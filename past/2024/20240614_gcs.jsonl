(AP) — One is a wiry 6-10 center and swoops down the court, manning the middle of Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim's famed zone defense.\n\nThe other is a foot shorter but has been just as intimidating at middle linebacker for Orange football coach Doug Marrone.\n\nMeet Baye (BYE) Moussa Keita (KEY'-tah) and Siriki (suh-RIK'-ee) Diabate (dee-ah-BAHT'-ee), Africans who have cleared big obstacles and taken different paths at Syracuse. Soccer, once the mainstay of their lives, is now an afterthought.\n\n\"Growing up, all I did was play soccer,\" said Diabate, who grew up in the Ivory Coast. \"That's all we do, and when I came here I pretty much was playing soccer.\"\n\n\"I played all the time,\" said Keita, a native of Senegal who keeps in touch with family by phone and over the Internet. \"I loved soccer.\"\n\nAt 14, Keita stood 6-foot-6 and excelled at soccer when the coach of his youth team encouraged him to attend a small clinic so officials from SEEDS — Sports for Education and Economic Development in Senegal — could see him. They liked what they saw and Keita left home the next year to attend an academy that would prepare him for the next step — the chance to go to the United States and, through basketball, have a chance at college.\n\nAfter graduating from the academy, Keita headed for the U.S. and earned a basketball scholarship at Syracuse. Keita grew up speaking French and Wolof, the native language of Senegal. When he arrived in the U.S. it took a few months at Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Va., to feel comfortable with English.\n\n\"Everything was just different, but that really helped me,\" Keita said. \"I feel like I've assimilated well.\"\n\nKeita, a junior, is a backup center and has become a Carrier Dome favorite with a work ethic his coaches would love to clone.\n\n\"Baye is a coach's dream,\" said Syracuse assistant Mike Hopkins, who played for the Orange in the 1990s. \"He's just disruptive. He plays so hard. It's all about team. He brings an energy and an excitement to the game. He makes things happen. It's like he has a shot of adrenaline on every possession, how hard he plays. His energy level is unparalleled.\"\n\nDiabate's journey has been more arduous. He was born right before his father, Souleymane, left for the U.S. to forge a better life for his family. He never saw him again until he left home to join him in 2003 in the Bronx.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" Diabate said. \"All I knew was from pictures and hearing his voice on the phone. The first time I saw him it was an emotional moment.\"\n\nDiabate continued to play soccer, dabbled in basketball and tried mightily to figure out his place in a new culture.\n\n\"Growing up back home, most kids have their family at home,\" Diabate said. \"At first, adjusting to life here was a struggle because I didn't speak no English at all. I didn't understand nothing in school. I had no friends. It was kind of hard.\"\n\nHis life changed after he became a regular at Roberto Clemente State Park, a waterfront park along the Harlem River in a tough part of the Bronx. Recreation supervisor Bob Morris introduced Diabate to football, and he started playing two-hand touch on Thursday nights.\n\nThat, too, was a struggle at first.\n\n\"He was horrible at basketball and he wasn't very good at football,\" Morris said. \"But you could see that he was very athletic. He was raw.\"\n\nMorris also coached a Pop Warner travel team of 13- and 14-year-olds and persuaded Diabate to give it a try.\n\n\"I convinced him to come out, but he wasn't very good, so he got cut,\" Morris said. \"He didn't know the nuances. He really didn't get football. He was a soccer kid from Africa. That's all he did was play soccer.\"\n\nThe following year Morris got Diabate to try again, and at the end of the year he was MVP of the all-star game.\n\n\"He played defensive end and had four sacks,\" Morris said.\n\nDiabate then attended Herbert H. Lehman High School, Marrone's alma mater, and was team captain his senior year. After graduation, he sent letters to different schools, including Syracuse.\n\n\"My message to coach Marrone was that this is a character kid,\" Morris said. \"This is a kid that every coach would love to have on their team. He'll never do anything to embarrass you. He's a good person, he's got a good heart, he works hard. He's the kind of kid that, even if he didn't start or didn't play, having a kid like that on your squad would be a plus.\"\n\nMorris said the only response Diabate received from Syracuse was that it was too late in the process. So Diabate enrolled at Nassau Community College on Long Island. He was a football walk-on but was co-defensive player of the year in 2010 in the Northeast Football Conference. He accepted an offer from Syracuse, enrolling in January 2011.\n\n\"I just kept working on it every single day, going out there and getting better,\" said Diabate, who chose the Orange over offers from Akron, Eastern Kentucky, Rhode Island, Maine and Central Connecticut. \"I gave it all I got.\"\n\nDiabate started two games at outside linebacker in 2011, was moved to the middle this season and was named a captain. He finished the regular season tied for second on the team with 67 tackles.\n\n\"The thing that jumped out at me from the very first moment was he's very, very coachable,\" Orange linebackers coach Steve Morrison said. \"He's a guy that wants to please. He wants to do well. He studies. It's so important to him, and he's got very good ability. When you couple those things together and the importance of football and how much he's placed on it, he's been able to do a lot of great things.\n\n\"Maybe more important, though, he's a great leader,\" Morrison added. \"He's a guy that really gets along with everybody, a guy that really can rally the kids. He's a different kid — in a good way. Obviously, his background is a pretty special thing where he's come to. He's a unique guy.\"\n\nEspecially to his teammates.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't understand everything he says, but you try to make the best of it any way you can,\" defensive tackle Jay Bromley said. \"It's amazing to speak as good as he does and to be really in tune with society and our coaches. It's just amazing. He's a great leader. That's one thing. We follow his lead.\"\n\nKeita and Diabate met in a dorm last year and asked each other about classes. Diabate attended a few basketball games to watch Keita in action. Diabate said they \"started clicking from there.\"\n\n\"I'm making the best out of the opportunity,\" said Diabate, an economics major. \"I'm thankful I was able to get a scholarship.\"\n\nNone of this surprises Syracuse's Daryl Gross, one of the few black athletic directors in Division I that don't work at historically black schools.\n\n\"I think it's terrific,\" said Gross, who was an assistant athletic director at Southern California before coming to Syracuse eight years ago. \"At USC what we found was that African athletes were some of the best athletes, and they had a tremendous work ethic. They really appreciate the country, the opportunities and take full advantage. And they've always been incredible role models.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Diabate will suit up for the final time at Syracuse when he trots into Yankee Stadium to play in the Pinstripe Bowl. Hours later, Keita will be ready to spark the Orange when they play Alcorn State in the Carrier Dome.\n\nSomeday, both hope to return to Africa to help youngsters in their countries. Diabate wants to build schools in the Ivory Coast. More immediately, he has his eyes on the NFL. After the season, he'll be showing off his 4.57-second speed in the 40-yard dash to teams in the spring.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Diabate said. \"We're blessed.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/28/george-floyd-university-scholarship-sued-discrimination/73138297007/", "title": "Complaint accuses George Floyd scholarship of discriminating ...", "text": "Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the type of legal claim filed regarding the alleged Title VI violation.\n\nMinnesota's North Central University's George Floyd Memorial Scholarship for young Black students is being sued and accused of violating an anti-discrimination law.\n\nA legal complaint filed with the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights on Monday says that the scholarship violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by exclusively qualifying for Black students.

John Lewis’ humble beginnings and his life’s work on voting rights.\n\n“His heart and passion was making sure we had the right to vote,” said Browning, pastor of the Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church in Fort Washington, Maryland, attended by Lewis’ longtime chief of staff.\n\nLewis first visited Browning’s church in the 1990s when he wrote his autobiography “Walking with the Wind.”\n\nHe last visited in December when he shared his cancer diagnosis, shortly before the public announcement.\n\nBrowning said he’d bonded with Lewis on a plane ride to Alabama in March for the congressman’s annual pilgrimage to Selma to commemorate “Bloody Sunday.” During one event, Browning delivered a prayer at the historic Brown Chapel A.M.E. where Lewis and other civil rights protesters sought refuge during the 1965 walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nLewis had left the program early because of his health but returned to shake Browning’s hand and tell him he loved him.\n\n“I shook his hand back and said, ‘I love you, too, congressman,’’ Browning recalled. It was the last time Browning would see Lewis in person.\n\nBrowning last spoke with Lewis by phone soon after the congressman visited Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C. in June.\n\n“Just for us to get through to pray with him,” he said, “was special.”\n\nVice President Pence pays respect\n\nDressed in black and wearing black face masks, Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, paid their respects to Lewis at the Capitol Monday evening.\n\nLewis’ coffin had been moved to the East Front Portico of the Capitol, following an afternoon ceremony in the rotunda, to allow members of the public to honor Lewis from the plaza below the steps.\n\nThe Pences stood behind the casket, as cameras clicked from below.\n\nPence served with Lewis in Congress and was among the many lawmakers who participated with Lewis in reenactments of Bloody Sunday by crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge together.\n\n\"John was a great man whose personal courage and decades of public service changed American forever,\" Pence later tweeted. \"God Bless the memory of John Lewis. May his example ever inspire.\"\n\nOther notable officials who paid their respects after Monday’s ceremony included Vice President Joe Biden, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Defense Secretary Mark Esper.\n\nAfter Biden left the rotunda, he encountered Rep. Karen Bass, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus who is among the women under consideration to be Biden’s running mate.\n\nBiden thanked Bass “for putting up with me.”\n\nWhen a reporter asked if there was anything he wanted to ask the congresswomen, he jokingly responded: “I’ve asked her to be vice president. She said `No.’”\n\nA 'hero's farewell'\n\nJohn Lewis returned to the nation’s capital one last time Monday.\n\nOnlookers applauded as the hearse carrying the late congressman and civil rights icon drove onto the Capitol grounds following a route that took his motorcade passed many landmarks significant to him.\n\nThere was the memorial to Martin Luther King Jr., Lewis’ friend and mentor.\n\nThen the Lincoln Memorial. Lewis had been the last living speaker from the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Justice that culminated at the memorial.\n\nLewis had made his last public appearance in June at the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where he had “passed the torch,” as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described it.\n\n“John Lewis brought the world here today because his impact and legacy will be forever known around the world,” Georgia state Rep. Rep. Vernon Jones told USA TODAY after Lewis’ hearse drove through the plaza, located near the White House. “I am a living product of John Lewis.”\n\nAfter the motorcade had headed up Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump told reporters he wouldn’t be going to the Capitol to pay his respects as Lewis lies in state for two days.\n\n\"No, I won't be going, no,\" he told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to North Carolina.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, stood in front of the casket for several moments in the late afternoon, before the casket was scheduled to be brought to the Capitol's east front for public viewing.\n\n'I love you, brother':Lawmakers remember Rep. John Lewis' friendship and advice\n\nAfter the hearse arrived at the Capitol, one member of Lewis’ honor guard fainted in the heat before Lewis' flag-draped casket was lifted from the hearse and carried up the steps.\n\n\"Ready, step! Ready, step! Ready, step!\" the guard called out as it moved in unison.\n\nInside the Capitol Rotunda, members of the House and Senate and other invited guests sat 6 feet apart in concentric circles.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus, wearing face masks that read “Good Trouble,” sat together.\n\nThe honor guard carried Lewis' casket to the center of the rotunda and, with bowed heads, placed it on the catafalque constructed in 1865 to support Abraham Lincoln's casket.\n\n“John was revered and beloved on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “We knew that he always worked on the side of the angels. And now, we know that he is with them.”\n\nThe last time Pelosi saw Lewis, a few weeks before he died, she brought him a pin that said “One country, one destiny.”\n\nThose were the words embroidered into the coat that Abraham Lincoln was wearing the night he was assassinated by a Confederate sympathizer.\n\nPelosi said Lewis’ identification with Lincoln was clear 57 years ago when, at the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial, Lewis declared, \"Our minds, souls, and hearts cannot rest until freedom and justice exist for all the people.”\n\n“Between then and now, John Lewis became a titan of the Civil Rights Movement and then, the `Conscience of the U.S. Congress,’” she said.\n\nReferencing King’s famous saying, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said “history only bent toward what's right because people like John paid the price” – at a Nashville lunch counter, in a jail cell, at a bus station in South Carolina, and beyond.\n\n\"Even though the world around him gave him every cause for bitterness,\" McConnell said, Lewis treated everyone \"with respect and love.\"\n\nAs Christian vocalist Wintley Phipps sang an emotional version of \"Amazing Grace,\" Rep. Johanna Hayes, D-Conn., saw Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-N.Y., crying. She reached into her purse and handed him a tissue.\n\nPlacing his hand on his father's casket, Lewis' only son, John-Miles Lewis, led the procession of mourners paying their respects at the conclusion of the service.\n\nLeaders of Congress formed a half-ring around the casket. Pelosi blew Lewis a kiss from her masked mouth.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus came up as a group to surround their colleague. Some wiped tears from their eyes.\n\n“He sacrificed so much for people that he had never met to make this country strive towards a more perfect Union,” Sen. Tim Scott, the first African American senator from South Carolina, said after the ceremony. “It’s a hero’s farewell and earned, deserved in every way.”\n\nTrump won't attend Lewis' memorial services\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday he would not be attending Lewis' memorial services at the Capitol this week.\n\n\"No, I won't be going, no,\" he told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to North Carolina.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his wife are scheduled to pay their respects as Lewis lies in state Monday evening.\n\nTrump and Lewis shared a turbulent history.\n\nIn 2017, Trump lashed out at Lewis on Twitter, accusing him of being \"all talk ... no action or results,\" after the congressman said he would skip Trump's inauguration. Lewis considered Trump an illegitimate president because of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n'Living product of John Lewis'\n\nGeorgia state Rep. Vernon Jones attended the passing of Lewis' motorcade because of how much the congressman meant to him and his political career in the state legislature and county government.\n\n“John Lewis brought the world here today because his impact and legacy will be forever known around the world,” Jones told USA TODAY. “He was one of Georgia’s tallest pines that fell.”\n\nJones was born in 1960, so he was a young boy as the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act were passed. His parents were unable to vote, but Jones became an elected official who helps set public policy.\n\n“I am a living product of John Lewis,” Jones said.\n\nJones asked Lewis for advice during Jones’ first campaign in 1990. “He said shake as many hands as you can and I never stop shaking hands,” Jones said.\n\nA final ride through Washington\n\nLewis, who died July 17 from pancreatic cancer at 80, arrived at Maryland's Joint Base Andrews after two days of tributes in Alabama.\n\nThe family and friends traveling with him include Lewis’ only son, John-Miles Lewis, as well as siblings, nieces and nephews.\n\nThe motorcade passed by several landmarks important to the civil rights icon and longtime lawmaker before arriving at the Capitol, where flags are at half-staff in his honor. The landmarks included:\n\nThe Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial: King was a friend and mentor to Lewis, who often said King changed his life and taught him the discipline and philosophy of non-violence and non-violent direct action that he used as a foundation for his activism.\n\nThe Lincoln Memorial: Lewis was the last living speaker from the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Justice that culminated at the memorial. The march was one of Lewis’s first official acts after becoming the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.\n\nThere had been calls for last-minute changes to Lewis’ speech. The day before, some people, including local clergy and Kennedy administration officials, had objected to parts of his speech, including a reference to people marching across the South like Union General William Sherman.\n\nLewis, in a dark suit and tie, headed to the stage with his three-paged single-spaced speech he had not rehearsed.\n\n“He didn’t have time to really review,’’ Courtland Cox, who worked with Lewis at the committee, remembers. “He had to do it on the fly before 250,000 people and the nation.”\n\nBlack Lives Matter Plaza: Lewis made his last public appearance on June 7 at the plaza, a section of 16th Street near the White House where the city painted the words “Black Lives Matter” in 35-foot yellow capital letters as part of the protests unfolded over the death of George Floyd.\n\n“He met the mayor there and really passed the torch,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday.\n\nElmira Walker, 79, of Washington, D.C., went to the plaza to see the motorcade drive by in order to impress on her children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren Lewis’ importance in their lives.\n\n“I was moved to come because I feel like at my age I have to do it now,” she told USA TODAY.\n\n“I could relate to almost everything that he talked about – raised in the South, coming out of the fields and so forth,” said Walker, who was raised in Scotland Neck, N.C., and whose mother and grandmother never got a chance to vote.\n\n“It was a painful thing that you could work and couldn’t vote – you didn’t have a voice,” Walker said. “Because of his voice and because of the example of what he said, he meant a lot to me.”\n\nThe Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture: “It is a dream come true,” Lewis said at the 2016 dedication of the museum, the end of a century-long campaign for a repository of black history on the National Mall. The idea, which originated with Black veterans of the Civil War, had been languishing for decades when Texas Rep. Mickey Leland asked Lewis to take up the charge after Lewis’ 1986 election to Congress. After Leland was killed in a 1989 plane crash, Lewis introduced authorizing legislation every year until it one became law in 2003.\n\n“Giving up on dreams is not an option for me,” Lewis wrote in 2016. It was one of his proudest legislative achievements and he is known as the “Godfather” of the museum.\n\nThe Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building: Lewis whoauthored legislation to rename the Justice Department building for Robert Kennedy, and he had worked on Kennedy’s 1968 presidential campaign. Lewis was campaigning in Indianapolis with Kennedy when it was announced that King had been shot. A few months later, Lewis was among the campaign workers at the Ambassador Hotel, waiting for Kennedy to return to his hotel room after giving a speech, when Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nThe National Council of Negro Women: The organization was led for more than 50 years by Dorothy Height, another civil rights leader. Height was a key organizer of the March on Washington. Female leaders like Height and Rosa Parks walked down Independence Avenue while the men proceeded down Pennsylvania Avenue with the press.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court: Before arriving at the Capitol, the motorcade passed by the Supreme Court, where the words “Equal Justice Under Law” are engraved above the entrance. That goal is what Lewis fought for his entire life, organizers say. When he died, Lewis was still pushing to restore a portion of the Voting Rights Act that the court struck down in 2013. Lewis hadsat in the courtroom when the case was argued.\n\nAfter an arrival ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, Lewis’ casket will return to the East Front, facing the Supreme Court, so the public can walk past to pay respect.\n\n'Long overdue'\n\nJust hours ahead of the Capitol Hill ceremony, about a dozen lawmakers, most of them dressed in black, took turns on the House floor pushing legislation the importance of a bill that would set up a commission to study the social status of Black men and boys.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called the proposal Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act “long overdue.”\n\n“We’ve come a long way in America, but we still have a long way to go,’’ said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who noted the nation’s history of slavery. “We are still living with its legacy today.”\n\nSome members of the Congressional Black Caucus wore black face masks that read “Good Trouble,” a phrase Lewis frequently used to describe his advocacy for civil rights and other issues.\n\nPictures of Lewis greeted visitors as they entered the Capitol.\n\nInside the rotunda, where the statue of King looked down and the statue of Rosa Parks stood in a nearby room, programs for the ceremony rested in rows of black chairs.\n\nSome of the invited guests arrived long before the 1:30 p.m. service was scheduled to begin.\n\n“It’s the proper thing to do,’’ South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn said of the honors for Lewis, who will be the first African America lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\nLouisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond noted that Lewis has been working on civil rights issues since he was 15 years old.\n\n“I think the country owes a person like that one hell of a sendoff,” he said.\n\nJuly 26, 2020: Honoring civil rights icon John Lewis as national protests rage\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush was the last person to lay in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, an honor given to American statesmen and military leaders, including twelve U.S. presidents.\n\nLongtime congressman Elijah E. Cummings, who died last October, was the first African American lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol, though not in the rotunda.\n\nIn 2005, civil rights icon Rosa Parks laid \"in honor\" in the rotunda, the tribute given to private citizens who have not served in government or the military.\n\nThe Lincoln catafalque, rough pine boards nailed together and covered in a black cloth, has been used for most of those who have lain \"in state\" in the rotunda.\n\nThe base and platform have occasionally been altered to accommodate the larger size of modern coffins, but otherwise has changed little since Lincoln's time, according to the Architect of the Capitol.\n\nWhile the cloth covering has needed to be replaced over the years, the style of the drapery has remained the same.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, the Lewis family has encouraged supporters to organize \"John Lewis Virtual Love Events\" in their homes to watch the ceremonies rather than traveling to public ceremonies. People can also show support by tying a blue or purple ribbon on their doors or in their front yards, by posting tributes on social media using the hashtags #BelovedCommunity or #HumanDignity, or by leaving a written tribute at www.theJohnLewisLegacy.com.\n\nMembers of Congress spent hours on the floor last week offering testimonials.\n\n\"In the coming days, when the streets are filled with those who mourn John, we will see people in fine suits and people in rags,\" said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. \"We will see laborers and professionals. We will see faces pained by disease or poverty. But all of them will rejoice that John Lewis lived.\"\n\nFellow civil rights veterans:'We had right on our side'\n\nActivists working in John Lewis' shadow:Warnings about voter suppression ahead of November vote\n\nThe Backstory:John Lewis urged journalists, 'be a headlight, not a taillight'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/business/russian-oligarchs-deaths-intl/index.html", "title": "Several prominent Russian businessmen have died by apparent ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt least eight prominent Russian businessmen have reportedly died by suicide or in as yet unexplained accidents since late January, with six of them associated with Russia’s two largest energy companies.\n\nFour of those six were linked to the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom or one of its subsidiaries, while the other two were associated with Lukoil, Russia’s largest privately owned oil and gas company.\n\nEarlier this year, the company took the unusual public stance of speaking out against Russia’s war in Ukraine, calling for sympathy for the victims, and for the end of the conflict.\n\nLukoil’s chairman Ravil Maganov died this week after falling out of the window of a hospital in Moscow, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLukoil confirmed the death on Thursday in a statement published on its website.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What we know about Lukoil chairman's death 01:54 - Source: CNN\n\nMaganov “passed away following a severe illness,” Lukoil said, making no mention of a fall. “Maganov immensely contributed to the development of not only the company, but of the entire Russian oil and gas sector.”\n\n\n\nAnother top Lukoil manager, Alexander Subbotin, was found dead near Moscow in May after reportedly visiting a shaman, TASS reported.

He was in charge of very large amounts of money. So, did he kill himself? I don’t think so. I think he knew something and that he posed some sort of risk,” Volobuev told CNN in April.\n\nRussia’s Investigative Committee did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on this case.\n\nJust a day later, on April 19, Sergey Protosenya, a former executive at the gas producer Novatek, which is partially owned by Gazprom, was found dead at his home in Lloret de Mar, a Mediterranean resort near Barcelona.\n\nThe bodies of his wife and daughter, showing signs of having suffered violence, were found inside the family’s luxury home, an official source close to the investigation told CNN last week, while the body of Protosenya was found in the garden outside, according to the source.\n\nSon questions initial findings\n\nCatalan police in the province of Girona, where the town of Lloret de Mar is located, told CNN on Friday that they have since completed their investigation into the case and sent the findings to a court.\n\nThe police force said its conclusion was that the deaths were a double murder and subsequent suicide.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail in April, Protosenya’s son questioned that version of events, suggesting instead that his father was murdered.\n\n“The Catalan police have taken statements from the son. Other hypotheses have been ruled out. Also ruled out was a triple homicide,” the police’s press official told CNN at that time. “That this was the work of the Russian mafia? Well, no,” the official added.\n\nRussian gas tycoon Sergei Protosenya and his wife Natalya.\n\nNovatek, Protosenya’s former employer, said he was “a wonderful person and a wonderful family man.”\n\n“Unfortunately, there have been speculations on this topic in the media, but we are convinced that these speculations are not related to reality. We hope that the law enforcement agencies of Spain will conduct a thorough and objective investigation and sort out what happened, ” the company said in a statement.\n\nCoroner’s ruling\n\nMikhail Watford, a Ukrainian-born Russian oil and gas billionaire, was found dead in his home in Surrey, England on February 28.\n\nSurrey Police told CNN it did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances.\n\nAnother Russian businessman, Vasily Melnikov, was found dead alongside his family in Nizhny Novgorod in late March, according to the Russian newspaper Kommersant.\n\nMelnikov owned MedStom, a medical supplies company. According to Russia’s Investigative Committee, a 43-year-old man, his wife, 41, and two children aged four and 10 were found stabbed to death on March 23.\n\nThe committee did not name Melnikov, but the ages of the dead and the location of the incident match the Kommersant report.\n\nThe regional branch of the investigative committee has not updated the status of its investigation and did not return CNN’s request for comment. At the time of the incident, in March, it said there “were no signs of unauthorized entry into the apartment,” and that “knives were found and seized.”\n\n“[Investigators] are considering several versions of what happened, including the murder of the children and wife by the head of the family, followed by self-inflicted death,” the committee said.\n\nHow to get help: In the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Plus, we take a look at Obama's role in the 2024 election, and how a Florida resort gives sick children a chance to just be kids. A US Navy destroyer fired missiles at a Houthi radar site in Yemen earlier today. It was the second attack against militants this week after American and British airstrikes late Thursday. Defense officials said today's strike was against a radar installation used to locate and attack commercial ships in the Red Sea. Thursday's attack was widespread, involving more than 60 military targets in at least 28 locations in retaliation for Houthi strikes on commercial vessels. Houthi said Thursday's US and UK strikes killed at least five people. The two strikes represent a major escalation of US involvement in Middle East fighting since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7th.\n\nThe Houthis are a militia group based in Yemen and backed by Iran. They began attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, a major shipping channel, shortly after Hamas attacks in Israel. Houthi leaders have said the attacks were in support of Hamas. They said ships bound for Israel were being targeted, though few of the ships they attacked had direct links to Israel. Militants have used drones and missiles to attack 27 ships since mid-October, according to US Central Command.

Meanwhile, it appears former President Barack Obama is getting more involved with the 2024 race. I caught up with USA TODAY National Political Correspondent Phillip M. Bailey about Obama's role in the election and more. Philip, it's always a treat to have you on. Thanks for making the time.\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nNo problem, man. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPhilip, let's start here. What are some of President Joe Biden's weaknesses right now among key parts of his Democratic base?\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nPresident Biden, who has taken some of the scars of governing and has had unpopular numbers for some time now, but as 2024 comes into focus, his lagging numbers among key demographics of the Democratic Party, Hispanic voters, African-American voters, voters aged 35 and younger, that's going to be a coalition that will be essential for him in 2024. And what the USA Today Suffolk University polling has shown is that he's doing pretty poorly with those groups right now at the moment, 10 months out of the election. For example, one in five Black voters told USA Today, in the Suffolk University poll, they'll support a third party candidate in November. You're seeing he's only claiming about 63% of Black voters at this point, which would be historically low from the 87% that Biden carried in 2020.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat role might former President Barack Obama play for Biden in his 2024 campaign? What are Obama alums saying on this?\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nPresident Obama is the brightest star in the Democratic constellation. I think this has become a story and an issue because Obama's former Vice President is having a hard time with the coalition that really he helped usher into the Democratic Party, making it a solid requirement for any Democrat running. Remember, Barack Obama was only re-elected and elected President with about 39, 40% of the White vote. So that diverse younger demographic of voters is essential for Democrats. So I think what you're going to see is in talking to surrogates and people who are very close to the former President Barack Obama, they tell me that, look, he's going to take a very active role. He's already taking an earlier active role compared to previous cycles in 2020 or 2022. And you're already seeing him shoulder to shoulder with Biden. In fundraising, they hauled in about $4 million off of one event alone.\n\nSo you're going to see Barack Obama engage, but at the same time, Obama is still remaining the cool, calm, collected persona that he was as President. He understands that this is Biden's campaign. Biden is the President, so he's there as a sounding board largely. We talked to Eric Lesser, former Massachusetts legislator, who worked in the Obama administration. He was talking about how, look, for him, Barack Obama is the bridge in the Democratic Party, the generational bridge. You have a big question about Joe Biden's age and being 81 years old, but at the same time, relatively speaking, Barack Obama is a kid. He's only in his sixties, so he's often seen as the bridge between Biden and younger Democrats, like Maxwell Frost, a Congressman from Florida who Obama has reportedly met with along with AOC and others. So in a lot of ways, we're going to see Obama be the mentor in chief in 2024, not just to younger Democrats and people who are running from city council and state-wide races and federal races all the way up to Joe Biden.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPhilip, is there a downside to kind of going to Obama for this type of help in 2024? Are there any hesitations from the Biden camp on this?\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nNo hesitations that I've picked up on, but I do think that there is some aggravation from the Biden campaign about some of these stories and reporting. They certainly, I think, are always sort of wondering why is the focus so much on what President Obama is or isn't doing. Some Biden surrogates and people in and around the campaign will point out that, look, Barack Obama was involved in the 2016 race, and Donald Trump won that one. And I think everyone has an ego, and I don't think that Joe Biden is any different. I think that some of these criticisms coming from certain individuals that used to work for President Obama probably didn't have the best working relationship with Joe Biden when he was Vice President. But, look, a lot of people who work for Joe Biden used to work for Barack Obama. The way it was described to me by sources close to former President Obama was, \"We're like a family.\"\n\nThere's a little bit of dysfunction. There's a little bit of disagreement. I do think that because of Joe Biden's age, there will be a question of is he up to it? Right? There will be a question of can he handle the long haul of this? And I think there is a part of the Biden orbit and a part of the Biden network that probably doesn't want to be seen as too reliant on Barack Obama. I think what you will see happen over the coming weeks and months, Taylor, is that the Biden camp, I think, is going to focus his message, particularly as we see what happens on the Republican side if Donald Trump ends up recapturing Republican nomination. They certainly want this to be a binary choice. But there's a lot of unanswered questions. There's a lot of hypotheticals. And let's always remember, most people are still not paying attention. Right? No votes have been cast yet. These polls and surveys, even ours, are snapshots. They are moments in time. The only poll that matters is the one on election day.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Phillip M. Bailey. 2024 is here. I know we'll chat again throughout this big political year. Thanks so much.\n\nPhillip M. Bailey:\n\nTaylor, thank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has announced increased oversight of Boeing's 737 MAX production. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement, quote, \"The grounding of the 737 9 and the multiple production related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk. The FAA is exploring the use of an independent third party to oversee Boeing's inspections and its quality system,\" unquote. The move came less than a day after the FAA said it would investigate the aircraft manufacturer's production process. Some 737 MAX 9 jets remain grounded as the FAA works to decide on requirements for hardware inspections that airlines will have to carry out before the return to service. Part of the plane's fuselage ripped apart during an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month. Previous versions of the 737 MAX were involved in two crashes in 2018 and 2019, killing hundreds of people.\n\n♦\n\nFreezing cold, heavy snow, and even blizzard conditions are hitting millions of Americans at the end of this week into the weekend. The National Weather Service warned of dangerously cold temperatures and a winter storm through the weekend, bringing heavy snow across the Midwest from Iowa to Michigan. More than a thousand flights were canceled at Chicago's airports. And black ice from freezing rain has caused widespread accidents in several areas, including Kansas City. Meanwhile, in the West, two men were rescued after being caught in an avalanche Thursday in Idaho, and a person was reported dead from an avalanche in California on Wednesday.\n\n♦\n\nA nonprofit Florida resort is giving critically ill children the chance to just be kids. I spoke with USA TODAY Consumer Travel Reporter Eve Chen to learn more. Eve, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nEve Chen:\n\nIt's my pleasure.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nEve, let's just start here. What is Give Kids The World Village?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nGive Kids The World Village is an 89-acre nonprofit resort in the Orlando area, and it's exclusively for critically ill kids and their families. Anytime a child makes a wish through a wish-granting organization, so Make-A-Wish, but hundreds throughout the world, 50% of those wishes involve Orlando area attractions, think Disney World, Universal Studios, other places like that. And when they make these wishes and they're granted, they get to stay at this village, which is a fully immersive, fully accessible experience for a whole week for their family.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThat's amazing. So what do families say about their experiences here and what it's done for them?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nI spoke to several families. One mom said that going there gave her peace that she didn't know was possible anymore. Having all those doctor's visits and hospital stays back to back, she said she was always looking for what might be coming up next, and this was just a chance to kind of breathe again. Because everything's designed with these families in mind, they don't have to think about all of the hoops to jump through. Another mom said that this was the first place that her child felt like a normally developing child because she didn't have to lift up the wheelchair everywhere. Everything was accessible from the carousel to the rides to the villas that each family gets to stay in. The showers are wheelchair accessible. So one teenage child told the President and CEO of Give Kids The World Village Pamela Landwirth that it was the first time she'd ever taken a shower by herself because she's able to roll in by herself. And these are things that people take for granted, but it's purposely designed for these families and kids to be able to enjoy the things that we all take for granted.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat a remarkable place, Eve. What are you hearing about why it's so vital for some of these kids to see others like themselves at a place like this?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nOne of the things that the President, CEO Pamela Landwirth told me was that it can be very isolating when you're going through an experience like this because no one may be around you. Your friends and your family, they've not gone through this type of medically complex journey before. And so you might see other families like this when you're at the hospital or at the doctor's office. But just to enjoy everyday life, eating a meal, having a fun time doing things and not getting stared at was really big for them because a lot of times if they have a visible illness, they get looks or may feel under a microscope, where here every child is going through some sort of journey like that, so they don't feel alone. One of the kids told me, he's nine years old, he said that every time he met another child, he'd say, \"What kind of surgery did you have to come here?\" So it was totally comfortable for them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt must just be such a powerful sense of relief for them. And Eve, it sounds like some of these kids and families end up returning after their first visit. What can you tell us about these alumni visits?\n\nEve Chen:\n\nSure. So the first trip is that wish trip, and that's just a once in a lifetime experience that's week long. They get to do all the things. They have all their meals covered, their housing. They get tickets to all of the parks and all of these onsite experiences at the resort itself. But then they can also come back twice a year for alumni visits. It's not going to be the same blowout trip as the wish trip, but they can enjoy the onsite amenities that they would have during the previous experiences.\n\nSo every night, they have a nightly party with a different theme. They have a winter wonderland night and a Halloween theme night and a talent show night. And basically, it's a chance for these families to make memories that one mom said they may have missed when they were in the hospital or their kids were not well enough to make these family memories, or if their time with their children is limited because some of these children, unfortunately, are not just critically, but terminally ill. This is a chance to make some memories that they may never get to make down the line. So it's really special to them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nEve Chen covers consumer travel for USA TODAY. Eve, it's such a moving piece. Thanks for coming on and chatting about it.\n\nEve Chen:\n\nThank you so much.

They are hiring and certifying more local, Spanish-speaking staff. More than half of 2,500 students in the small Russellville city school district identify as Hispanic or Latino, and about a quarter are learning English. But the district at times has struggled to find the people and money necessary to help those students achieve. As part of a recent exercise to help the class learn English, a third grader pulled a block from a Jenga tower and read aloud a question written on one side. “Where,” the boy read, then slowly sounded out the other words: “Where would you like to visit?” “Disneyland,” one student said. “Space,” another chimed in. “Guatemala,” one girl said. Kathy Alfaro, a new English language teacher at Russellville Elementary, exchanged a few words with the girl in Spanish, then turned to the other students. “Do y’all know what she said?” Alfaro asked the class. “She said she has a lot of family in Guatemala because she was born there. And I told her that I was born here, but I also have a lot of family in Guatemala.” Districtwide, the percentage of students who met their language proficiency goals increased from 46% in 2019 to 61% in 2022. At the two elementary schools, proficiency jumped by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, received a hero’s welcome Thursday when the Democrat gave the keynote address at the Alaska Federation of Natives conference in Anchorage. Those attending the largest annual gathering of Natives in Alaska showered her with standing ovations, spontaneous songs and gifts, including a bolo tie worn by her Republican predecessor, the late Don Young. Young’s daughter Joni Nelson presented the tie to Peltola, saying it was a passing of the mantle to her. The surprise presentation came after Young’s adult children joined Peltola on stage as she paid tribute to Young, who held Alaska’s sole seat in the House for 49 years until his death in March. Peltola defeated Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich in an August special election to finish out Young’s term. Those three, along with Libertarian Chris Bye, are competing for a full two-year term in the November election. Another of Young’s daughters, Dawn Vallely, later said on stage that her father would have been happy with the results of the special election, won by Peltola. Nelson wore the white beaded tie – which features the state of Alaska in blue beads – onstage but removed it to place it around Peltola’s neck when she greeted the family.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sued the federal government to be able to keep more than 100 double-stacked shipping containers that Republican Gov. Doug Ducey had placed to fill in gaps along the U.S.-Mexico border near the southwestern desert community of Yuma. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Arizona on Friday asks that the state be allowed to take the unilateral action it believes necessary to defend its residents from migrants illegally crossing the border. Ducey complains the U.S. government is not doing enough to stop migrants from coming to Arizona, forcing the state to take action. The shipping containers went up in August. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation last week sent a letter telling Arizona to take down the containers, saying they are unauthorized and violate U.S. law. Arizona refused. The Cocopah Indian Tribe in southwestern Arizona also complained that some of the containers were placed on its reservation without permission. The Bureau of Reclamation also demanded that no new containers be placed, saying it hoped to prevent conflicts with federal construction contracts to fill the gaps in the wall near the Morelos Dam in the Yuma area.\n\nArkansas\n\nConway: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended her avoidance of local media in her bid for governor Friday as she appeared in her only debate ahead of next month’s election. Sanders, the Republican nominee who is heavily favored in the November election, has conducted few local interviews during her bid for the state’s top office. Sanders had agreed to only one debate with Democratic nominee Chris Jones and Libertarian Ricky Dale Harrington. Sanders said she’s been speaking directly to voters by campaigning around the state. “Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press comes a great deal of responsibility,” Sanders said. “When they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside the box, which I have done every single day for the past two years.” Public polling has shown Sanders leading by double digits, and she’s shattered fundraising records in the predominantly Republican state. Early voting begins Monday in Arkansas. During her two year term as ex-President Donald Trump’s chief spokeswoman, Sanders scaled back televised news briefings after repeatedly sparring with reporters who aggressively questioned her. Sanders often sought to justify the lack of formal briefings by saying they were unnecessary when journalists could hear from Trump directly.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAtherton: Three decades after a car was reported stolen in Northern California, police are digging the missing convertible out of the yard of a $15 million mansion built by a man with a history of arrests for murder, attempted murder and insurance fraud. The convertible Mercedes Benz, filled with bags of unused concrete, was discovered Thursday by landscapers in the affluent town of Atherton in Silicon Valley, Mayor Rick DeGolia said, reading a statement from police. Although cadaver dogs alerted to possible human remains Thursday, none had been found more than 24 hours after technicians with the San Mateo County Crime Lab began excavating the car, DeGolia said. Police believe the car was buried 4 to 5 feet deep in the backyard of the home sometime in the 1990s – before the current owners bought the home. The car was reported stolen in September 1992 in nearby Palo Alto, he said. By Friday, the technicians had been able to excavate the passenger side of the convertible, which was buried with its top down. They also opened the trunk, where they found more bags of unused cement. Cadaver dogs were again brought back to the house and again “made a slight notification of possible human remains,” DeGolia said.\n\nColorado\n\nCastle Rock: Brewing beer, cooking food, and refilling water bottles with recycled wastewater could soon become standard practice in a state that’s synonymous with its pristine-tasting snowmelt and mountain springs. Last week, Colorado’s water quality agency gave unanimous preliminary approval to regulate direct potable reuse – the process of treating sewage and sending it directly to taps without first being dispersed in a larger water body. Pending a final vote in November, the state would become the first to adopt direct potable reuse regulations, according to state and federal officials. “Having well-developed regulations … helps ensure projects are safe and that project proponents know what will be required of them,” said Laura Belanger, water resources engineer with the non-profit Western Resource Advocates. As the state’s population explodes, and regional water supplies dwindle, recycling water for drinking is a significant opportunity for stretching a limited supply, said Kevin Reidy, conservation specialist for the Colorado Water Conservation Board. And he said it’s a game changer in a place like Castle Rock, a city of 75,000 just south of Denver nestled under its prominent namesake butte, that relies primarily on pumping finite groundwater for drinking.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hartford: The grieving widows of two slain police officers gave tearful tributes to their husbands Friday during a funeral attended by thousands of law enforcement officers from around the country. Others who spoke at the service for Bristol Officers Dustin DeMonte and Alex Hamzy pleaded for an end to hatred and suspicion against the police. “To Alex and Dustin, you were both true heroes, amazing people, and you will be missed beyond words by everyone,” said DeMonte’s wife, Laura, who is pregnant with their third child. “I am so sorry this happened to you. Two of the very best humans. So kind, positive and fun-loving.” DeMonte, Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato were shot Oct. 12 in what police believe was an ambush set up by a 911 call made by the shooter, Nicholas Brutcher. Iurato, who survived a gunshot wound to his leg, struggled to get behind a police cruiser and fired a single shot that killed Brutcher. Brutcher’s brother, Nathan, also was shot – possibly by his brother – and survived. DeMonte was a sergeant with 10 years’ experience on the force, and Hamzy was an officer for eight years. The funeral included formal, posthumous promotions of DeMonte to lieutenant and Hamzy to sergeant.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor was sentenced Wednesday to one year of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service for official misconduct and conflict of interest convictions. Auditor Kathy McGuiness avoided jail time for the misdemeanors, each of which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, news outlets report. McGuiness maintains her innocence, and prosecutors sought a sentence of 30 days in prison for the Rehoboth Beach Democrat based on her lack of remorse. Her attorney argued that a $1,000 fine was sufficient. In July, a Kent County jury convicted McGuiness on three misdemeanor counts but acquitted her on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. A judge later threw out a misdemeanor conviction for improperly structuring contract payments to a consulting firm, rejecting her request for a new trial. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of her daughter Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness. Prosecutors alleged that Saylar McGuiness, 20, and a friend were hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden will host a roundtable Monday on breast and cervical cancer, part of the administration’s “moonshot” effort to reduce deaths from cancer, the White House said. The event is one of many being launched by the American Cancer Society. Singer Mary J. Blige, an advocate for cancer screening, will participate in the roundtable with Biden. President Joe Biden announced in February his goal of halving cancer deaths in the next 25 years. The issue is personal for the president, whose son Beau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer. Biden launched the cancer moonshot the following year when serving as then-President Barack Obama’s vice president.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than 230 pythons were removed from the Everglades as part of an annual competition to eliminate the invasive species from the South Florida wetlands preserve. Florida wildlife officials said Thursday that 1,000 hunters from 32 states and as far away as Canada and Latvia removed 231 Burmese pythons during the 10-day competition known as the Florida Python Challenge. Matthew Concepcion won the $10,000 top prize for removing 28 Burmese pythons. Another hunter, Dustin Crum, won a $1,500 prize for removing the longest python, a snake that measured over 11 feet long. Pythons became invasive in Florida after they were brought into the state as pets and then abandoned in the wild by their owners, wildlife officials say. Since 2000, more than 17,000 wild Burmese pythons have been removed from Florida, where they are a destructive presence for native species, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Every one of the pythons removed as part of the Challenge is one less preying on our native birds, mammals and reptiles,” said Rodney Barreto, the commission’s chairman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A beer garden near downtown Atlanta filled for a recent event hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock aimed at Latino voters. Some said they came to seek Warnock, who is seeking reelection in the midterm elections Nov. 8 against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. But others came to see a particularly high-profile Latino who would be speaking on Warnock’s behalf: composer, actor and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda. “Who I’m really here to see is Lin-Manuel Miranda because I’m a really big fan of his,” said Camilla Estrada, of Atlanta, who described herself as liberal and said she plans to vote for Warnock. Georgia Democrats spent the first week of the state’s 19-day early voting period in frantic activity, as they implore supporters to vote in advance. Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams each held multiple events a day. Miranda also appeared with Abrams at a restaurant in suburban Lawrenceville on Wednesday, while the Abrams campaign later rolled out a recorded chat with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday night. Almost 575,000 people had voted in Georgia by the end of Thursday, roughly on pace with the 2020 presidential election, when 5 million votes were cast in the state, buoying Democratic hopes that a big turnout might help them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines will operate 10 cargo planes for Amazon.com starting next fall under a deal that could eventually involve more planes and give Amazon a 15% stake in the airline. The airline’s parent company, Hawaiian Holdings Inc., said Friday that it will fly and maintain an “initial fleet” of 10 leased Airbus A330-300 jets for the retail giant. The fleet could grow “depending on Amazon’s future business needs,” the company said. Hawaiian said it issued warrants that Amazon can exercise over the next nine years and acquire up to 15% of Hawaiian stock. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings jumped 13% in afternoon trading Friday. When travel plunged and consumer spending spiked early in the pandemic, airlines began carrying more cargo and demand for freighter planes grew. More recently, the cargo business has cooled off as consumer spending shifted away from goods toward services including travel, and airlines have been stuck with excess cargo capacity. Global demand for cargo fell 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier, the International Air Transport Association reported this month. Hawaiian said it won’t use any of its current planes to serve Amazon. Instead, Amazon’s air division will lease the first 10 planes -- which will be converted from passenger jets to freighters -- from leasing company Altavair.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not uncommon for Idaho wildlife officials to be called for help when a moose, mountain lion, black bear or other wild animals wander into one of the state’s rural communities. But Idaho Fish and Game officials are asking the public for help with a particularly unusual find – a 3.5-foot alligator that was discovered hiding in the brush of a rural neighborhood about 40 miles northwest of Boise. Southwest Region spokesperson Brian Pearson told the Idaho Statesman that a New Plymouth resident was walking their dog Thursday evening when they noticed something moving in the brush. Further investigation revealed the alligator – a creature commonly found in the coastal wetlands of the southeastern U.S., but certainly not native to Idaho. Pearson said the resident put the alligator in a nearby horse trailer until Idaho Fish and Game conservation officer could pick it up Friday morning. The department has the animal in captivity for now, but Pearson said it will be euthanized or given to a licensed facility unless the owner is located. Idaho Fish and Game officials are hoping members of the public will call the department if they have any information about the alligator’s origins.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three young men were fatally shot and two more seriously wounded early Sunday during what police called a caravan of street racers involving about 100 vehicles that took over an intersection on the city’s Southwest Side. The shooting happened about 4 a.m. in Brighton Park after the caravan blocked streets leading to the intersection for illegal street racing, Chicago police Cmdr. Don Jerome said during a news conference. Those killed were between the ages of 15 and 20, Jerome said, adding that the two wounded are expected to survive. Police made no immediate arrests. Caravans blocking streets for drag racing, cars turning doughnuts and “drifting” are a “semi-recent phenomenon where they gather throughout different points of the city, and there were several others last night of no consequence … until this one,” Jerome said. The City Council member for the neighborhood where Sunday’s shooting happened said police and other city officials needed to act more aggressively to shut down such caravans. “This is not just fun and games on the street,” Alderman Raymond Lopez told reporters at the scene. “We are seeing gangs and criminality join into the drifting and drag racing.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A northwestern Indiana man who pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his 9-year-old daughter as he was talking to her two brothers about gun safety won’t serve any prison time for her 2017 death. A Lake County judge sentenced Eric S. Hummel, 38, on Thursday to one year to be served in the county’s community corrections program while living at home, followed by 31/ 2 years of probation. Judge Natalie Bokota accepted the Hobart man’s guilty plea to reckless homicide and neglect of a dependent charges in Olivia Hummel’s death, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Prosecutors had sought an 81/ 2 -year prison sentence for Hummel, but Bokota said she agreed with Hummel’s attorneys that incarcerating him would result in further trauma to his boys. According to court records, Hummel said he was showing a handgun to his sons and telling them to never play with it “because it can kill someone” when he accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Hummel told a 911 dispatcher he didn’t realize the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger. He admitted in his plea agreement that he was talking to his sons about gun safety in a bedroom of his Hobart home in June 2017 when he pointed a handgun at the boys and pulled the trigger.\n\nIowa\n\nGrinnell: In a rare move, leaders of Grinnell College and the city appealed this month for the public’s help to put an end to racial harassment, slurs and graffiti that have shaken the campus community this fall. In an open letter to the public Oct. 16, Grinnell Mayor Dan F. Agnew and Grinnell College President Anne F. Harris asked residents to mobilize against the harassment against black citizens, students and community members and not be complacent to any racism they may witness. They urged residents to report any harassment or vandalism to police, tip police if they know any individuals who have been involved, and to enroll in bystander intervention training to help prevent future incidents. Grinnell police said Friday that they had only one formal incident report, and no arrests had been made. But in a statement to the campus community Oct. 12, the private college said there had been several incidents, including defacement of campus signs and vehicles with racist and white supremacist graffiti and harassment of community members by “unknown individuals screaming slurs from moving vehicles.” “We also know that additional incidents may not have been reported,” the statement said. Grinnell, routinely ranked as one of the nation’s best liberal arts colleges, has a diverse student body.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Two years after her mate’s death, a female lion at the Topeka Zoo has grown a mane. The confident, sassy African lion named Zuri was always pretty much in charge of her three-member pride at the zoo, said her animal curator, Shanna Simpson. But staff members were still taken aback when, in the wake of her mate’s death two years ago, the aging lioness began growing what appeared to be a “mohawk” atop her head. That was followed by a rare and significant growth of the fur around Zuri’s head and neck, Simpson said. Zuri is intelligent, feisty and easy to train, Simpson said. The Topeka Zoo acquired Zuri and sister Asante in 2005 from the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, then in 2006 it acquired Avus from the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisconsin, to mate with Zuri and Asante. Avus had a large mane. Female African lions are attracted to males with large manes, Simpson said. Those manes help protect the males as they fight with other lions and with predators such as leopards and hyenas, she said. Zoo staff suspect Zuri’s increase in fur was triggered by the death of Avus, which left she and her sister as the only remaining members of their pride, Simpson said. “She feels like she needs to protect her pride, so her testosterone increases,” Simpson said. “And boom, she’s got more fur around her neck.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Local public transit workers have authorized a strike, but they aren’t walking out just yet. Union members with the Transit Authority of River City voted 95% in favor of the strike authorization Thursday, amid contentious contract negotiations. For now, buses will continue to run as scheduled, with no immediate plans to initiate a strike, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1447 President Lillian Brents said after the vote. The two sides are set to return to the bargaining table Nov. 2. Union leadership said workers want “a safe workplace and a fair contract.” The union is asking for a 6% raise for all workers after one year and 4% raises after years two and three, along with a cost-of-living adjustment of 1.25% every six months. TARC has offered a 3% raise for technical maintenance workers and radio room employees, a 2.5% raise for coach operators and a 1% raise for nontechnical maintenance workers, according to the union. The raises would take place in each year of the three-year contract. They do not include a cost-of-living adjustment. TARC claims the union’s salary demands are unrealistic and would exceed TARC’s annual budget, which is set by Louisville’s mayor and Metro Council.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Prohibitions against nonunanimous jury convictions – outlawed by Louisiana voters in 2018 and, later, by the U.S. Supreme Court – do not have to apply retroactively to earlier convictions, Louisiana’s highest court ruled Friday. The ruling came in the case of Reginald Reddick, convicted of murder by a 10-2 jury vote in 1997, but the court acknowledged it had implications for hundreds of others convicted with 10-2 or 11-1 jury votes. In 2018, Louisiana voters approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting nonunanimous verdicts in trials for crimes committed after Jan. 1, 2019. At the time, Louisiana was one of only two states allowing such verdicts. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that nonunanimous verdicts were unconstitutional, broadening the effect of the state constitutional amendment. But in 2021, the Supreme Court made clear in a case known as Ramos v. Louisiana that its decision against nonunanimous verdicts applied only to future cases and cases in which the defendants’ appeals had not been exhausted. Friday’s state high court majority ruling by Justice Scott Crichton cited the Ramos case and other jurisprudence in determining that neither federal nor state law required a retroactive application of the prohibition.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: A Republican congressional hopeful in a highly competitive race is spreading misinformation about the state’s housing policies, public housing directors said. Former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin is challenging Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who narrowly defeated the Republican in 2018. During his campaign, Poliquin has relayed a story about a woman living in her car who allegedly told him she was taken off a housing list because of immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Poliquin, who has focused his campaign on issues such as curtailing immigration and protecting gun rights, used the anecdote as part of his argument for increased border security. The Maine Association of Public Housing Authority Directors rebuked the story on Thursday with a statement to the Bangor Daily News that did not name the candidate but came in response to his statements. The statement said: “Such misinformation erodes trust in the public housing system on which so many individuals and families depend for safe, quality affordable housing, and it cannot be left uncorrected.” Eligibility for federal housing assistance is limited to U.S. citizens and noncitizens who have eligible immigration status, federal rules state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A video shows Republican Dan Cox, who is running for governor, accepting a gift from a young man wearing a shirt with a Proud Boys insignia during the candidate’s primary victory party this summer. The video, obtained by The Washington Post, shows Cox accepting a comb from him. “Here, this is a present from Maryland Proud Boys to you,” the young man said in video footage publicly posted on Cox’s Vimeo account. Members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, were involved in storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After accepting the gift, Cox asked the man’s name and shook his hand. “Nice to meet you,” Cox said, before greeting other supporters. The Washington Post reports the clip was removed after the newspaper contacted Cox’s campaign, which responded with a statement denying an association with the young man. “In the noise of the victory celebration, it was hard to hear what was being said,” Cox said, adding that he was surprised by the man handing him something and that “frankly, I did not even keep the comb.” Cox has reiterated false claims that the 2020 presidential election “was stolen” from Donald Trump, and he volunteered to help decertify results in Pennsylvania. He has also issued denials and apologies about his conduct surrounding Jan. 6. Although he said he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally, he has said he left before the march to the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlympton: A nearly three-week strike by truckers at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor has come to an end with a new labor agreement, the Teamsters union said. The five-year agreement includes an immediate $5 per hour pay raise, an $11 per hour raise over the course of the agreement, improved retirement benefits, and keeps drivers on the union health insurance plan, the Teamsters Local 653 said in a Facebook post Thursday. About 300 workers at the Sysco facility in Plympton south of Boston went on strike Oct. 1. “I’ve never been prouder to be a Teamster. This fight proves that we truly are the biggest, fastest, strongest union in the world,” Local 653 shop steward Kevin Whitten said. “This strike brought members together like never before and built solidarity that will continue for years to come.” An email seeking comment was left Friday with a spokesperson for Houston-based Sysco. More than a dozen picketers at the facility were arrested early Monday after blocking the exits with tractor-trailers and preventing some employees from leaving. Sysco, which has distribution facilities across the country, supplies food to schools, hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants and other businesses. The Plympton facility remained operational during the strike with third-party drivers.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A teenager accused of killing four fellow students and injuring more at his high school is expected to plead guilty to murder this week, authorities said Friday. Ethan Crumbley had created images of violence during a classroom assignment last November but was not sent home from Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. He pulled out a gun a few hours later and committed a mass shooting. Authorities have pinned some responsibility on Crumbley’s parents, portraying them as a dysfunctional pair who ignored their son’s mental health needs and happily provided a gun as a gift just days before the attack. They also face charges. Crumbley, 16, is due in court Monday. “We can confirm that the shooter is expected to plead guilty to all 24 charges, including terrorism, and the prosecutor has notified the victims,” said David Williams, chief assistant prosecutor in Oakland County. A message seeking comment was left for the boy’s lawyers. Crumbley was 15 when the shooting occurred at Oxford High, roughly 30 miles north of Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s death are heading to trial on state aiding and abetting counts, the third and likely final criminal proceeding in a killing that mobilized protesters worldwide against racial injustice in policing. J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have already been convicted of federal counts for violating Floyd’s civil rights and begun serving those sentences. Many witnesses expected to testify at their state trial have already done so at both their federal trial and at the state trial against their former colleague, Derek Chauvin. While much of the evidence in this proceeding will look similar, there will be some key differences. Jury selection gets underway Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: Hundreds of people applauded – and some wiped away tears – as the community unveiled a larger-than-life statue of Emmett Till on Friday, not far from where white men kidnapped and killed the Black teenager over accusations he had flirted with a white woman in a country store. “Change has come, and it will continue to happen,” Madison Harper, a senior at Leflore County High School, told a racially diverse audience at the statue’s dedication. “Decades ago, our parents and grandparents could not envision that a moment like today would transpire.” The 1955 lynching became a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago so the world could see the horrors inflicted on her 14-year-old son. Jet magazine published photos of his mutilated body, which was pulled from the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. The 9-foot-tall bronze statue in Greenwood’s Rail Spike Park is a jaunty depiction of the living Till in slacks, dress shirt and tie with one hand on the brim of a hat. The rhythm and blues song “Wake Up, Everybody” played as workers pulled a tarp off the figure. Dozens of people surged forward, shooting photos and video on cellphones.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a top Republican prospect for governor, wants to block public funding for library books that might appeal to the “prurient” – meaning sexual – interests of minors. Ashcroft proposed the new rule on libraries last week. It does not include a more-detailed definition or include examples of which specific books would be restricted as appealing sexually to children or teenagers. In a statement, the Missouri Library Association called Ashcroft’s rule “an infringement on the professional judgment of librarians, and an effort to further stoke division in the communities that libraries serve.” The group warned that small and urban libraries, which rely most on state funding, would face the greatest impact from the policy. Ashcroft on Friday said he didn’t propose the rule in response to any particular book but hoped it would prevent potential issues. “I know that a lot of Missouri libraries are doing a good job on this and reflecting the values of the taxpayers that paid for the materials,” Ashcroft said. “But I just think it’s good to have some guidelines to make sure that we’re reinforcing that parents are in control.” The proposal would require state-funded libraries to adopt policies on the age-appropriateness of literature, which is already common at both school and public libraries in the state. And under the rule, anyone could challenge access to books. The proposal is what’s known as an administrative rule, which would have the same effect as a law if enacted.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two physician groups have asked state election officials to issue a correction to statements printed in a voter information pamphlet that they argue are false and and could confuse voters as they consider an abortion-related ballot measure. The complaint comes from two groups that oppose a referendum that would raise the prospect of criminal charges for health care providers unless they take “all medically appropriate and reasonable actions to preserve the life” of an infant born alive, including after an attempted abortion. At issue is language in the pamphlet written by supporters that explains the proposed measure. Supporters say the referendum requires medical care to be provided if an infant is born alive after induced labor, cesarean section, attempted abortion or other method. The physicians say that supporters dropped a word from the language of the proposal and that the law, if passed, would also apply to an infant born as a result of natural labor, even if a fetus was born extremely preterm, and regardless of the infant’s prognosis or the family’s wishes. The complaint was made Friday by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology on Friday. They asked the Montana Secretary of State’s Office to issue a correction to statements.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific delivered 13% more profit in the third quarter, but the railroad predicted Thursday that its customers will ship fewer items than it expected, confirming the economy is slowing down in the face of soaring inflation. The Omaha-based railroad said it now expects the number of shipments it handles to be up about 3% this year and match the third-quarter number. Previously, Union Pacific had predicted that volume would be up 4% to 5% this year. “I have no idea if we’re in a recession or one is looming,” UP CEO Lance Fritz said. “I do know that the economy is slowing down.” Union Pacific reported $1.9 billion profit, or $3.05 per share, in the quarter. That’s up from $1.67 billion, or $2.57 per share, a year ago, but this year’s results were weighed down because the new contracts the railroads agreed to with their 12 unions cost $114 million more than Union Pacific had been planning on. Without that one-time charge for the new contracts, which only half of the unions have approved, Union Pacific would have reported earnings per share of $3.19. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.06 per share.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A rural county can start hand-counting mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday, but it won’t be allowed to livestream the tallying and must make other changes to its plans. The ruling came in response to an emergency petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which challenged several aspects of Nye County’s plan to start hand-counting votes this week. The ACLU said in its lawsuit that the plan risked leaking early voting results. It also said that rules on touch screens to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act were too vague and restrictive and that the county violated state law with its “stringent signature verification” for voter ID. Located between Las Vegas and Reno, rural Nye County was one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act on election conspiracies related to mistrust in voting machines. Alongside the primary machine tabulation process, Interim County Clerk Mark Kampf’s plans to publicly hand-count all paper ballots. The hand count was first proposed to county commissioners by Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant in response to false claims about Dominion voting machines. Sadmira Ramic, the ACLU of Nevada’s voting rights attorney, praised the ruling.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: A small plane crashed into a building, killing the two people on board and sparking a large fire on the ground, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement Saturday that a single-engine Beechcraft Sierra aircraft crashed into a building north of Keene Dillant-Hopkins Airport in Keene on Friday evening. City officials said on their Facebook page that no one was injured in the building hit by the plane but that “those on the plane have perished.” “The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. The NTSB will be in charge of the investigation and will provide additional updates,” the FAA said. Keene Mayor George Hansel told the Associated Press that two people on the plane died but that they have not been identified. He said the the plane hit a two-story barn connected to a multi-family apartment building. All eight people were evacuated from the apartment building due to the subsequent fire. At a morning press conference, Hansel said the plane was owned by Monadnock Aviation, which is based at the airport. He said it was unclear where the plane was headed, and no one answered the phone at Monadnock. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and the operations at the airport were not affected, he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s new K-12 public school mental health plan is facing lots of opposition from state lawmakers who say they won’t back its proposal to eliminate the decades-old School Based Youth Services program, which provides critical counseling and support for teens in low-performing districts. The School Based Youth Services program, set up in 90 of the state’s public schools, is scheduled to be eliminated by June 2023 to make way for NJ4S, New Jersey Statewide Student Support Service Network, an expanded and revamped system that would be available to all or most of the state’s 2,400 schools. Unveiled in October as a “first-in-the-nation” effort to centralize services and spread them beyond schools and into libraries, group homes and social service agencies, NJ4S was in the works for more than a year and created as a response to the pandemic’s teen mental health crisis under the guidance of Department of Children and Families’ Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer. But it was immediately met with intense criticism from educators and advocates who support expanding services but said the time-tested school-based programs must also stay.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Department of Agriculture will waive cost-sharing requirements for farmers and ranchers affected by the largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján on Thursday announced that the agency will cover cost sharing for emergency forest restoration, conservation and other environmental improvement programs. The move follows the approval of a massive federal spending bill that included $2.5 billion in relief for those affected by the fire and post-fire flooding. That bill included a provision to waive cost sharing for all programs administered by the USDA. The wildfire was sparked by two government planned burns earlier this year. It ripped through hundreds of square miles of forest and grazing lands, destroying homes and the livelihoods of many of the rural residents. Through no fault of their own, Luján said, residents lost large swaths of cherished lands and will have to grapple with the effects for years. “Our farmers and ranchers, business owners and families deserve relief to recover,” he said in a statement.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: The victims of a racist mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket will be honored with a permanent memorial in the neighborhood, elected and community leaders announced Friday. The shooting “is part of the Buffalo story forever going forward,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. “We want to do something that people remember. A place to come and reflect. A place to honor. And a place to say never again.” Former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, whose 86-year-old mother Ruth Whitfield was among the 10 Black people killed May 14, is among those appointed to a planning commission tasked with acquiring land, seeking input on the design, securing funds and maintaining the monument. Buffalo NAACP President Mark Blue will lead the effort. “It’s not going to take the place of my mother or the lives of the other loved ones that were lost here,” Whitfield said. “So we will forever miss them and honor their legacy by what we do going forward.” The officials did not specify a budget or timeline for the project’s completion. Brown said numerous businesses and people have offered to contribute. Payton Gendron, 19, has been charged with killing 10 and wounding three others at the Tops Friendly Market. Investigators said he drove 200 miles from his Conklin home intending to kill as many Black people as possible at the store, which he targeted because of its location in the predominantly Black East Buffalo neighborhood. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSalisbury: A man who was shot during a weekend concert at Livingstone College has been identified as a suspected shooter and is now facing charges, officials said Tuesday. The shooting took place Saturday during a performance featuring rapper Asian Doll at the historically Black college in Salisbury. Police are also asking for help identifying another person of interest. Salisbury police obtained a warrant charging Talib Latrell Kelly, 21, of Salisbury, with attempted first-degree murder, discharging a firearm on educational property and possession of a firearm by a felon, the department said. Kelly is not a Livingstone student, Salisbury police Capt. P.J. Smith said at a news conference. Officers were called to the campus about 11 p.m. and found gunshot victims and others who had been hurt as concertgoers fled the gunfire, city officials said in a statement. Video footage from the event shows that a fight broke out while Asian Doll was on stage. Two male victims were taken to Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center in Charlotte with gunshot wounds, and officials also identified a woman who had a superficial wound to her neck, Smith said. None of the victims’ injuries were considered life-threatening, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A North Dakota farmer who had been detained in Ukraine since November 2021 on accusations he planned to kill his business partner is back home, the state’s two U.S. senators announced Friday. Kurt Groszhans, from Ashley, North Dakota, has ancestors from Ukraine and went there to farm in 2017. The relationship with his partner, law professor Roman Leshchenko, crumbled after Groszhans alleged that Leshchenko embezzled money from him. Groszhans and his assistant were arrested on charges of plotting to assassinate Leshchenko, who was then Ukraine’s agriculture minister. Groszhans said in a statement Friday that the Ukrainian officials made up the charges in an “effort to shut me up” after he discovered corruption “at the highest levels” of the government. “I am grateful to be home after this horrible ordeal,” Groszhans said in a statement. “My family and supporters worked tirelessly over a long period of time to make this happen and it was nice to be able to celebrate my birthday on North Dakota soil. The fact they refused to classify me as a wrongful detainee was an unfortunate and politically cowardly act that cost me almost a year of my life,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state of Ohio will not require the COVID-19 vaccine for school students despite a recommendation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel. A panel with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the federal government’s list of routinely recommended vaccinations. The panel’s decision, likely to be adopted by the CDC director, formally adds the shot to a list often used by schools and health officials in making vaccination requirements. Ohio leaders made it clear Friday that the vaccine would not be required for Ohio students. “The State of Ohio does not mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for school attendance. The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) vote does not change Ohio law. The state’s list of required vaccines can only be changed through legislation,” Ohio Department of Health Director Bruce Vanderhoff said in a statement. Indeed, not every vaccine on the list has been adopted by Ohio as a requirement for schoolchildren, such as flu shots. A list of required vaccines for schools and child care in Ohio can be viewed on the Ohio Department of Health website.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A private foundation has raised more than $6 million to build a residence for future Oklahoma governors and their families, under a plan that calls for the current mansion near the state Capitol to be used for official meetings and special events, according to Gov. Kevin Stitt and people involved in the project. Talks about building a new home on the mansion grounds predate Stitt’s inauguration in 2019 and grew out of concerns about the cost of renovating the century-old structure. Stitt told reporters on Wednesday that he and his family – who lived only temporarily in the mansion – would not live in the new residence if he wins a second term next month. “It will not benefit Gov. Stitt,” he said. The foundation, Friends of the Mansion, is expected to announce plans for the residence after the Nov. 8 election. The foundation was created in 1995 by former Gov. Frank Keating and former first lady Cathy Keating to pay for renovations and additions. The new residence is envisioned for land behind the current mansion. Plans would have to be approved by two zoning commissions that oversee the area near the Capitol.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The mayor plans to ban camping on city streets and move unhoused people to designated campsites, as the growing homeless population has become the top concern for the vast majority of residents. “The magnitude and the depth of the homeless crisis in our city is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said Friday. “We need to move our scattered, vulnerable homeless population closer to the services that they need.” The resolution would establish at least three large, designated outdoor camping sites, with the first opening within 18 months of securing funding. Wheeler didn’t specify when the funding would be confirmed or how much the measure would cost. The designated camping sites would initially be able to serve up to 125 people and would provide access to services such as food, hygiene, litter collection and treatment for mental health and substance abuse, Wheeler said. The sites could eventually serve 500 people. Oregon’s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and drug addiction. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, and there are more than 700 encampments across the city, Wheeler said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s elections chief wants legal penalties against two Republican county officials and their lawyer for what she calls in a new court filing their “unprecedented, reckless decision” to give an outside group access to voting machines during pending litigation on that subject. Lawyers for acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman last week asked the state Supreme Court to hold in contempt the two Fulton County commissioners and to dismiss the litigation that had been scheduled for oral argument before the justices this week. Chapman was appointed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. On Friday afternoon, the justices appointed Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer as a special master to gather evidence on the contempt request and make a report with recommendations by Nov. 18. During their long-running dispute with the state, Fulton County GOP Commissioners Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch had allowed one group, Wake TSI, access to voting machines as part of the failed effort to locate fraud that might overturn ex-President Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat. That prompted the Department of State to tell counties they “shall not” allow such access to voting machines. Ulsh and Bunch were moments away from permitting a second group, Envoy Sage, to inspect the machines in January when the state Supreme Court put that on hold. The inspection planned in January was to involve computers, electronic poll books, ballot scanners and possibly more.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawsuit claiming that Brown University failed to protect female students from sexual harassment and assault can move forward in part, a federal judge ruled last week. Four former students filed a federal class action suit in August 2021 alleging that the university systemically and repeatedly failed to protect women from harm, including rape, despite knowing that sexual assault on campus is “endemic.” Two current students later joined the suit. The university moved to dismiss the suit in March. On Oct. 18, U.S. District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr. allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief to go forward but denied their efforts to seek monetary relief. The plaintiffs were enrolled between 2018 and 2021. The plaintiffs can sue to force Brown to “ensure that the Title IX office receives, investigates and resolves complaints.” The plaintiffs must still prove that their suit meets the criteria for class-action certification. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or in activities that receive federal financial assistance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Months after accusing disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh of killing his wife and son, investigators and prosecutors have released few details about the evidence that they believe connect him to the shootings. That’s led Murdaugh’s lawyers to file a flurry of court documents requesting information from the prosecution, seeking to publicly weaken the case before the January trial has begun. The defense attorneys argue that there was unknown DNA found under Murdaugh’s wife’s fingernails. They also have a different suspect, Murdaugh’s friend Curtis Eddie Smith, arguing that he failed a lie detector test regarding the killings. Murdaugh has already admitted to asking Smith to arrange Murdaugh’s own death to defraud his life insurance company. Those defense documents even boosted a story from Smith that prosecutors later said had no evidence to back it up – that Paul Murdaugh killed his mother, Maggie, when he caught her with a groundskeeper at the family’s Colleton County hunting lodge, and the groundskeeper then shot the son. Alex Murdaugh, 54, has proclaimed his innocence ever since June 2021, when he found the bodies, each shot several times. He has said through his lawyer he “loved them more than anything in the world.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nVermillion: The University of South Dakota may welcome a new sorority chapter in the coming years. Alpha Pi Omega, the country’s oldest Indigenous Greek letter organization, could open doors on campus if enough students express interest, according to a flier circulated on social media promoting an informational session held Oct. 13. APO is a sisterhood of Indigenous women who are committed to each other, communities, tribes, families, academic excellence and self-empowerment, according to the flier. Its philanthropic cause is the National Indian Education Association. Hanna Delange, a spokesperson for USD, said nothing has been solidified yet with the sorority’s plans but confirmed the informational session took place as a chance for students to learn about the potential organization. Brooke Poppe, director of sorority and fraternity life on USD’s campus, said while there is no current timeline to open the sorority, the plan moving forward is on hold until there is enough student interest. It takes five or more students to start any student organization on campus. When or if Poppe receives a list of interested students, USD can move forward with the APO national organization in the expansion process. Poppe said her office hopes to have that potential list together by the end of the semester.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Employees of Bess T. Shepherd Elementary School blasted a recent nighttime prayer meeting over the school’s exterior loudspeaker, although district officials said it was an accident. An unidentified neighbor who could hear the praying from inside his or her home Monday night posted a video on the Reddit website that recorded about two minutes of a speaker praying over the intercom, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. “This went on for 45 minutes,” the video caption said. The video included a woman’s voice repeatedly saying, “We need you in this school, God. We need you in every school, God.” She spoke of casting the things of hell “back to the abyss” and said: “You cannot rule in this school. You cannot rule in the hearts and minds of the children.” The speaker also prayed over staff members. District officials said the prayer meeting occurred about 6 p.m. Monday, although they were not aware of it until Thursday morning. “There were staff members inside the building praying who were unaware the external intercom system was enabled,” district spokesperson Steve Doremus said in an email. “As soon as they were made aware, the intercoms were turned off.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas Department of Public Safety fired an officer Friday who was at the scene of the Uvalde school massacre and becomes the first member of the state police force to lose their job in the fallout over the hesitant response to the May attack. The department served Sgt. Juan Maldonado with termination papers, spokeswoman Ericka Miller said. No details were offered about his role at the scene of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School or the specific reason Maldonado was fired. The firing comes five months after the mass shooting that has put state police under scrutiny over their actions on the school campus as a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers. Maldonado could not be reached for comment Friday night. Body camera footage and media reports have shown the Department of Public Safety had a larger role at the scene than the department appeared to suggest after the shooting. State troopers were among the first wave of officers to arrive but did not immediately confront the gunman, which experts say goes against standard police procedure during mass shootings.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox hosted the first of what governors across the U.S. are planning to be a series of new discussions on how states could address mental health issues. Neither Cox nor other governors involved are proposing specific policy solutions so far, but that isn’t the point – the idea is to listen to physicians, pediatric psychologists, educators, parents and others to try to find areas of consensus. Cox, the vice chair of the National Governors Association, is among a bipartisan group of governors who have joined NGA chair Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, in forwarding the “Strengthening Your Mental Health” initiative, with the ultimate goal of finding nonpartisan policies that states everywhere might adopt. Over two days at a roundtable event in Salt Lake City, Cox, a Republican, and Murphy, a Democrat, hosted a series of conversations on the topic, hoping to hear experts’ opinions on potential solutions connected to prevention, early intervention and resilience building. “Youth mental health is an urgent issue in Utah and nationwide,” Cox said. “The (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the problem, and it’s important that we be proactive in bolstering support resources and letting young people know that help is available.”\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: A fired deputy who is the only candidate on the November ballot to become sheriff of the county where he served was charged Friday with simple assault for kicking a shackled prisoner, authorities said. John Grismore, 49, of Fairfax, was cited on the charge Friday through his attorney. He is due in court Monday in St. Albans to answer the charge, Vermont State Police said in a news release. Surveillance cameras recorded the prisoner being kicked Aug. 7. In the Aug. 9 primary, Grismore won the nominations of both Franklin County’s Republican and Democratic parties to have his name on the November ballot for sheriff. But after the video became public, he was suspended and then fired by outgoing Franklin County Sheriff Roger Langevin. The county Republican and Democratic parties gave their support to a write-in campaign by Sheriff’s department Lt. Mark Lauer, a 27-year Vermont State Police veteran who has been at the department for nearly a decade. Gale Messier is also running a write-in campaign. He spent decades in law enforcement including 20 years at the sheriff’s department in Chittenden County, Vermont’s most populous county. On Friday, Grismore said in an email that “the story is still the same” and that he had nothing new to add.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Belvoir: A “barricade situation” drew the FBI and other law enforcement officials to a U.S. Army base outside the nation’s capital Sunday, according to the official Twitter account of Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia. The base tweeted shortly before 1 p.m. that its law enforcement officials, local police and the FBI had responded “to a barricade situation” Sunday morning. “The situation is ongoing, & we cannot comment further at this time,” the base tweeted. It provided no other details except to say some of the gates to the installation remained open. The situation was inside a home, WUSA-TV reports. Fort Belvoir sits on about 8,800 acres of land along the Potomac River in Fairfax County and is located about 20 miles south of Washington. The base is home to several Army command headquarters, elements of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard and nine Department of Defense agencies, according to a Department of Defense website that serves the military community. The installation has 2,154 family housing quarters and seven child youth service facilities, according to Fort Belvoir’s 2022 strategic plan.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities said Friday that they arrested three suspects in the slayings of two people and shooting of a police officer after a daylong search on a tribal reservation in northeastern Washington. The Colville Tribes Emergency Services said on Facebook on Friday evening that the third suspect was arrested in Elmer City, one of several small communities on the rural reservation. Two others were arrested earlier in the day. The search for the suspects began after the Colville Tribal Police Department responded to a report of a shooting Thursday in Keller, a small community about 275 miles east of Seattle. Officers found two people dead, and an officer who came across a vehicle described as having left the scene was shot in the arm, according to the department. He was doing well after being transported for medical care, the department said in a news release. Police identified two of the suspects as Curry Pinkham and Zachary Holt. Robin Redstar, a Colville Tribal member and Nespelem resident, said she and other residents waited in their home for hours, and at one point one of the suspects was believed to be in a gully behind her house. Authorities eventually arrested a man in front of her home around 10 a.m. after he tried to enter her neighbor’s back door, Redstar said. Her neighbor, a hunter with guns, was able to detain the man and get him to the street, where a tribal police car was waiting, Redstar said. “It was pretty quick. Corbie (the neighbor) was giving him a good speech about morals,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Voters will get the final say on a ballot question that would amend the state constitution to give the Republican-dominated Legislature control over virtually every aspect of public schooling. The vote comes amid a fight raging nationally over the politicization of schools. West Virginia’s Republican leaders have joined politicians elsewhere in pushing to regulate how subjects such as race are taught in classrooms and funnel public money into alternative education options, including charter schools and voucher programs. Just this year, the state Board of Education joined a lawsuit against top Republicans over a school choice program – one of the nation’s most expansive – alleging it unconstitutionally drains money from public schools. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which sided with lawmakers. And in a state that once was a stronghold of organized labor, some see the proposed amendment as part of an effort to defang the most formidable center of union power left standing: public school employees. Four years after more than 30,000 school workers went on strike in one of the nation’s poorest states, igniting teacher walkouts nationwide, many say they’re overworked and exhausted.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A Milwaukee County judge on Friday denied a Republican Party of Wisconsin request to stop the city of Milwaukee from continuing a get-out-the-vote effort that the city argues it neither runs nor funds. Judge Gwen Connolly wrote that the arguments made by the party and Milwaukee voter Elizabeth Burke were “deficient” and that issuing such an order would chill constitutionally protected free speech. The lawsuit was one of two filed by the Republican Party of Wisconsin and other plaintiffs in the weeks after Mayor Cavalier Johnson made comments Sept. 12 about an initiative dubbed “Milwaukee Votes 2022” and referenced door-to-door canvassing funded by the “private sector.” Johnson’s spokesman then said the campaign conducting the canvassing is privately funded, and the city’s association was “limited to the mayor voicing support for the work.” The first lawsuit, which centered on an open records request, was dismissed earlier this month after the party said it had received the requested records from the Milwaukee Election Commission and Mayor’s Office related to the get-out-the-vote effort. In the second lawsuit, filed Sept. 28, Burke and Republicans argued that though Milwaukee Votes 2022 is a purportedly nonpartisan get-out-the-vote effort, the city would partner with an organization, GPS Impact, that openly works to elect Democratic candidates and advance progressive causes.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: A hunter accidentally shot himself in the leg while trying to fight off a grizzly bear attack in west-central Wyoming – the second such attack in a week’s time, officials said. Lee Francis, 65, of Evanston, was taken to the University of Utah Health hospital for treatment after the encounter Friday, the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said. Francis was hunting with his son in an area south of Grand Teton National Park on Friday evening when the bear attacked him. He was able to fire several rounds from his handgun, causing the bear to run away, but one of the rounds hit Francis in the lower leg, the sheriff’s office said. His son used a satellite phone to call for help just before 6 p.m., then began providing first aid. His son was able to help his father onto a horse, and they headed toward a nearby lake to meet search and rescue crews. Francis was eventually taken to the hospital via helicopter, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Wildlife officials had not located the grizzly bear, Sgt. Travis Bingham with the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday. Because it was snowing, Game and Fish planned to try to search for the bear again Monday, weather permitting, he said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/03/rockefeller-christmas-snake-burglar-truman-library-news-around-states/49471921/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican Gov. Kay Ivey recognized Ashley M. Jones, the state’s first Black poet laureate, a creative writing teacher who delves into inequality and the difficulty of being Black in America, in the same building where Southern delegates voted to form the Confederacy 160 years ago. Standing in the white-domed Capitol, Ivey presented Jones with a commendation for the honor, bestowed earlier this year by the Alabama Writers Cooperative for a four-year term that begins in January. “Everyone in this room, and I would add folks around the country, are proud of you for being honored with this well-deserved, historic recognition,” Ivey told Jones during the ceremony. As poet laureate, Jones will advocate for poetry and writing in general during lectures and appearances at schools, libraries and other institutions. “I am committed to making space for all of us who write,” she said. Jones’ appointment is “pretty revolutionary,” said Jeanie Thompson, an author and executive director of the Alabama Writers Forum. “She brings a strong statement, but she brings a lot of balance,” said Thompson. “And so I think that she will have things to say that people will hear.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The remains of a man found on Fire Island just west of Anchorage in 1989 have been identified through DNA and genome sequencing, Alaska State Troopers said. Troopers said the victim was Michael Allison Beavers, who owned an excavation business in Chugiak. He was reported missing in 1980. The decadeslong investigation started when human remains were discovered July 24, 1989. An autopsy concluded it was a Caucasian male between the ages of 35 and 50, and evidence found on the remains indicated the death was criminal, troopers said. Officials said it appeared the remains had been on the beach for at least a year, but the date of death couldn’t be determined. A DNA profile entered into the national missing persons database in 2003 came back with no match. Earlier this year, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation Cold Case Investigation Unit reopened the case. Bone samples retained in the case were sent to a private lab, where DNA was extracted and genome sequencing was used to create a comprehensive DNA profile. Beavers’ spouse reported him missing two months after he was last seen alive, in November 1979. Beavers, 40, left his home in Chugiak to travel to Seattle by car to contact a business associate. He never arrived, troopers said. The investigation into his disappearance stalled and closed in 1982. Ten years later, he was declared dead. Troopers said the investigation into his death continues, and anyone with information about his disappearance and death should contact authorities.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 25-foot-tall white pine installed in the state Capitol’s executive tower lobby was lit for the first time Wednesday by Gov. Doug Ducey during a celebration marking the start of the holiday season. The lighting of the Capitol tree is an annual tradition and brings together schoolchildren, state workers and the governor. This year’s celebration featured Christmas carols sung by students from Chandler High School’s choir, the Treblemakers. Last year’s tree lighting ceremony was forced to be held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ducey cheered the return to an in-person ceremony, noting at the time of last year’s lighting, vaccines were not available and the state’s economy was just starting to revive from effects of the pandemic shutdowns.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court upheld the 20-year prison sentence for a former pathologist at an Arkansas veterans hospital who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of a patient he misdiagnosed. The three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments by Robert Levy’s attorneys that the sentence was unreasonable. Levy pleaded guilty to misdiagnosing a patient with small cell carcinoma who died after being treated for a type of cancer he didn’t have. Levy falsified the patient’s medical record to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis, according to a plea agreement. Levy was fired from the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville in April 2018. VA officials said in 2019 that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating to 2005.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRiverside: Police are looking for a man dubbed the “snake burglar” who wriggled his way through a Southern California business and fled with several thousands dollars. Surveillance video showed the man slithering on his belly at the Rustic Roots salon in Riverside at about 5 a.m. last Friday after apparently getting into the business through a rooftop fire escape. “It just gave me chills up my spine,” owner Lori Hajj told KNBC-TV. Hajj said the thief she called the “snake burglar” stole hundreds of dollars worth of products, cash from the register and a safe with more than $8,000 inside. A security guard who was installing a new alarm system at the salon told KNBC-TV that the crook had been trying successfully to avoid a motion sensor. The same man might have tried to burglarize other businesses previously, including a local pizza parlor where security video showed a man crawling on his belly, the station said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Rocky Mountain National Park will have a timed-entry permit system for the third straight season, pending approval from the National Park Service. The park is proposing the system for 2022 with minor tweaks to what was implemented in 2021. The third-most visited national park implemented the pilot system in 2020 to address visitor congestion and resource damage. The park’s timed-entry permit system has been polarizing, with some visitors enjoying less congestion and others complaining about the restrictions that curtail spontaneous trips. Through August, the last month for which visitation numbers were available, the park saw nearly 3.3 million visitors compared with 2.2 million during the same time in 2020. In 2019, the park saw nearly 4.7 million visitors over the entire year. Park spokesperson Kyle Patterson said the park is continually adjusting the system based on data it has collected to help balance visitor experience with resource protection.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut collected about $1.7 million during its first partial month of legalized online gambling and sports wagering, Gov. Ned Lamont said. The figures represent the state’s share of revenue collected Oct. 12-31. Roughly $1.2 million came from the state’s portion of online casino gambling revenue generated by the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes, and approximately $513,000 came from sports betting revenue generated by the tribes and the Connecticut Lottery Corporation. The money will be deposited into the state’s general fund. Under the state’s new legalized system, Connecticut collects 13.75% of gross gambling revenue from sports wagering, and 18% from online casino gambling until 2026, when the rate increases to 20%. The state does not receive any payments on sports wagers placed at the southeastern Connecticut casinos owned by the two tribes, which currently have opened temporary sports book facilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Children can now visit inmates at Delaware correctional facilities for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, correction officials said. The Delaware Department of Correction announced in a news release Tuesday that in-person visits at all of its facilities have been expanded to include children and youth under 18. The department said it’s making the change as COVID-19 vaccination expands to include children and aggressive COVID-19 mitigation measures continue in the correctional system. Visiting children must be accompanied by an adult visitor and inmate visits are limited to either one adult or one adult and one child. The department said all in-person inmate visits must be scheduled in advance through the facility and all visits are subject to COVID-19 screening. Commissioner Monroe B. Hudson Jr. emphasized that video visitation is available in all Delaware prison facilities and was expanded early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:When United flight 2701 from Chicago landed at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday afternoon, it became the first commercial flight to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel, WUSA-TV reported. It was an important milestone as the travel industry works to fight its contributions to climate change. “Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry, but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels, we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes,” said United CEO Scott Kirby. The demonstration flight departed O’Hare Airport at 1 p.m. CST carrying 100 passengers, with an arrival time of 4 p.m. EST. The flight used 500 gallons of SAF -- a clean alternative to jet fuel -- in one engine and 500 gallons of jet fuel in the other. According to United, airlines are only allowed to use a maximum of 50% SAF on board, meaning past flights using SAF were a combination of the alternative fuel with conventional jet fuel. United Airlines has set a goal of being 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To work towards this goal the company says it plans to buy 1.5 billion gallons of SAF; so far this year they’ve purchased more than 7 million gallons through the Eco-Skies Alliance program.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami is making face coverings optional for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated students whose parents sign opt-out paperwork. The archdiocese made the announcement Tuesday, citing community COVID-19 statistics and the advice of physician advisors, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Miami-Dade County Department of Health. The CDC recommends mask-wearing in public indoor settings, including schools, in areas of substantial or high community transmission. As of Wednesday, Florida was the only state in the nation where transmission was low in nearly every county, according to the CDC’s COVID-19 data tracker. Face masks were already optional for fully vaccinated students and teachers who provided vaccination cards to the school or were confirmed through the FL SHOTS database, the archdiocese said in a statement. Public schools in Miami-Dade and Broward counties allowed parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in early November. If the data trends negatively again, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said measures will be put back in place.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGrovetown:A nutrition manager at Cedar Ridge Elementary School has been arrested on charges of possession of methamphetamine found at the school, according to a press release from the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. At approximately 8:30 a.m., the department responded to the school where a small amount of methamphetamine was found in an employee restroom in the kitchen. After an investigation, the department believed it belonged to Kelley Nile, the nutritional manager. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office K-9 Division responded to the campus and discovered an additional user amount of methamphetamine in the center console of Nile’s vehicle. Nile was arrested on charges of possession of schedule II narcotics and transported to the Columbia County Detention Center. The Columbia County School District said Nile is no longer employed by the school system. The school is in the process of notifying staff and parents about the situation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii State Department of Health said a laboratory has detected petroleum product in a water sample from an elementary school near Pearl Harbor amid heightened concerns that fuel from a massive Navy storage facility could contaminate Oahu’s water supply. The department said the test result from a University of Hawaii lab is preliminary, and it’s not yet known what type of petroleum was in the water. The sample was taken Tuesday at Red Hill Elementary School. The department is still awaiting test results of samples sent to a lab in California. For three days, hundreds of residents in Navy housing complained of a fuel-like odor coming from their tap water. Some have said they suffered from stomach pain and headaches. The department said all complaints have come from people using the Navy’s water system, and not from anyone who gets their water from Honolulu’s municipal water utility. The Navy and the utility have wells that draw on the Moanalua-Waimalu aquifer, which is located 100 feet below the Navy’s fuel storage tanks at Red Hill. The Navy on Sunday shut down a Red Hill well that draws water from the aquifer out of an “abundance of caution,” a spokesperson said. The department has advised all those using the Navy’s water not to drink their tap water. It’s recommending that those who can smell fuel in their water not to use it for bathing, washing dishes or laundry. The system provides water to about 93,000 people living in and near Pearl Harbor.\n\nIdaho\n\nSugar City: State wildlife officials have euthanized three lion cubs in southeastern Idaho. Officials with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game captured and euthanized the cubs on Friday after they appeared in the backyards of homes in Sugar City. The cubs had been in the area for several days before being captured by wildlife officials. Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman James Brower told the East Idaho News that the mother was nowhere to be found, and the cubs were in poor health. It’s not known what happened to the mother. “We did a pretty thorough examination of these cubs, and they were fairly emaciated,” Brower said. “They were in really poor body condition, so they were not very healthy. There’s no rehabilitation center or place that you can take them to. They would have not made it on their own. They would have starved to death. They were pretty young.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city dropped its lawsuit against the police union in its fight over city employee COVID-19 vaccine orders, saying the complaint became unnecessary as more officers complied. The move follows a judge’s ruling last month to suspend an end-of-the-year city deadline for police officers to get vaccinated. Still, Mayor Lori Lightfoot vowed Wednesday that if union leaders revived talk of an “illegal work stoppage” over the mandate, the city would return to court. The city sued the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7 in October, accusing President John Catanzara of encouraging an “illegal strike.” The city said those who didn’t comply with the vaccine mandate would be placed on “no-pay status.” In public statements and on social media, Catanzara encouraged police to disobey the order. The union also sued. Lightfoot and police leaders said the mandate was put in place to protect officers and the public. More than 460 law enforcement officers have died of COVID-19, including four in Chicago, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette:Six African penguins died at the Columbian Park Zoo after falling ill with avian malaria, zoo officials said. The zoo announced Tuesday that the penguins died despite around-the-clock care that included anti-malarial medications intended to halt their infections. Zoo Director Neil Dale said in a news release that the zoo’s three remaining African penguins were in critical condition after also contracting the illness, the Journal & Courier reported. Avian malaria is a parasitic disease caused by a “plasmodium” that’s transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos, the zoo said. This disease only affects birds and is not transmissible to humans or other zoo animals. Dale said the first African penguin fell ill on Oct. 24 and despite the zoo veterinary team’s efforts, it died four days later. Five other penguins later died. The zoo’s Penguin Cove exhibit opened at the zoo in July after being pushed back several times because of the COIVD-19 pandemic. Dale said the zoo is working with the exhibit’s design team and continuing to consult experts for preventative measures that would help ward off exposures to the illness.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Former television news anchor Tiffany O’Donnell has been elected mayor of Cedar Rapids. O’Donnell garnered 68% of the vote to businesswoman Amara Andrews’ 32% in Tuesday’s runoff election. The runoff was triggered when no candidate reached a majority 50% of the vote in the Nov. 2 general election. O’Donnell, a former news anchor for television station KGAN and chief executive of Iowa-based women’s leadership group Women Lead Change, campaigned on finishing cleanup from last year’s derecho, fixing city streets and accelerating flood recovery. O’Donnell will take office in January at the end of incumbent Mayor Brad Hart’s term.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A lawsuit filed against a Wichita car dealership by the wife of a police officer injured when he was run over by a sport utility vehicle from the business has been settled for an undisclosed amount. Officer Brian Arterburn was critically injured in February 2017 when he was hit by an SUV driver while putting down stop sticks to stop the vehicle as police chased it. Arterburn’s wife, fellow Wichita police officer Claudale Arterburn, sued Eddy’s Chevrolet Cadillac, its owners and the driver of the SUV, Justin Terrazas. The dealership has said that the vehicle was stolen and that it has “no clear understanding” of how Terrazas came to have it in his possession, the Wichita Eagle reported. But the lawsuit alleged Eddy’s Chevrolet Cadillac gave Terrazas access to the vehicle and did not report the car was stolen for two months before the chase, despite being told it was being used for criminal activity. Terrazas pleaded guilty to charges in the case and was sentenced to nearly 29 years in prison. The lawsuit, which had sought $75 million in actual and punitive damages, had been set to go to trial before the settlement was announced Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Gov. Andy Beshear said he will propose devoting $10 million to support an expansion of Waterfront Park into western Louisville. The 22-acre park expansion will connect downtown and West Louisville along the Ohio River in the state’s largest city, officials said. The total cost of the expansion is $50 million. “For so many people in this city, Waterfront Park is not just a place, it’s an experience,” Beshear said. “It’s the backdrop for some of their happiest moments with family and friends. It’s time that this experience is accessible to all members of the Louisville community.” Beshear will submit his budget proposals to the legislature early next year. The park expansion site will be in the Portland neighborhood within West Louisville. The expansion will include plazas, gardens and an observation pier at the river’s edge that can accommodate events, performances and other gatherings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:In two short weeks, Miss Louisiana, Julia Claire Williams, will compete on the national stage for the title of Miss America. “I really am most looking forward to visiting with all of the state title holders,” Williams said. “They’re such kind, strong, compassionate, impactful, young women, and to stand amongst them to compete for this job is such an honor.” The competition, which takes place Dec. 16 at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. The centennial Miss America competition was set to take place last year, but it was canceled because of the pandemic. Williams works as an emergency room scribe for St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe. She is a graduate of University of Louisiana Monroe and hails from Kinder in the southwest part of the state. Williams said she has enjoyed fulfilling the role of Miss Louisiana, including her social impact initiative, which focuses on serving disadvantaged and disabled youth. Although there isn’t one specific facet she has enjoyed more than the others, she said the job has helped her grow as a person. Through her experience, Williams said she has increased her public speaking skills and grown in her adaptability.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunk: The federal government is providing a small meat processor in Maine with $200,000 to help rebuild from a devastating fire last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is giving the money to Nest & Mullen LLC of Kennebunk, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree said Tuesday. The fire destroyed a processing plant in September 2020. The grant will help the business recover and rebuild, Pingree said. She said the fire “not only destroyed their plant, but it shook the foundation of their entire business and threatened their livelihood.” Nest & Mullen is a five-generation farm and butcher shop, Pingree said. The money is through USDA’s Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grant program. The agency announced $32 million in grants to dozens of processing facilities earlier in the week.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan outlined preparation plans in the state for the omicron variant of COVID-19, urging people to get vaccinated and to get a booster shot if enough time has gone by since they have been vaccinated. The governor spoke at a news conference not long after after the White House announced that a person in California who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 became the first in the U.S. to have an identified case of the omicron variant. The state’s Board of Public Works approved an emergency procurement Wednesday to acquire additional special reagents and supplies to further expand the state’s capacity to track and detect variants of the coronavirus. The board also voted to extend the state’s genomic sequencing agreements to track various mutations of the coronavirus with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. Through agreements with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, Maryland is now sequencing at nearly three times the level recommended by public health experts, the governor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts is deploying three mobile units to administer monoclonal antibody treatment to high-risk individuals who have been exposed to or have COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker said. The clinics have the capacity to treat up to 500 patients a week with therapies that can help reduce the severity of the disease and keep COVID-19-positive individuals from being hospitalized. Two of the new mobile units – currently in Fall River and Holyoke – began administering monoclonal antibody treatment to patients last week, according to the administration. A third unit is set to be deployed to Everett on Friday. The mobile clinics will increase access to monoclonal antibody treatment in Massachusetts, according to Baker. The mobile clinics can be relocated based on demand. Referral from a health care provider is required for treatment at any of the three new mobile clinics. Treatment will be provided at no cost to the patient and offered regardless of immigration status or health insurance. Patients should talk to their doctor about whether monoclonal antibody treatment is right for them.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: An 11-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed her father and three other people was released Wednesday from a rehabilitation hospital. “She’s Laney, she’s great and she’s our miracle,” said Christie Perdue of Gaylord, referring to her daughter Laney. Laney was one of five people in a plane that crashed on Beaver Island off Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula on Nov. 13. The family believes Laney survived because her father, Mike, shielded her during the crash. Laney was released from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. “We’ve gone from no walking to a wheelchair to a walker and now to crutches,” Christie Perdue told WOOD-TV. “Her goal was to go home on crutches.” Mike Perdue died, along with the pilot and a couple. The crash is being investigated by a federal transportation agency. “Our community has just surrounded us with love,” Christie Perdue said. “Laney’s getting letters from schools all over Michigan, letters from New York and Minnesota, and we are just so grateful.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Health said it’s not approving anxiety disorders as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana, unlike neighboring North Dakota and three other states. State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said there’s not enough scientific evidence of benefits of medical cannabis use when compared to the possibility of “unintended consequences.” No new conditions will be added to the existing list of 17 qualifying health issues. “We received many comments from health care practitioners treating patients with anxiety disorder, and they urged us to not approve it as a qualifying medical condition,” Malcolm said. North Dakota added anxiety disorders to its accepted uses two years ago, when it immediately became the most commonly cited condition. Minnesota did agree to add infused edibles in the form of gummies and chews to a list of approved products that includes pills, vapor oil, liquids, topicals, powdered mixtures, and orally dissolvable medicines like lozenges. “Expanding delivery methods to gummies and chews will mean more options for patients who cannot tolerate current available forms of medical cannabis,” Malcolm said.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A downtown Tupelo neighborhood has joined the National Register of Historic Places. Advocates learned about the designation in late September, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. The largely residential area includes hundreds of parcels on about 163 acres of land. Chris Grimes, vice president of the Historic Downtown Neighborhood Association, helped organize the effort. Grimes owns a historic home in the newly designated neighborhood that dates to 1870 and will now be able to apply for tax credits for some of the restoration work that’s underway, the Daily Journal reported. He had initially sought National Register designation only for his home, but the Mississippi Department of Archives & History thought other homes should be included, according to the newspaper. Downtown Tupelo and other neighborhoods in the city already have the designation. “Believe it or not, it’s easier to get a neighborhood on the register than it is to get an individual home,” Grimes said. Mississippi has more than 1,300 listings in the register, the nation’s official list of sites, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their significance.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence:The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum was scheduled to reopen with limited hours Thursday. The museum will initially reopen on Thursdays through Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for those who bought advance tickets online. Visitors will be required to wear masks. The museum reopened in July after a two-year renovation project but was closed again in October when COVID-19 cases began to increase in Jackson County. “The pandemic has presented a lot of challenges, but we are prepared and anxious to open our doors to make history come to life for our visitors,” museum Director Kurt Graham said. The nearly $30 million renovation was the most extensive project at the museum since it was built in 1957. It offers more exhibits and artifacts, along with interactive exhibits, and a new layout that walks visitors through Truman’s life from his Missouri childhood through his presidency and his later years.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife workers and volunteers scrambled Wednesday to save trout and other fish stranded by an abrupt drop in water levels on a river that’s renowned among anglers. A malfunctioning gate that lets water out of Hebgen Dam just west of Yellowstone National Park caused flows into the Madison River to plummet early Tuesday, according to dam operator NorthWestern Energy. That left side channels cut off from the main river and some areas with no water. Some fish have died, according to outfitters who provided photos of fish lying on exposed rock beds that normally would be covered with water. More fish are at risk in the cut-off side channels, fly fishing shop owner Kelly Galloup said. Galloup said bigger trout likely moved to deeper pools as water levels dropped. But he expected a significant impact on fish born last year that were too small to escape the sudden drop in flows. There was no immediate estimate of the number of fish stranded, but Galloup said hundreds had been rescued Tuesday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized in Nebraska with the coronavirus continues to climb and reached 555 on Tuesday, which was the highest since last winter. The state said 14% of the hospitalized patients were between the ages of 20 and 44, and doctors at several of Nebraska’s largest hospitals said younger patients have been showing up in intensive care units more often. Although the number of hospitalizations remains well below last fall’s peak of 987, the state’s hospital capacity is strained because hospitals were busy with other patients before COVID-19 cases increased this fall. The state said only 13% of the adult ICU beds and 20% of the pediatric ICU beds were available Tuesday. Dr. Matthew Donahue, the acting state epidemiologist, said unvaccinated Nebraskans are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than people who have been vaccinated. He said the spread of the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant has fueled the rise in cases. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska decreased over the past two weeks, going from about 864 per day on Nov. 15 to about 771 per day on Monday. But the number remains high.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A union for drivers and the operator of metro Reno’s transit bus system said they have reached a tentative agreement to settle a contract dispute that dramatically reduced service during the past three weeks. Officials of Teamsters Local 533 and Keolis International said Tuesday normal service would resume immediately if the agreement is approved by a vote of represented employees later this week. Terms of the proposed settlement were not immediately available. Only a handful of routes ran during the strike, leaving thousands of riders without public transportation. Teamsters 533 President Gary Watson said some issues between the union and Keolis remained unresolved but that union officials were hopeful that those can be resolved in the coming months. Keolis Vice President Mike Ake said the tentative agreement resulted from productive negotiation sessions held over the weekend. The strike began Nov. 9 after the union rejected the “best and last offer” proposed by Keolis, which operates the system for the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter:The 23rd annual Festival of Trees benefitting the Community Children’s Fund kicked off in-person Wednesday morning at the Town Hall after a fully virtual event last year. The event was spread out over two days in an effort to manage the number of visitors. Bidding on the 51 Christmas trees donated and decorated by local businesses was done online. Organizers said they were elated to be able to restart the event in-person at the Town Hall after a year marred by the pandemic. The Christmas trees, all donated by Ace Hardware, feature a variety of goodies for the lucky winners ranging from candy to Guinness beer. Foss Motors has a double donation tree where the dealership will match the buyer’s bid up to $2,000 to be donated to a charity of the buyer’s choosing. And, as always, there is the gift card tree, which features gift certificates from local businesses totaling $2,800.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Republican lawmakers scorned statehouse rules requiring proof of either COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test to enter the building and sought to halt the mandate with a lawsuit. Assembly and Senate Republicans, who are in the minority, sued late Wednesday seeking to stop the requirement and set the stage for a confrontation with law enforcement officials. That’s because both chambers have scheduled votes for the afternoon, when legislators are expected to gather to cast their votes. GOP Assembly member Brian Bergen walked into the statehouse complex unstopped by officials and didn’t show proof required under the policy set by the State Capitol Joint Management Commission, the panel made up of administration and legislative officials that sets rules for the building. “It’s unfair and completely discriminatory policy. they’re essentially creating two classes of people, vaccinated and unvaccinated,” he said in an interview. Legislators who don’t follow the protocol won’t be permitted into the legislative chambers, according to Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin’s spokesperson Kevin McArdle, who added that leaders have spoken with state police and the attorney general’s office.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she will pursue a 7% pay increase for educators and staff at K-12 public schools, as well as higher minimum salaries for teachers at various career stages. The proposal would boost salaries for more than 50,000 public school workers across the state at an annual cost of about $280 million. The Legislature convenes in January to craft a general fund spending plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1. The governor’s office estimated the proposed changes would increase the statewide average for teacher pay to just over $64,000 a year. New Mexico’s minimum teacher salaries would increase to between $50,000 and $70,000, depending on experience and certifications. Current minimums ranging from $41,000 to $60,000 were set in 2019. The proposed changes would bring New Mexico roughly in line with the recent national average for teacher pay of about $64,000.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The holly, jolly, best time of the year got a light-filled launch Wednesday, when the towering Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center was officially turned on. The 79-foot Norway spruce, covered with more than 50,000 lights in a rainbow of colors and bearing a crystal-covered, 900-pound star, was lit in a midtown Manhattan ceremony again open to the public, in contrast with last year’s virus-impacted event. The lighting was televised on NBC and hosted by NBC “Today” anchors Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Craig Melvin. Among the musical performances were Harry Connick Jr., Norah Jones, Brad Paisley and Alessia Cara. The high-kicking Radio City Rockettes were also part of the celebration. This year’s tree came from Elkton, Maryland, where it stood for more than 80 years outside a family home. The first Christmas tree was placed in Rockefeller Center by men working there in 1931.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed legislation that would bar officials from counting mail-in absentee ballots received after Election Day, even if their envelopes were postmarked on or before that date. Cooper’s veto was expected, given that Republicans pushed through the measure on party lines. Any GOP attempt to override his veto also is likely to fail given that Republicans majorities in both the House and Senate aren’t veto-proof. Republicans haven’t overturned any of Cooper’s previous 12 vetoes this year. Current law says envelopes postmarked by the day of the primary or general election can count if they are received within a three-day grace period. Republicans insist the bill would boost confidence in election outcomes by the public and help the media call results more quickly.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Gov. Doug Burgum said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has granted his request for another extension of the hours of service waiver for drivers of commercial vehicles transporting water and livestock feed to help North Dakota livestock producers affected by continuing drought conditions. Burgum first granted a similar 30-day waiver in an executive order Sept. 22, and the FMCSA previously extended the waiver through Nov. 23. Under the new extension, the waiver will remain in effect through Dec. 24 or until the end of the emergency, whichever is earlier. Thursday’s U.S. Drought Monitor report showed 9% of North Dakota remains in extreme drought, mostly in the northwest corner, 33% is in severe drought, 30% is in moderate drought and 21% is rated as abnormally dry.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund is asking lawmakers to boost the required employer contribution rates to the retirement system. The fund is backing legislation that would increase employer contribution rates to 26.5% of payroll for police and firefighters, up from 19.5% and 24%, respectively. An estimate for how much that would cost Ohio’s 900 local police and fire departments was not immediately available. “I think that the employers, mayors, etc, understand the essential nature of recruiting and retaining public safety officers – not just through COVID but we’ve had a lot of social unrest,” said fund Director Mary Beth Foley. “So we need them and they need a defined benefit plan that they can rely upon, they need disability benefits to be ensured.” The employer contribution was last increased in 1986. Foley said the goal is to move legislation, which has yet to be introduced, through the House and Senate by December 2022. Over the past eight years, employee contribution rates increased by 2.25% to 12.25% and retirees have been forced to pay more for health care benefits.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A human skull found in southwestern Oklahoma 16 years ago has been identified as that of a missing Muskogee woman, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. The skull is that of Rebecca Jean Boyd, who was 29 when she disappeared in 2002, the OSBI said. The skull, found in a field by a farmer in Kiowa County in July 2005, was known only as Kiowa Jane Doe. “We are happy that Rebecca’s family has her back and can give her the proper burial that she deserves,” said OSBI Director Ricky Adams. “Now our Cold Case Unit is going to determine how she ended up in that field and who is responsible.” No other remains have been found and a suspected cause of death has not been determined, according to OSBI spokeswoman Brook Arbeitman. “We have a lot of questions that need to be answered,” Arbeitman said. “The first step was to get her identified.” Arbeitman said Boyd was visiting relatives in Lawton when she was last seen on July 26, 2002. Boyd was reported missing four days later and was identified when the skull matched a DNA profile of Boyd that had been entered into a national missing persons database.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A Canadian energy company canceled a controversial natural gas pipeline and marine export terminal on the southern Oregon coast after failing to obtain all necessary state permits. Opponents of the Jordan Cove project, which would have created the first liquefied natural gas export terminal on the West Coast in the lower 48 states, rejoiced at the news. The marine export terminal would have been located at Coos Bay, with a 230-mile feeder pipeline crossing southern Oregon. Many landowners, Indian tribes and environmentalists had objected, saying the project by Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corp. could spoil the environment and would have contributed to global warming by producing greenhouse gases. In 2019, protesters filled the Oregon State Capitol and occupied the governor’s office until they were hauled away by state police. Supporters of the project to ship U.S. and Canadian natural gas to Asia said it would create jobs and help the economy. The Coos Bay City Council last year approved dredging part of the bay to increase the width and depth of the shipping channel. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the project in March 2020. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown threatened to go to court to stop the project if it didn’t obtain every permit required from state and local agencies. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality denied a water quality certification for the project, and the Department of State Lands refused to grant another extension to Pembina to file documents in its application for a permit to dredge sediment out of Coos Bay.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: TV stations in Philadelphia, New York City and Cleveland said they are taking down the “Dr. Oz Show,” now that the show’s host, Mehmet Oz, has formally become a candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. The stations were compelled by the Federal Communications Commission’s “equal time” rules that give rival candidates the ability to request matching air time. Oz, 61, will bring his unrivaled name recognition and wealth to a wide-open race that is expected to be among the nation’s most competitive and could determine control of the Senate in next year’s election. This is the celebrity heart surgeon’s first run for public office, but he is facing a crowded Republican primary. The longtime New Jersey resident said he moved to Pennsylvania a year ago.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: An animal shelter has tripled the reward it is offering to $15,500 for help identifying the people who abandoned two dogs found by the side of a road in Portsmouth on Thanksgiving morning. The Potter League for Animals is offering the reward for information about the people who left the two female dogs, WPRI-TV reported. Police said the dogs appeared to be “lethargic and emaciated,” when they were found near a sports complex. They were treated by an emergency veterinarian. One of the dogs had to be euthanized because of her poor health, police said. The animal shelter initially offered a $5,000 reward but contributions from anonymous donors increased the amount of the reward, the station reported. Anyone with information can call Portsmouth police.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Laura Cantral, the executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, one of South Carolina’s most influential environmental groups, is stepping down, prompting a nationwide search for her replacement. Cantral is leaving at the end of December, the organization said in a Wednesday news release. Cantral took over the organization four years ago after the Conservation League’s founder and longtime leader Dana Beach stepped down. The group has worked to oppose offshore drilling, preserve fragile coastal ecosystems against development and advocate to protect other natural resources along the state’s coast. The organization said Cantral is departing for personal family reasons and will move to Atlanta next year. The group’s board of directors will begin searching for a replacement in the coming weeks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWagner:Wagner High School principal and activities director Neil Goster, who was accused of making racist comments toward Native Americans last summer, resigned more than two weeks ago, along with his wife, Cindy, who was a fourth-grade teacher. In a special school board meeting in Wagner two weeks ago, the Goters’ resignations from the Wagner Community School District were accepted by the board in a 5-0 vote. Two board members were absent at the time of the vote. Local residents called on Neil Goter to resign in July and August after LaJuanda Stands and Looks Back alleged in a formal letter that Goter made racist comments to her and other Indigenous people in the town on the Yankton Sioux Reservation. Stands and Looks Back alleged that on July 24, Goter told her and a group of Native American women at a golf course that “my face is so red, I must be Native American.” She was told administrative action was taken by the district after her allegations, but it’s unknown what action was made. According to the Department of Education’s Teacher 411 webpage, Neil and Cindy Goter’s teaching certificates are still active until July 2026. Superintendent Matt Yost would not comment on the story when reached by the Argus Leader. Attempts to reach both Neil and Cindy Goter at their listed phone numbers and email addresses were unsuccessful.\n\nTennessee\n\nSewanee: Reuben Brigety, the University of the South’s vice chancellor and president, said he will resign later this month and would accept a position as U.S. ambassador to South Africa if offered. In a letter Wednesday, Brigety said he decided to leave the post Dec. 21. He wrote that he would accept a nomination for the ambassador job if President Joe Biden nominates him, saying news reports have indicated Biden intends to do so. Brigety, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union, said “it would be unfair to prolong any uncertainty at the University.” The White House has not yet announced a nomination. Additionally, the role requires Senate confirmation. “I have been profoundly honored to serve as the 17th vice-chancellor of the University of the South, and I had expected to serve Sewanee for a long time to come,” Brigety wrote. “Yet I also know that I would not decline my obligation to serve my country if asked by the president of the United States.” Brigety took office in June 2020 as the first African American vice chancellor at the university also known as Sewanee. He previously served as dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An appeals court halted a federal judge’s order that stopped Texas from enforcing its ban on mask mandates in the state’s schools, allowing the prohibition to remain in effect. In a 15-page ruling, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a request by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to stay the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel. The appeals court on Nov. 24 had granted an administrative stay while it issued a formal ruling on Paxton’s request. The 5th Circuit’s ruling on Wednesday means Yeakel’s decision will be on hold while the case goes through the appeals process. The appeals court will ultimately issue a final ruling on his order. The federal judge ruled on Nov. 10 that the ban ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott through an executive order violated a federal law protecting disabled students’ access to public education. The nonprofit advocacy group Disability Rights Texas, which had filed the lawsuit that prompted Yeakel’s ruling, argued Abbott’s ban prohibited accommodations for disabled children particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. In granting the stay, the appeals court said that Paxton would likely win in his appeal, the students represented by Disability Rights Texas likely do not have standing to challenge the ban and the students and the group had not exhausted all remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that makes available a free public education to eligible U.S. children with disabilities.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Nate Brooksby was selected as the Washington County sheriff after the local Republican Party gathered in a special election to decide who would replace Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, who retired because of health problems. Brooksby, who had been the department’s chief deputy, beat out Jared Redfearn with 106 out of 140 votes. The position opened outside of the regular election cycle after Pulsipher announced he would be retiring effective Wednesday. This isn’t the only change in the department leadership, as Undersheriff James Standley also retired this fall. After Standley left the department, Brooksby was appointed to replace him as undersheriff by Pulsipher so Brooksby would be “brought up to speed” on the department’s budget and projects, according to a press release.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: More than 300 Vermont National Guard soldiers are beginning to return to the state, many after nearly a year deployed overseas. The first of the soldiers returned on Wednesday. All are scheduled to be home by Dec. 10. The 172nd Law Enforcement Detachment deployed in January 2021 to support the U.S. Europe Command. Soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 172nd Infantry (Mountain) departed in February for the U.S. Central Command. The two units were the first of several to deploy throughout the first half of 2021, with a total of more than 950 Vermonters deploying to various locations across Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia. The soldiers of the the law enforcement detachment operated as the primary law enforcement element on Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base in Romania. The soldiers from the 3rd Battalion participated in a variety of missions, including assisting with security at the Kabul during the August evacuations from Afghanistan.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia has launched a new system to improve the response to mental health emergencies. The Marcus Alert system launched Wednesday in five regions in the state, news outlets reported. The system is named for Marcus-David Peters, who was fatally shot in 2018 by police after he charged an officer amid a behavioral health crisis. It will start as a pilot program in Richmond, Virginia Beach, Prince William County, Bristol and adjacent Washington County, and five counties in the northern Piedmont. It must expand to all parts of the state by July 1, 2026. It’s part of a rollout of new services financed by Virginia’s Medicaid program to help people in behavioral crises in their communities to avoid sending them to state mental hospitals, private emergency rooms and juvenile detention centers. The system aims to use regional call centers to alert mental health teams to potential psychiatric emergencies, quickly assess risks and dispatch professionals to help the person in crisis by persuasion instead of force.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state Sen. Keith Wagoner said he plans to challenge newly appointed Democratic Secretary of State Steve Hobbs in next year’s election. Hobbs was sworn into office Nov. 22 following his appointment by Gov. Jay Inslee to replace Kim Wyman, a Republican. Wyman – the fifth consecutive GOP secretary of state in Washington dating to 1965 – resigned to take a key election security job in the Biden administration. Wagoner said voters have long shown a preference for a Republican secretary of state and Inslee failed to recognize that by naming Hobbs, who was a Democratic state senator since 2007. Hobbs’ appointment lasts until the November 2022 election, which will determine who serves the remaining two years of Wyman’s four-year term. Hobbs said he plans to enter that race.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Union maintenance and service workers at Cabell Huntington Hospital ratified a contract late Wednesday to end a month-old strike, the hospital announced. Members of the Service Employees International Union District 119 ratified the three-year contract covering more than 900 workers at the hospital, which said in a statement that employees could likely begin returning to work as soon as Friday. The statement did not disclose details of the contract, which Dr. Kevin Yingling, the hospital’s president, called “fair and equitable.” Under an earlier offer, the hospital had asked union members to begin paying health insurance premiums. “We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said hospital Chief Operating Officer Tim Martin. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:FPC Live, a division of Madison-based Frank Productions and one of the world's largest concert promoters, announced plans to operate a built-from-scratch music venue in the Historic Third Ward, adjacent to the southern end of Maier Festival Park. Actually, it would be two venues – an 800-person-capacity room and a 4,000-person- capacity room – with separate entrances, both housed in the same 108,000-square-foot facility. Pending approvals, including from the Historic Third Ward Architectural Review Board and the City of Milwaukee Board of Harbor Commissioners, construction on the venue could begin in early 2022 and would open in the second half of 2023. The new concert venue would be the latest in Milwaukee's entertainment-building boom. The Milwaukee Bucks' Fiserv Forum, constructed for $524 million, opened in 2018. This year saw the openings of the Bradley Symphony Center, following a $90 million renovation of the Warner Grand Theatre, and the reopening of Summerfest's American Family Insurance Amphitheater after a $51.3 million upgrade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon made state District Court judge John G. Fenn his first appointment to the state Supreme Court. Fenn has served on the Fourth Judicial District bench for Johnson and Sheridan counties since 2007. He previously was an attorney in private practice in Sheridan for 13 years. Fenn’s experience as a judge has earned him respect in Wyoming’s legal community, Gordon said in a statement Thursday. “He has shown himself to be keenly aware of the impact of Wyoming Supreme Court decisions, not only on the law, but also with particular attention to the consequences for the individuals involved in these cases,” Gordon said. Fenn replaces Justice Michael Davis, who is retiring, and will begin on the state high court on Jan. 17. Fenn is a graduate of Big Piney High School and holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. He helped develop Wyoming’s new Chancery Court created by legislation signed by Gordon in 2019, according to the governor’s office.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/31/pumpkin-boat-foie-gras-ban-library-raccoons-news-around-states/40513379/", "title": "Pumpkin boat, foie gras ban: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: A new facility has opened with the aim of reducing poverty and its effects on families. The Shoals Dream Center is envisioned as a hub for an array of services to aid the area’s families, The TimesDaily reports. Among them: providing food; academic tutoring and mentoring for at-risk kids. The center also plans to offer addiction recovery resources and life skills training. The Shoals Dream Center is an extension of the Chapel church. The social services components will offer after-school programs where students can engage in learning and developmental training, activities, and games three days per week, says Toyia Gourley, director of the Dream Center Academy. The food distribution is set up in the style of a supermarket, the newspaper reports.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The state agency overseeing air quality has agreed to submit a cleanup plan by mid-December for this city that has some of the nation’s most polluted winter air. A federal court judge, as part of a lawsuit, approved an agreement that set the deadline for the cleanup plan to be submitted by the state Department of Environmental Conservation to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Judge Thomas Zilly also approved a mid-January deadline for the EPA to make sure the plan complete. Clean air advocates sued in December, saying the state failed to submit a legally compliant plan to address particulate pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and other sources. Fine particulate is a pollutant that can cause heart and lung problems.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has announced it is changing its abbreviation from UA to UArizona in an effort to increase search engine optimization results for the college. The Tucson-based college in a statement Monday said the change would help distinguish the school from other national and international entities that use UA, including the University of Alabama, Under Armour and United Airlines. Officials say the southern Arizona school was not appearing high on Google results for “UA.” University officials say the college will now use UArizona for its communications. The college had already changed its Twitter handle to @uarizona. Officials say there are not yet any plans to use the new abbreviation on college merchandise or in chants at sporting events.\n\nArkansas\n\nJonesboro: An Arkansas State University alumnus says he was surprised to spot a few curious critters running around the campus library. Codie Clark, a math tutor, says he spotted at least two raccoons Sunday on the third floor of the university’s Dean B. Ellis Library while waiting for a student to arrive for a tutoring session. Clark says other students then cornered one raccoon. Associate Vice Chancellor for Marketing and Communications Bill Smith told KAIT-TV that the school’s facility management personnel humanely trapped the animals after being notified by library staff. Clark says an animal rescuer released the racoons back into the wild that night. Smith noted the raccoons likely came to campus because of recent rain. He encouraged anyone who encounters wild animals to contact the Facilities Management Department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some of the country’s largest ride-sharing companies proposed a state law Tuesday that would let them continue to treat drivers as independent contractors while also guaranteeing them a minimum wage and money for health insurance. The Legislature enacted legislation this year requiring such companies to treat drivers as employees, which would let them form a union and entitle them to benefits. But the law proposed Tuesday would exempt ride-sharing companies. The proposal must be approved by voters. If passed, it would supersede the Legislature’s action and any similar ordinances by local governments. It also would prevent lawmakers from passing another law to block it. The proposal will only get on the November 2020 ballot if supporters can gather about 660,000 signatures. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have already pledged $90 million to support the effort, making it one of the most expensive ballot measures ever.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Hundreds of state employees have prepared to have their emails eliminated to remove access to government records that would otherwise be public. The Denver Post reports the affected employees work for the Department of Regulatory Agencies, which regulates state industries including insurance, banks, electric utilities and real estate. Officials say the department’s 600 employees were notified multiple times of the upcoming purge set to begin Friday. Department officials say employees were instructed to preserve any vital emails, including pending litigation or existing open records requests. Officials say the purge is to ensure department emails are easily searchable. Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition says deletion of electronic records is a major problem for those seeking information. Colorado law gives state departments broad discretion in crafting their record-keeping policies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed an executive order that creates an entity charged with coming up with a plan for better coordination between state government agencies and the business community. The Democrat says he has a goal of transforming a workforce development system that’s currently designed to meet the needs of 20th-century jobs into one that serves 21st-century jobs. He says the state’s education and training system today is “too static and disconnected,” and there’s a need for better collaboration with business and labor so Connecticut’s teachers know what skills to teach. Lamont announced the creation of the Governor’s Workforce Council at Naugatuck Community College on Tuesday.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal magistrate is recommending dismissal of a lawsuit against Delaware State University officials by a woman who says she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student. The magistrate ruled Tuesday that the revised lawsuit by Mai-Ajah Keel is time-barred and that Keel has failed to state a claim. Keel says after she reported the assault in 2013, she was met with deliberate indifference by school officials and harassment and retaliation by her alleged attacker and other students. Keel’s alleged attacker, Jason Faustin, was charged in 2015 with fourth-degree rape. The charges were later dropped, but Faustin was suspended from campus after a school panel found him “responsible” for sexual assault. Faustin later served as an intern in the Dover office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: There was glam; there were costumes; there were high heels and a race. In a D.C. tradition that has made a statement since the 1980s, the 33rd Annual 17th Street High Heel Race took off Tuesday evening with a parade and race near Dupont Circle, WUSA-TV reports. The event is the district’s second-largest annual LGBTQ community event, filled with cheer as costumed drag queens and other participants race down the street. It was originally started by a group of 25 drag queens who decided to sprint down the road and strut their stuff. This year, the event brought out thousands of residents and visitors to join in on the fun. Even Mayor Muriel Bowser made an appearance at the event, serving as the grand marshal to kick off the celebration.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A memorial for the Pulse nightclub massacre will have a reflecting pool with rainbow-colored lines radiating from it, and a nearby museum will resemble a three-dimensional spirograph, according to design concepts announced Wednesday. Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub in June 2016. It was the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history until a gunman opened fire on Las Vegas concertgoers in 2017. The design concepts are only a starting point for discussions on the Pulse memorial and museum and are open to revisions, according to organizers. The designs were produced by several French architects and artists who worked with an Orlando architectural firm and a DePaul University professor. Plans call for the memorial to feature a garden with 49 trees in honor of the victims who were killed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials are moving forward with plans for some new parks in the city. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that the City Council last week approved the purchase of land from The Conservation Fund for a park in the Home Park neighborhood. The city will buy the land for a little more than $200,000. City officials also approved funding to purchase two properties for the $40 million Rodney Cook Sr. Park currently under construction in the Vine City neighborhood. The AJC says the park will feature 18 sculptures memorializing civil rights heroes, including Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Big Island neighborhood that was ravaged by the 2018 Kilauea volcano eruption has become a destination for tourists wanting to get a look at the damage caused by one of the largest eruptions in the volcano’s recent history. But the Hawaii Tribune Herald reports residents of the Leilani Estates neighborhood consider the visitors a nuisance and are relieved to see interest beginning to wane. Tourism increased as residents were trying to return to their homes and property after being forced to evacuate. More than 700 homes were destroyed. Leilani Estates Community Association president Andy Andrews says the number of tourists has fallen significantly since earlier this year, and there are fewer confrontations between locals and visitors, who he says ignore warning signs and parking rules.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Latino students make up 18% of the enrollment in the state’s public schools, but their achievement scores continue to lag state averages. The Idaho Statesman reports researchers and state officials say improving Latino students’ outcomes is an urgent need because of their importance to the state’s workforce. The Idaho Department of Education has set long-term goals to improve Latino outcomes. However, the department has left strategy for reaching those goals to districts and schools with little success in two years. Latino students are recording lower-than-average test scores and fewer postsecondary degrees. Rod Gramer, the CEO of Idaho Business for education, says if the Latino students are not successful, Idaho is not going to be successful.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s teachers union voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with city officials Wednesday but refused to end a strike that has canceled two weeks of classes unless the mayor adds school days to cover that lost time. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday night that she would not meet that demand. Lightfoot accused the union’s top leadership of “moving the goal posts” by raising the issue Wednesday rather than in a face-to-face meeting with her Tuesday. “Not once during that three-and-a-half-hour meeting did they raise compensation for strike days,” Lightfoot said heatedly. Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said it would require cutting winter or spring break days or adding days to the end of the year. Union President Jesse Sharkey said the teachers are not asking to be paid for a strike but do credit the walkout for forcing the district to compromise on some contract issues.\n\nIndiana\n\nSeymour: John Mellencamp, the subject of a new mural in his hometown, endorsed the project by adding a few significant brushstrokes Tuesday afternoon. Indiana rock star Mellencamp painted his initials, “JJM,” on the exterior of a music store in Seymour, the community he immortalized in 1985 hit “Small Town.” Artist Pamela Bliss says Mellencamp was reserved and appreciative during his surprise visit, but he also flashed his signature ornery demeanor when Bliss offered a small paintbrush after he agreed to sign the work. “He said, ‘You call that a (expletive) brush? Give me another one,’ ” Bliss said, laughing. “I got a little piece of the real John right there.” Bliss says she’s a fan of Mellencamp’s paintings, some of which are currently on display at the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts in Seymour and at ACA Galleries in New York City.\n\nIowa\n\nWaukee: Authorities are investigating another explosion at a gender reveal party that happened one day after a blast at a similar gathering killed a 56-year-old woman in a nearby community. Authorities say no one was injured in the explosion Sunday in rural Waukee, a Des Moines suburb, but they are looking into unconfirmed claims that the blast broke a neighbor’s windows. Waukee Fire Capt. Tomme Tysdal says the Waukee explosion came from a commercially available gender reveal kit, unlike the homemade device that killed Pamela Kreimeyer on Saturday near Knoxville, a town 45 miles away. Authorities say Kreimeyer died instantly when her family’s device exploded, hitting her in the head from 45 feet away.\n\nKansas\n\nDodge City: A monkey that was injured last month trying to protect his offspring from being taken by an intruder during an apparent break-in at a zoo has died. Officials at the Wright Park Zoo say the 32-year-old tufted capuchin monkey was found unresponsive early Tuesday. City spokeswoman Abbey Martin says the zoo’s veterinarian was unable to revive the monkey, named Vern. The Hutchinson News reports a necropsy will be done to determine the cause of death. Vern underwent surgery for broken bones after the Sept. 3 break-in. A younger monkey named Pickett was found loose within the city limits and returned to the zoo. Vern and a female monkey named Charro arrived at the zoo in 1988. Their two youngest sons, Jack and Pickett, are part of the zoo’s current capuchin troop.\n\nKentucky\n\nMurray: Murray State University students are using GPS devices to track box turtles and learn about the technology’s value. Assistant wildlife biology professor Andrea Darracq says students work in the classroom to build the tracking devices and go into the field at an off-campus university property to locate the turtles. The university says the turtles are tracked with the GPS devices and a transmitter, allowing the students to determine a turtle’s location with a receiver and compare it to more precise GPS readings. The school says the capturing and marking of turtles was done with approval from its Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee and a state educational wildlife collection permit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A $2.1 million research project at Tulane University is aimed at helping members of an American Indian tribe cope with climate change and economic inequality. In a news release, Tulane says the project aims to benefit the United Houma Nation. Challenges facing the south Louisiana tribe include coastal land loss that threatens fishing, trapping and even some homes. Part of the project will involve examining how tribal citizens move within and outside the state to manage these and other challenges. Tulane’s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine was awarded the project by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s Gulf Research Program.\n\nMaine\n\nGardiner: It looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and – if it gets a prosthetic leg – will once again walk like a duck. Loni Hamner, of Gardiner, recently adopted a female Mallard duck that was left with one leg and a stump after being attacked by a fox last year. Hamner says the duck she’s named Faith can hop and hobble around, but she wants her “to have a good duck quality of life and do all the things ducks like to do.” The Bangor Daily News reports that a query on the Maine Poultry Connection Facebook page led Hamner to the University of Maine Advanced Structure and Composites Center. Lab manager Paul Bussiere says he’ll create a prosthetic leg for Faith for free in his spare time.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Exelon Corp., the energy company that runs the Conowingo Dam, will invest more than $200 million in environmental projects, according to an agreement announced Tuesday by Gov. Larry Hogan. Officials have been focusing on how to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials also are concerned that sediment buildup behind the dam’s walls could be released and wreak havoc on the fragile Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The money in the proposed settlement will be used to improve water quality in the Lower Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, the nation’s largest estuary, Hogan said. Parts of the agreement will be submitted for approval to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as part of the licensing renewal for the dam.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCarver: The cranberry industry is looking to solar power for relief as it struggles with plummeting fruit prices. Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts, the nation’s second-largest grower after Wisconsin, are proposing to build solar panels above their bogs. Jordan Macknick, an analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, says the novel approach to blending solar production with crop cultivation is being researched but hasn’t been tried before on a large scale anywhere in the world. Michael Wainio, a Massachusetts cranberry farmer proposing one of the projects, says revenue from solar power is essential to maintaining his family’s farm near Cape Cod. University of Massachusetts researchers have launched a study to examine the idea. Opponents argue there would be long-term environmental consequences.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The funeral for John Conyers, who served more than 50 years in Congress, will be held Monday at a church in the city. The public will get a chance to show their respect for Conyers on Saturday and Sunday at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Conyers died Sunday at age 90, two years after resigning from the U.S. House. Monica Conyers tells The Detroit News that her husband’s funeral will be held at Greater Grace Temple. She anticipates former President Bill Clinton will attend, along with elected officials. On Twitter, Clinton called Conyers a “champion for justice & equality.” Conyers was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and is credited with creating the federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Data show that the University of Minnesota’s 2019 freshmen class is the biggest in 50 years and includes the most students of color in the school’s history. The Minnesota Daily reports the Office of Institutional Research’s numbers reveal that most freshmen – about 54% – are female. In 2010, 18% of the freshman class was students of color. Now, minority students make up more than a quarter of this year’s class. Vice provost and dean of the school’s Office of Undergraduate Education Bob McMaster says part of the rise is due to changes in Minnesota high schools, which have seen demographic shifts in recent years. Still, the number of black students remains relatively small. About 5% of new students are black, up slightly from over 4% a decade ago.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With the nationwide closure of Fred’s Pharmacy, one county is taking it really hard. The residents of Kemper County in east-central Mississippi now find themselves without any pharmacy in the entire county. Residents will have to place and pick up prescriptions at pharmacies in Meridian or Philadelphia – about a 30-minute drive to each one. Mississippi Board of Pharmacy President Ryan Harper says that will be an issue for some of the state’s most critical patients. He says patients on multiple prescriptions also usually have a huge hurdle of having access to reliable transportation. Fred’s closed Oct. 18. It was located in the county seat, Dekalb, with a population of just over 1,000 residents.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The mayor is proposing an ordinance aimed at helping police keep firearms away from those with a history of domestic violence. The Kansas Star reports that the ordinance Quinton Lucas unveiled Wednesday would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists, but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases. Lucas and his staff wrote the proposal with help from the Rose Brooks Center, a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Shelter victim advocate Annie Struby says more than half of the most dangerous domestic abusers in Kansas City have access to firearms.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has spent more than $2 million on snow plowing so far this year, surpassing what costs were by this date for the past two years. The Independent Record reports snow plowing costs for the state Department of Transportation increased by more than 250% since last year. Department officials say they spent $575,577 from July 1 to Oct. 28 last year and $544,872 during the same period in 2017. Officials say record snowstorms have hit large regions just days into the fall season, breaking decades­long snowfall records in cities like Great Falls. Officials say about 277,800 miles have been plowed so far this season. Only a quarter of that was plowed this time last year. Officials say costs include labor, operating equipment and materials.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Officials have begun the process to get the city’s downtown placed on the National Register of Historic Places. City officials convened an open house Monday to review the federal and state historic-district guidelines with members of an Omaha planning firm and the Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office. Omaha-based RDG will prepare North Platte’s nomination papers. Stephanie Rose, an urban planner for the firm, says residents are welcome to share their thoughts and historic information with her over the coming months. If the U.S. National Park Service adds downtown North Platte to the register, buildings that are at least 50 years old within the district could qualify for federal and state historic tax credits to help pay for rehabilitation projects.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s casinos took in nearly $1.06 billion in winnings last month – a high for 2019 and a record for September in a key index of state fiscal health. Nevada Gaming Control Board analyst Michael Lawton attributes Wednesday’s healthy “gaming win” report to an increase in slot machine play and results from Las Vegas Strip and Clark County casinos. Lawton says a 6.8% increase in the monthly figure compared with the same month a year ago was the fourth straight increase in the year-to-year comparison. The state took in almost $66.4 million in taxes on the September 2019 figures. The $1.059 billion tally topped the previous September best of $1.058 billion in 2007 by just $100,000. October 2007 was the best month ever for casino winnings, at $1.165 billion.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University System of New Hampshire has announced that tuition for in-state students will be frozen in place for the 2020-2021 academic year. The Concord Monitor reports that the state board of trustees announced Tuesday that it had unanimously voted to freeze tuition for undergraduate students. The freeze will go into effect for students at the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College and Granite State College. The New Hampshire House recently increased the state’s appropriation to the university system by $12 million over two years to freeze tuition. Gov. Chris Sununu called the announcement a “big win for New Hampshire students.” This is the system’s first tuition freeze since 2013.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodbridge: A small plane crashed through the roof of a home Tuesday, killing the pilot and causing an explosion that set two houses ablaze in a New Jersey suburb of New York City. No one was in the home in which the Cessna 414 crashed, but flames spread to another house, where a woman escaped injury, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac said. The plane went down about 11 a.m. not far from an elementary school, according to National Transportation Safety Board investigator Adam Gerhardt. The crash sent flames into the air, belched smoke for hours and left neighbors thinking the earth was shaking. Gerhardt said the pilot was flying using instrument flight rules typically used by experienced pilots when flying with reduced visibility. The weather in the area was cloudy and misty at the time of the crash.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. House has approved legislation that would prohibit oil and gas development on federal land surrounding a national park held sacred by numerous Native American tribes. The vote came Wednesday to make permanent a buffer around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico says there are some areas where drilling should not take place, and the area around Chaco is one of them. Aside from prohibiting new permits and canceling any existing nonproducing leases, the measure suggests additional studies and protective measures should be taken to address health, safety and environmental effects on nearby communities and tribal interests. The area includes land belonging to the Navajo Nation and individual tribal members. The legislation does not affect those parcels.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that bans restaurants and grocery stores from selling foie gras, the fattened liver of a duck or goose, considered a culinary delicacy for centuries. The bill, expected to be signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, would forbid the sale of the French specialty starting in 2022. Animal welfare activists had campaigned for a ban on the grounds that the methods used to produce foie gras are cruel, involving force-feeding a bird a corn-based mixture through a tube slipped down its throat. Farmers who produce foie gras – meaning fatty liver in French – say the birds are treated humanely and don’t suffer during the fattening process. The council vote was 42-6 for the final version of the bill that calls for a fine of up to $2,000 for each violation. With about 1,000 New York restaurants offering foie gras, top chefs did not take kindly to the news, including Momofuku’s David Chang, who called it “idiocracy.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSpencer: The state has received a federal grant to renovate a 1920s rail car that was built to comply with the racist Jim Crow laws of the 20th century. State officials say the National Park Service awarded a grant of more than $287,000 to renovate the railroad car that’s now at the N.C. Transportation Museum in Spencer. The 44-seat coach hasn’t been used since 1969. The car has 22 seats in the rear that were designated for African Americans so that it complied with segregation laws. It needs extensive renovation, including asbestos removal. The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources says it’s one of few such cars held by a museum for public viewing. Another one is at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor is retracting an audit critical of the city of Williston after officials provided more information to the state. Auditor Josh Gallion issued the audit report Monday but retracted it late Tuesday. Gallion says the audit “highlighted several areas of concern,” including a violation of the state’s open meetings law and $92 million in airport contracts that were not disclosed in financial statements. Gallion says the city auditor signed off on the report last week. But Gallion says the city has now provided more information for review. Gallion says auditors are reviewing the new information and will issue a revised audit later.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A federal civil rights lawsuit says a 10-year-old Muslim boy was questioned about his patriotism and religious beliefs by a student teacher at a school outside Cleveland and was ordered to undress to determine whether his parents had abused him. The lawsuit filed last week says the boy’s teacher, the student teacher and a nurse for the Lakeview Local School District in Cortland held him against his will in a room last November and coerced him into saying he’d been disciplined by his mother with a belt. Family attorney Matthew Abens says a county children’s services investigation quickly determined there was no wrongdoing by his parents. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the boy is being treated for trauma.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials say the frequency of congenital syphilis cases has risen sharply in the state during the past five years and continues to increase. The Oklahoma Department of Health said Tuesday that the state has experienced a 283% increase in the number of congenital syphilis cases among women since 2014 and a 92% increase since last year. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact, but health officials say congenital syphilis can be transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, birth defects and death. Officials say health care providers should test pregnant women for the disease early in their pregnancy and again early in the third trimester.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The number of wolves in the state is growing, but not particularly fast. State biologists tallied a minimum of 124 wolves statewide last year, according to the annual wolf report released Wednesday. The number represented an 11% increase over the previous year, but only a growth of 14 animals since 2015. Four wolves were killed illegally in 2017, and another five were killed due to conflict with livestock. Wolves continued to expand their territory. A pair of resident wolves were documented in the Mount Hood area for the first time, meaning the apex predator has a foothold in every region of the state except the coast. Oregon is home to at least 12 wolf packs, according to the report, including 11 that have a breeding male and female with at least two pups that survived the winter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBethlehem: A prosecutor says he will recommend dismissal of charges against a woman authorities say handed her 1-month-old baby to a bus driver and walked away in tears. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Wednesday that 26-year-old Ashley Walters “clearly has some mental health issues.” He said she had displayed combative and erratic behavior and would be involuntarily committed for treatment. Walters was charged with child endangerment after authorities said she boarded a bus in Bethlehem, placed her son on the farebox and told the driver to call police because “this was her son that she can’t take care of.” Pennsylvania’s Safe Haven Law allows babies up to 28 days old to be left at a hospital or police station. Morganelli says Walters’ baby was 32 days old.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city has come up with what it calls a “climate justice plan” to reduce its carbon footprint while accounting for the needs of low-income and minority neighborhoods. The plan unveiled Friday by the city’s Office of Sustainability and Racial and Environmental Justice Committee includes getting 100% of municipal buildings’ electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and making all city vehicles and school buses run on renewable energy by 2040. Priorities outlined in the 88-page plan include planting more trees and expanding green spaces; investing in bike paths, trails and sidewalk improvements; and eliminating food waste. The plan says neighborhoods with the largest populations of people of color and lowest median incomes have the most pollution, the severe health effects from environmental causes, and the least amount of green space.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Environmental groups are taking steps toward suing a company they say is responsible for polluting the state’s waters with tiny plastic beads. News outlets report the groups represented by Southern Environmental Law Center sent Frontier Logistics a 60-day legal notice Monday on grounds it violated the Clean Water Act. The state environmental control department cited Frontier in July after the plastic bits, called nurdles, were found in its facility and thought to be the same ones spilled onto Sullivan’s Island. Environmental groups say they’re still washing up. But Frontier’s vice president contends the nurdles can’t be traced to it. An environmental control spokeswoman said Frontier installed preventative measures, so the agency closed the matter. The pellets are turned into plastic products, and environmentalists say marine animals mistake them for food.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: University leaders tell state lawmakers they’re working to implement a new law aimed at ensuring free speech and intellectual diversity on campus. A legislative committee summoned regents and university presidents to a meeting Wednesday to detail their efforts to comply with the law. Its passage last spring came after controversy over a “Hawaiian Day” party theme at the University of South Dakota revived conservative lawmakers’ complaints about political correctness on campus. The university presidents said they’re holding trainings for students and faculty on protecting speech. They say they’re also working to gauge students’ experiences on campus. The Board of Regents is required to give a written report on its implementation of the law by Dec. 1.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: You’ve heard of a pumpkin being turned into a carriage, but what about into a boat? Justin Ownby has tried for years to grow the perfect giant pumpkin, with limited success. This year, though, he outdid himself. “We’ve pumpkin spiced everything else; why not pumpkin spice a boat?” he said. Ownby, 36, owns a family farm in Cleveland with his wife, Christin, 32, and their four children. A massive pumpkin in his patch grew to more than 900 pounds and several feet across this year, big enough to carve out space for a grown man to sit inside it and paddle across a pond – before it sank under him. “It’s fish food now,” Ownby said with a laugh. “There’s catfish in there. They’ll make short work of that thing.”\n\nTexas\n\nHarlingen: The critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle had an offseason for nesting this year along beaches in the state, with 190 nests recorded in Texas. The Valley Morning Star reports the number, which covers a geographic area from the Bolivar Peninsula south to Boca Chica beach, was down from 250 nests logged last year and 353 in 2017. But this year’s sharp drop-off in Kemp’s ridley nesting in Mexico has set off yellow-flag alerts among scientists who track and study the species. The Texas nesting numbers were not necessarily poor by the standards of the past decade, and they tend to fluctuate because adult females don’t return to their home beach every year to lay a clutch of eggs. Recent studies show female Kemp’s ridleys may come back to nest at three-plus-year intervals.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state liquor commission has announced it is running out of bar licenses for potential business owners again after a similar shortage two years ago. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control handed out its last 2019 bar permits Tuesday to two establishments in Lehi and West Valley City. Department authorities say five other business were placed on the waiting list, some of them planning to open in November and December. Officials say businesses must wait for a population increase after applying due to a state law allowing one bar for every 10,200 people. Officials say three permits are expected before July 2020 following new population information. Some owners say the Legislature should review the population quota.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has named a new poet laureate. Republican Gov. Phil Scott appointed Mary Ruefle to the honorary position this week. WCAX-TV reports she was recommended by a panel of judges. The poet laureate is picked every four years and serves as the state’s ambassador for the art of poetry, participating in ceremonies and readings in Vermont and nationwide. Ruefle said at the ceremony Monday that she was honored to join the ranks of those who served before her and was humbled and scared. She said she’s used to that and said that’s how she feels in the face of poetry and as “a member of that tribe.” Chard Deniord was the state’s last poet laureate. Robert Frost served as Vermont’s first in 1961.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats hoping to seize control of the Legislature in next month’s elections say passing the long-stalled Equal Rights Amendment will be a top priority next year. Passed by Congress in 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, explicitly enshrining equality for women in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty-seven states have ratified it, and advocates say having 38 would meet the constitutional threshold for approval, though it would also likely spark court battles over a long-passed ratification deadline and other legal questions. Other states are working toward ratification, but advocates say the once solidly conservative Virginia, where every seat is on the ballot in November, appears closest. The measure has cleared Virginia’s GOP-controlled Senate before but stalled in the House, which Republicans also narrowly control.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: County officials have announced a proposal to turn a jail into a homeless shelter and use an additional sales tax for funding. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports the proposal would convert the 288-bed jail into a multi-care facility named the Yakima County Care Campus. Yakima County commissioners say the 0.3% countywide sales tax that generates more than $3.5 million a year could fund the care facility with commissioner approval. Officials say commissioners are expected to hold a city hall meeting Oct. 29 to decide. Commissioners say the facility would offer mental health services, substance abuse treatment and long-term housing. Officials say an 8,000-square-foot storage building on the jail’s property would be used as permanent shelter. Commissioners expect to fully convert the facility by 2026.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRichwood: An 11-foot python that was on the loose was found Tuesday, about a month after it got out of its tank, broke through a window screen and slithered outside. Richwood Police Chief Charles Burkhamer says a letter carrier saw the snake laying out in the sun next to a roadway Tuesday, about a block away from where it escaped a month ago. Authorities had been scouring the area trying to find the reptile, and Richwood residents had been notified to keep watch over small children and house pets. Burkhamer said he faced a practical question as he looked at the massive snake on the side of the road. “What am I going to do with it?” he wondered. “We didn’t have a dog crate big enough.” So Burkhamer stuck the snake in a trash can for safekeeping until it could be returned to its owner, who has been asked to register the animal with state officials and reinforce the reptile’s tank.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state has the widest achievement gap between black and white students of any state based on results of a test known as the nation’s report card. The National Assessment of Educational Progress test results released Wednesday show no significant change from statewide results a decade ago. However, declining scores for the lowest-performing students resulted in Wisconsin having the widest achievement gap of any state. State superintendent of schools Carolyn Stanford Taylor says the achievement gap is a crisis, and closing the gaps is “imperative for our state.” The test was given to students in fourth and eighth grades last spring. Wisconsin’s scores were higher than the national averages in both grades and in both subjects.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Farmers in the state are wrapping up a difficult year for sugar beets. A cold snap followed by a week of mild temperatures is threatening the harvest in the Bighorn Basin. A freeze followed by a thaw causes liquids to run out and spoil other beets when they’re stacked in piles. It also lowers the sugar content and price for beets. The Cody Enterprise reports a summer hailstorm and rainy weather also made for a difficult year. Farmer Cody Easum says harvest size and sugar content are both low this year. A local beet pile is growing by about 1,200 tons per day, down from 3,000-4,000 tons in a typical year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/12/27/2016-celebrity-deaths/95872686/", "title": "Final goodbye: Roll call of those who died in 2016", "text": "Bernard McGhee\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDeath claimed transcendent political figures in 2016, including Cuba’s revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej, but it also took away royals of a different sort: kings of pop music, from Prince and David Bowie to George Michael, and a princess of pop culture, actress Carrie Fisher.\n\nOther artists and entertainers who died in 2016 included author Harper Lee, conductor Pierre Boulez, musicians Leonard Cohen, Merle Haggard, Maurice White, Frank Sinatra Jr. and Phife Dawg, and actors Gene Wilder, Abe Vigoda, Florence Henderson, Alan Rickman, Robert Vaughn, Garry Shandling, Doris Roberts, Alan Thicke, Fyvush Finkel and Anton Yelchin.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nCarrie Fisher's impact was epic even beyond her iconic Princess Leia\n\nGeorge Michael brought sounds of Detroit into pop of the '80s\n\nHere is a roll call of some well-known people who died in 2016.\n\nJANUARY\n\nPat Harrington Jr. , 86.

This is the lowest percentage in nearly 50 years, Gallup notes, but remains a solid majority.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/11/17"}]}

The headset will launch early next year for $3,499.\n\n“Just as the Mac introduced us to personal computing, and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro introduces us to spatial computing,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.\n\nThe Vision Pro includes a three-dimensional interface where apps appear to pop up within the room you occupy, while also still viewing your surroundings if you choose. A knob called the digital crown, also found on Apple Watch, controls how immersed users want to feel while wearing the headset.\n\nThe device will also support Apple's Magic Keyboard and Trackpad for those who want more traditional computing options.\n\nWith the headset, users can have browsing tabs arranged around them, stretch screens for a movie theater experience, or join video calls with spatial audio that can mimic an in-person interaction, according to Apple.\n\nThe device uses advanced eye tracking to let wearers use their eyes to highlight an app or other field. You can tap a finger to select or flick your wrist to scroll. If you view a search bar, once it's highlighted, you can speak to enter a query.\n\nWhat's different about Vision Pro compared to other VR and AR headsets is EyeSight, a feature allowing other people to see the eyes of the person wearing the headset. When the wearer is immersed in an activity, the headset gives visual cues to others when they are busy. Apple said the feature is meant to keep users connected to their surroundings.\n\nApple also introduced iOS 17, the next operating system for iPhones. Features will include Contact Posters to give phone contacts more personality, live transcriptions of voice mails, NameDrop for quickly sharing contact information, and improvements to autocorrect for text messaging.\n\nScroll down for a replay of Apple's WWDC keynote.\n\nReactions: Apple meets 'Ready Player One'\n\nNow that the Vision Pro is here, the immediate reactions on social media like Twitter are the comparisons to Ready Player One.\n\nIf you recall, Ready Player One is novel-turned-film about a dystopia where inhabitants seek escape by entering a virtual reality universe.\n\nVision Pro starts at $3,499\n\nWant to join the future of spatial computing? Prepare to pay up. The headset will cost $3,499 when it launches next year.\n\nOptic ID is like Face ID for Vision Pro\n\nThe headset will support Optic ID, a biometric tool for unlocking when you use Vision Pro.\n\nHow does Vision Pro sound?\n\nThe headset will feature a unique spatial audio system meant to convince users the sound is coming directly from the room.\n\nUnder the hood of Vision Pro\n\nThe front of the product is a single piece of glass providing a view for the user along with a series of cameras. The digital crown controls how immersed you want to be in the environment. Apple said it studied thousand of heads to create a modular system to make sure it can fit any wearer. Like other headsets, it includes an adjustment dial to customize fit.\n\nMickey Mouse meets Vision Pro\n\nDisney is among the partners on board with Vision Pro, providing a preview of entertainment experiences on the headset. A teaser shows experiences such as courtside replays of NBA games and bringing Disney World into your living room. Disney Plus will appear when the Vision Pro launches, said Disney CEO Bob Iger.\n\nHow you view photos and videos in Vision Pro?\n\nUsers can display photos as big as your room, and panoromas can expand and wrap around you, providing a lifelike view. The headset has a camera, too, to capture moments while wearing the device. Video views and cinema environments provide movie theater style vibes, according to Apple. The headset will allow for 3D movies, too.\n\nHow you browse the web in Vision Pro\n\nSo how exactly do apps work? With Safari, you arrange the tabs all around you. For example, you might have one tab when you look left, and others when you look right. But while the tabs are open, you can still see others around you. Accessories are supported with the headset, including mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhat Apple Vision Pro interface looks like\n\nApple's demo shows the user viewing apps that show up right in the room. The headset includes a digital crown like the Apple Watch, and it appears tethered instead of operating independently, although it's not clear what device connects to the headset. The headset itself looks sleek. You use your eyes to move to different apps, while using your hands to scroll or select. The headset supports voice, too. Just look at the search bar, then speak your query. Vision Pro will also display your eyes when wearing the headset through an EyeSight feature. It's a clear blend of VR and AR.\n\nApple introduces Vision Pro, a new AR headset\n\nAnd here comes the mixed reality headset. Apple unveils Vision Pro. Using eyes, head and voice, you control apps and other tools. You can also see through the headset like you're wearing glasses, but apps appear in your environment like augmented reality. \"Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing,\" said Cook, comparing it to how the Mac and iPhone revolutionized technology.\n\nApple Watch will add mental, vision health features\n\nThe smartwatch will leverage the Mindfulness app to describe how you're feeling, ranging from very unpleasant to very pleasant. The health app will also include standardized assessments you might take at a doctor's office to determine your state of mind, and whether you should contact a medical professional. If you're a parent, you can use Apple Watch to measure how much time they spend in daylight. Apple devices will also offer a Screen Distance feature to alert users if they're holding screens too close.\n\nWatchOS 10: The latest updates\n\nEven more widgets, readers! When using fun faces like Portraits, you can use the digital crown to pull up widgets quickly with simple details like weather or timers. Apps have been redesigned, such as World Clock, which has dynamic colors that change depending on time of day. The Activity app has been tweaked with a new trophy case and more full screen views. Third-party apps will see new changes such as the NBA app, which provides more in-game information beyond score (finally). Also debuting on the Apple Watch later this year: Snoopy and Woodstock.\n\nThe Watch will soon get several new feature to accommodate cyclists, such as new ways to measure cadence and a new view for monitoring your progress during a ride. Compass and Maps apps will get updates to help hiking lovers.\n\nApple TV is adding FaceTime\n\nBig update to Apple TV: The FaceTime app will be available, so you can view and participate in calls right on your TV. Users can also use services like SharePlay to watch TV shows or movies with friends. You can also soon take Zoom calls through your TV.\n\nAirPods Pro will add Adaptive Audio\n\nAn update to AirPods Pro will support Adaptive Audio, which combines the noise cancelling and passthrough modes to fit your environment. A speaking feature will automatically lower the audio from AirPods when it recognizes you speaking to others. Automatic switching has improved, too, so it happens more quickly.\n\nWhat's new with Mac browser Safari?\n\nPrivate browsing is updated to lock browser windows, blocks trackers for loading and remove any URL trackers. Passwords and passkeys will soon be easier to share with important people in your file. Profiles allow people to create different identities to separate histories, such as work versus personal profiles. Users can also create Web apps from pages.\n\nWhat updates are coming to macOS Sonoma?\n\nThe next release, named Sonoma, is focused on improving productivity, said Federighi. Apple sure loves its widgets, because they're letting users add them directly to the screen instead of popping into view. When you open an app, widgets will fade in the background, and they adjust depending on the background of your desktop.\n\nMacs will add a Game Mode to improve latency, and developers will get better tools for porting their games over to the platform. Speaking of games, legendary designer Hideo Kojima confirmed his hit game Death Stranding will debut on Macs later this year.\n\nFor video calls, small and large overlays can easily move your video presence throughout a call. There will also be fun video effects such as fireworks exploding in the background if you give the thumbs-up.\n\nA PDF miracle for iPad\n\nRaise your hand if you get frustrated trying to fill out a PDF online. Apple's answer to this is the ability to autofill fields the tablet will recognize to quickly update. Apple also improved integration between PDFs and Notes, for easier access and collaboration.\n\niPadOS 17 beefs up widgets, lock screens\n\nOwners of iPad, this is for you. Apple will make widgets more functional, and include customized lock screens similar to the iPhone. Users can also add lock screen widgets. Live Activities such as food orders or travel plans will appear on iPads, too. Apple will also bring the Health app to iPad for the first time.\n\nDropping the Hey in 'Hey, Siri'\n\nA small change, but you soon can drop the \"Hey\" when waking up Siri. Users can simply say Siri. Other new features expected with iOS 17: offline maps, improvements to People albums, and a new Pets album within Photos.\n\nThe iPhone will have a Standby mode\n\nNew to the iPhone later this year is Standby, which turns the smartphone into a smart display when it's locked. It can show info like photos, time and date, or other notifications. If you want to use it as a traditional alarm clock, it will automatically dim to low light.\n\nJournal app to debut on iPhones this year\n\nThe iPhone will get a new Apple app, called Journal. Users can chronicle key moments in their life with a combination of writing and photos. Your phone will also remind you near the end of your day if you want to start writing.\n\nYour keyboard will become smarter\n\nAutocorrect gets a ducking update (see what I did there). Sentence level corrections can fix more types of mistakes. The keyboard will allow you to quickly revert to your original word if autocorrects tries to fix it when you don't want it. Predictive text will improve, too, gets Federighi.\n\nNameDrop quickly exchanges contact info\n\nSimilar to AirDrop, NameDrop allows people to quickly share contact information. Their info will appear on your phone, and you can select how you want to save details like phone number.\n\nStickers on Messages get more love\n\nStickers will get a major update with iOS 17. Users can access Stickers more easily to add to messages. They can also cut out elements from photos and create unique stickers users can customize. Emojis will be available as Stickers, too.\n\nLive Voicemail transcribes on the fly\n\nOne cool feature coming soon to iPhones: Live Voicemail. When a person calls currently, the Phone app will transcribe the message after it's recorded. With Live Voicemail, it will transcribe as the person is leaving the message, so you can see it in real time.\n\nUpdates are coming to Messages, too, including location sharing within a thread, check-ins to alert friends or family when you are safe, and transcribed audio clips shared in texts.\n\nIt's official: iOS 17 is confirmed\n\nApple's Craig Federighi appears to introduce the world to iOS 17. It starts with phone calls (remember it's still a phone). You can create special visual identities for contacts and lock screen style posters that pop up whenever someone calls. \"They're going to stand out in a whole new way,\" said Federighi.\n\nUpdates to Mac Studio\n\nTernus shifts to the Mac Studio, the company's supercharged desktop computer. Consumers can now buy a version with the M2 Max chip, which basically means it's going to operate super fast. Apple introduces a new chip, M2 Ultra, which doubles the performance of Macs running M2 chips, Apple said. It's clearly aimed at higher level production work such as video editing or audio engineering. Definitely don't buy this just for email or playing Wordle. Apple unveiled yet another Mac desktop, the Mac Pro with M2 Ultra.\n\nAll the big performance on the desktops come at a price. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999, while the Mac Pro starts at $6,999. A budget buster for sure.\n\nApple announces 15-inch MacBook Air at $1,299\n\nWe start WWDC with fresh hardware. John Ternus, Apple's senior VP for hardware engineering on Macs, joins to introduce a version of MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen. It's available in four finishes, MagSafe charging, and 1080p camera for video calls. The laptop has six speakers, and supports Apple's in-house M2 processing chip. The revamped laptop also boasts 18 hours of battery life. It starts at $1,299, and is available next week. Also, the 13-inch model will see a discount down to $1,099.\n\nLet Apple WWDC begin\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook kicks off the conference in front of giant rainbow arches right outside Apple Park. Cook notes this year marks the 15th anniversary of the App Store. Cook also said the company is committed to helping developers with the tools to help them do their best work.\n\nWhat time does WWDC start?\n\nThe conference begins with a keynote address starting at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch WWDC keynote?\n\nThe keynote is available to watch through Apple's website, or on the Apple TV app. In previous years, Apple has also streamed its keynote on YouTube.\n\nWhat are Apple's plans with AI?\n\nApple is one of the few tech companies that has remained quiet on artificial intelligence, as services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard start to infiltrate the space.\n\nThat should change Monday, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Apple is expected to discuss its plans and strategy for AI during the keynote.\n\n\"We expect Apple to head down the path to have its own AI driven solution that will be integrated within the Apple ecosystem and enable consumers to further tap into their iOS data, video, music, applications, and Apple devices through next generation AI capabilities,\" Ives said.\n\nWhen will we see iPhone 15?\n\nThe announcement of a new iOS brings us closer to a new iPhone. So when will we see iPhone 15 (granted they stay with the naming convention)?\n\nDon't expect an announcement Monday. Apple saves it for its big iPhone event in September. Typically the new iPhone launches in September, roughly two weeks after its signature fall event. Last year, Apple held its iPhone event September 7, then launched iPhone 14 on September 16.\n\nCan Apple's mixed reality headset break through?\n\nThe journey of the VR headset has felt like a rollercoaster ride. There was the initial buzz when the first headsets made their debuts. But the devices didn't take off like smartphones due to factors such as pricing and the fact that many headsets were tethered to a PC or other device to function.\n\nFacebook parent Meta has seen some success with its Quest line of VR headsets by making them more affordable and allowing them to operate independently.\n\nExpect Apple's rumored headset to remain a niche product for a while, said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson. The more important priority is creating an ecosystem capable of creating unique AR and VR experiences.\n\n\"Let’s not forget the iPhone and Apple Watch experiences were not built overnight but took a couple of years to scale,\" Husson said.\n\nWhat to expect from iOS 17\n\nAmong the rumored features is a new smart display that functions similarly a smart home device with screen like Amazon's Echo Show. When the iPhone is placed in landscape mode (horizontally), it will show specific notifications when the screen is locked, reports Bloomberg. The update will also add a journaling app to update friends and take notes, said the report.\n\nMore on Apple's mixed reality headset\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out its headset combining augmented and virtual realities during the keynote. The device will be named either Reality Pro or XR Pro, said the report, and cost around $3,000.\n\nThe headset will support VR as well as offer a pass-through mode to add AR elements, said the report. The device is meant for tasks such as communication, watching videos or playing games, the report said.\n\nWhat to expect at WWDC\n\nThe main purpose of the conference is to introduce developers to new versions of software for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. Prepare to see not just iOS 17, but fresh versions of iPadOS, watchOS and macOS.\n\nAlthough Apple typically reserves many of its big hardware announcements for its iPhone event in September, this year could be different. Monday could mark the debut of Apple's long-rumored mixed reality headset.\n\nWhat devices will be compatible with iOS 17?\n\nThe next iOS isn't just for new iPhone owners. Like previous releases, iOS 17 will be available on multiple iPhone models released over the past couple years. Support for iOS 16 stretches all the way back to the iPhone 8, released in 2017. However, if you are still hanging on to an iPhone 8, it's possible it gets cut out from this year's release.\n\nWhen will iOS 17 come out?\n\nThe keynote is typically when Apple not only unveils the next iOS but details on its launch. The arrival of iOS 17 is timed to the launch of the next iPhone, so the next update will likely debut in September a couple days before the new smartphone is available in stores.\n\nLast year, Apple released iOS 16 on September 12, four days before the launch of iPhone 14.\n\nWhat does WWDC stand for?\n\nThe annual Worldwide Developers Conference is a week-long gathering of developers of applications for Apple products including the iPhone, Mac, and iPad to connect with fellow developers and discover new tools for creating apps. The conference is free for all developers.\n\nThe conference had previously been hosted at a convention center in San Francisco before the COVID-19 pandemic transformed it to a virtual experience in 2020. This year, Apple will host a special in-person experience Monday at its Apple Park headquarters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/06/10/apple-ios-18/74045850007/", "title": "iOS 18 unveiled: See key new features and changes coming with ...", "text": "Apple announced new features coming to iPhones via iOS 18 and the company's AI-powered intelligence system called \"Apple Intelligence\" at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, including scheduled iMessages, interface customizability and one-of-a-kind emojis.\n\nWith iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence coming later this year, according to Apple executive Craig Federighi, iPhone users will have access to a smarter, more customizable and more powerful mobile operating system.\n\n\"We are just getting started, I hope you are as excited as I am about the road ahead,\" Federighi said during Apple's keynote at WWDC.\n\nHere are some of the new features coming via iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhen is iOS 18 releasing? Which phones can use iOS 18?\n\nApple announced iOS 18 will debut this fall as a free download for iPhone Xs and later.\n\nEnhanced home screen, control center customizability\n\nWhen iPhone users unlock their devices, they are typically met by a wallpaper and a ton of apps. With iOS 18, users will be able to further customize their home screen in various ways, including by:\n\nPutting app icons and widgets anywhere on the home screen grid.\n\nTurning the iPhone on dark mode, which now changes app icons.\n\nChanging the tint color of the home screen.\n\nThe control center is also more customizable as iPhone users will be able to group their favorite controls, including ones created by third-party apps. The flashlight and camera shortcuts on the lock screen will also be changeable.\n\nScheduled messages and more \"tapback\" reactions coming with iOS 18\n\nThe Messages app will have a lot of new features coming thanks to iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence, Apple leaders announced Monday.\n\nScheduled messages, emoji tapbacks and text effects were announced as improvements to the Message app. The text effects will allow users to visually amplify their messages, while emoji tapbacks are ways to respond to text messages more expressively.\n\nRich Communication Services (RCS) is another new edition to Messages coming via iOS 18 and the improvement will allow for smoother text messaging between iPhone and Android users.\n\nWelcome, 'Genmojis'\n\nWith the help of Apple Intelligence, users will be able to create custom \"Genmoji\" to match any moment. All users will have to do is provide a description and a Genmoji will appear, along with other options to choose from. Genmojis can also be added inline in messages.\n\nAnother feature available in Messages courtesy of Apple Intelligence is users' ability to create \"total original images\" of people in sketch and animated forms. Apple used a contact's birthday as an example, and a custom sketch was created and sent via the Messages app.\n\n'Biggest redesign ever' to Photos\n\nPhotos is receiving its \"biggest redesign ever\" as the app will now be \"unified to a single view.\"\n\nFilter options are coming to the app and users will able to search through photos by the month or year they were taken. Screenshots can also be filtered out.\n\nA collections feature is now included and will allow users to browse through customizable sections. A carousel that updates daily is another feature that allows users to see their favorite photos in a new format.\n\nImproved, more organized Mail app\n\nThe Mail app will be able to separate emails into sections to make users' inboxes more organized.\n\nIncoming email is separated into:\n\nPrimary for personal and time-sensitive emails\n\nfor personal and time-sensitive emails Transactions for confirmations and receipts\n\nfor confirmations and receipts Updates for news and social notifications\n\nfor news and social notifications Promotions for marketing emails and coupons\n\nA new mail digest feature will also make skimming important emails easier.\n\nHighlights and redesigned reader added to Safari\n\nSafari will be able to make it easier to get the gist of articles or webpages quickly by finding key information and summarizing.\n\nFor example, Safari will summarize a long article for users or find the location of a restaurant just by its name appearing on a webpage.\n\nPasswords app, improved privacy\n\nThe Passwords app will make it easier for users to store and access their passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes. The app will also tell users if their passwords are weak or have been used multiple times.\n\nThe iOS 18 update will also help users' privacy by allowing them to hide apps and lock apps to where it would require a passcode or Face ID to open them.\n\nAdvanced Siri\n\nDue to Apple Intelligence, Siri will be more advanced than ever by being able to:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/05/07/watch-apple-let-loose-livestream/73588826007/", "title": "May 7 Apple event highlights: Watch live as USA TODAY discusses ...", "text": "Apple unveiled new devices and features Tuesday during its \"Let Loose\" event, headlined by a new line of iPads.\n\nUSA TODAY is providing live analysis of the tech giant's latest announcements, scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. ET.

The system updates will launch more widely this fall.\n\nMost notable for iPhone fans is the introduction of customizable lock screens capable of not only showing personalized clocks but also widgets including weather, activity and other data. The time can also be displayed in the background to prevent hiding photos used for lock screens.\n\nBut it's not just software updates coming soon. Apple also unveiled a new MacBook Air running its latest M2 processing chip. The laptop is available next month starting at $1,199.\n\nScroll down to recap all the live updates from Apple's WWDC keynote.\n\nNew Apple Pay feature:Now you can buy that iPhone or MacBook on the installment plan with Apple Pay Later\n\nOn an extended trip? How to pause cable, internet services and save money\n\nFor Xbox, PS5 and Nintendo Switch:Climb behind the wheel of today’s car racing games\n\nWhen will iOS 16, macOS, others launch?\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook said developer betas for iOS 16 and other updates will be available today and launch next month as a public beta. All the operating systems will become available to users this fall.\n\nAlso coming soon to iPad\n\nThere will be a new display scaling setting, to adjust the size of an app's view when multitasking or using the split-screen feature. The Stage Manager feature for Macs will also appear on the iPad. Recent apps appear on the left, which apps in the dock along the bottom remain available.\n\nThe iPad's new Freeform app\n\nThe iPad will soon add a Freeform app, which essentially creates a whiteboard for when you want to work together with others during, for example, a FaceTime call. It looks like a more sophisticated Notes app, where users can drop in notes, photos or whatever digital materials on the whiteboard.\n\nUp next: the iPadOS\n\nIt's now the iPad's turn, which is also going to get a big update this fall. The weather app receives some important visual upgrades, a collaboration feature to more easily work together and share information within apps like Messages. Other users can then join the collaboration to start working on a document.\n\nHanding off a FaceTime call?\n\nApple fans are aware of the ways you can transition between your iPhone and Mac. The latest fun way to use it: FaceTime calls. Let's say you start a call on the iPhone. If you're near a Mac, it will alert you asking whether you want to continue your call on the Mac. Another incredible feature: the ability to use your iPhone as a really fancy webcam. It's called Continuity Camera.\n\nApple's plan to ditch passwords\n\nApple introduced Passkeys, which leverages Touch ID or Face ID to create a unique key for a service. Passkeys can't be leaked or compromised, Apple said. With a Passkey, you can sign up or log in to a service just using the iPhone.\n\nSay hello to the new macOS: Ventura\n\nMacs are getting a cool new upgrade, too. Ventura, the name of the new macOS, will include Stage Manager, a feature that will let Mac users focus on the app they're using without the clutter. The other open apps are off to the side to presumably provide less distraction. Users can also group apps together in clusters if you are working on a project that requires hopping between several apps.\n\nThe Spotlight search tool gets a major upgrade. Users can peek at results with quick look, search images from your library or even the web, and you can search text from within an image. Users can also perform tasks such as starting timers within Spotlight. The Spotlight feature is also getting this upgrade on iPhone.\n\nMail adds features such as undo send, scheduled send, follow-up suggestions, and remind me to flag a message for reminders, making it more comparable to Google's Gmail. Search within mail will get overhauled to instantly share suggestions when you start searching.\n\nThere's a new MacBook Pro, too\n\nThe updated MacBook Pro is mostly similar, only it's going to get the new M2 chip, which means it's going to be faster than the M1 laptops. The new MacBook will launch next month starting at $1,299.\n\nSurprise: It's a new MacBook Air\n\nApple is upgrading to M2 chips, the latest version of the chips which will run future Mac computers. The first computer to receive one is the MacBook Air, which Apple says is their best-selling laptop.\n\nNaturally, Apple is revealing a new MacBook Air. It's under half an inch thin and weighs under three pounds. It also boasts a 13.6-inch display. It will be available in four colors, and supports MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack.\n\nThe Air has enough battery life for 18 hours of video playback, and fast charging.\n\nThe new MacBook Air starts at $1,199 and launches next month.\n\nTrack medications on Apple Watch\n\nThe watch will soon add a Medications app to easily track which medications you take and when to take them. Users can manually add them or take a picture to quickly add to the app. Users can also set schedules to know when to take their medications. The app will provide alerts if your medications have critical or serious interactions.\n\nImprovements to Apple Watch Sleep app\n\nThe next watch update will include support for sleep stages, checking how much time you spent in specific sleep stages, such as REM sleep. If you own a Fitbit, then you're likely aware of how it works.\n\nFor heart health, WatchOS 9 is adding AFib history, which provides long-term tracking of when users are in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIt's time for Apple Watch updates\n\nLet's start with faces. Apple is adding four more faces, including a lunar calendar face, the playtime face with animated numbers and a metropolitan face in various colors. Faces will also add new complications, which are essentially super-small widgets with info such as dates or heart rate.\n\nAs for fitness, WatchOS will leverage tools like machine learning to better track running during workouts, with details such as stride and ground contact time. Users can also quickly see which heart rate zone they're in during a workout.\n\nIf you follow the same route when you run, you can also track your best times to try to beat previous sessions.\n\nWhat's new with CarPlay\n\nApple is introducing some updates to the in-car system CarPlay. Among them: upgraded odometers with an Apple aesthetic, widgets providing trip information, navigation tools and weather details. Users can also perform tasks like adjust the temperature in the car without leaving CarPlay. The iPhone communicates with your car's real-time systems to display all the information within CarPlay. Users can even customize how that information is displayed.\n\nApple's new Safety Check app\n\nTo help protect personal safety, Apple is releasing a Safety Check app, created in partnership with domestic violence groups. The app can manage access to your device, disable location sharing, or set up an emergency reset of your phone. It can also reset any privacy permissions and double-check who has access to information on your phone.\n\nFamily Sharing updates big for parents\n\nApple is tweaking family sharing to make it much easier for parents to set up devices for kids and adjust the parental controls. Kids can also send requests via Messages to earn more screen time. I for one look forward to 1,000 messages asking me for five more minutes on YouTube. iPhone owners can also create shared libraries available to whomever you select, to automatically share photos with family or friends.\n\nNew territory for Apple Maps\n\nThe app will soon feature multi-stop routing, which lets users add multiple stops during a single trip. Transit features get upgraded as well, providing details on schedules and pricing for different services. Maps will also provided a detailed City view to offer a better perspective of surroundings.\n\nBuy Now, Pay Later comes to Apple Pay\n\nApple introduces the option to pay later for items you purchase through Apple Pay Later, which allows consumers to break down the purchase of an item on Apple Pay through multiple installments.\n\nNew ways to use your license on iPhone\n\nApple is slowing rolling out the option to add your driver's license to your iPhone. Arizona and Maryland are the first states to do this, and others are coming soon. One upcoming use case involves verifying with the Uber Eats app that you are over 21 to order certain items.\n\nA more useful Live Text feature\n\nPerhaps one of the coolest upcoming uses for Live Text: the ability to open the camera within the Translate app and immediately see text in view translated. Visual lookup will not only spot items in an image and allow you to search them, but you also can grab specific elements in the photo and paste them into a message.\n\nMessages gets an update, too\n\nNew features such an undo send, marking threads as unread, and the ability to edit a message after it's sent are among the new tweaks to make the app easier and more efficient, said Apple's Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering. Composing messages will also improve thanks to an upgraded on-device dictation feature. When using dictation, the keyboard remains open so you can both dictate and type if needed. It even does emoji dictation. Mind blown emoji indeed!\n\niPhone notifications that are less obnoxious\n\nNotifications will stream from the bottom of the screen with iOS 16, and users can even hide them completely. There are also live activity widgets on the lock screen for special events like tracking sports scores, listening to music and tracking an Uber ride. Users can also customize Focus mode so lock screens can match the moment, such as when you're at work.\n\niOS 16 gets a big lock screen update\n\nApple's Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, confirms what we already knew: iOS 16 is the next major software update for the iPhone. He starts with the lock screen, calling it \"the biggest update ever.\"\n\nIt's far more personal, offering different fonts, styles and colors, along with tiny icons for information such as noise levels, weather and more. It's similar to the Apple Watch and how you update and personalize watch faces. Making the updates requires just a simple drag and drop interface.\n\nUsers can easily swipe to update the fonts, and Apple is finally going to eliminate faces on wallpapers get covered up by the time.\n\nTim Cook starts things off\n\nNo surprise, but Apple's CEO begins from the halls of Apple's new futuristic headquarters to officially start WWDC. Cook is currently recapping all the ways Apple is trying to foster robust developer environments, including new academies focused on underrepresented communities. Cook says the Apple community has grown to more than 34 million developers.\n\nWhat is WWDC?\n\nThe Worldwide Developers Conference, held each year, is a week-long gathering of developers of applications for Apple products including the iPhone, Mac, and iPad to connect with fellow developers and discover new tools for creating apps.\n\nThe conference had previously been hosted at a convention center in San Francisco before the COVID-19 pandemic transformed it to a virtual experience in 2020.\n\nHow to watch WWDC\n\nThe keynote is available to stream on Apple's website or through the Apple TV app available on various streaming devices. Apple also streams its keynote through its YouTube channel.\n\nWhat we know about iOS 16 right now\n\nThe most notable rumored update Apple could reveal is iOS 16 supporting an always-on display, which could provide basic information to users without having to wake the device. Other rumored features coming to the iPhone include upgrades to the Messages app and the Health app.\n\nWhen will iOS 16 launch?\n\nTypically, the arrival of the latest version of iOS lands just before the launch of a new iPhone in the fall. Last year, Apple launched iOS 15 on Sept. 20, four days before the debut of the iPhone 13.\n\nWill my iPhone support iOS 16?\n\nThe most recent releases of the iPhone will almost certainly support iOS 16. The question is whether much older models going back to the iPhone 6S, which launched nearly seven years ago, will still run the latest version of iOS. If you're clinging to one of those models, it might be time to consider an upgrade.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/06/10/macos-sequoia-apple/74042809007/", "title": "MacOS Sequoia: Newest Apple operating system's key features ...", "text": "Apple announced big updates to its MacOS system during the tech company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday.\n\nAlthough no new phones or laptops were announced at the conference, Apple's primary focus was on new operating systems for MacBooks and other devices, as well as a new focus on Apple Intelligence, the company's latest push to join in on the AI movement.\n\nThe new computer operating system, which Apple has named Sequoia, was unveiled during the WWDC keynote address.

That’s particularly true when it comes to Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS in the realm of smartphone AI.\n\nGoogle has already announced several important AI-based features for Android phones, while Apple is widely recognized as having fallen behind in the “AI on the smartphone” race. Tech industry observers expect that situation to change in about a month when Apple is predicted to introduce a raft of new generative AI-powered features at its Worldwide Developer’s Conference (WWDC).\n\nIn the meantime, however, Google continues to pad its lead and unveiled multiple new capabilities for Android this week at its own Google I/O developer conference. The company kicked off with an expansion of its already impressive circle-to-search function, which it first unveiled along with Samsung at that company’s Galaxy Unpacked event earlier this year.\n\nIn case you haven’t seen it, circle-to-search provides a very intuitive, graphical way to find anything currently displaying on your phone’s display. You long press on your Android phone’s home button and, as the name suggests, simply use your finger (or a stylus) to select an object or text on your phone’s screen with a circle or a scribble, then Google will automatically do a search on the highlighted item. You can even ask questions about the object to learn more about it.\n\nIt's a simple but very useful extension of your phone (or tablet) that leverages the AI processors in the latest devices to essentially “see” from the inside out what’s on your screen. More importantly, it’s the kind of experience that finally makes your smartphone feel, well, smart. After all, if you can see what’s on the screen, why shouldn’t it?\n\nThe latest extension to circle-to-search is a homework helper feature that, interestingly, seems to share a number of similarities with the latest editions to ChatGPT 4o that OpenAI just introduced. Google’s version can help with physics and math word problems that students are viewing on their device screens, explaining along the way how to solve them (and not just giving the answers). It’s a great example of how AI-powered features can bring incredibly useful new experiences to our phones and tablets.\n\nGoogle enhances search:Google all in on AI and Gemini: How it will affect your Google searches\n\nGoogle also described how it is more deeply integrating its Gemini generative AI models throughout Android. Google provided examples of how Gemini will let you do things like drag and drop AI generated images into documents, emails, and messages. In addition, thanks to Gemini’s summarization capabilities, you’ll be able to find the specific information you’re looking for in a video through a feature they’re calling “Ask this Video.”\n\nOne of the big trends that Apple is expected to highlight at WWDC is the ability to run large language models (LLMs), which power generative AI features, directly on iPhones. This will allow some applications to function on their own instead of having to go to the cloud. While that may not initially sound like a big deal, this approach offers several advantages, particularly with regard to privacy and even performance. To be clear, general-purpose searches will continue to need an external connection, but applications and experiences that leverage your own documents, emails, messages, etc., can be done solely on the device, preventing the possible exposure of private information.\n\nGoogle recognizes those benefits as well and pointed out with their Gemini Nano model being built into the next version of Android, they will be the first mobile operating system to do so. More importantly, Google also said they will be bringing a multimodal version of Gemini Nano—meaning one that recognizes spoken language, sound and camera inputs in addition to text—to Android later this year. This should open up a dramatically enhanced set of experiences and enable the creation of powerful and intelligent digital assistants that can understand and intelligently respond to your requests. In fact, Google’s teased their intriguing and compelling vision for what a digital assistant can be, at the I/O event via their Project Astra.\n\nGoogle also demonstrated some AI applications that go well beyond the things we’ve seen generative AI typically used for. The new TalkBack feature, for example, which will leverage the Gemini Nano multimodal features, can describe images to people who are sight impaired. The company also showed a Scam Detection feature that can listen to a phone conversation you’re having and warn you if it believes it’s a type of fraud. While some people may be understandably concerned about an AI-powered agent monitoring a conversation, the process only occurs on the device. (It’s also a good example of why running certain applications only on the device is so important.)\n\nFor Android phone users, expect to see these kinds of AI-powered features rolled out to newer generation devices throughout the course of the year. For iPhone owners, Apple will be doing its own set of AI-powered features, but there’s a good chance that many of them will be similar to what Google announced. In fact, it’s even rumored that Apple may be licensing some technologies from both Google and OpenAI to integrate into its next version of iOS.\n\nRegardless, it’s clear that we are entering into an exciting new era of truly “smart” devices with AI-powered features that should make the experience of using them both more intuitive and more rewarding.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm.

Apple's existing parental controls had notable failings: A parent could restrict the kind of content but not the length of time they used an app.\n\nApple on Monday said Screen Time would give parents access to their child’s Activity Report right from their own iOS devices using Family Sharing in iCloud and allows them to schedule times to limit when a child’s iOS device can be used, such as during bedtime.\n\nSaid Federighi: \"It empowers you with insight and control.\"\n\nBut for every additional control that Apple introduced to help encourage a child or adult to ditch the phone, the company provided other updates that hue to the perennial goal of most tech companies: offering better and stickier ways for you to use their product.\n\nThese included changes to its video-conferencing app FaceTime that allow you to make calls with up to 32 people and a new augmented reality feature called \"Memojis\" that creates animated emojis of yourself.\n\nGiven the choice of hairstyles, accessories and eye-color, it wasn't hard to imagine spending time glued the phone making the perfect cute avatar — perhaps to bring to your next group FaceTime call.\n\nApple also showed off a way to scroll through apps and even load Web pages on Apple Watch, thanks to an employee who did the demo while working out on a stationery bike.\n\nApple's Watch finally added a feature that seems like a no brainer: Walkie-Talkie, which allows users to chat back and forth in short audio bursts.\n\nAnd it touted a way to use an augmented reality game on iPad to bring a physical Lego set to life.\n\nTouting privacy as Facebook reels\n\nIn recent weeks, Cook has taken some jabs at Facebook in the wake of the company's Cambridge Analytica data scandal, touting Apple policies that sequester much of consumers' information on their encrypted devices.\n\nMore robust security measures are aimed at making it more difficult for apps in the Apple universe to access your private data, unless you grant that access.\n\nAnd it wasn't above taking direct aim at Facebook. During the keynote, Apple showed typical comments on a website with a pop-up that asked if you wanted to allow or disallow Facebook.com to use cookies and website data while browsing that website.\n\nOne of the most raucous responses during the keynote was reserved for Federighi's announcement that the newest operating system would offer greater levels of security that \"extends protection to your (computer's) cameras and microphone, your mail database, message history and more.\"\n\nBatterygate and new iOS 12\n\nApple also offered some mollification to users still angry over its own black-eye, dubbed Batterygate, when it was discovered late last year that older devices were losing battery power after loading updated software. Federighi said \"we’re doubling down on performance, with apps loading 40% faster.\"\n\nSome of the other more compelling iOS 12 changes include tweaks to Siri, the often-used (10 billion requests a month, Apple says) digital assistant that hasn't fared well in comparison tests with Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant.\n\nWhile Apple didn't say anything about Siri getting smarter, the company did release Shortcuts, which are both suggested and customizable shortcuts that help Siri be more proactive.\n\nLet's say that as you get ready to drive home from work you want Siri to message your significant other, turn up the thermostat and tune into NPR. By creating a Siri Shortcut with those commands and calling it \"Driving Home,\" Siri will initiate all those tasks when summoned by that prompt.\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/04"}]}

Now she could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSusie Wiles was searching for her next act when Donald Trump came knocking last spring.\n\nPlotting a comeback after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was proving to be tougher than the former President had anticipated, and he needed someone to whip his disorderly political operation into shape. Surrounded by advisers who he suspected had only stuck around to make money, Trump began asking close friends who else could be trusted to take on the unenviable task.\n\n“After all the drama of his first term and the election, everyone was enriching themselves through Trump, and he f**king hates that. It became clear after several people mentioned her name that Susie wouldn’t be like that,” said a person close to Trump.\n\nWiles was an intriguing choice from the start. A veteran of Trump’s presidential campaigns, she had already proved her political worth twice over, helping him notch a win in Florida in 2016 and then growing his margin of victory there in 2020. Still, it was a curious move for the optics-obsessed former President to make his top lieutenant a 64-year-old bird-watching, pound cake-baking grandmother, who asked only that her travel expenses be covered when she accepted the position in March 2021.\n\nBut as Trump readies a widely expected 2024 campaign, people in every corner of his orbit – from ardent election deniers to fixtures of the Republican establishment – say Wiles may be the most sensible choice to helm it. CNN spoke with 16 former and current Trump aides and advisers and people close to Wiles for this story, many of whom described her as the consummate professional – someone who has adeptly navigated Trump world’s “Lord of the Flies” factionalism without making enemies, earning the respect of both his youngest aides at Mar-a-Lago and the domineering personalities in his kitchen cabinet.\n\n“Trump world is dynamic and volatile and innovative and ever-changing, and Susie is the rock,” said Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, who has known Wiles for years.\n\n“The people around him, whether they like Susie or not, all agree that she doesn’t stir up trouble,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump administration official who is close to both Trump and Wiles.\n\nWiles’ command of Trump’s post-presidential activities – from his midterm travel and 2022 endorsements to fundraising through his various committees – has also landed her praise in Washington, where some Republicans are decidedly less enthusiastic about the prospect of another White House bid by the former President.\n\n“Susie is a supremely talented woman in a male-dominated arena,” said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. “Her ability to navigate tough political environments to execute campaign goals and deliver Republican victories is unmatched.”\n\nOf course, there is another theory for Wiles’ meteoric rise through the Trump world ranks. Her complicated history with Ron DeSantis has left some Trump allies with the impression that she could be an asset if Trump finds himself in an unexpectedly competitive 2024 primary against the popular Florida governor.\n\nWiles once served as a top adviser to DeSantis, but she was abruptly ousted from his inner circle in 2019 amid rising tensions between the duo and was then let go from Trump’s campaign operation at the governor’s behest. She was later reinstated.\n\n“I’ve never heard her bash on DeSantis in a ruthless way, but I think she is very aware that he was intimately involved in [her] getting bounced from the 2020 campaign,” said a current Trump adviser.\n\nAt the very least, it was enough to create a lasting fissure in their relationship, which several well-placed sources said is virtually nonexistent nowadays. But some believe Wiles’ familiarity with DeSantis – especially his potential weaknesses as a candidate – could also be useful in the future.\n\n“I don’t think President Trump would have won Florida in 2016 without Susie Wiles, and she was instrumental in Ron DeSantis’ victory [as governor] in 2018. They would both benefit from having Susie involved in a 2024 campaign,” said David Bossie, a longtime Trump friend and adviser.\n\n“No doubt” she would be more loyal to Trump in a primary, said Caputo. “She is as steadfast as they come, and I think the President understands that in Susie Wiles, he has competency and loyalty in levels that are very beneficial to him.”\n\nA Trump spokesman and Wiles separately declined to provide comment for this story.\n\nA longtime fixture in Trump world\n\nTo be widely respected in Trump’s orbit is no small feat. Before Wiles became the former President’s de facto chief of staff, four men held the title in some capacity during his presidency. One was fired via Twitter, two have become high-profile critics of their former boss and the last one may be in serious legal jeopardy amid revelations by the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nWiles would never introduce herself as Trump’s chief of staff, preferring to think of herself as a trusted adviser, but nearly everyone in his inner circle sees her as such, including his adult children, according to people familiar with their thinking.\n\n“She’s probably his longest-serving adviser now. Anytime I’ve gone [to see Trump], she’s either there or she’s just left,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Florida-based lobbyist who served as ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump administration.\n\nNot a golfer herself, Wiles spends most of her time with Trump huddling in offices at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club or Mar-a-Lago resort. People who speak to Trump regularly said he will often pause phone conversations to loop in Wiles, that alone being a supreme testament to her value. Last week, Wiles was seated to the right of Trump during a meeting at Bedminster with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, according to a photo posted by Orban’s spokesman.\n\n“‘It’s always, ‘Let me get Susie in here’ or ‘Make sure you tell Susie about that,’” said Caputo.\n\nBut if she needs to get something to Trump without delay, she has been known to make an appearance on the green as well. “She’ll jump in a cart herself and drive down to Trump if she needs to get something in front of him,” said one of the Trump advisers.\n\nUnlike Trump’s previous gatekeepers, Wiles doesn’t closely monitor whom he speaks with, according to several people familiar with the matter. Nor does she actively try to prevent contact with figures on the fringe, these people said. That includes a rotating cast of characters who indulge Trump’s obsession with the 2020 election or periodically introduce him to far-fledged conspiracy theories of their own. Wiles’ own view of whether the election was stolen is less clear-cut than her boss’, according to multiple people familiar with her thinking.\n\n“I don’t think she believes the election was stolen,” said a person close to Wiles. “She thinks we got beat by … not doing a good enough job of stopping states in the regulatory aspects of the election and that Democrats were smart and ruthless in using the Covid-19 pandemic to their advantage.”\n\nWiles “carefully rides the tent,” said Caputo. “She has to interact with people who think [the election was stolen], and people who don’t.” Several Trump advisers who were directly involved in organizing the “Stop the Steal” rally on January 6 or who assisted in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election have drawn intense scrutiny from the House select committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol. Wiles has not been asked to testify before the panel, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, nor has she been subpoenaed to testify in other ongoing inquiries related to election interference.\n\nSome of those allies are on weekly calls that Wiles holds with Trump’s political team, when she and his coterie of paid advisers discuss primaries on the horizon and how Trump-backed candidates are faring. More recently, she has been involved in conversations about how Trump can best position himself for a third presidential campaign. Wiles “touches everything,” as one Trump adviser described her role.\n\nOver time, these calls have endeared Wiles to the rest of Trump’s team. She will take time to praise aides and advisers by name for contributing savvy ideas and ensures everyone stays up-to-date on Trump’s upcoming travel, said people familiar with the calls. But she will also confront failures head on.\n\n“Susie is so sweet that everybody wants to please her – and maybe that’s part of her shrewdness – but when she has to discipline the motley crew that is Trump world, she doesn’t think twice about it,” said one of the people close to Trump.\n\nAbove all, it is Wiles’ competency and the former President’s belief that she isn’t profiting off him that set her apart, according to some of the longest-lasting faces inside Trump’s circle.\n\nAs one Democratic strategist in Florida put it: “If I was running for president, I would want Susie Wiles.”\n\nMaking her mark in GOP politics\n\nWiles has built a reputation for delivering hard truths to powerful men. Some of the most difficult words she’s had to share were with her father, the late sportscaster Pat Summerall, during a 1992 intervention to confront his alcoholism.\n\n“Dad, the few times we’ve been out in public together recently, I’ve been ashamed we shared the same last name,” Wiles said in a letter that was read during the intervention, according to Summerall’s 2006 autobiography. The words made his knees buckle, Summerall wrote. Only after hearing from Wiles did the former NFL kicker and legendary broadcaster agree to enter the Betty Ford Center for treatment.\n\nBy then, Wiles had already kick-started a successful path into politics. It wasn’t campus activism, Ronald Reagan, or a seminal moment that drew her in. The hypercompetitive political arena had simply felt like a natural fit for Wiles, who had grown up with two brothers in addition to being the only daughter of a professional athlete. In 1979, she was hired as an assistant for US Rep. Jack Kemp, an ex-teammate of Summerall’s on the New York Giants. Next, she jumped aboard Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign as a scheduler.\n\nAfter a few years in the Reagan administration, Wiles launched a consulting career in her native northeast Florida. She soon became a power player in Duval County, along with her then-husband Lanny Wiles, who was also active in Florida Republican politics (the two later divorced in 2017). There, she ran the district office for US Rep. Tillie Fowler, a Republican, before advising successive Jacksonville mayors, while raising two daughters.\n\n“I have rarely met someone with her instincts for politics and policy and where they intersect,” said John Delaney, the first of those mayors, who leaned on Wiles to sell voters on a multibillion-dollar tax increase to modernize the city. “She knows what to magnify that will resonate with the public.”\n\nAfter two decades in and around Jacksonville City Hall, Wiles in 2010 was asked to meet with a former health care executive named Rick Scott. A political novice and awkward public speaker, Scott had launched an eleventh-hour, self-funded GOP bid for Florida governor against state Attorney General Bill McCollum, a heavy favorite with support from most Republicans.\n\n“We told her, ‘Hey, we got a guy nobody knows, we’re behind by 50 points, come join us,’” said Curt Anderson, a top strategist on the Scott campaign. “She was able to immediately come in and bring a level of organization that kept people on task.”\n\nWith her candidate’s fortune at her disposal, Wiles engineered an upset over McCollum and the GOP establishment. Scott then managed a narrow victory in the general election. (He is now the state’s junior US senator.)\n\nAnderson recalled that before they pulled off Scott’s 2010 win, Republican operatives had warned Wiles and the campaign’s other advisers, “You’ll regret this, and you’ll never work in politics again.” So when Wiles later linked up with Trump – joining a campaign that her peers considered doomed – she was entering familiar territory.\n\nThe two first met during a Trump Tower rendezvous arranged by Wiles’ then-boss, lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard. At the time, most of Florida’s political class had sided with native sons Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio in the GOP presidential primary. Wiles, herself, didn’t come across as a Trump-type. She had helmed the fleeting 2012 presidential campaign of Jon Huntsman, whose high-road approach to politics was antithetical to Trump, and then helped Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign in Florida that year.\n\nTim Miller, who advised Huntsman’s campaign, said it was “bizarre” to watch Wiles align with Trump.\n\n“We were running a campaign on modernizing the Republican Party, and running on climate change and being decent to immigrants,” said Miller, a vocal critic of the GOP’s embrace of Trump. “You can’t think of a campaign further from the Donald Trump campaign than the Huntsman campaign.”\n\nBut Wiles felt the party needed a jolt from the outside. The two clicked, though Trump at first was unconvinced his campaign needed a full-time person in Florida.\n\nThat changed after Trump secured the nomination. Dissatisfied with his top Florida strategist Karen Giorno, Trump was convinced by advisers in September 2016 to consider adding Wiles to his campaign instead.\n\n“Susie was brought in to run battleground communications for us in a new role as the campaign was expanding,” said Bossie, who was then serving as his deputy campaign manager.\n\nAt first, Wiles was not a good fit with Trump’s style. “He likes someone who can command a room and fit the role he sees in his mind, and here’s this gray-haired matronly figure,” a source told CNN. “She’s not the one who is plucked out of central casting.”\n\nThe tension erupted in the final weeks of the race after a fundraiser at his Doral golf course, when Trump, convinced he was going to lose Florida and blaming his campaign team on the ground, unloaded on Wiles during a late-night meeting, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident. Wiles wondered if she should quit, one source said, and he considered letting her go just 10 days before the election.\n\n“In her words, it was a way she had never been spoken to in her life,” said a person close to both Wiles and Trump.\n\nBut Trump’s eventual victory in Florida earned Wiles a reputation as a talented fixer and Sunshine State savant. So in 2018, when Trump’s hand-picked choice for Florida governor – DeSantis, then a former congressman – was struggling in the campaign home stretch, Wiles was once again asked to take charge. With her in command, DeSantis eked out a 32,000-vote victory, the closest election for governor in state history.\n\nNot long after, the problems started.\n\nA public fallout\n\nDeSantis entered office a relative stranger to Tallahassee and the insular world of Florida state government. To guide his transition, he tapped Wiles, who also ran his political operation, and Gaetz, a former state lawmaker before he was elected to Congress and whose father had reigned as a powerful state Senate president. Together, Wiles and Gaetz built DeSantis an administration, interviewing potential department heads from her home in Ponte Vedra Beach, where they killed time watching birds in the estuary off her backyard, Gaetz said.\n\nDeSantis jumped out to a fast start, gaining national attention for his governing style while raising money at an impressive clip. But behind the scenes, a gulf emerged between him and Wiles. A person close to DeSantis said the governor’s wife, Casey, an influential voice in his orbit, privately questioned whether Wiles was more loyal to Ballard’s lobbying clients, and the couple grew skeptical of the allegiances of people she had hired. They purged staffers they viewed as too close to Wiles and marginalized her role in his political operation.\n\nThen came a revelation, outlined in internal memos published by the Tampa Bay Times in September 2019, that DeSantis’ political committee had planned to sell access to the governor to donors, including $100,000 to privately golf with him or $250,000 for an intimate gathering. Wiles had authored one of the memos, which made clear DeSantis and his wife approved the fundraising plan. DeSantis placed the blame on Wiles and cut her out of his circle, though he never explained to her why, a source said.\n\nTrump then removed Wiles from his reelection team at DeSantis’ urging, multiple sources confirmed. She stepped away from Ballard Partners, citing health issues.\n\nIn a matter of days, the most successful political operative in Florida was out of work.\n\n“It was tough for her both personally and professionally,” Delaney said.\n\nCaputo, the Trump adviser, called it a “terrible mistake” by DeSantis to let Wiles go. A source who worked for the governor remarked in 2019 to a reporter now with CNN: “How do you kick Susie Wiles out of your inner circle if you want to become President of the US?\n\nWiles remained on the sidelines until the summer of 2020, when Trump saw polling that suggested he was in trouble of losing Florida to Joe Biden. Several people lobbied for Trump to bring back Wiles, and he began floating the idea in conversations. Bossie tried to get DeSantis onboard, but the governor loudly argued against her rehiring. Meanwhile, Ike Perlmutter, the billionaire Republican donor who owns a home near Mar-a-Lago, sided with DeSantis and strongly pushed Trump to reconsider multiple times, sources familiar with those conversations told CNN. But Trump had made up his mind.\n\n“Trump basically said Susie running his 2020 Florida operation was the right answer. He first asked, ‘What do you think if we do this?’ and then the conversation went to Trump basically saying, ‘We are doing this,’” recalled a source familiar with Trump and Perlmutter’s conversations.\n\nA spokesman for the DeSantis campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the governor’s relationship with Wiles. Several Florida political insiders declined to speak to CNN about the DeSantis-Wiles saga on the record, citing concerns that they or their clients could face retribution from the governor.\n\nWiles’ return to Florida was a “game-changer,” said one source familiar with operations there. Trump gave her tremendous latitude to run his Florida operation, including resources to target voters who were not traditionally Republican, such as Latinos, school choice parents in the Black community and Jewish residents in Democratic strongholds. In Florida, Democrats traditionally had an advantage during early voting on Sundays, when Black churches organized “Souls to the Polls” voter drives. Trump’s Florida team started “Believers and Ballots” to get White Christians from church to early voting sites and saw strong returns.\n\nOne GOP operative in Florida said, “We were the only state that got exactly what we asked for from Trump. And that was all [Wiles].”\n\nIn the end, while Trump narrowly lost most swing states, he won Florida by a healthy 4-point margin.\n\n“She’s like the political Muhammad Ali,” said state Sen. Joe Gruters, chairman of the Florida GOP. “That’s why the President trusts her and works with her on the basis that he has already and probably will in the future.”\n\nA ‘difficult campaign’ ahead\n\nWith Trump and DeSantis potentially headed for a 2024 collision, some Republicans close to both men believe Wiles could be an X factor for Trump. She knows better than most DeSantis’ strengths and where his vulnerabilities lie, and she has developed a deep loyalty to Trump, people close to her say.\n\nWiles also has a record of unexpected victories she will want to preserve if she accepts a senior role in another Trump campaign, which could be markedly difficult due to his age, mounting legal troubles, and an emerging push by prominent Republican leaders for a crowded GOP primary. Justice Department officials are currently investigating Trump’s actions leading up to January 6 as part of its criminal probe of efforts to subvert the 2020 election outcome, while there’s a separate investigation in Georgia into possible criminal meddling in the state’s election results by the former President.\n\n“This will probably be one of her final acts in the political world,” said one of Trump’s advisers.\n\n“It’s going to be a difficult campaign no matter what anybody says,” added Caputo. “[Trump] will need 25 Susie Wiles.”\n\nWhile some Trump allies fear DeSantis could become another roadblock to the former President’s quest for a second term, Wiles, in her conversations with people inside Trump’s orbit, has downplayed the role she could play. She is known to say, “You run your race” – a mantra for focusing on your own campaign and not the other team – and is dismissive when asked by allies about the status of her relationship with the Florida governor.\n\n“I’m sure she knows some things that Ron wouldn’t want to have to deal with, but she is smart and knows her credibility is on the line, so she won’t go out there peddling rumor and innuendo,” said one of the people close to Wiles.\n\nStill, Wiles and DeSantis are not on speaking terms. DeSantis will attempt to win reelection this fall without Wiles on his team, though few expect him to need her.\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, however, Wiles is seen as indispensable. Even in the cutthroat environment Trump has cultivated around him, where unanimity is rare, his closest aides and advisers regard Wiles as a steady hand in one of the most tumultuous periods of his political career.\n\n“Out of all the people who have led his political operation, she has by far done the best job, and I don’t know that it’s particularly close in a lot of ways,” said one of the current Trump advisers.\n\nIt would seem, then, that Wiles would be an obvious choice to run Trump’s next campaign should he choose to pursue that path. But the most predictable thing about Trump is that he loves to be unpredictable.\n\n“Would I predict that she would run it? Yes,” said a source close to Trump. “Would it shock me if she got fired tomorrow? No. That’s just Trump world.”", "authors": ["Gaborr Steve Contorno", "Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/20/alaska-america-bathtub-miracle-glamping-opposition-news-around-states/49552231/", "title": "Alaska for America, bathtub miracle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Nearly two dozen organizations have sent a letter asking the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to investigate the state’s plan to use $400 million in pandemic relief funds to build two super-size prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2024/05/23/100-milwaukee-objects-for-culture-history-sports-food-drink-more/73307718007/", "title": "100 Milwaukee objects for culture, history, sports, food & drink, more", "text": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nSome of us used to say we were from Milwaukee with a hint of shame.\n\nBut there are signs everywhere we look that Cream City is rising. Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/highschool/2020/05/01/san-antonio-jefferson-high-school-boys-soccer-team-aspen-institute-healthy-sport-index/3064249001/", "title": "San Antonio's Jefferson High boys soccer team wins Healthy Sport ...", "text": "Brad Wolverton\n\nThe Aspen Institute\n\nSAN ANTONIO – In the small Mexican town where Ever Mejia grew up, many kids quit school by their early teens to help their families work the fields.\n\nMejia had bigger dreams – he wanted to attend an American university. But when he immigrated here in 2017, his odds weren’t good. He could barely speak English when he and his family moved into one of this city’s poorest neighborhoods.\n\nBut after enrolling in a nonprofit leadership program during his sophomore year at Jefferson High School, his fate turned. The lessons he learned through the Urban Soccer Leadership Academy (USLA), which provides mentorship and financial assistance to low-income players across San Antonio, have helped Mejia – and more than a dozen of his teammates on Jefferson’s boys soccer team – navigate the path to college.\n\nThree years ago, when USLA first started working with local students, 16% of Jefferson’s boys soccer players were accepted to college, but none attended. This year, 100% of the school’s players are expected to attend.\n\nThe program has helped Mejia’s teammates, some of whom came from even more difficult backgrounds than him. One grew up in a Honduran orphanage. Another spent time in an immigration camp in Florida. A Congo-born player fled his homeland along with eight siblings, among the thousands of people displaced by that country’s civil war.\n\nIn San Antonio – which has the highest poverty rate in the nation among the 25 largest metropolitan areas – the challenges have not subsided. Only half of the team’s 18 players have two parents in the home. One player, who’s 18, is helping to raise a young niece and nephew after his sister recently died.\n\nMany of Jefferson’s players live largely independent lives, as their parents toil at low-income jobs that barely feed their families. Their pain has been compounded in recent weeks as many of their parents have lost their jobs at restaurants, cleaning businesses and other companies as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJefferson was once considered one of the nation’s premier public high schools. Its alumni include two Nobel Prize winners, a Grammy Award-winning artist, and multiple NFL players, including Tommy Nobis, a former Pro Bowler and top pick in the NFL draft.\n\nBut 10 years ago, the school received an “academically unacceptable” rating from the state of Texas, as its graduation rate had plummeted. One of the school’s few bright spots was its powerhouse boys soccer program. Between 2009 and 2018, the team won four district championships. In 2014, it advanced to the fourth round of the state playoffs, the school’s best showing ever.\n\nDespite their on-field success, few Jefferson players were moving on to the collegiate ranks. In fact, many weren’t even finishing high school, as they had to start working full time to help support their families.\n\nEd Garza, a former mayor of San Antonio and Jefferson alum, wanted to change that pattern. Garza, the founder of USLA, approached his alma mater about a partnership.\n\nOver the past six years, dozens of Jefferson players have participated in his program, contributing to a sharp improvement in the team’s post-secondary success. In one recent graduating class, four of seven seniors went on to play college soccer, while all but one enrolled in college classes.\n\nAs winner of the Healthy Sport Index Contest for boys soccer, Jefferson serves as a leading example for other high schools to achieve positive outcomes in the three areas of health considered in the nationwide search by the Aspen Institute Sports & Society Program in partnership with Hospital for Special Surgery. Jefferson works to engage a large number of students (85) in physical activity, especially important when serving Hispanic youth, who have among the highest rates of obesity in the nation. The team’s playing style, with controlled passing, minimizes injuries. But the program stands out most by attending to the psychosocial needs of its students, who face many challenges to educational and personal advancement.\n\nStory continues below ...\n\n********************************************\n\nJefferson High School boys soccer team\n\nLocation: San Antonio, Texas\n\nTeam budget: $13,900 (includes $12,550 in combined salaries for three coaches). Urban Soccer Leadership Academy does not provide direct financial support.\n\nRoster size: 85 players (freshman, junior varsity and varsity combined), making soccer one of the largest sports at the school, with about the same number of participants as football.\n\nHistory: Between 2009 and 2018, Jefferson won four district championships. In 2014, it advanced to the fourth round of the state playoffs, the school’s best showing ever. Jefferson had a 20-4 record in 2019-20.\n\nCoach: Nick Torres\n\nAthletic trainer: Full time\n\n********************************************\n\nIndeed, the program has helped transform the way Jefferson players think about their lives, says Nick Torres, who has coached the team since 2011. Several times a month, USLA’s volunteer mentors speak with his team, providing tutoring and college-prep services, helping them create “vision” and “purpose” statements and inspiring them to align their daily actions with what they want for themselves and their families.\n\n“These are strong-willed kids with a strong sense of family,” Torres says. “This program has challenged them to put that strong will to use for them and their families.”\n\nFinancial issues aren’t the only challenges the team faces. Drug abuse is common in inner-city San Antonio, and the threat of deportation hangs over many families. (Last year the father of one Jefferson player was deported).\n\nMany Jefferson players are English learners, immigrants or first-generation students. Besides classroom help, they need advice navigating the path to citizenship, which Garza’s program helps to provide.\n\nJust as importantly, players need assurance that their school is a safe environment, Torres says. Twice this season, while practicing with their USLA team, players heard gunshots during practice and had to run off the field. Torres and Garza have worked with local law enforcement and health agencies to administer emergency-preparedness training for the team, including how to apply tourniquets.\n\n“You hope the boys never have to use something like that, but we want them to be prepared,” Torres says. “It gives them some peace of mind.”\n\nThe roots of the program\n\nGarza, 51, grew up a few blocks from Jefferson High, an ornately designed white-stone campus built in 1932, which some say resembles a Spanish estate. He still lives on the same street, three houses down from where he was raised.\n\nAfter serving two terms as San Antonio’s mayor and another two terms on city council, he turned his attention to the local school system and was elected to the San Antonio Independent School District in 2009.\n\nAround campus, he is a ubiquitous figure, overseeing team leadership training, providing individual tutoring and academic advice – even driving some kids home from practice.\n\nGarza and a group of volunteers started USLA in 2014, inspired to help inner-city kids have a safe place to play after school and in the summer. Once he hooks them with soccer, he invites them to education and leadership-training sessions that are open to all students, no matter if they play the sport.\n\nUSLA serves more than 1,000 kids a year, with an annual budget of about $280,000. A year after starting the program, Garza created a USLA club team for elite high school players. His goal was to support those who couldn’t afford to play competitively outside of their high schools. (Most travel teams cost $2,000 or more a year per player. For scholarship players, USLA subsidizes all but the uniform.)\n\nUSLA now fields three boys and two girls high school-age club teams, drawing from 32 San Antonio-area high schools (14 of Jefferson’s 18 varsity boys players participated this season). Garza also runs a summer rec league for 450 kids. To make it inclusive, he charges just $15 for three months of play.\n\nMore:How yoga benefits one high school boys basketball team\n\nGarza finances his program with government grants and financial assistance from local businesses and nonprofits. He thinks other community leaders could build similar programs by establishing clear, measurable educational objectives and tracking data to demonstrate the value of their programs, then working with community partners to fill students’ social and academic gaps with in-kind support.\n\nTorres says it would take someone special to pull it off. “I love what he does,” Torres says of Garza. “But to make another USLA – I don’t know who has the heart.”\n\nJose Segura, an 18-year-old Jefferson senior, joined the program after moving here eight years ago from Guanajuanto, Mexico. Before trying out for the USLA team, he had no formal training in the sport. He grew up playing the game by kicking a basketball around a concrete playground with friends. (No one could afford a soccer ball, he says).\n\nSince joining the academy, his game has flourished. He is a two-year captain on Jefferson’s team and one of the district’s leading scorers. In 2018, he was selected to the state’s Olympic Development Program.\n\nSegura’s parents moved here to give him and his sister more educational opportunities; neither of them made it past third grade. Next month, Jose will be the first in his family to graduate high school. He expects to finish in the top 100 of his class, with a 3.3 GPA.\n\nThe leadership program has taught him to prioritize his studies and manage his time better. “It’s taught me to do things directly,” he says. “If you wait, you’ll be late.”\n\nStory continues below ...\n\n***************************************************\n\nHealthy Sport Index Contest\n\nJefferson High School is the Aspen Institute’s Healthy Sport Index award winner for high school boys soccer. The Healthy Sport Index, developed in partnership with Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), helps the public make informed decisions about sport activities that meet the needs of youth. The Aspen Institute is searching for additional exemplary and innovative high school teams from many sports. The national search seeks teams that embrace best practices and innovate new ways to encourage physical activity, minimize injury risk and support athletes’ emotional, social and mental well-being. High school teams may be nominated here.\n\n***************************************************\n\n‘I know I can do something to help my family’\n\nOver the past decade, Jefferson has overcome many of its academic challenges, adding a prestigious International Baccalaureate program and improving its overall graduation rate to over 90%, up from 63% about a decade ago.\n\nMejia, who moved here from Guamúchil, Mexico, a two-day drive from San Antonio, is enrolled in Jefferson’s IB program. Before joining USLA, he says he didn’t have a plan for getting into or paying for college. “I was just doing what I had to do,” he says. “It wasn’t a focused goal.”\n\nOnce he learned about the college admissions process during USLA’s “college chats,” he changed his ways – but it hasn’t been all roses. An English learner, he has struggled to keep up with the IB curriculum. There were many times he wanted to quit – but his mother wouldn’t let him.\n\nMore:How one high school wrestling team dramatically increased participation by putting kids first\n\nA single parent, she works at two restaurants to care for her family, but she doesn’t allow her son to work more than one day a week. He helps build swimming pools on Saturdays, but only after his schoolwork is done.\n\n“Es primera la educación siempre,” Gina Mejia says. (“Education is always first.”)\n\nMejia says his mom is “muy duro” (“very tough”) on him – but the persistence has paid off. At the start of this semester, he was ranked among the top 35 students in the senior class, with a 3.75 GPA. That helped qualify him for a full scholarship to the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\nMejia wants to use his education to improve his family’s plight. Twice a year he visits his mother’s family farm in Guamúchil, where they grow beans, wheat, tomatoes and other vegetables. In college, he plans to study mechanical engineering, with hopes of designing a machine to protect the family farm against flooding.\n\n“I know I can do something to help my family,” he says.\n\n‘We turn into mom and dad’\n\nNot all Jefferson players are such good students. Last year, two of its players were among the 26 Jefferson students who failed to pass the state academic assessments required for graduation.\n\nIt was the job of Yareli Melendez, a district-wide instructional specialist, to work with those players. Despite their academic limitations, she was impressed with their work ethic. One of the players broke his arm but still showed up for tutoring.\n\n“He just never used it as an excuse,” Melendez says.\n\nAfter failing the test four times, both players passed on their fifth attempt – and both enrolled in community college the next fall.\n\nJefferson also employs a full-time family and community engagement specialist, Rebecca Zertuche, who works all hours answering parents’ questions and attending to students’ needs.\n\nA few years ago, she got a call from Garza in the middle of the night about a player who had just run away from home. She and her husband have fostered Jefferson players for years, including one three-year stretch when they had three extra teenagers in their house. (Their son, Andres, played on the freshman and JV teams this year.)\n\nTorres, who teaches physical education, gets as many opportunities as anyone to influence these students.\n\n“We get after ’em daily,” he says. “We turn into mom and dad.”\n\nFive days a week during the school year, Torres works with each of the school’s 85 soccer players on the school’s freshman, JV and varsity teams. Jefferson has different freshman and JV coaches, but Torres has every player in the soccer class they are all enrolled in.\n\nIn that class, players spend most of their time in the weight room or on the field doing high-repetition, low-weight lifting exercises and speed and agility training to build muscular endurance and avoid repetitive-stress injuries. In addition, Torres encourages his players to run track, play tennis and participate in other sports to give their muscles a break from soccer.\n\nAt 35, Torres is close enough in age to identify with the challenges his players are dealing with. Off the field, he hams it up with students, sharing memes on a group text chain and joking with players who hang out in his office.\n\nThe boys have nicknames for many players – from Mbappé (Josue Salazar, who resembles the star French player) to Gerber (Mejia, who looks like the Gerber baby). They call Torres “vasuca” (bazooka) for how hard he shoots the ball.\n\nTorres says he treats all of his players like they’re his own kids – which also calls for tough love. Last year, he disciplined a star player who was caught with drugs. The school has a three-strikes policy, but Torres told him if he found him with drugs again, he would kick him off the team.\n\nWhen the player used drugs again, Torres cut him. “If my kid was caught with drugs, your a-- is mine,” he says. “I couldn’t make an exception.”\n\n‘Make the field small’\n\nOn an early March afternoon, Torres put his team through a light workout ahead of a big game the next day against a district rival.\n\nJefferson plays a possession, flow-inspired passing game. “When at their best,” Garza says, “they execute possession passing and ball-on-the-ground attacks like a machine.”\n\nTorres placed four cones on one half of the field, representing a space slightly larger than the penalty area, and encouraged his players to practice one-touch passes.\n\n“Can we close the space?” he says. “Make the field small.\n\n“Tomorrow, all we’re looking to do is hit the target man’s feet,” he adds. “I want you on the run, rather than chasing through the air.”\n\nThat strategy, which reduces the need to head the ball, has helped Jefferson limit concussions, one of the most common – and concerning – injuries in the sport. Torres also avoids practicing headers to help reduce head injuries.\n\nStill, the team has had about three players per year over the past few years suffer concussions, says Charles Young, the school’s full-time head athletic trainer. He says that’s down from previous years, when heading was more prevalent.\n\nWhenever a player is concussed, Young requires them to sit out at least six days – one more than the state requires. Sometimes, players end up sitting much longer. This year, a head injury Salazar suffered kept him out of competition for multiple weeks.\n\nSome kids hide their injuries because they don’t want to go to the doctor over concerns that the bills will be too high, Young says. Others have a different fear, he says: “They’re afraid their parents will get deported.”\n\nStory continues below ...\n\n***********************************************************\n\nWhat We Like\n\nOther innovative health ideas by Healthy Sport Index Contest boys soccer finalists:\n\nBelleville High School (Belleville, Wisconsin): Coach Robert Gentilli finds that many high school boys are reluctant to admit they suffer from depression. So, Gentilli openly encourages players to speak up, and he says about 10 to 15 typically do each season. Gentilli says parents or teammates often identify players who are having problems, and he flags them for a school counselor. He also encourages players to talk about their problems within the team if they are comfortable doing so. “It’s an awesome experience to see these kids find each other and really rely on each other,” Gentilli says.\n\nKlein High School (Klein, Texas): Coach John Lawhon’s team heavily relies on short, quick passes to keep possession and control the game. This also has a valuable health benefit. By keeping the ball on the ground instead of frequently playing it through the air, soccer players can minimize injuries, such as to the head or lower body after jumping in the air. Many studies have confirmed that heading the ball may cause minor head injuries, which negatively exert their effects over time. The mildest level is a concussion. In a complicated concussion, the symptoms last longer and can present long-lasting cognitive disorders.\n\n***********************************************************\n\n‘The dads I didn’t have’\n\nThe next day, Jefferson’s players traveled across town to play the top-ranked team in the district. It was a game pitting one of the city’s poorest schools (Jefferson) against one of its wealthiest (Alamo Heights) – a fact not lost on the players.\n\nBefore the game, Fernando Osorio, a captain and one of Jefferson’s best players, gathered his teammates on the sideline.\n\n“Look at the field they got,” Osorio says, pointing to the immaculate turf. “Look at the field we got,” he says, referring to the bumpy dustbowl where his team practices.\n\nOsorio and his brother spent their elementary school years living in an orphanage in Honduras, working 10 or more hours a day. When he moved to this country, in 2014, he could hardly speak English. His classmates mocked his accent and called him a “wetback,” he says. He got in a lot of fights.\n\nBefore his eighth-grade year, Osorio taught himself to speak English by listening to songs and pushing himself to be uncomfortable speaking the language.\n\nWhen he was first asked about his “vision” and “purpose” in life in a USLA session, he dismissed the questions as silly. “I thought, ‘This isn’t going to help me – I just want to play soccer,’” he says. “I had to be humbled.”\n\nThat happened after he and his mother had a falling out, and he ran away from home. “I was very hard-headed,” Osorio says. “There are things you don’t understand sometimes, and you take it out on other people. I had a lack of forgiveness toward my family because they abandoned me.”\n\nOsorio eventually returned home, thanks in part to a Christian family that took him in. He says they “led me into God’s path.” He has since reconciled with his mom and “opened his heart” to Garza and Torres. He calls them the “dads I didn’t have.”\n\nGarza put him in touch with a pro bono lawyer who is helping him establish asylum. Torres has put him on the radar of college coaches he knows. But Osorio’s improved play has helped do that on its own.\n\nLast year, he made the state and regional Olympic Development teams, with a chance to try out for the national team. This spring, before coronavirus interrupted his team’s season, he had 23 goals and seven assists, helping his team to a 20-4 record.\n\nThe pandemic has thrown a new wrinkle into the lives of Jefferson soccer players. The school, which shut down in March, needed about a month to get laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots for all students, allowing classes to restart. The school has sent out lunches to the students who are on free or reduced lunch, delivering the meals on school buses.\n\nThe Jefferson soccer players and coaches stay in touch by text messages, but they have largely gone their separate ways. Some players started jobs or increased their work hours to help their families pay bills.\n\nOne of their final games together was that match in early March against Alamo Heights.

Authorities said the gunman fired a semi-automatic rifle from a business rooftop at crowds below before fleeing the scene.\n\nRobert E. Crimo III, 21, who was arrested later Monday in connection with the shooting in suburban Chicago, admitted to authorities he was the gunman, prosecutors alleged Wednesday during a court hearing where a judge denied Crimo bond.\n\nHe faces seven counts of first-degree murder and a sentence of life in prison, if convicted. Illinois abolished capital punishment in 2011.\n\n“I want a long sentence,” the suspect’s father, Robert Crimo Jr., said, according to a report by the Post. “That’s life. You know you have consequences for actions. He made a choice. He didn’t have to do that.”\n\nCrimo will face additional charges for those he wounded, along with the murder charges already filed, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart said. “It’s vital to the healing of this community that every single victim receives justice,” Rinehart told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday.\n\nAlso revealed publicly Wednesday: After the shooting, Crimo drove to Wisconsin’s capital of Madison on Monday and contemplated a shooting there before deciding against it, authorities said. That might have been one of two narrowly avoided mass gun attacks at July Fourth celebrations nationwide. Police in Virginia say a tip may have foiled a separate attack plot, unrelated to Crimo, in Richmond.\n\nIn Highland Park, residents have been paying their respects in the days following the shooting to those killed or wounded, with some overcome with emotion, others kneeling in prayer.\n\nA mourner visits a memorial for the victims of a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade, on Wednesday in Highland Park, Illinois.

Her grandparents were sitting “right across from where the shooter” was located, she told CNN.\n\n“Every single year of my life, we’ve gone to this parade, and they wanted to be there specifically so that when I passed by in the parade, I would be able to find them there,” Wathen said.\n\nHer grandfather was struck by shrapnel in his shoulder, barely missing his lungs, but doctors say he will make a full recovery, she said.\n\nThe trauma of the event, however, has “shaken a lot of people up,” she said. “It’s hard to say how we’ll be in a year, but for right now, it’s scary to even think about going back.”\n\nTwo people wounded remained hospitalized at NorthShore University Health System facilities as of Wednesday afternoon and were in stable condition, according to spokesperson Jim Anthony. A total of 39 people had been treated for injuries, he said, and an 8-year-old boy was transferred to UChicago Medicine Comer Children’s Hospital, which confirmed the child is in critical but stable condition.\n\nA woman views the candles and flowers left for the victims of the July 4th parade shooting on Tuesday, July 5, 2022 in Highland Park, Illinois.

WLS-TV/ABC7/Reuters In pictures: 4th of July shooting in Highland Park, Illinois Prev Next\n\nSuspect’s father thought he would use weapons at shooting range, report says\n\nThe suspect’s father decided to sponsor his son’s firearm owner’s identification card (FOID), a document needed to buy a weapon in Illinois, because he thought his son would take the weapons to a shooting range, the New York Post reported.\n\n“He bought everything on his own, and they’re registered to him,” Crimo Jr. told the Post.\n\n“They make me like I groomed him to do all this,” he said, according to the report, which comes amid questions over whether Crimo’s parents could face charges. “I’ve been here my whole life, and I’m gonna stay here, hold my head up high, because I didn’t do anything wrong.”\n\nIn a separate interview with ABC News, Crimo Jr. acknowledged he “filled out the consent form to allow my son to go through the process that the Illinois State Police have in place for an individual to obtain a FOID card.”\n\n“They do background checks,” he said. “Whatever that entails, I’m not exactly sure. And either you’re approved or denied, and he was approved.”\n\nCNN’s calls to Crimo Jr. have not been returned. Crimo Jr.’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, told CNN they would not be making any further public comments, “but the parents will continue to speak with law-enforcement and to assist them.”\n\nRinehart, the county state’s attorney, told CNN on Thursday there is no criminal liability for sponsoring someone’s FOID, but added the office is still going through evidence “in terms of who knew what when.”\n\n“There’s different ways to look at potential criminal liability in this case,” Rinehart said. “There’s not a, per se, violation of law if you vouch for somebody in a FOID card and they end up doing something terrible like this. But, having said that, we are continuing to investigate the case and continuing to explore all options.”\n\nIn addition to wanting to see his son serve a long sentence, Crimo Jr. told the Post he is “furious” over his alleged actions, adding that the night before the shooting, the two discussed a 22-year-old Danish man suspected of shooting and killing three people at a mall outside Copenhagen on Sunday.\n\n“He goes, ‘Yeah, that guy is an idiot.’ That’s what he said!” Crimo Jr. recalled, saying his son added, “People like that … (commit mass shootings) to amp up the people that want to ban all guns.”\n\n“I talked to him 13 hours before (Monday’s massacre). That’s why I guess I’m in such shock. … Like, did he have a psychiatric break or something?” Crimo Jr. said, per the Post.\n\nThe suspected shooter’s uncle, Paul Crimo, told CNN on Thursday that his nephew “showed no aggression towards me or nothing.”\n\n“There’s no indications of nothing, that I saw, that would lead to all this,” he told CNN. The uncle added that he did not know where his nephew got the money to pay for the guns he purchased and said he had no knowledge of them.\n\n“He lives in the back apartment, we don’t see each other,” he said.\n\n“I’m sorry, I mean, from the bottom of my heart, I mean, I’m devastated and my heart, my thoughts and prayers goes out to all the victims, the families and everybody that got hurt, the community, everybody,” the uncle added.\n\nSuspect contemplated second attack, police say\n\nFollowing the shooting in Highland Park, Crimo left the scene and drove to Madison, Wisconsin, where he “seriously contemplated” committing another shooting, according to Lake County Major Crime Task Force Deputy Chief Chris Covelli.\n\nThe firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered near the scene, but Crimo had another gun in his vehicle during his arrest, police said. That weapon was a Kel-Tec rifle, Covelli said Wednesday. Crimo had approximately 60 rounds of ammunition in his car at the time, Covelli added.\n\nWhen Crimo located another celebration in the Madison area, he “seriously contemplated using the firearm he had in his vehicle to commit another shooting,” Covelli said, though “indications are that he hadn’t put enough thought and research into it.”\n\nThe FBI alerted Madison police Monday afternoon that Crimo was on the run and may be in the area, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said Wednesday. “We feel for the grieving families in Highland Park and all those forever impacted by the events of Monday’s shooting. We recognize tragedy very well could have taken place in our own community,” said Barnes.\n\nAfter he was detained Monday evening in northern Illinois, Crimo “went into details about what he had done; he admitted to what he had done” in voluntary statements during questioning to Highland Park police, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo was appointed a public defender and is due in court again July 28.\n\nCovelli declined to address the suspect’s motive Wednesday, telling reporters he didn’t want to go into specific details about what Crimo told investigators.\n\n“However, he had some type of affinity towards the numbers 4 and 7, and the inverse was 7/4,” Covelli said, referring to Monday’s date, July 4. Crimo’s affinity “comes from music that he’s interested in,” said Covelli.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Chilling': CNN's Josh Campbell describes gunman's demeanor at hearing 01:05 - Source: CNN\n\nCrimo had purchased weapons in Illinois despite two encounters with police in 2019 over fears for his safety and that of others, information released by state and local police shows.\n\nHighland Park police received a report in April 2019 that Crimo had earlier attempted suicide, Covelli said Tuesday. Police spoke with Crimo and his parents and the matter was handled by mental health professionals, he said.\n\nIn September that year, a relative reported Crimo threatened family members – to “kill everyone” – and had a collection of knives, Covelli said. Police removed 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from their home.\n\nThe knives were “just a collection,” Crimo Jr. told the Post. “You know, I used to collect coins and baseball cards.”\n\nHighland Park police submitted a “Clear and Present Danger” report about the visit to the Illinois State Police, the state agency said. Family members were not willing to file additional complaints, the state police said in a Tuesday news release.\n\nThe knives confiscated by Highland Park police were returned the same day after Crimo’s father said they were his, the state police said.\n\nOver the next two years, Crimo legally purchased five guns, according to Covelli – including rifles, pistols and possibly a shotgun. Crimo passed four background checks between June 2020 and September 2021 when buying firearms, which included checks of the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System, state police said Tuesday.\n\nCrimo’s application for a FOID card – sponsored by his father because his son was under 21 – was not denied because there was “insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger” at the time, state police said.\n\nRinehart, the Lake County state’s attorney, declined to comment Wednesday on whether Crimo’s father or other relatives could face charges.\n\nParents of accused shooters historically haven’t been charged in mass shootings until recently – as in the case of a 15-year-old accused of killing four fellow students at a Michigan high school in November, CNN legal analyst Areva Martin said.\n\nMichigan prosecutors say the negligence of parents Jennifer and James Crumbley allowed their son, Ethan, access to the weapon used in that mass shooting. Each has pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nIllinois prosecutors would have to establish reasonable foreseeability if they want to prosecute Crimo’s father, Martin said.\n\n“The question this prosecutor’s going to have to ask (is) was it reasonably foreseeable that someone who had made a suicide attempt and who had threatened to kill others would lead that person … to commit the crime against the paradegoers,” she said.\n\n“And if the answer to that question is yes … there definitely could be manslaughter charges filed against his dad, who did sign that consent form and gave consent for him to gain access to the high-powered weapon and weapons that were used.”", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell Joe Sutton Rebekah Riess", "Travis Caldwell", "Joe Sutton", "Rebekah Riess"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/13/met-opera-cat-catch-slender-man-news-around-states/118816660/", "title": "Met Opera, cat catch, Slender Man: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission will ask lawmakers to revise the state’s medical marijuana law in order to get plants in the ground next year and make the products available to patients sooner, Al.com reports. The commission also voted to offer State Treasurer John McMillan the job of executive director of the new agency that will run the medical cannabis program. McMillan – who served two terms as state agriculture commissioner and is a former commissioner of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources – told the news outlet he expects to accept the job, which would require him to resign as state treasurer. Al.com reports Commission Vice Chair Rex Vaughn said he has been in discussions with lawmakers about moving up the start date for licensing cultivators from Sept. 1, 2022 to early 2022. The time required to grow the plants, which will be raised in greenhouses, is 90 to 110 days. The 14-member commission oversees a new agency that will license and regulate cultivators, processors, secure transporters, testing laboratories and dispensaries of medical marijuana products. It will be a seed-to-sale intrastate program, with products made from plants grown in Alabama. A special legislative session is expected this fall on redistricting. Another might be held on prison construction.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said President Joe Biden’s push to require millions of U.S. workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is “ill conceived, divisive and un-American.” “At a time in which we are called to work together, forced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty,” the Republican governor said Friday. Biden on Thursday outlined plans to mandate that employers with more than 100 workers require their employees to be vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus weekly. When asked Friday about critics who might sue over the plan, Biden said: “Have at it.” Dunleavy has faced some criticism for not issuing a statewide mask mandate and for not implementing a new disaster declaration to deal with a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. He has instead asked lawmakers to act on legislation intended to address staffing concerns raised by health care facilities. In a letter to legislative leaders this month, he said the virus is now “endemic,” and his administration is “adapting and proposing changes that make the response to the challenge more durable, and not subject to the whims of 30-day proclamations or health orders.” Still, in his statement, Dunleavy said it is “clear from the data and empirical evidence over the last year that the vaccine is the most effective way to fight COVID-19.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sold off $93 million in Unilever bonds and plans to sell the remaining $50 million it has invested in the global consumer products company over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories, the latest in a series of actions by states with anti-Israel boycott laws. The investment moves state Treasurer Kimberly Yee announced last week were mandated by a 2019 state law that bars Arizona government agencies from holding investments or doing more than $100,000 in business with any firm that boycotts Israel or its territories. Arizona appears to be the first of 35 states with anti-boycott laws or regulation to have fully divested itself from Unilever following Ben & Jerry’s actions. While Ben & Jerry’s, based in Vermont, is owned by London-based Unilever, it maintains its own independent board, which Unilever said makes its own decision on its social mission. Ben & Jerry’s announced July 19 that maintaining its presence in the occupied territories was “inconsistent with our values.” The Arizona law enacted in 2016 and revised in 2019 had broad, bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. He tweeted that the Ben & Jerry’s decision “is discrimination.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An appeals court has reversed a lower court judge’s order that the city must reinstate a police officer who was fired for fatally shooting a Black motorist. The Arkansas Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday reversed Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s decision last year regarding the firing of former Officer Charles Starks over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired his gun at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February 2019. Fox reversed the Little Rock Civil Service Commission’s decision to uphold Starks’ firing and instead imposed a 30-day suspension and reduction in salary. Starks resigned in September and accused the police chief of making his working conditions “intolerable” after his reinstatement. Starks pulled over Blackshire because the car he was driving had been reported stolen, though Blackshire’s family has said he borrowed it from a friend. Surveillance and dashcam footage showed that Starks instructed Blackshire to exit the parked car. Instead, Blackshire began to slowly drive away and bumped Starks, who fired into the windshield four times. The car briefly stopped, and Starks got onto its hood and fired at least 11 more times into the car as it continued to move.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers have approved what advocacy groups say are the nation’s strongest protections against falsely labeling items as recyclable when they in fact are destined for landfills. The measure sent late Thursday to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for his consideration would reserve the “chasing arrows” recycling symbol for items that actually can be recycled. The bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Ben Allen, said in a statement that it will force truth in advertising and “will reduce contamination in the recycling stream and improve the sorting process, thereby saving cities and ratepayers money while empowering consumers to make more informed decisions.” It’s among efforts in several states to ease confusion about recycling and increase recycling efforts. A Consumer Brands Association report recently asserted that confusion has led to “a broken recycling system in America.” A coalition of 14 opposition groups countered that the bill would have “resounding impacts” on the state’s goal to divert 75% of trash from landfills and hinder efforts to recycle packaging. The bill would likely require regulators to create a list of eligible items that “is extremely limiting,” potentially including just 15, the groups said – eight types of paper materials, two forms of glass, two types of metals, two types of plastics and one type of colored plastic.\n\nColorado\n\nGolden: Security workers will accompany nurses and staff members of Jefferson County Public Health’s three mobile vaccine units for the foreseeable future after months of harassment and abuse. One weekend this month, the agency was forced to pull vans off the street after a driver in Gilpin County, which contracts Jefferson County’s health agency, drove toward and destroyed signage around the van. Others “verbally abused” staff members Sept. 4, said Dr. Dawn Comstock, the agency’s executive director. These types of attacks have been going on for months, she said, but they’ve escalated to a higher degree. For instance, last month someone threw live fireworks into a tent of nurses and staff members, the Gazette reports. Despite the ongoing barrage of attacks and harassment, the county was still set to hold its COVID-19 vaccine events. “JCPH will not be intimidated out of its public health mission,” Comstock said. “We’ve arranged additional security measures to keep staff safe and will be working with our law enforcement partners to assure these handful of extremists are not allowed to infringe on the rights of those who want to be vaccinated.” Each incident has been reported to law enforcement, but each time the perpetrator has left the scene before officers arrived.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Tourism officials plan to spend more money than usual promoting the state’s fall foliage in an attempt help the industry rebound from the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont helped launch the $1.4 million “Full Color Connecticut” marketing campaign Friday, which he said will link leaf peeping to other attractions across the state. Tourism officials said the play on the fall colors is meant to highlight other colorful destinations in the state, “from the golds of corn mazes and the pinks of cotton candy to the blues of coastline sails and the ambers of craft beer.” The campaign’s budget is nearly triple the amount typically invested in a fall marketing program, officials said. It is designed to reach about 33% of the market in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island – compared to 10% in recent years – and expand into other markets, such as Philadelphia. The campaign also will take advantage of the state’s high COVID-19 vaccination rates, which tourism officials have said helped bring visitors to Connecticut this summer. The campaign will run through Nov. 20 and feature hundreds of tourism-related businesses, from the state’s parks and orchards to its casinos and shops.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Decades of structural defects and water damage have put a 30-year-old condominium complex at risk of collapse, but disagreements among condo owners over annual fees have prevented repairs from moving forward. “The buildings are deteriorating. We’ve been paying through the nose,” Michael “Mick” Donnelly said, comparing the situation at Le Parc, where he’s lived since 2009, to that of a condo that collapsed in June near Miami. “It’s been a nightmare situation similar to Surfside because the buildings are nearing condemnation and the people here don’t deserve it.” The fatal collapse of the 12-story condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, put many Le Parc residents on edge. Most of the issues found to have contributed to the collapse of the over 130-unit Champlain Towers South on June 24 mirror long-standing problems Le Parc owners have endured. Le Parc Condominiums – consisting of three four-story buildings housing 76 units – has faced similar issues to those at Champlain Tower South, including shoddy construction practices, design flaws, the developer going bankrupt, and decades of deterioration and water infiltration. While some emergency work was done, a permanent fix – estimated to cost $4.5 million – has been on hold nearly five years due to a lack of funds and financing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education, joined D.C. middle school students and families Friday, welcoming them back to classrooms and honoring the educators who made it all possible, WUSA-TV reports. The first lady spoke at Brookland Middle School and delivered words of encouragement while acknowledging the challenges of the past year and a half during the coronavirus pandemic and highlighting goals to come. “We are going to partner with you because we don’t always know what the future holds, but we do know what we owe our children,” she said, while affirming that the administration will ensure schools like Brookland have the resources and support to continue in-person learning. “We owe them a promise to keep their schools open as safe as possible. We owe them a commitment to follow the science. We owe them unity so that we can fight the virus, not each other.” Meanwhile, the president emphasized the necessity of COVID-19 shots. “Parents, get your teens vaccinated – you’ve gotten them vaccinated for all types of other things,” he said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, easy and convenient.” Biden also celebrated D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s vaccination efforts and her success in setting up 20 inoculation sites at local schools\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Gardens: The most notable catch in Saturday’s NCAA football game between Miami and Appalachian State didn’t happen on the field. It wasn’t even a football. It was a cat. The animal somehow got into Hard Rock Stadium, then got caught by one of its paws off the facade of the upper deck in the first quarter. It eventually fell to the lower level of the stadium, where fans using an American flag as a makeshift net were able to safely break its fall and catch it before it was carried off to safety. “They were trying to grab it from above, and they couldn’t reach it, but they were scaring it downward,” said Craig Cromer, a facilities manager at the University of Miami and season ticket holder who with his wife, Kimberly, brings the flag to each home game. “It hung there for a little while with its two front paws, then one paw, then I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s coming soon.’ ” That’s when the Cromers unhooked the flag from the railing and hoped for the best. The petrified cat fell, bounced a bit off the flag, and eventually was secured by some in the student section before being brought away by stadium security. “I’ll tell you, if the cat will help us in our red-zone offense, I’m going to see if we can give it a scholarship,” Miami coach Manny Diaz said. Some videos of the incident were posted on Twitter, tagged #HardRockCat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s transit authority is soliciting public input for the exterior graphic design of new railcars. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is encouraging current and potential future riders to vote for one of four design options through its website or on its social media pages. All four designs include MARTA’s traditional color scheme and are inspired by “the dynamism and movement of trains,” according to a news release. The transit authority says more than 1,300 people participated in a similar crowdsourcing effort in the spring that sought input on the interior design of the railcars. Those votes and comments revealed that the most popular interior features are digital maps, next station and destination displays, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessible seating and signage, the release says. “We were thrilled with the response we received on the interior features and are eager to see what riders think of the exterior design options,” MARTA General Manager and CEO Jeffrey Parker said in the release. The new railcars are slated to arrive in stations in 2023.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige is requiring government contractors and visitors to state facilities to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. Ige’s executive order issued Thursday takes effect Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. State contractors must attest to their employees’ vaccination status or provide weekly tests for unvaccinated staff. Contractors also must wear masks and maintain physical distance while on state property. The order also applies to visitors to state facilities. It does not apply to beaches or outdoor state properties. Inmates at correctional facilities, patients at state hospitals, and children under 12 or students attending state public or charter schools are exempt. Travelers arriving at airports are also exempt. The order says it is intended for the “safety of the government workforce during this ongoing escalation in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths resulting from the delta variant.” Last month, Ige issued an executive order requiring state and county employees to be either vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Northern Idaho’s long, deep streak of anti-government activism has confounded attempts to battle a COVID-19 outbreak overwhelming hospitals in the deeply conservative region. A deadly 1992 standoff with federal agents near the Canadian border helped spark an expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country, and the area was for a long time the home of the Aryan Nations, whose leader envisioned a “White Homeland” in the county that is now among the hardest-hit of the pandemic. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so packed with COVID-19 patients that authorities announced last week that facilities would be allowed to ration health care. “This is extremism beyond anything I ever witnessed,” Tony Stewart said of people who refused to get vaccinated and wear masks. Stewart is a founding member of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, which battled the Aryan Nations for decades and helped bankrupt the neo-Nazi group. “I’m almost speechless in seeing so many people have lost concern for their fellow humans.” Anti-government sentiments are strong in northern Idaho. State Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, refused an interview request, saying reporters were liars. She has promoted mask-burning protests and is among lawmakers who have frequently pushed COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Lawmakers are considering whether to put a statue on state Capitol grounds of Ronald Reagan, the Illinois native who served as the country’s 40th president. Members of the House Statue and Monument Review Task Force met Wednesday to discuss Reagan’s legacy and whether to memorialize him at the statehouse in Springfield, where there are statues of two of the four U.S. presidents who were either born in or launched their political careers from the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant are represented on the Capitol grounds, but not Reagan or Barack Obama, who started his political career in the Illinois Legislature. Reagan was born in Tampico and raised in Dixon. He later had an acting career in Hollywood before becoming governor of California. Rep. Mary Flowers, D-Chicago, the chairwoman of the task force, said that “whether we agree with his policies or not … (Reagan) had a profound impact on the direction of this country.” She noted Reagan’s “made-for-TV” presidency produced images and ideas that remain with the U.S. today – for better or worse. His “It’s Morning Again in America” campaign ad created an idealistic vision of the country, she said, but he also is credited with the offensive phrase “welfare queen.” The task force will continue to take public comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nLogansport: The body of a Marine who was among 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing during the U.S.-run evacuation at Afghanistan’s Kabul airport was returned Sunday to his northern Indiana hometown. A military procession marked the beginning of memorial services for Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto Sanchez, 22, of Logansport. Sanchez’s body arrived Sunday morning at Grissom Air Reserve Base. The procession then headed about 20 miles to Logansport. People lined the route to show their respects, many with American flags, and jets flew overhead as the procession approached downtown Logansport. It stopped briefly downtown, where the hearse carrying Sanchez’s body paused under a garrison flag. The procession included Indiana State Police and vehicles carrying Sanchez’s family, followed by thousands of motorcycles. Sanchez was among 17 members of his Logansport High School class who joined the military after their 2017 graduation. He died in the Aug. 26 attack in Kabul, where he had been transferred after serving as a U.S. embassy guard in Jordan, according to his obituary. A public visitation is scheduled for Monday at LifeGate Church in Logansport. The funeral is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the church. Burial will follow at Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge declined Friday to halt enforcement of a law that prohibits school boards from enacting mask requirements, saying there is no evidence that any school board would immediately impose a mask mandate if the law weren’t in effect. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Frances Parr, a mother of twin boys from Council Bluffs. She sued the state, Gov. Kim Reynolds and several state officials last month in Polk County District Court, seeking an order halting enforcement of the law. Judge Celene Gogerty, who was appointed to the bench by Reynolds in November 2018, said Parr has presented no evidence that a temporary injunction would alleviate Parr’s alleged harm caused by the law. Parr has asserted the law violates her constitutional rights. Her sons were set to start first grade in the Council Bluffs Community School District this fall, but she is teaching them at home over fears for their safety because the school cannot require other students to wear masks. Parr also has asked Gogerty to issue an order for a universal mask mandate for all students and school personnel until a voluntary plan can be implemented that separates mask-wearing students and staff from those who refuse. That request has not yet been argued before the judge but is another available remedy, Gogerty said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hospitals across the state will receive $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds for extra pay for nurses to keep them on the job but will be required to report monthly on how many nurses they’ve lost and why, under a plan a state task force approved Friday. Kansas law required a bipartisan pandemic response task force to spell out how the $50 million would be spent, and the task force added the reporting requirement. The task force’s meeting came a day after President Joe Biden imposed new vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans. Republican officials in Kansas and across the nation strongly criticized Biden’s mandate. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, proposed the reporting on nurses who’ve been terminated. He called Biden’s new federal vaccine requirements “dictatorial edicts.” “We’ve had front-line workers – I mean, you can call them heroes – on the front lines for the last year and a half,” Masterson said. He also said he worries that “we’re gonna get some of them premium pay, and we are going to give some others a pink slip.” Earlier in the week, Masterson proposed to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives – a proposal that failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Lawmakers grabbed the quarterback role to direct the response to COVID-19, but when it came time to lead, the GOP-led Legislature “punted” the decision on mask-wearing in schools to local boards, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. A day after a special legislative session ended, Beshear gave a blistering response to the Legislature’s decision to halt statewide mask mandates to combat Kentucky’s worst surge of the coronavirus pandemic. He declared that the Legislature “owns this pandemic moving forward.” Legislators passed bills Thursday that scrapped a statewide mask mandate for public schools and imposed a ban on any statewide mask rules until June 2023. Beshear vetoed the mask-related language, but Republican lawmakers overrode him before ending their three-day session. “The masking decision the General Assembly made was wrong. And it was also a punt,” Beshear told reporters. “I’ve been willing to make the calls, to take the hits, to make the plays. And the Legislature asked to go in … at QB. And what did they do? They punted on first down. When you’re in charge, it means you’ve got to make the decision. This one was to push the decision to others.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Supply trucks are once again delivering beer on Bourbon Street, and the landmark Cafe Du Monde is serving beignets, fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar, even though there aren’t many tourists or locals around to partake of either. With almost all the power back on in New Orleans nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ida struck, the city is showing signs of making a comeback from the Category 4 storm, which is blamed for more than two dozen deaths in the state. More businesses are opening daily, gasoline is easier to find, and many roads are lined with huge debris piles from cleanup work. Thousands are still struggling without electricity and water outside the metro area, and officials say oppressive heat is contributing to health problems and misery. It could still be weeks before power is restored in some areas, and many residents who evacuated haven’t returned. “It is not lost on anybody here at the state level and certainly not on our local partners just how many people continue to suffer,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. “While things are getting better, and we can be thankful for that … this is going to be a very long-term recovery.”\n\nMaine\n\nPhippsburg: A group wants to create an oyster reef off the town’s coast to improve water quality, protect a shoreline from storm surges and act as a habitat for other smaller shellfish. The oyster reef is part of the fight against “the immense amount of change” that’s taking place because of climate change in waters off the Maine coast, Marissa McMahan, a senior fisheries scientist at Manomet, a Brunswick-based conservation nonprofit, told the Times Record. The project is the continuation of a two-year pilot program the Nature Conservancy began in 2017. The conservatory’s goal was to see if an oyster reef could be grown on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than 99% of the world’s large bodies of saltwater, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Phippsburg group is growing oysters in bags that float on the surface of the water. They’ll eventually be released into the ocean with a hope that they’ll attach to one another and grow as a vertical structure. Oysters benefit the environment because they filter algae, creating clearer, cleaner water that can support underwater grasses used for habitat by crabs, scallops and fish. They also can break up waves and reduce shore erosion.\n\nMaryland\n\nBethesda: Activists are calling for the return of a Black cemetery to a church decades after it was erased by development. The Rev. William J. Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the Poor People’s Campaign, spoke by Zoom to participants at a Friday rally, which organizers said included descendants of those buried at the Moses African Cemetery and members of the Macedonia Baptist Church. The church plans to restore the cemetery and build a monument and museum on the site. The Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition sued Montgomery County’s Housing Opportunities Commission last month claiming that part of the cemetery is beneath the parking lot of the Westwood Tower Apartments, news outlets report. The housing agency owns the property and apartment building and uses the rental income to cover costs of the agency. An estimated 500 bodies of enslaved people or relatives of the enslaved rest at the cemetery, the lawsuit says. The plaintiffs argue that selling the parcel that was used as a burial ground without court approval violates state law. Last week, a Montgomery County judge temporarily blocked the $51 million sale of land that includes the Westwood Tower Apartments, WTOP-FM reports. The temporary restraint forbids the sale until a Sept. 27 hearing on the matter.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: The body of a U.S. Marine killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan returned home Saturday in a solemn procession through Massachusetts on the 20th anniversary of the attacks that led to America’s longest war. Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo died in the Aug. 26 bombing near the Kabul airport where people were being evacuated amid the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A dozen other U.S. service members and 169 Afghans were killed as people struggled to get into the airport and on flights out of the country. Dignitaries including Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Kim Janey and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey paid their respects to Rosario Pichardo’s family as her body arrived at Boston’s Logan International Airport. In her hometown, Lawrence, people lined highway overpasses and streets waving American flags as the vehicle procession made its way through the city near the New Hampshire state line. A Marine honor guard carried the flag-draped draped casket into the Farrah Funeral Home as police, firefighters and others stood and saluted. “We will never forget her name,” Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez said afterward. “We are proud to have her home.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill that would have restricted state officials’ ability to use the Public Threat Alert System to announce new laws or executive orders. The Democratic governor, whose veto had been expected, said the system has only been activated once in the five years since it was created, for an active-shooter situation. The state used a different, federal system last year to send alerts to wireless devices about Whitmer’s stay-at-home and mask orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. That angered GOP lawmakers who said it should only be activated for “immediate” threats. That system would not have been affected by the state legislation. In a letter to legislators, the governor said the bill “would add complexity to the administration of the state’s public threat alert system, making it harder for law enforcement officers to do their jobs and making Michiganders less safe. … There is no need to further limit or complicate its use.” The measure had cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature mostly along party lines. The federal Wireless Alert System allows four types of messages: presidential alerts, imminent threat alerts, AMBER alerts and – as of 2019 – public safety messages designed to save lives or safeguard property. People can opt out of the latter three.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: Authorities said Sunday that a vast majority of the Greenwood Lake wildfire in northern Minnesota is contained, one month after lighting ignited the blaze in the Superior National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service reported that the nearly 27,000-acre fire was 67% contained as of Sunday morning. The Forest Service had said last week that the fire was nearly half under control as hundreds of firefighters were still being dispatched to the area. “I think the team is feeling really good about how things are looking out there. There’s been a lot of great work done and progress made taking advantage of this cooler weather,” Fire Service spokeswoman Stefani Spencer said. “The containment is pretty much growing every day.” Spencer added that the public is happy to have roads open, including all traffic opened along Highway 2. She said the closure was an inconvenience and frustration for folks traveling to Ely and the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Star Tribune reports. The fire started Aug. 15 about 10 miles southwest of Isabella has destroyed 14 cabins and homes along with 57 outbuildings. Some residents in the affected area who were evacuated have recently been allowed to return to homes and cabins after the fire lost intensity.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Physicians who spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines could now have their licenses to practice medicine suspended or completely revoked, according to a new policy adopted by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. The policy, adopted Sept. 7, says doctors have an “ethical and professional responsibility” to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and share factual and scientifically grounded information with them. “Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,” the policy says. Whether physicians “recognize it or not,” they possess a high degree of public trust due to their specialized knowledge and training, giving them “a powerful platform in society,” it says. The policy specifically warns doctors against spreading misinformation on social media and strongly recommends physicians separate their personal and professional content online. “Physicians must understand that actions online and content posted can affect their reputation, have consequences for their medical careers, and undermine public trust in the medical profession,” it says.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: Thieves in the Kansas City area have in the past month have taken two churches’ fruit harvests. Hosanna! Lutheran Church in Liberty had planned to harvest grapes it grows after a Sunday worship service earlier this month, WDAF-TV reports. But members discovered that all 1,500 pounds of grapes had been stolen, apparently cut off their vines. The church has for about 15 years had the grapes bottled for communion wine. The harvest is a big annual event, especially for children in the congregation. The grapes were valued at $1,500. “This wasn’t really about theft of grapes,” said Pastor Mike Kern. “We don’t care about the value. It was more of a theft of joy.” Kern’s church was not alone. St. Peter and All Saints Episcopal Church in Kansas City reported that four of its apple and pear trees were recently picked clean, too. The anticipated harvest was three or four years in the making. The Rev. Jonathan Frazier said the Episcopal church donates its fruit to a nearby food pantry and a downtown homeless shelter. “So it’s just really sad because for somebody to take that quantity of fruit, they’re probably going to sell it,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Glacier National Park’s reservation system for Going-to-the-Sun Road, which ended last week after a three-month trial run, caused countless headaches for locals and outsiders who struggled to secure $2 tickets, but park officials say it worked as intended, alleviating traffic congestion inside the park and preventing long lines of cars from spilling onto U.S. 2. “Generally we do feel it was a success because it met our major goals,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Kerzman told the Daily Inter Lake. Kerzman noted the park never had to close the west entrance, as it has been forced to do in past seasons, and there were never more than about 15 cars backed up on the highway. In recent years, she said, traffic jams have stretched for miles from West Glacier to Coram. Additionally, the reservation system helped ensure that many visitors could find parking and access their desired trailheads and campsites. “We feel that we were able to manage the number of visitors and be able to ensure a good experience for everybody,” Kerzman said. Of course, not everyone was enamored by the new approach to crowd control. One recent review on tripadvisor.com called the reservation system “a disgrace” that made it “impossible” to access the park and prompted the author to cancel their visit, losing money on a hotel booking.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Starting in early 2022, public transit will be more widely available in the city and surrounding communities. To address the increasing demand for public transit in Northeast Nebraska, the newly renamed North Fork Area Transit announced new services that will provide “safe, efficient and affordable” public transportation. A new flexroute bus service called “Forklift” will provide rides along three routes and the addition of almost 100 bus stops across the community, said Steve Rames, Norfolk’s public works director. The Norfolk Daily News reports that Forklift, which will operate seven days a week, will also allow anyone who lives within three-quarters of a mile from any marked bus stop to schedule curbside service. The flexroutes will run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The system will likely rotate on 30-minute cycles during peak times and one-hour cycles during non-peak times, Rames said. The North Fork Area Transit’s existing call-ahead ride service will continue but under a new name, “Telelift.” With Telelift, riders are able to schedule a ride 24 hours in advance. Service is available up to 30 miles around Norfolk, seven days a week, Rames said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A change in newly issued Nevada driver’s licenses means airport security screeners may have to manually check the credentials because their scanners can’t read the bar codes, officials said. The Transportation Security Administration hasn’t yet updated its scanning system to account for a minor change to the bar code on the state’s new license design, said Kevin Malone, a state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman. TSA agents at U.S. airports can manually inspect a license if the scanning system won’t read the bar code, TSA Lorie Danker spokeswoman said. The state began issuing licenses with the new design in July. A note on the DMV’s website recommends that travelers allow extra time to complete airport security screening.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBrentwood: Dozens of families have challenged mask-wearing policies in New Hampshire school districts during the coronavirus pandemic, with two cases in court Friday calling for injunctions to stop enforcing them. A lawyer representing families in the Epping, Londonderry and Timberlane districts argued at a Rockingham County Superior Court hearing that mask mandates violate the parents’ rights to make health care and medical decisions for their children, and they are illegal restraints under a state law that limits the use of child restraint practices in school. “Their children have difficulty breathing with these masks on,” attorney Robert Fojo said. “It’s causing them to be afraid; they suffer anxiety and stress as a result of wearing these masks, experiencing lightheadedness and trouble concentrating. Masks irritate their skin, cause acne. It exacerbates already inherent problems that they have, such as asthma, difficulty with speech, learning-related disabilities, and obviously a distraction. They inhibit social interaction, which is what these children should be doing in school.” Attorneys for the school districts have argued for the case to be dismissed, saying the districts have been following a “tool kit” for schools from the state Department of Health and Human Services that recommends mask-wearing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Four more counties have received a major disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paving the way for residents of Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Union counties to access federal assistance in the wake of the remnants of Hurricane Ida, Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed. The declaration comes after Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic and Somerset counties received declarations from the White House last Monday. The declaration allows for assistance with needs like grants for temporary housing and home repairs, among other things that will help residents and business owners in the aftermath of Ida. There also will be federal funding available to all levels of government as well as some nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work to repair or replace facilities damaged by the storm in the designated counties. Many in Essex County had been pushing for a disaster declaration after the area got crushed by Ida. Montclair officials had hoped for FEMA to include the county after the storm brought “devastating” flooding. In Montclair, which received 7.5 inches of rain, at least 50 drivers were rescued from cars and countless more ruined, more than 150 basements needed to be pumped out, officials said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Native American communities across the state are putting the finishing touches on proposed redistricting maps aimed at greater self-determination in future public elections, as competing plans wind their way toward the Legislature for consideration. Participants in a redistricting commission for New Mexico’s Indigenous pueblo communities said Friday that map proposals may be finalized as soon as this week. The maps will be submitted to a seven-member Citizen Redistricting Commission that is reviewing and vetting redistricting maps for the Legislature, which can adopt recommendations or start from scratch. The seven-seat commission has no Native American representation. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, whose growing political clout is reflected in the election of Laguna Pueblo tribal member Deb Haaland to Congress in 2016 and her promotion this year to secretary of the interior. Attorney Joseph Little is working with a broad alliance of Native American communities to turn redistricting principles into action using results of the 2020 census to track population changes. Major redistricting changes are most likely in the heavily Native American northwest region of the state and an oil-producing region in the southeast.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: For the first time in 550 days, an audience was inside the auditorium at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday night, attending a Metropolitan Opera performance of Verdi’s “Requiem.” The night of multiple extended standing ovations was in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but in fact marked much more. The company was performing in its home for the first time since hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic, including Met violist Vincent Lionti, assistant conductor Joel Revzen and chorister Antoine Hodge. It also marked the first performance in the house since the death of conductor James Levine, the Met’s towering figure of the last half-century. He died in March at 77, a little over three years after was he was fired for sexual improprieties. Levine’s successor as music director on the podium is 46-year-old Yannick Nezet-Seguin. The pandemic caused the Met to cancel more than 275 performances, including its entire 2020-21 season, plus an international tour. The gap was the longest since the company began in 1883. A series of Broadway shows will start opening this week. The New York Philharmonic begins Friday at Alice Tully Hall, while David Geffen Hall undergoes reconstruction expected to last another year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judge has set a mid-October deadline for state lawmakers to follow a court-ordered plan to provide full funding for improving public education, or he will take action himself. State Superior Court Judge David Lee said he was “very disheartened” that the General Assembly is funding a small part of a plan calling for at least $5.6 billion in new education funding by 2028, news outlets report. Lee has scheduled a court hearing Oct. 18 and said if the plan isn’t fully funded by then, he will consider options on how the court can resolve the matter. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, also accused Lee of overstepping his authority, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Lee’s warning marks the next stage in the Leandro school funding case first filed in 1994 by low-wealth school districts to get more state funding. The case is named after a Hoke County student who has since graduated from college. The North Carolina Supreme Court assigned Lee to oversee the case after Judge Howard Manning retired. Over the years, the state’s highest court has ruled that the North Carolina Constitution guarantees every child “an opportunity to receive a sound basic education” and that the state wasn’t meeting that standard.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agriculture officials have confirmed a second case of cattle anthrax in Kidder County. The case was confirmed by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on Friday, according to the state Agriculture Department. The first case was reported in August. Officials say producers in the county and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax. The disease is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as drought. Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Two cases of anthrax were reported in North Dakota in 2020. In 2005, more than 500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported, with total livestock losses estimated at more than 1,000.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Police Department is pledging to increase recruitment of female officers to reach the goal of a force composed of 30% women by the year 2030. The department announced it is joining the New York University School of Law’s “30x30 Pledge.” In addition to recruitment, Cincinnati police also want to improve the retention and promotion of women in policing. According to a memo from the Cincinnati City Manager’s Office, the force is currently 22.7% female, compared to the national average of 13%. Officials say about 100 departments throughout the country have signed the pledge. “The goal of the pledge is not only to inform agency progress but also to identify and understand barriers to progress such as resources, capacity or authority,” the manager’s office reported. Officials said the police force should also be representative of the population it serves, which is 51% female.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has rejected a request to remove two members of the state’s Pardon and Parole Board from a high-profile death penalty case. The court’s brief ruling Friday denied a prosecutor’s request to remove Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle from considering the commutation request of Julius Jones, who was sentenced to death for the 1999 killing of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. The ruling came after a lawyer for District Attorney David Prater argued before a court referee that unless members Luck and Doyle were barred from taking part in the decision, the five-member board would likely recommend that Jones’ sentence be commuted following a hearing Monday. Prater, who argued that Luck and Doyle have a conflict of interest because of their work with released inmates, said in a statement that he respects the high court’s decision. “This is the system I operate in every day and I believe in it, though decisions don’t always go as I desire,” Prater wrote. He said his office is prepared to present “the truth of the circumstances” surrounding the fatal shooting of Howell during a carjacking. “If the Board objectively considers the truth, they will quickly vote to deny the killer’s commutation request,” Prater wrote.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Transportation Commission has granted conditional approval to a plan to expand Interstate 5 through Portland’s Rose Quarter as well as build a cap over the freeway to allow for the redevelopment of a Black community destroyed when the interstate was first built. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the commission’s unanimous decision Thursday follows the recommendation of Gov. Kate Brown that the Oregon Department of Transportation pursue “hybrid option 3.” That plan would essentially tunnel the freeway and provide economic opportunity for the region’s Black community in an effort to reclaim the Albina district. Supporters say the idea is to remediate historic harm caused by the freeway’s original construction and displacement of community members. Approval of the hybrid 3 model is contingent upon ODOT providing a thorough analysis of the project’s cost structure and funding sources by December. It also requires ODOT and its contractors to update its diversity and subcontracting plans and to reevaluate the project’s initial environmental impact study. The project’s cost has risen significantly from its initial price tag of between $715 million and 795 million to upward of $1.18 billion.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Some physicians are offering stock doctor’s notes for use by parents wishing to have their children exempted from wearing masks in school, according to state health officials who say they have referred the matter for possible disciplinary action. A statewide, universal mask mandate for Pennsylvania schools went into effect Tuesday as the Wolf administration seeks to keep school buildings open for in-person learning amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The acting health secretary’s face covering order contains an exemption for students for whom wearing a mask would cause or worsen a medical condition. But parents in districts that require a doctor’s note or other medical documentation have complained it’s been difficult to find a physician who will sign off. The Health Department said some doctors are pushing stock exemptions available to anyone. “The administration is aware that some physicians have indicated that they intend to offer blanket ‘exemptions’ to individuals with whom they have no treatment relationship, and regardless of whether the individual’s physical condition required an exemption,” the department said in a statement. Those doctors “have been and will be referred to the appropriate licensing boards for possible disciplinary action.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: A pond has been closed to shellfish harvesting after seven people reported becoming ill after consuming raw shellfish harvested in the area last month. The state departments of health and environmental management said Saturday that Potter Pond in South Kingstown will be closed until further notice. The agencies said two of the sickened individuals tested positive for Campylobacter Jejuni. People with Campylobacter infection usually have diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps as well as nausea and vomiting, the agencies said. The symptoms usually start after two to five days and last about one week. The agencies advise anyone who consumed shellfish from the area and is feeling ill to seek medical attention, as more serious complications can develop. Health officials say they’ve contacted all commercial harvesters in the area to ensure that any product harvested during the time frame under investigation is not sold at restaurants and markets. They’re also urging recreational harvesters who collected shellfish between Thursday and Saturday in the pond to either discard them or avoid consuming them raw or undercooked. Officials say quick steaming isn’t sufficient to prevent illness, but cooking the shellfish until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce risk.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawsuit filed in federal court is asking a judge to overturn a requirement in state ethics laws that makes it illegal for anyone who files a complaint against a public official from talking about it unless the complaint is found valid. The lawsuit is filed by a whistleblower who says a state lawmaker broke ethics laws by voting in favor of a special interest that paid the legislator $108,000 over three years through contracts with firms with ties to the lawmaker. The State Ethics Commission rejected the complaint after discussing it behind closed doors, saying the lawmaker taking money from a subsidiary of the special interest didn’t affiliate him with the interest, the whistleblower’s lawyer said in a lawsuit obtained by The Post and Courier. In the lawsuit, attorney Chris Kenney called the finding a “legal absurdity.” Kenney, who works in state Sen. Dick Harpootlian’s law firm, told the newspaper he can’t further identify the lawmaker or the special interest without a ruling in his favor from the court. Ethics laws prevent people who file a complaint from talking about it publicly before the complaint is heard and also if the commission rules against it, even on a technical issue. Critics of that provision have said it violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The first sporting bets have been wagered in the city, bringing to fruition an effort that began several years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned commercial sports gambling. Four casinos in Deadwood opened sports betting Thursday: Tin Lizzie, Cadillac Jack’s, Gold Dust and Mustang Sally’s. Betting is only allowed at licensed facilities in Deadwood. People can place their bets with tellers at a window, at a digital kiosk or, soon, through an app on their phone. The app will only work within the facilities. The South Dakota Commission on Gaming issued a final ruling Wednesday on a list of sporting events on which gamblers will be able to place bets, including Olympic events and professional and college-level sports, the Rapid City Journal reports. Deadwood Gaming Association Executive Director Mike Rodman said Thursday’s opening was a success. “We’re very pleased that we got to this point,” he said. “And it’s been a long haul getting there. We’re happy to be there today.” In 2019, the Deadwood Gaming Commission attempted to get the Legislature to legalize it but came up three votes short. In 2020, South Dakota voters legalized sports gambling with about 58% approval, and the Legislature passed the gaming laws in 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The federal Environmental Protection Agency is proposing the addition of a former munitions factory just outside the city to a list of prioritized Superfund toxic cleanup sites, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen said. The EPA has proposed adding the National Fireworks site in the Memphis suburb of Cordova to its Superfund National Priorities List for removal of toxic chemicals detected in groundwater, Cohen, D-Memphis, said in a statement Thursday. National Fireworks made flares, grenades, incendiary bombs and large caliber rounds for the U.S. Army and Navy from 1942 to 1945, the EPA said. Metals and chlorinated solvent contamination have been identified in the soil and groundwater on the Superfund site, the EPA said. The 260-acre site was redeveloped in 1986 as an industrial park. The listing would make the site eligible for cleanup funding as one of the nation’s highest priority contamination sites. The site is “dangerously close to Memphis’ Shaw Wellfield that provides drinking water to 79,000 people,” Cohen said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The CEO of Salesforce said the company will help employees leave the state, and he did so while retweeting a story linking the offer to concern about Texas’ new anti-abortion law. Salesforce, which sells customer-management software, joins a small number of companies that have reacted against the law. CNBC reported that the San Francisco-based company told employees in a Slack message that it will help them move “if you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state.” On Friday night, CEO Marc Benioff retweeted a post about the story, adding: “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice.” Ohana is a Hawaiian term for family. The company did not return messages for comment. The Texas law passed the Republican-controlled Legislature and was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May but didn’t go into effect until this month. It bans most abortions after six weeks, before many women know whether they are pregnant, and lets private residents sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. By a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the law. Last week the U.S. Justice Department sued Texas to block the law.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Thirteen Utah hospitals will postpone many nonemergency surgeries starting this week as health care workers are overwhelmed by another surge in coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant, a major health care company said Friday. Intermountain Healthcare announced that the hospitals will postpone non-urgent procedures for several weeks starting Wednesday. The announcement comes a week after state hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to curb the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. Hospital utilization in Utah is nearing its previous peak in December, when intensive care units were 104% full, and 606 COVID-19 patients in hospitals. There were 516 people hospitalized for COVID-19, and ICUs were 93% full as of Thursday, state data shows. About 62% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Thursday. Utah reported 10 new deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,703. Several Utah hospitals postponed nonemergency surgeries at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to alleviate some of the strain on health care networks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city’s annual marathon has been shortened so that fewer health care professionals will be needed at the race next month amid a surge in COVID-19 infections, organizers said. The People’s United Bank Vermont City Marathon & Relay will be a half marathon and modified relay event Oct. 24, RunVermont said. “After extensive review and discussions with professionals associated with the health care field, RunVermont believes it would be insensitive to ask those professionals to step aside from their duties to attend to the needs of the race at a time when the medical community is under some significant strain,” the organization said in a statement. Marathon runners can switch to a half marathon, select a virtual marathon option or defer the race until May 2022, organizers said. They can also chose to enter one of three races on a complimentary basis if space is available: the Mad Marathon in Vermont on Sept. 12; the Adirondack Marathon in upstate New York on Oct. 3; or the Eversource Hartford Marathon in Connecticut on Oct. 9.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Arrests on marijuana-related charges have fallen dramatically this summer in and around the capital city since a new law legalized possession of small amounts of pot and residents keeping a few cannabis plants, according to a newspaper report. Twenty-five marijuana-related arrests occurred in Richmond and in Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico counties in the first seven weeks after the law took effect July 1, compared to 257 arrrests during the same period last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing local law enforcement data. “A 90% reduction in marijuana arrests indicates that the public policy is performing as intended and in a manner that is consistent with post-legalization observations from other states,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The law legalized possession by adults age 21 and over of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the cultivation of four pot plants per household, among other decriminalization provisions. Selling marijuana remains illegal until the state launches a regulated market in 2024 and issues licenses. A regulatory board will help carry out the details.\n\nWashington\n\nLa Conner: The Swinomish Tribe is threatening to sue the federal government to speed up estuary restoration and salmon preservation on the Skagit River delta. Much of the estuary has been drained and closed off with tide gates to facilitate agriculture, but such habitat is crucial for juvenile salmon. The tribe says that under an agreement reached in 2010 – following a prior lawsuit – the Army Corps of Engineers isn’t supposed to grant construction permits to dike districts for work on the tide gates unless they first restore estuary habitat. But for the past five years, the Corps has been doing just that, the tribe says. During that time, at least 660 acres should have been restored. The restoration efforts are now behind the agreement’s schedule, which calls for restoring 2,700 acres by 2035. At the current pace, it will take a century to complete that, tribal scientists say. The tribe notified the Army Corps last week that it intends to sue within 60 days, saying the agency has allowed the dike districts to violate the Endangered Species Act. Skagit River Chinook salmon are protected under the law. The Army Corps and NOAA Fisheries said they are reviewing the tribe’s claims.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University is expanding its mask mandate to include all indoor campus spaces, officials said Friday. Masks will be required beginning Monday in all buildings and facilities regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status through Oct. 6, when public health conditions will be reevaluated, the school said in a statement. Last month, the university began requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The numbers of cases and quarantines involving university employees and students remain manageable, but officials said they decided to take the precautionary step due to the recent, significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the state. The mask requirement won’t apply in personal office spaces, small gatherings in residence halls, or while eating or exercising, officials said. Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that cases in West Virginia are still rising, and there are a record number of patients in intensive care units and on ventilators. He continued to urge residents to get vaccinated. “This thing is running rampant right now,” he said. “These vaccines are incredibly safe, and they’ll stop this.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A woman who admitted to helping stab a classmate to please online horror character Slender Man will be freed Monday from a mental health institution under strict conditions, a judge ruled Friday. Anissa Weier, 19, will be released after spending almost four years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh. A conditional release plan calls for her to live with her father, submit to around-the-clock GPS monitoring and receive psychiatric treatment, among other things. She won’t be allowed to use the internet except at home, and the state Department of Corrections will monitor her online activity. Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Payton Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Geyser stabbed Leutner multiple times as Weier urged her on. Leutner suffered 19 stab stab wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren said the conditions of Weier’s release were fair, and the plan “provides for the protection of the community” as well as for Leutner and for Weier herself. Weier, dressed in a dark suit and smiling occasionally, said nothing during the 20-minute proceeding. “She looks forward to moving on into a productive life,” her attorney, Maura McMahon, told the judge.\n\nWyoming\n\nSheridan: Artifacts found this summer at Medicine Lodge Archaeological Site are slated for radiocarbon dating, which could tell researchers more about when the Crow, or Apsaalooke, people came to the area, according to the state archaeologist. “This summer, we found Crow ceramics, as well a range of things, from thousands and thousands of flakes and 10 arrow points (or arrowheads) and preforms to make arrowheads to animal bone from bison as well as bighorn sheep, as well as obsidian,” Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton said. “We really hoped to find Crow ceramics to radiocarbon date, to have a better idea of how old those ceramics are.” Sharon Peregoy, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who represents the Crow Agency, said this type of work may help date early people of the area, preserving – or recovering – history that can otherwise be lost. “It helps dispel the concept that the Crow, Apsaalooke, people were new transplants to the area,” she said, adding that in this context, “new” means an arrival of 500 years ago. “The findings of these types of excavations and research correlates with our Crow oral history, which dates from time immemorial … prehistoric,” Peregoy said. “History is important to preserve a homeland for future generations.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/30/year-tumult-and-tragedy-delaware/95747624/", "title": "A year of tumult and tragedy in Delaware", "text": "Adam Duvernay\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe year is almost done, and its stories are about to be relegated to the past tense.\n\nBut none of the most important moments, dominant characters or traumatic episodes happened in a vacuum. In the coming year, here in Delaware and beyond, 2016's stories will continue their impact for better or worse.\n\nThose bemoaning the turbulence of 2016 have any number of directions to point their fingers: a presidential campaign billed as the worst in U.S. history, gun violence on both sides of a badge, disease and fear of disease, fake news masquerading as fact, children killed by children in Wilmington streets and schools, a storied Delaware conglomerate making a drastic change and overcrowded local races for political positions few have faith in.\n\nAt least no Delaware celebrities died – unless you count John Schultz, the 84-year-old shirtless runner killed in November when a pickup truck struck him on Philadelphia Pike.\n\nThere's a debate swirling in comment sections and Facebook pages across the nation about whether 2016 was truly a terrible solar rotation or if it only seems that way as individuals and communities look for someplace to hang their frustration before ringing in the new year.\n\nWhether you wanted Mayor Dennis P. Williams to keep a hold of Wilmington's reins or you belong to one of the families wronged by the 12 men permanently taken from Delaware's death row, it seemed almost every outcome in 2016 left someone standing in the cold.\n\nBut it couldn't have been all bad, right?\n\nDelaware sent women on to Olympic gold, to a national field hockey title, to the U.S. House of Representatives and to the Democratic National Convention; even the worst political opponents still sat side by side in carriages on Return Day; the bulk of the DuPont brand will remain in state; and ABC isn't going to air that show about Murder Town.\n\nOur conflicts gave us an opportunity to reflect on right and wrong when Muslims were threatened; when Black Lives Matter protesters were shouted down; after the (mostly) civil political debates; and during the heart-wrenching, line-of-duty losses of emergency responders.\n\nBelow is a collection of the stories that helped tell the tale of the year 2016 in Delaware.\n\n'All I wanted to do with my friend was walk across the stage and get our diplomas.'\n\nShytera Dawkins was close friends with 16-year-old Amy Joyner-Francis, the 16-year-old Howard High School of Technology student killed in March when a brutal bathroom attack caused her heart to give out.\n\nJoyner-Francis' death sparked outrage and grief across Wilmington, a town constantly roiled in violent crime but which found the needless death of a child too much to bear. Memorials constructed outside her school were the backdrop for media stories nationwide.\n\nTrinity Carr, Chakeira Wright and Zion Snow were charged in connection with the fight. Wright and Snow are being charged with third-degree criminal conspiracy. Carr was charged with criminally negligent homicide, a felony, and third-degree criminal conspiracy, a misdemeanor.\n\nThe three are expected to go to trial on April 3 in Family Court.\n\n'I got what I asked God to give me ... I will always be Mr. Mayor.'\n\nDennis P. Williams lost his bid for a second term as mayor of Wilmington, losing out to the man with whom he sparred most often during the campaign, Riverfront developer Mike Purzycki.\n\nWilliams' part in the mayoral campaign – a contest that included a slew of opponents from across the city spectrum – was low-key, marked most noticeably by his absence from most of the debates.\n\nThough it was well known Williams had many detractors in the city, he also was expected to draw heavily from his longtime support base in north Wilmington and the East Side that first elected him to the office.\n\nBut Purzycki won, capturing 23.59 percent of the ballot. Delaware Center for Justice Advocacy Director Eugene Young got 21.78 percent. Former City Councilman Kevin Kelley got 20.29 percent. Williams came in fourth with 13.97 percent.\n\nRELATED: Our 50 most-read stories of 2016\n\nWilliams was well known for a bellicose attitude toward people and institutions he considered detractors or opponents. In the few debates he attended, Williams used personal attacks on political rivals and even in defeat maintained a defiant attitude.\n\n\"I made some decisions. I wasn't going to buckle under those who tried to intimidate me. I wasn't going to do it then, and I'm not going to do it now,\" Williams said in his farewell address, which was – typical for him – delivered in a 20-minute video as he stood by.\n\n\"And if I was the mayor tomorrow, which I will be until (January) 3, anybody that's trying to intimidate this mayor will not be able to intimidate me. I'm not going for it. The people elected me to make decisions, not to be wishy-washy. And that's who I am. I am the mayor.\"\n\n'I feel like something I have devoted my entire career to is going away.'\n\nDespite those feelings, North Wilmington resident Barney Kantar was one of the former employees and shareholders who voted to approve DuPont's merger with Dow Chemicals this year, a corporate saga that kept the First State worrying over the future of its flagship company – and thousands of jobs – until the last minute.\n\nMore than 98 percent of DuPont shareholders voted in favor of the deal to merge DuPont with its former rival in July. The merger, when approved by regulators, will combine the companies into a $130 billion conglomerate, dubbed DowDuPont, before splitting into three separate companies.\n\nTwo of the businesses – focused on agriculture and specialty products – will be based in Delaware. The third will be based in Dow's hometown of Midland, Michigan.\n\n'Delaware decided to take the next step, rather than take a step backward.'\n\nSantino Ceccotti, a lawyer for the Delaware public defender, was one of many legal and political backers of Delaware eliminating its death penalty this year.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court in August ruled the state's law is unconstitutional because it gives judges the power to override a jury's recommendation of life in prison in favor of a death sentence. The ruling stemmed from a U.S. Supreme Court decision in January to strike down a similar law in Florida.\n\nChief Justice Leo E. Strine Jr. said Delaware's current law violates the Sixth Amendment requiring a jury to unanimously and independently make factual findings before sentencing a defendant to death.\n\nA later December decision was applied retroactively, converting the death sentences of 12 men to life in prison.\n\n'Even the people that don't like me will vote for me because they think I run a good government.'\n\nTo many, outgoing County Executive Thomas P. Gordon's return to power in 2012 was just as unlikely as his failed re-election bid in September.\n\nGordon has spent parts of five decades working for New Castle County government, first as a police officer and eventually as county executive beginning in 1996. His first two terms in office saw his stock in Delaware politics rise to a point where some felt his trajectory was aimed for the governor's office.\n\nBut a federal corruption indictment of him and his top lieutenant ended that rise. All felony charges were later dropped, and Gordon pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.\n\nGordon was out of public work for nearly a decade. He returned to office in 2012, defeating then incumbent-Executive Paul Clark, whose handling of the Barley Mill Plaza saga gave voters a reason to question his ethics as well.\n\nGordon's supporters billed his return as Gordon 2.0, but controversy continued to follow him. Things began to unravel when Gordon fired his controversial second-in-charge David Grimaldi, who in turn sued the executive and his daughter for defamation in a still-unfolding legal drama involving online sock puppets and secretly recorded phone calls.\n\nGordon was defeated in the September Democratic Primary by political newcomer Matt Meyer, a Wilmington attorney. Gordon is the only New Castle County executive to be elected to three terms.\n\n'I get that he can be abrasive to some people. But he's from New York. I'm Italian. In my family, you just tell it like it is.'\n\nBernadette Sahm, the former head of the Smyrna Opera House who now runs a consulting business for nonprofits, was one of Delaware's many supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. Though Hillary Clinton carried the state, voters like Sahm made their presence known this election cycle – even in dark-blue Delaware.\n\nIn Delaware, Clinton got about 53 percent of the vote; Trump got about 42 percent.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the presidential election dominated the 2016 news cycle. But it was, by all accounts, one of the strangest, loudest, dirtiest, contentious, exhausting and politically devastating in the country's history.\n\nThere wasn't a scandal or speech that could hurt Trump with his supporters, and when the election finally was decided, it became obvious the naysayers hadn't been listening to the mogul's throngs of backers.\n\nHis candidacy spurred a major bump – more than 4,500 – in people registering as Republicans in Delaware, especially in Sussex and Kent counties. In the former, the number of registered Republicans surpassed the number of Democrats for the first time in decades.\n\n'Rest in peace, my sister.'\n\nThose words were spoken in December by Wilmington Fire Chief Anthony S. Goode at the funeral of fallen firefighter Lt. Ardythe Hope. On the first day of that month, Hope died of injuries she sustained fighting an arson fire that killed two of her colleagues.\n\nShe was the first female firefighter in Wilmington's history to die of injuries sustained on the job.\n\nThe mother of three lay in a hospital bed at Pennsylvania's Crozer-Chester Medical Center for 68 days before succumbing to her burns. Capt. Christopher Leach and Lt. Jerry Fickes died in the fire set at Canby Park Estates, a secluded neighborhood off South Union Street in Wilmington. Firefighter Brad Speakman was released from Crozer after spending six weeks recovering from injuries he suffered in the blaze.\n\nTwo other injured firefighters, Terrance Tate and John Cawthray, were treated at Christiana Hospital.\n\nThough the funeral services for Fickes and Leach and Hope were months apart, each drew fellow firefighters and emergency personnel from around the country who attended in a stunning display of solidarity. Vice President Joe Biden spoke at the first service, for Fickes and Leach, and provided a video message for the second.\n\nBeatriz Fana-Ruiz, 27, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder, first-degree arson, assault charges and seven counts of reckless endangerment for having set the building to flame.\n\n'Next year, (I hope) we have the guts to do what it takes to move Delaware forward.'\n\nWhen state Rep. Ruth Briggs King, R-Georgetown, said these words in June, she was looking ahead to a tough 2017.\n\nFor most of the legislative session, nonprofit and government leaders were bracing for funding cuts as the General Assembly faced another gloomy budget year. But lawmakers managed to cobble together a budget in the final weeks of the session that contained few drastic cuts.\n\nThey may not be able to do that again next year: A state panel found that the deficit for next year could be as big as $350 million.\n\n'The addict today is everybody's kid. ... I have daydreamed about writing his obituary. No parent should have to do that.'\n\nKaren Blum is the mother of a son recovering from a heroin addiction. Marc left Delaware when he couldn't find access to addiction treatment and went to live a halfway home in Florida.\n\nThe Blums are among hundreds of Delaware families frustrated with an antiquated addiction treatment system that Delaware's Department of Health and Social Services says lacks the individualized care necessary to treat addiction and prevent relapse.\n\nIn Delaware last year, 228 died of drug-related overdoses. Most treatment options in Delaware require patients to engage in a 12-step program to create a sober support network otherwise unavailable to them; however, medication-assisted treatment, the new standard of care in addiction, is beginning to take hold. Those who use this treatment take a daily or weekly dose a drug used to stave off withdrawal symptoms and cravings for heroin or opiates.\n\nThe state estimates about 90,000 residents suffer from drug and alcohol addiction, a population the state poured $12.54 million into last fiscal year. No new funds were allocated for addiction treatment in the coming year.\n\n'It infuriates me. You're there running a business. You're liable.'\n\nMartin Uniacke has a different opinion about who is at fault for his sister's death by carbon monoxide than the owners of the Evergreen Apartments at Riverfront Heights near Elsmere.\n\nOn March 25, Nancy Uniacke, Timmy Dunfee, Veronica Mousely and Andrew Spankakos died inside their homes in Building G of the complex. The deaths were caused by the release of carbon monoxide from a rusted-out boiler exhaust system in the basement.\n\nMultiple wrongful death lawsuits have been filed, and Evergreen Apartments has filed third-party lawsuits laying blame with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, which OK'd the boiler a year before the incident during an inspection.\n\nEvergreen Apartments claims passing that inspection clears them of responsibility. DNREC is working on rule changes to boiler inspections which would make providing maintenance records part of boiler owners' responsibility.\n\n'Today, we're here to tell the mothers, daughters and sisters of Delaware that you are allowed to be whoever you want to be.'\n\nSo said House Minority Leader Valerie Longhurst. It was a banner year for women in Delaware politics.\n\nIn the Nov. 8 election, the state elected Lisa Blunt Rochester its first female member of Congress, and it elected Bethany Hall-Long as only the second female lieutenant governor.\n\nFemale legislators pushed through a package of bills aimed at fighting gender discrimination. They barred employers for disciplining workers for discussing their pay, for their reproductive decisions or for their family obligations.\n\nLawmakers also strengthened reporting requirements for colleges about sexual assault.\n\n'This plan gave hope to parents in the community. Now, there's another layer of let-down and defeat.'\n\nJessica Gibson, a Wilmington mother and nonprofit leader, gave voice to citywide disappointment on the final day of the General Assembly.\n\nDelaware’s educational debate was dominated by the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission’s plan for redistricting city schools and providing extra funding to high-needs schools.\n\nCity residents and leaders said the plan would be a historic first step toward fixing a broken school system, but critics worried about the cost of the plan and said there were too few details about how it would concretely help kids.\n\nIn a series of emotionally charged meetings, the commission’s supporters narrowly muscled their plan through the State Board of Education and the House of Representatives. But on the last day of the session, the Senate put off action until next year.\n\nGov. Jack Markell and Commission Chair Tony Allen said they have not given up hope the plan can pass, but many Wilmington residents felt Dover had let them down again.\n\n'The court doesn’t really know what they’re doing. ... They think they’re doing a standard cellphone search and not using this device.'\n\nThat was the verdict of John Daniello, a Sussex County public defender, on the issue of Stingrays, a portable electronic gadget that once was the domain of secret agents and the military but now is being deployed by the Delaware State Police.\n\nIt's not clear how police are using the tools because, at the request of the FBI, they're doing everything possible to keep the surveillance secret.\n\nThe controversial technology, originally developed to hunt down terrorists, works by tricking mobile phones to connect to it rather than the nearest tower – without the knowledge of users.\n\nStingrays allow police to comb through the collected data to extract a phone’s location, as well as eavesdrop on text messages, call histories and other transmitted material.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/10/fluoride-wince-tsunami-maps-volcanic-unrest-news-around-states/50819717/", "title": "Fluoride wince, tsunami maps: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A long-running festival that aims to entertain people while educating them about the heritage and culture of Native Americans returns this week to west Alabama. The annual Moundville Native American Festival will be held from Wednesday to Saturday at the University of Alabama Moundville Archaeological Park. This will mark the first in-person festival since 2019, as the event was held online only the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of visitors are expected at the festival, which began 34 years ago. “The festival is one the largest events that brings people to the park every year,” said Clay Nelson, director of the UA Moundville Archaeological Park. Holding the festival online was the best option for the past couple of years, but Nelson said there’s no substitute for seeing up close the park’s attractions, which include 29 massive flat-topped earthen mounds. “We can describe the earthen mounds as much as we want, but seeing them in person really helps illustrate what great engineering feats the indigenous peoples of Alabama were doing in the 13th century,” he said. The festival will feature artists, craftsmen and educators from around the nation, who’ll share their knowledge of Native American culture. People will be able to buy Native crafts and food, as well as traditional festival fare.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fall storm packing strong winds damaged roofs and windows in parts of western and northwest Alaska and resulted in flooding of roads in the far northern city of Utqiagvik, according to damage reports, with a new storm expected to hit the Arctic coast this week. Water levels dropped by midday Saturday across the region, said Jonathan Chriest, a National Weather Service meteorologist. The system forecasters are tracking is expected to bring elevated surf and strong winds to the Arctic coast Tuesday through Thursday, though water levels and winds weren’t expected to be as high as with the last storm, he said Sunday. There commonly are strong storms in northern and western Alaska between September and December, he said. But the storm that just hit parts of western and northwest Alaska and the remnants of Typhoon Merbok, which caused widespread damage in parts of western Alaska last month, were “exceptionally strong” for the areas that each impacted, he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Abortions can take place again in the state, at least for now, after an appeals court on Friday blocked enforcement of a pre-statehood law that almost entirely criminalized the procedure. The three-judge panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed with Planned Parenthood that a judge should not have lifted the decades-old order that prevented the older law from being imposed. The brief order written by Presiding Judge Peter J. Eckerstrom said Planned Parenthood and its Arizona affiliate had shown they are likely to prevail on an appeal of a decision by the judge in Tucson to allow enforcement of the old law. Planned Parenthood had argued that the lower court judge should have considered a host of laws restricting abortions passed since the original injunction was put in place following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. Those laws include a new one blocking abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that took effect last month. The previous limit was 24 weeks, the viability standard established by now-overruled U.S. Supreme Court cases. “Arizona courts have a responsibility to attempt to harmonize all of this state’s relevant statutes,” Eckerstrom wrote, mirroring arguments made by attorneys for Planned Parenthood.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two deputies who were caught on video violently arresting a suspect outside a convenience store in August have been fired, Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante said Thursday. Damante told Fort Smith television station KHBS that Levi White and Zachary King had been fired but did not elaborate on the decision. A bystander recorded White, King and Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle arresting 27-year-old Randal Worcester outside a convenience store in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. Mulberry Police Chief Shannon Gregory said Riddle remains on administrative leave. The bystander’s video of the Aug. 21 arrest shows one of the deputies repeatedly punching and kneeing Worcester in the head before grabbing his hair and slamming him against the pavement. As that was happening, another officer was holding Worcester down, while a third kneed him over and over. Damante has said Worcester was being questioned for threatening a clerk at a convenience store in the nearby small town of Alma. Damante said Worcester tackled one of the deputies and punched him in the head before the arrest. The deputy suffered a concussion, Damante said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Geological Survey has released updated tsunami hazard maps for seven counties to help users determine whether they are in areas at risk for inundation and for planning. The revised interactive maps released Friday cover San Diego, Santa Cruz, Ventura, Marin, Sonoma, Solano and Napa counties. The new maps reflect new data and improved computer modeling since an earlier series of maps was published in 2009, as well as threats from tsunamis originating far away and locally, the Geological Survey said in a press release. In one example of the updates, new modeling for Santa Cruz County shows that a subduction zone earthquake off the Aleutian Islands could unleash a tsunami 18-25 feet above the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, more than double the height suggested in 2009, the agency said. The Geological Survey said California’s shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been significantly destructive and deadly. On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City, California, hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A police officer who arrested a woman who was seriously injured when the parked patrol car in which she was placed was struck by a freight train said he did not realize he had stopped the vehicle on the railroad tracks, according to police body camera video. In video obtained by KUSA-TV on Thursday, Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez told another officer he thought he had cleared the tracks when he stopped Yareni Rios-Gonzalez on Sept. 16 in a suspected road rage case involving a gun. He said he pulled up right behind her truck and was focused on her because he was concerned about weapons. Vazquez also said he did not know another officer had put Rios-Gonzalez in Vasquez’s patrol vehicle until after it was hit by the train. He said the “saving grace” was that the other officer put Rios-Gonzalez on the side of the vehicle not usually used for arrested people. Rios-Gonzalez’s injuries included nine broken ribs, a broken arm and a fractured sternum. Her lawyer has said he plans to file a lawsuit against police. Previously released video from Vazquez’s body camera shows he asks the other officer several times over the sound of the train’s rumbling whether Rios-Gonzalez was in the patrol vehicle, and she responds, one hand to her face, “Oh my God, yes, she was!”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Jurors concluded their first full day of deliberations without reaching a verdict Friday in a trial to determine how much conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay for spreading the lie that the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax. Jurors are scheduled to return Tuesday. After deliberating just briefly Thursday afternoon, the panel got back to business Friday with a request for a dry-erase easel, markers, an eraser and a copy of the jury instructions. Last year, Jones was found liable for damages. The jury’s task is to decide how much Jones and his company Free Speech Systems should pay to relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and to an FBI agent who responded to the massacre. The plaintiffs testified they have been tormented and threatened by people who believed that one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history was a con staged to build support for gun restrictions. Jones repeatedly publicized that false notion on his “Infowars” show. Twenty children and six adults were killed when a gunman stormed Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on Dec. 14, 2012. Jones testified in the trial, saying he was “done saying I’m sorry.” His lawyers have argued that he’s not responsible for the deeds of anyone who tormented the victims’ families, and that they are overstating how much harm it caused them.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: New state laws allowing universal voting by mail and Election Day registration are unconstitutional, Delaware’s Supreme Court ruled Friday. In a three-page order, the justices said the vote-by-mail statute impermissibly expands the categories of absentee voters identified in Delaware’s constitution. The same-day registration law conflicts with the registration periods spelled out in the state constitution, they said. The order, which will be followed later by a formal opinion, came after justices heard arguments in the case Thursday. Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook last month upheld the same-day registration law but said the vote-by-mail law, the result of legislation Democrats rammed through the General Assembly in less than three weeks, violates constitutional restrictions on absentee voting. Both bills were passed in June, each receiving exactly one Republican vote, and were signed by Democratic Gov. John Carney in July. Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jennings appealed Cook’s ruling striking down the vote-by-mail law. GOP attorneys representing voters, a state House candidate and a Department of Elections employee appealed Cook’s decision upholding same-day registration. The Supreme Court upheld Cook’s ruling on the vote-by-mail law but said his decision allowing same-day registration should be reversed.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Air and Space Museum will reopen half of its flagship building to the public on the National Mall on Friday, WUSA-TV reports. When the museum partially reopens, visitors can check out eight new and renovated exhibitions, along with the planetarium on the museum’s west end. Highlights include “Destination Moon,” which will display the Apollo 11 space suit; “Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery,” which will feature an immersive experience called Walking on Other Worlds; and the “Thomas W. Haas We All Fly” exhibition, which will include the Challenger III and the Lear Jet 23. The museum has been undergoing a seven-year renovation that began in 2018 and includes redesigning all 23 exhibitions and presentation spaces, replacing outdated mechanical systems and other repairs and improvements. “You should be excited to engage with these pieces of history, these real artifacts, these real things,” said Beth Wilson, an educator with the museum. “Come and see them.” Free timed-entry passes are required to visit the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida officials began planning to transport migrants to other states in July and told potential contractors their task would be to relocate them on a voluntary basis, according to state documents. The documents released Friday night provide new details about the program that culminated in the Sept. 14 flight of 48 mostly Venezuelan migrants from San Antonio, Texas, to Martha’s Vineyard, an island off Massachusetts. The flight has spawned an investigation by a Texas sheriff and two lawsuits amid criticism that the program was a political stunt by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appeal to his conservative base. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and is frequently mentioned as a potential 2024 presidential candidate. According to the documents, the program as outlined in July was intended to “assist in the voluntary relocation of Unauthorized Aliens who are found in Florida and have agreed to be relocated” elsewhere in the country. It made no mention of finding migrants in Texas. Ultimately, state officials chose Vertol Systems Co., based in Destin, Florida, and has so far paid the firm $1.56 million for the Martha’s Vineyard flight and possibly for a second flight to Delaware, the home state of President Joe Biden, that didn’t happen. No other flights have been announced.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia prosecutor investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 election filed paperwork Friday seeking to compel testimony from a new batch of Trump allies, including former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis filed petitions in court seeking to have Gingrich and Flynn, as well as former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann and others, testify next month before a special grand jury that’s been seated to aid her investigation. They join a string of other high-profile Trump allies and advisers who have been called to testify in the probe. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump attorney who’s been told he could face criminal charges in the probe, testified in August. Attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro have also appeared before the panel. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham’s attempt to fight his subpoena is pending in a federal appeals court. And paperwork has been filed seeking testimony from others, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Willis has said she plans to take a monthlong break from public activity in the case leading up to the November midterm election.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on the planet, is in a “state of heightened unrest” but is not erupting, and there are no signs of an imminent eruption, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said Friday. Earlier in the week week, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park closed the Mauna Loa summit backcountry until further notice, calling it a “precautionary measure” amid “elevated seismic activity.” The observatory said the heightened unrest began in mid-September, “as recorded by an increase in earthquakes below Mauna Loa summit.” The volcano, which stands about 13,680 feet above sea level on the island of Hawaii, last erupted in 1984, the observatory said. Since 1843, it has erupted 33 times, with the time between eruptions ranging from months to decades, according to the observatory. The park’s online portal says this is the volcano’s “longest quiet period since written records have been kept.” “Mauna Loa will erupt again,” Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. “As long as there is heightened unrest, it is more likely to erupt. But it could be weeks or months – or it could eventually die off.” The latter happened the last time there was elevated seismic activity and summit expansion on Mauna Loa, in early 2021.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court heard arguments in lawsuits over three of Idaho’s abortion laws Thursday, sharply questioning attorneys about the value placed on a pregnant person’s health, the state’s interest in ensuring that pregnancies are carried to term and Idaho’s long history of anti-abortion laws. The high court earlier this year allowed the laws to go into effect, and as a result Idaho is one of several states where abortion is almost entirely outlawed. A final ruling on the laws – including one that criminalizes all abortions but allows physicians to defend themselves by showing the abortion was needed to save the pregnant persopn’s life, one that criminalizes most abortions after about six weeks’ gestation, and one that allows even extended potential relatives of a fetus or embryo to sue an abortion provider – could be handed down sometime in the coming months. “For 50 years, generations of Idaho women have had control over their bodies and lives with respect to the most intimate personal and private decision imaginable whether to carry a pregnancy to term or whether to terminate it,” Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney representing a regional Planned Parenthood affiliate, told the court. “The Idaho Legislature seeks to upend women’s lives and strip them of this fundamental right – one that’s necessary to the exercise of numerous other rights that all Idahoans cherish.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man accused of walking into a Chicago police station and pointing a gun at officers, leading police to shoot and wound him, appeared in court Friday on assault charges, where a judge ordered his bond set at $200,000. The police department said in a news release that 43-year-old Terrick Bland, of nearby Maywood, is charged with five counts of aggravated assault of a peace officer and one felony count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to police, Bland walked into the lobby of the Ogden District station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city’s West Side and began shouting anti-police statements Wednesday. When officers ordered him to drop a gun that he had wrapped in a plastic bag, he pointed it at officers, and at least three of them opened fire. Bland was shot once in the shoulder and was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. According to the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, Bland was represented at Friday’s hearing by an attorney with the county public defender’s office. An official from the office said she could not immediately determine who represented Bland. It was the second time in a little more than a week in which Chicago officers shot an armed suspect inside of a police station.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region. State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday after determining that the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with four horses testing positive for the virus. State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus “is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana” until the first hard freeze of the fall season occurs. As of Tuesday, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said two horses in LaGrange County and one horse in Kosciusko County had tested positive for the virus. No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, “humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk.” Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects. While rare, the virus can cause serious illness with long-term complications and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Falls: Paddlers on the Cedar River now will be floating on designated waters. The river, from Janesville to around La Porte City – about 46 miles – has been formally recognized as a designated water trail as part of the Cedar Valley Nature Trail. A 14-mile stretch of Black Hawk Creek from Hudson to the Cedar River was also designated as an official water trail. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports members of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Black Hawk County Conservation, Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments and Partnership for a Healthy Iowa paddled from Washington Park in Cedar Falls to the Waterloo Boat House in celebration of the new identification. Kayla Lyon, director of the Iowa DNR, said there are more than 1,000 miles of designated water trails in the state. The state’s first designated water trail was the Cedar Valley Paddler’s Trail in Black Hawk County, which begins at the Fisher Lake Boat Ramp. The 10-mile trail was recognized in 2005. Peter Komendowski, executive director of the Partnership for a Healthy Iowa, said the waterway was first paddled by 26 eighth graders and adults, and it took them more than six hours. It travels through a chain of lakes, down the Cedar River and through George Wyth State Park before looping back to the start.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Wichita police officer was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of drunken driving, becoming the city’s third officer to be apprehended within about two weeks. Police said in a release that the officer, who was off-duty, is also facing a charge of possession of a gun while intoxicated. The officer, who has been with the department for two years, has been placed on administrative leave while a criminal and internal investigation is conducted, the Wichita Eagle reports. The incident follows two other arrests of Wichita officers within five days at the end of last month. A detective and 15-year veteran of the force was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Sept. 23 after she collided with a city bus in downtown. A police recruit was arrested on suspicion of criminal threat Sept. 28 when police responded to a domestic violence call.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday to block Kentucky’s laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution. Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of “an unborn child” begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.” The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception but rather at birth, while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky “has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.” Their complaint, filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court, says Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus. “As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me; it affects my health care,” lead plaintiff Lisa Sobel said. “And then it’s a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Democratic challenger to U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise released a campaign ad on social media that includes video of her giving birth. Katie Darling said she was seven months pregnant when she decided to join the congressional race in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that ended constitutional protections for abortion. The 75-second video documents Darling traveling from her family farm in St. Tammany parish in September to a hospital, where she grips the side of a bed while in labor. “I wanted to share that this is real for me,” Darling, 36, said in an interview with the Associated Press. “I am literally the one hooked up to the machines and the IVs in the hospital bed, going through childbirth, and nobody else should be deciding how I handle that.” In a voiceover, Darling highlights her concerns about climate change, Louisiana underperforming in education and the state’s near-total abortion ban – the only exceptions are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient if they continue with the pregnancy and in the case of “medically futile” pregnancies. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. “Louisiana deserves better than the path it’s on,” Darling says in the video. “I want that better path,” she adds, “for you” – as the ad pans to her husband in the delivery room. “For her,” as a the video shows her 6-year-old daughter. “And for him,” she says directly into the camera from her hospital bed as she cradles her newborn.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Wildlife agencies are finding elevated levels of a class of toxic chemicals in game animals such as deer, prompting health advisories in some places where hunting and fishing are ways of life and key pieces of the economy. Authorities have detected the high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in deer in several states, including Maine, where legions of hunters seek to bag a buck every fall. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched an effort last year to limit pollution from the chemicals, linked to health problems including cancer and low birth weight. In Maine, where the chemicals were detected in well water at hundreds of times the federal health advisory level, legislators passed a law in 2021 requiring manufacturers to report their use of the chemicals and to phase them out by 2030. The state issued a “do not eat” advisory last year for deer harvested in the Fairfield area, about 80 miles north of Portland, after several of the animals tested positive for elevated levels. The state is now expanding the testing to more animals across a wider area, said Nate Webb, wildlife division director at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. “Lab capacity has been challenging,” he said, “but I suspect there will be more facilities coming online to help ease that burden.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The office of the state’s attorney general is supporting an appeal by a slain woman’s family after a Baltimore judge overturned a man’s murder conviction in a case chronicled by a groundbreaking podcast. Hae Min Lee’s brother, Young Lee, has asked the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to halt court proceedings for Adnan Syed, whose conviction in Lee’s 1999 killing was reversed by Baltimore Circuit Judge Melissa Phinn in September. Young Lee is asking the appellate court to suspend an Oct. 18 deadline for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges against Syed or retry him. Lee argues that his family didn’t get adequate notice of the Sept. 19 hearing at which Phinn overturned Syed’s conviction. Attorney General Brian Frosch’s office, which represented the state in opposing Syed’s appeals, said in a court filing Friday that Young Lee has a right to appeal given his status as the victim’s representative, the Baltimore Sun reports. The filing argues that Lee’s appeal should be addressed before any circuit court rulings render it moot. Syed, who has always maintained his innocence, has served more than 20 years of a life sentence. He was convicted of strangling Lee, whose body was found buried in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were students at a Baltimore County high school.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials said Friday that they’re concerned about elevated levels of the coronavirus in the city’s wastewater. The concentration of the virus in local wastewater had increased by 3.1% over the prior week and by nearly 100% over the past two weeks, according to new data from last week from the Boston Public Health Commission. New COVID-19 cases in Boston had decreased slightly over the prior week, though the data did not include positive results from at-home tests, the commission said. Boston hospitals had 170 new hospital admissions related to COVID-19 last week. Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the public health commissioner, said the elevated concentration in the wastewater is “very concerning” because increases in COVID-19-related hospitalizations, combined with flu season, will cause “major strain” on Boston’s health care system. Ojikutu said it’s important to try to get ahead of the issue and recommended that people get booster shots and flu shots, wear a mask indoors, get tested for COVID-19 and isolate if they test positive to help reduce transmission. Nearly 79% of Boston residents are fully inoculated against the disease. The commission began noticing elevated coronavirus levels in the wastewater in late September.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has signed another extension of a law that makes people convicted of crimes, typically with low incomes, responsible for a portion of local court expenses. The law, which raises millions of dollars for local governments, doesn’t apply to others who use Michigan’s court system. It has been criticized, even by judges, as unfair at minimum and unconstitutional at worst. The state Supreme Court last spring heard a challenge by a man who was ordered to pay $1,200 in Alpena County. But instead of settling the matter, the court said it would hear more arguments during its 2022-23 term. The Legislature in September voted to keep the law going for an additional 18 months. Only 17 lawmakers opposed it. Whitmer, a Democrat, said she signed the extension last week. Rep. Sarah Lightner, R-Springport, acknowledged it puts another “Band-Aid on this issue” while a long-term court funding solution can be explored. A group called the Fines and Fees Justice Center tracks how states impose fines and fees in courts. Co-director Lisa Foster said Michigan stands out because judges who preside over a criminal case are also given power to order financial penalties that benefit local government. People convicted of crimes can be ordered to pay a portion of staff salaries and building maintenance.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State Attorney General Keith Ellison sued Fleet Farm on Wednesday, alleging the retailer negligently sold firearms to two straw buyers, including one gun that was used in a shootout in a St. Paul bar that left one person dead and 14 bystanders injured. The lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges that Fleet Farm ignored multiple red flags that should have tipped off chain officials, including sales of multiple guns in single purchases. It alleges that Fleet Farm stores sold the two at least 37 firearms over a 16-month period. Most of the guns have not been recovered, Ellison said. Ellison, a Democrat, is facing a stiff reelection challenge from Republican candidate Jim Schultz, who has made violent crime his top issue. “We comply with all applicable gun laws and devote substantial resources to training and compliance,” countered Fleet Farm spokesman Jon Austin. He said that after the St. Paul shooting Ellison highlighted, “we were told by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that our team members had ‘done nothing wrong’ and had complied with all applicable gun laws.” The Midwestern company has 17 stores in Minnesota that sell firearms. Straw buyers purchase firearms from licensed retailers and resell them to people who can’t legally buy them or on the black market.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city is heading off the threat of a garbage pileup by agreeing to pay its overdue bill for collections the past six months. Even as Jackson struggles with a troubled water system, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City Council have been feuding over the garbage contract for the city of 150,000 residents. Richard’s Disposal has picked up Jackson garbage since April without compensation. The company said it would stop collections after Saturday unless it receives payment. City Council President Ashby Foote told the Associated Press on Friday that the city will pay $4.8 million, and garbage collection will continue. Lumumba awarded an emergency contract early this year to Richard’s after the council voted multiple times against hiring the New Orleans-based company. Jackson has had water problems for years, and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September because torrential rainfall exacerbated problems with the main water treatment plant. Crews are still making emergency repairs to the water plant, and questions remain about the quality of water in the city where 80% of residents are Black, and a quarter live in poverty.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A mother whose son died less than an hour after he was transported from a jail to a state prison has won a $1.2 million settlement in a case that helped lead to suspensions, firings and reforms. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Angela Malcich claimed in the suit that nurses and guards at the St. Louis County Justice Center repeatedly ignored the serious medical distress of her son, Daniel Stout. He was arrested June 3, 2019, on a parole revocation and spent the next eight days in the county jail. The night before his death, Stout complained of stomach pains but was told he would have to wait until the morning to see a nurse, the suit claims. That morning, though, jail staff told a worsening Stout that he would need to wait for care again until he could be transported more than an hour to the state prison in Bonne Terre. Upon arriving, he was vomiting blood and died before emergency crews could get there. An autopsy blamed complications of an ulcer that perforated his intestine. Four other inmates also died in the county jail in 2019, with an internal report finding that all of them had acted “strangely” beforehand and that most were denied medical care.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A draft report from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s housing task force details a slew of ideas to boost housing supply in an effort to tackle Montana’s affordability crunch, previewing legislation that could be advanced during next year’s legislative session, the Montana Free Press reports. Several of the task force’s recommendations involve scaling back local zoning restrictions such as minimum lot sizes, building height limits and parking requirements to make it easier to develop more dense housing developments in urban areas with existing access to services like water lines, streets and fire departments. The report released last week calls for legislation that places “sideboards” on the development restrictions towns and cities have the power to enact and also suggests providing financial incentives to local governments that implement “key regulatory reforms.” The group also suggests putting some state money toward supporting affordable housing efforts. It generally avoids suggestions that seek to address housing challenges with new government regulations, such as restricting AirBnB-style short-term rentals. The task force, which is set to formally present its recommendations to the governor in the coming weeks, is looking for public comment to consider as it finalizes its initial report by a Saturday deadline.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city will have a new tallest building once Mutual of Omaha completes its planned $600 million headquarters tower downtown in 2026. Mutual CEO James Blackledge told the Omaha World-Herald it recently became clear that the insurance company’s new skyscraper would eclipse the 45-story First National Bank tower. The new Mutual building is projected to be 677 feet tall. That would make it 43 feet taller than the First National building that opened in 2002. Mutual didn’t set out to build the city’s tallest building, but Blackledge said he’s proud of the impact the project will have on Omaha’s downtown and its image. “I think people see skylines, and it does create an impression of all the things we want Omaha to be perceived as – a vibrant, growing, thriving place where people can live and work and prosper,” he said. The new building will be designed to hold roughly 2,400 of the company’s 4,000 headquarters workers at any one time, reflecting the rise of working from home. It will also be a little less than half the size of Mutual current 1.7 million-square-foot headquarters complex in midtown Omaha. In conjunction with the Mutual project, Omaha leaders have pledged to build a $306 million, 3-mile-long streetcar line to connect midtown with downtown by sometime in 2026.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Victims of a quick series of stabbings on the Las Vegas Strip described the shock and horror of the unexpected attack Thursday on a group of showgirls and others outside a casino that left two people dead and six injured. Police arrested Yoni Barrios, 32, after a short chase blocks from where they say he attacked four showgirls and ended up stabbing eight people. An arrest report released Friday said Barrios told police some of the victims had laughed at him, and he “let the anger out.” Prosecutors said he’ll be charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. “I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me,” said Victoria Caytano, one of the showgirl impersonators who was released from the hospital Friday after she was treated for a stab wound. “I got up, and I started running,” Caytano told KLAS-TV. “I started yelling, ‘He has a knife!’ ” The coroner’s office identified those killed as Las Vegas residents Brent Allan Hallett, 47, and Maris Mareen DiGiovanni, 30. Hallett was stabbed in the back, and DiGiovanni died from a chest wound, authorities said. DiGiovanni was part of the Best Showgirls in Vegas modeling and talent agency, according to Cheryl Lowthorp, who runs the business. She said two others with the agency were among the wounded, and a third escaped without injury.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former juvenile parole officer has been sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography and trying to send an explicit image to a child. Jason Ellis pleaded guilty in June. Prosecutors agreed in a plea agreement to drop a third charge of distributing child pornography. Ellis was fired from his job as a juvenile parole officer earlier in the year after he was arrested. An affidavit said Ellis sent online messages in 2020 and 2021 to undercover investigators posing as a 13-year-old girl and her father. Detectives uncovered more than 100 images of child sex abuse material on his phone, WMUR-TV reports.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state would sell off all of its pension fund investments in oil, gas and other fossil fuel companies under a bill approved by a New Jersey Senate committee Thursday. The bill targets any pension money invested in 200 of the largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies based on each of their carbon content in oil, gas and coal reserves. It was passed 3-2 along party lines with Democrats in support and Republicans against. “The clock is ticking, and there is not that much time left,” said state Sen. Bob Smith, D-Middlesex, the bill’s sponsor. “We’ve got to get our industry to change and our economy to change.” The pension fund was valued at $92.9 billion as of May 31, but it is not known exactly how much is invested in fossil fuel company stocks. A state Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a request for that information Thursday. Divest NJ, a group advocating for the measure, estimates it’s between $3 million and $4 million, based on documents it has obtained. The measure had languished in Trenton for almost five years and still has a long road ahead of it. It was moved to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday and would still need to be approved by the full Senate, the Assembly and Gov. Phil Murphy. It would take effect 12 months after being signed into law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has asked the federal Department of Justice to assign more FBI agents to the state in response to violent crime. Lujan Grisham said Wednesday in a statement that she wants to replicate the success of a recent surge in FBI resources and agents in Buffalo, New York. The Sept. 15 letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland describes a recent spate of homicides in Albuquerque and says that “additional federal agents are needed to alleviate the current strain on New Mexico’s law enforcement offices.” Lujan Grisham sent a similar request in June to FBI Director Christopher Wray. Lujan Grisham spokeswoman Nora Meyers Sackett said the governor’s office did not receive a response from the Department of Justice as of Wednesday evening. Concerns about crime are a prominent theme in the race for governor ahead of the Nov. 8 general election as Lujan Grisham seeks a second term in office. Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Ronchetti has painted a dire portrait of public safety conditions, railing against the state’s bail system and vowing a different approach to judicial appointments.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state police superintendent resigned Friday, days after Gov. Kathy Hochul said he was being investigated for his handling of internal personnel matters. In a statement, Hochul thanked Kevin Bruen for “his years of public service” and said that First Deputy Superintendent Steven Nigrelli will take over as acting superintendent on an interim basis. Bruen had been in charge of the state police since June 2021. A 20-year veteran of the department, he was appointed superintendent by Hochul’s predecessor, Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bruen’s resignation is effective Oct. 19, the state police said. Hochul told the Albany Times Union’s editorial board on Tuesday that she had ordered her counsel’s office to investigate allegations against Bruen. Among them, according to the newspaper, is whether he had shielded a senior human resources official from complaints about her own handling of personnel issues.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s two top Democratic officials are urging the Republican-led Legislature to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in light of President Joe Biden’s pardon Thursday of thousands of Americans convicted of “simple possession” under federal law. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein, the state’s top lawyer who is considering a run for governor in 2024, shared their support for the president’s decision at a Friday task force meeting on racial equity and criminal justice. Established by Cooper in June 2020 after George Floyd’s murder, the 24-member panel of law enforcement officers, attorneys, civil rights advocates and state officials had recommended in a 2020 report that state lawmakers replace the misdemeanor charge for possessing up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana with a civil offense on par with a traffic infraction. The General Assembly did not act on this recommendation. “Conviction of simple possession can mar people’s records for life and maybe even prevent them from getting a job,” Cooper told the task force Friday. “The General Assembly didn’t pass your recommendations on this last session, but I believe they should. North Carolina should take steps to end this stigma.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s five American Indian tribes are seeking exclusive rights to host internet gambling and sports betting in North Dakota – a monopoly worth millions – just a year after legislators turned aside a push by one big national player to allow gambling in the state. The tribes are turning to Republican Gov. Doug Burgum to approve the idea under tribal-state agreements known as compacts, the first of which was signed in 1992. The current compacts expire at the end of this year, and only Burgum can approve them, said Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator. The tribes argue their casinos have been hurt by the explosion of electronic pull tab machines statewide after they were legalized in 2017, with North Dakotans pouring almost $1.75 billion into the machines in fiscal 2022. Their proposal, obtained by the Associated Press, is still in draft form. A public hearing on a final proposal is set for Oct. 21, McDaniel said. DraftKings, a big player in the U.S. mobile gambling market, supported legislation and a failed resolution last year to allow sports betting in North Dakota to join about two dozen other states. The company said at the time that sports wagering already is taking place in North Dakota through illegal offshore markets.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A law banning virtually all abortions will remain blocked while a state constitutional challenge proceeds, a judge said Friday in a ruling that will allow pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation to continue for now. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Christian Jenkins issued the preliminary injunction from the bench after a daylong hearing where courthouse guards screened spectators, and one abortion provider testified to wearing a Kevlar vest over fears for her safety. In impassioned remarks announcing his decision, Jenkins knocked the state’s arguments that the Ohio Constitution doesn’t ever mention abortion and thus doesn’t protect the right to one. He said a right doesn’t have to be named to be protected. “This court has no difficulty holding that the Ohio Constitution confers a fundamental right on all of Ohioans to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice in health care decision-making that encompasses the right to abortion,” he said. He said the state failed to prove that the ban on most abortions after detection of fetal cardiac activity is narrowly tailored enough not to infringe on those rights. Rather, Jenkins said, the law is written “to almost completely eliminate the rights of Ohio women. It is not narrowly tailored, not even close.” The state is expected to appeal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nBlanchard: Jody Miller, whose “Queen of the House” won the 1966 Grammy Award for best country performance by a woman, died Thursday at age 80. Miller died in her hometown, Blanchard, of complications from Parkinson’s disease, according to Universal Music Group, owner of Capitol Records, which released most of her hits. “Queen of the House” was released in 1965 as an answer to Roger Miller’s hit “King of the Road.” The hit opened up a crossover career for Jody Miller, who wasn’t related to the “King of the Road” composer and singer. Her 1965 teen protest song “Home of the Brave” was her biggest-selling single, despite being banned from some radio stations’ playlists. Another hit was “Long Black Limousine,” a song about a man’s funeral procession. In the 1970s, Miller moved to Epic Records, where she had hits with “Baby I’m Yours,” “There’s a Party Goin’ On,” “Darling, You Can Always Come Back Home,” and the Grammy-nominated crossover hit cover of “He’s So Fine.” She retired in the 1980s to spend more time with her husband and children. After her husband’s death, she recorded a 2018 single, “Where My Picture Hangs on the Wall,” with daughter Robin Brooks Sullivan and Miller’s two grandchildren.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A serial rapist is set to be released from prison in mid-December after serving nearly 36 years behind bars, almost all of his maximum sentence. Richard Gillmore, arrested in 1986 and called the “jogger rapist” because he staked out victims as he ran by their homes, admitted to raping nine girls in the Portland area in the 1970s and ’80s but was only convicted in one case because of the statute of limitations. In 1987, a jury found him guilty of raping 13-year-old Tiffany Edens, his last known victim, in December 1986. The Associated Press generally does not name people who have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Edens has spoken out about the assault and recently wrote on social media that she received a voicemail in August from the state’s Victim Information and Notification Service telling her of his impending release. “I have been slowly processing the reality of it all,” she wrote. The Oregonian, citing prison officials, reported that Gillmore was transferred in August from Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla to the minimum-security Columbia River Correctional Institution in Portland to help him prepare for his reentry into the community. He will be 63 at the time of his release in December. KOIN reports Gillmore will remain under supervision until 2034.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An Italian heritage group has vowed to appeal a judge’s ruling that officials can remove a 13-foot statue of Christopher Columbus from a city park. Attorneys for the Italian Sons and Daughters of America have argued that the mayor doesn’t have the power to override an ordinance passed by the City Council in 1955 that cleared the installation of the 800-pound statue of the explorer. Common Pleas Judge John McVay Jr. ruled about a week ago that because the statue erected in 1958 is in a city-owned park, it represents government speech – citing a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a Utah city rejecting a monument proposed for a city park by a religious group. The Italian Sons and Daughters of America filed the lawsuit in October 2020 after the Pittsburgh Art Commission voted to remove the statue. Then-Mayor Bill Peduto then also recommended its removal. McVay had for two years urged the two sides to work toward a solution, including its relocation to a different location. The statue has been vandalized numerous times and is wrapped in plastic. “Based on the court’s ruling, the mayor can put up or take down any statue he wants on any city-owned property without regard for other branches of the city government,” the Italian Sons and Daughters of America argued. “Obviously, this cannot be correct.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Festival of Children’s Books and Authors returns to an in-person format this year for the first time since 2019, kicking off Friday with a virtual appearance by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor at Lincoln School. Sotomayor, who has written several children’s books in addition to a 2013 memoir, will speak to and answer questions from Rhode Island children. Free signed copies of her books “Just Ask” and “Just Help” will be given to children who attend the 4:30 p.m. event. The festival will continue Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lincoln School, where participants can listen to 30-minute talks by authors, purchase books and have them signed; make book crafts; and buy lunch from a variety of vendors. Authors and illustrators at the event will be Mary Jane Begin, Gaia Cornwall, Anika Aldamuy Denise, Christopher Denise, Rita Hubbard, Kekla Magoon, Juana Martinez-Neal, Oge Mora, Hayley Rocco, John Rocco, Bob Shea, Melissa Stewart, Chris Van Allsburg and Rhode Island’s poet laureate, Tina Cane, as well as members of Rhode Island Black Storytellers. Admission to the two-hour kickoff event with Sotomayor is free, but space is limited, and advance registration is recommended online. Admission to Saturday’s festival is $5.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Write-in U.S. House candidate Lee Turner rallied in downtown Greenville on Saturday to spread the word about her campaign. Turner had no intention of running for Congress, she said, but after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, details of incumbent U.S. Rep. William Timmons’ personal life went viral online, and Democratic candidate Ken Hill dropped out of the race, Turner said: “I’ve got to do something.” Turner said she’s running a campaign based on finding solutions, common ground and bringing elected officials from across the aisle together. “I became more sure that this district needed someone like me, who was a problem solver, versus somebody like Mr. Timmons, who’s just going to tow the party line,” Turner said. While she has run for office as a Democrat in the past, Turner said she is truly an independent who believes people are more alike than they are different and hopes to create legislation with mutual benefits across political ideologies to help the masses. “Mutual benefit is the strongest glue ever,” she said. “It needs no legislation to even sustain itself, but if you do legislate it, it’s not likely to be overturned by the next party in power because it’s mutually beneficial.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A new free online tutoring program is available for K-12 students in the state, administered by the Board of Regents and funded by the Department of Education. The Dakota Dreams Online Tutoring Program is staffed by college students at Black Hills State University and Northern State University who are preparing to become teachers. The program uses a secure online platform for students and tutors to connect for virtual sessions in English, language arts, math, science and social studies. Secretary of Education Tiffany Sanderson said the program will allow K-12 students to receive individualized support after the school day has ended. “Once a parent has registered their child, students can access a tutor from home, the local library or after-school program, or even their favorite coffee shop,” Sanderson said. “I think parents are going to like this one-on-one support as much as their students.” To access the free service, parents first need to register their students to use the platform. Once registered, sessions can either be scheduled in advance or on-demand, depending on tutor availability. Tutors will be available Monday through Sunday afternoons and evenings. The service will not be available on holidays and during Christmas and spring breaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country music icon Loretta Lynn was buried in her family’s cemetery on her Hurricane Mills estate Friday morning. The private ceremony of about 100 guests took place in the unincorporated Humphreys County town she bought in the 1960s after achieving worldwide fame with “Coal Miner’s Daughter.” Lynn died Oct. 4 at the age of 90. She left instructions for her funeral ceremonies, including plans for a large memorial where fans will be invited. “A public memorial is being planned,” family spokesperson Ebie McFarland said. “The family did have a private ceremony Friday with no other details available to share at this time.” McFarland said details about the public ceremony will be released soon. Loretta Lynn’s Ranch is one of the largest campgrounds in the state and draws streams of tourists throughout the year to the rural expanse, where she built an event center and other attractions. Lynn, who owned roughly 3,500 acres in Humphreys County, lived in the estate’s mansion until 1988 before turning it into a tourist center and moving into a smaller house on the property. She also built a museum and replica of the Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, cabin where she grew up for tourists to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The city’s school district suspended its entire police force Friday amid fresh outrage over the hesitant law enforcement response to the gunman who massacred 21 people at Robb Elementary School. The extraordinary move follows the revelation that the district hired a former state trooper who was among hundreds of officers who rushed to the scene of the May 24 shooting. School leaders also put two members of the district police department on administrative leave, one of whom chose to retire instead, according to a statement released by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District. Remaining officers will be reassigned to other jobs in the district. Uvalde school leaders’ suspension of campus police operations one month into a new school year in the South Texas community underscores the sustained pressure that families of some of the 19 children and two teachers killed have kept on the district. Brett Cross, the uncle of 10-year-old victim Uziyah Garcia, had been protesting outside the school administration building for two weeks, demanding accountability over officers allowing a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. Families have said students in the district are not safe so long as officers who waited so long to confront and kill the gunman remain on the job.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A jury found two animal rights activists not guilty on charges of burglary and theft after they allegedly took two sick piglets from an industrial pig farm. Activists Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, with the California-based group Direct Action Everywhere, had argued during their trial that nothing of value was stolen because the 3-week old piglets were in poor condition and likely to die. The not guilty verdict was delivered Saturday following a weeklong trial. The group took a 360-degree virtual reality video of the March 2017 incident at Smithfield Food’s Circle Four Farms near Milford and promoted it online, as part of a tactic known as “open rescue” that’s meant to shed light on abusive farming practices. Investigators used the video to identify the defendants and three other activists who were charged and took plea deals rather than go to trial. Hsiung and Picklesimer faced up to 51/ 2 years in jail if they had been convicted, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. In 2017 a federal court struck down a Utah law banning secret filming at farm and livestock sites, claiming the restrictions were an unconstitutional violation of free speech.\n\nVermont\n\nRichmond: Residents of a small community were blindsided last month by news that one official in their water department quietly lowered fluoride levels nearly four years ago, giving rise to worries about their children’s dental health and transparent government – and highlighting the enduring misinformation around water fluoridation. Katie Mather, who lives in Richmond, a town of about 4,100 in northwestern Vermont, said at a water commission meeting last week that her dentist recently found her two kids’ first cavities. She acknowledged they eat a lot of sugar but said her dentist recommended against supplemental fluoride because the town’s water should be doing the trick. Her dentist “was operating and making professional recommendations based on state standards we all assumed were being met, which they were not,” Mather said. Kendall Chamberlin, Richmond’s water and wastewater superintendent, told the Water and Sewer Commission in September that he reduced the fluoride level because of his concerns about changes to its sourcing and the recommended levels. He said he worries about quality control in the fluoride used in U.S. drinking systems because it comes from China – an assertion that echoes unfounded reports about Chinese fluoride that have circulated online in recent years.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: A Civil War reenactor pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he planted a pipe bomb at a battlefield in 2017 and threatened to disrupt additional events. A federal indictment against Gerald Leonard Drake, 63, of Winchester, Virginia, was unsealed Thursday. The indictment accuses Drake of planting a pipe bomb at Cedar Creek Battlefield during an annual reenactment in October 2017. The bomb did not detonate but resulted in cancellation of the reenactment after its discovery. The indictment also charges him with writing letters threatening violence at subsequent Cedar Creek reenactments, as well as an annual Remembrance Day Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. At a press conference Thursday announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said Drake falsely claimed connections to Antifa in his threatening letters not only to hide his actual identity but also to create additional political angst. In reality, according to the indictment, Drake was a Civil War reenactor who regularly participated in events at Cedar Creek until he was expelled from his unit in 2014. The indictment, though, does not explicitly state that bitterness over his expulsion motived his alleged misconduct.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia National Park: Park officials have closed recreational fishing indefinitely because waters have reached historic lows. The National Park Service announced it would halt all recreational fishing starting Thursday on the Ozette, Bogachiel, South Fork Calawah, Sol Duc, North Fork Sol Duc, Dickey, Quillayute, Hoh, South Fork Hoh, Queets, Salmon and Quinault rivers. The Cedar, Goodman, Kalaloch and Mosquito Creeks within Olympic National Park are also closed, The Seattle Times reports. The region for months has seen above-average temperatures and low rainfall. Seattle has had 0.48 inches of rain from July to September, while the average for that period is 3.16 inches, making it the driest such stretch on record. Park officials said they hope the closure will help protect fish, especially those trying to make upstream spawning migrations in the low water levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A West Virginia University fraternity has been cleared of hazing allegations but will be sanctioned separately on other violations, the school said. Pi Kappa Phi and the school agreed to end the fraternity’s interim suspension related to alleged hazing. The chapter will be on deferred suspension through February and lose some privileges through June, the school said Thursday. “In this case, our inquiry found no evidence of hazing, but exposed recruitment and alcohol behaviors which violate our Student Conduct Code,” said Jill Gibson, director of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities. The fraternity agreed to participate in education, training and harm reduction programs, WVU said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A Dane County judge refused Friday to issue a temporary order that would allow local election clerks to accept partial witness addresses on absentee ballots. A group called Rise Inc. filed a lawsuit in September seeking a judicial order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission to tell local clerks that they must accept ballots as long as the witness address includes enough information that clerks can reasonably discern where the witness can be contacted. The day after the group filed the lawsuit, its attorneys asked Judge Juan Colas to issue a temporary injunction mandating that the commission issue that guidance to clerks. Colas refused to issue the order during a hearing Friday morning, online court records indicate. The case will continue with a scheduling conference set for Oct. 17. Rise Inc., which encourages students to vote, sued after a Waukesha County judge last month sided with Republicans and said clerks are barred from filling in missing witness information on ballot envelopes. The judge struck down guidance the elections commission put in place six years ago, saying nothing in state law allows clerks to do that. The practice was unchallenged until Donald Trump lost Wisconsin to Joe Biden in 2020. About 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots in that election.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Springs: Yellowstone National Park is postponing the opening of a renovated road at its north entrance as it continues to repair the damage from this summer’s catastrophic flooding, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The park has pushed back the road’s opening date from Oct. 15 to Nov. 1, according to the newspaper, as park officials said they need more time to ensure that over 5,000 feet of guardrail are properly installed for traffic safety. “We have set incredibly aggressive time frames for these repairs, and our contractors have worked at lightning speed to get this road safely reopened,” Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a news release. “It’s essential that we do not cut corners and we ensure the road meets required safety standards prior to opening.” Unprecedented flooding in June severely damaged roads, swept away homes and forced the park to close as it evacuated about 10,000 visitors. The National Park Service said the most significant damage occurred at the Yellowstone’s north and northeast entrances, where access was cut off. The flooding washed out segments of the roadway between the north entrance and Mammoth Hot Springs. To reconnect the two areas, authorities have paved and expanded an old stagecoach route from the 1880s called Old Gardiner Road.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}]}

From miscaptioned videos to false claims about his conviction, viral claims have repeatedly misrepresented the president's son and his relationship with the law.\n\nIn the wake of Biden’s conviction on three federal gun charges, the USA TODAY Fact Check team recapped some of the false and misleading claims that have gone spread most widely — and what’s actually true.\n\nRead more: After Hunter Biden's guilty verdict, a look back at viral falsehoods\n\nJoe Biden doesn't address Hunter Biden case in first public comments since verdict\n\nJoe Biden gave remarks on gun violence in Washington on Tuesday, just hours after his son was convicted in his felony gun trial.\n\nThe president spoke at Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund’s “Gun Sense University,” where he called for banning assault weapons, instituting universal background checks and passing other gun control measures.\n\nJoe Biden was specifically addressing gun violence in his remarks. Hunter Biden was not accused of physically harming others in the felony case.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat kind of gun did Hunter Biden buy?\n\nThe gun Hunter Biden purchased and held onto for 11 days in 2018 is a .38 caliber Cold Cobra, known as a 38 special. The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense. The president's son told Delaware State Police he bought it for target practice in 2018.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nJoe Biden said he would not pardon Hunter Biden while he was on trial for federal gun charges last week, according to a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nABC anchor David Muir, interviewing Biden in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, asked whether he would accept the outcome of his son’s trial.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\nMuir also asked if he would rule out a pardon for his son.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the military?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge, which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict adds to Joe Biden's distractions\n\nHunter Biden's felony conviction on Tuesday could continue to distract President Joe Biden during pivotal weeks of his 2024 reelection bid, with the first presidential debate against former President Donald Trump fast approaching and the president's son's second federal criminal trial coming shortly before Election Day.\n\nAlthough not a part of his father's campaign and not on the ballot himself, Hunter Biden's conviction on three gun related charges could also complicate Joe Biden's campaign's labeling of his opponent, Trump, as a felon who should not return to the Oval Office.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat's next for Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden’s conviction in his federal gun trial is not the end of his legal drama.\n\nStill pending are the 54-year-old's sentence, his potential appeal and a Supreme Court case that could overturn the law behind his charges. The president's son − a lawyer, businessman and author − also faces a second federal trial on tax charges set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for the three charges: lying on a federal screening form by denying, lying to a gun dealer and possession of a firearm while using or addicted to unlawful drugs. But sentences for first-time and nonviolent offenders are typically shorter than the maximum possible.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGOP lawmakers both celebrate and downplay Hunter Biden verdict\n\nFor the Republicans who have long sought to prove wrongdoing by President Joe Biden and his family, Tuesday’s jury decision finding the president’s adult son, Hunter, guilty on all charges was welcome news.\n\nHowever, the fanfare was somewhat muted – at least, less than one might expect from a Congressional cohort that has been probing the Biden family's business ties for more than a year and with a presidential campaign already in full bloom ahead of November's Election Day.\n\nHouse Republicans spearheaded an investigation in 2023 and early 2024 into Hunter Biden’s ties to foreign businesses as part of an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. They say Joe Biden benefited financially from Hunter Biden’s business deals, but have not unearthed evidence that supports that claim and the inquiry has largely fizzled out.\n\n– Riley Beggin and Ken Tran\n\nDavid Weiss speaks publicly after verdict\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss said in a three-minute statement that the verdict reflected that no one in the country is above the law. He thanked Attorney General Merrick Garland for ensuring his independence of the investigation.\n\n“Ultimately this case was not just about addiction,” Weiss said. “This case was about the illegal choices the defendant made while in the throes of addiction.”\n\nWeiss did not take questions from the media, noting DOJ has \"additional trial work to be done\" on the Hunter Biden case.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Isabel Hughes\n\nJuror: ‘Oh man, I don’t want to be here.’\n\nA couple of the jurors who heard the Hunter Biden trial are speaking publicly about their deliberations.\n\nOne woman who served said she feared the case would be politically charged once she realized the trial involved the president’s son.\n\n“Oh man, I don’t want to be here,” she said. “I was expecting all of us to be at each other’s throats because you know of who his father is and how the political climate is in this country,” she said.\n\nBut after being selected, evaluating the evidence and returning guilty verdicts, she said there was not a problem with deliberations.\n\n“It turned out much better than what I expected,” she said. “There was not fighting, none of that in the jury room.”\n\nAnother juror agreed that politics played no role in any jurors vote.\n\n“It was just following the evidence,” the juror said. “We just had to find out the truth.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Bart Jansen\n\nJurors: First vote was split even\n\nTwo jurors who presided over Hunter Biden’s criminal trial said they took an evenly split vote on count one shortly after receiving the case for less than an hour of deliberation on Monday afternoon.\n\nFrom there, they studied the elements of the charges in the jury instructions and talked, jurors said. They deliberated for about two hours after returning guilty verdicts.\n\n“We broke it down and heard other people’s opinions,” one juror said after issuing the verdict. “That is what moved me to guilty on all three.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJuror says Hunter Biden case was a 'waste of taxpayer dollars'\n\nA female juror who lives near New Castle, Delaware said she felt the case should not have been prosecuted. She said Biden needed rehab, “definitely not imprisonment.\"\n\n“In my opinion this was a waste of taxpayer dollars,” the woman said as she left the courthouse. “They could have just fined him.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHere's how Hunter Biden, his lawyer Abbe Lowell reacted to verdict\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking his family for their love and support during the trial while saying he was “disappointed by the outcome.”\n\n“Recovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time,” Biden said.\n\nHis lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said he respected the jury’s verdict, but he would “continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump advisor comments on Hunter Biden's conviction\n\nKash Patel, a national security advisor for former President Donald Trump, said in a statement Tuesday that \"Hunter Biden’s guilty verdict is a rare example of constitutional justice, one not where individuals receive biased treatment based on their last name. The jury was able to consider the prosecution and the defense evidence in full, in accordance with due process.\"\n\nPatel alleged without evidence that the former president did not receive the same treatment in his New York hush money trial, when he was convicted on 34 felony counts.\n\n– Erin Mansfield and Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden reacts to Hunter Biden's verdict\n\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement on Tuesday following Hunter Biden's conviction, saying that \"I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\"\n\nHe added that \"(first lady Jill Biden) and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRead Hunter Biden's verdict\n\nWhen will Hunter Biden be sentenced? Judge Maryellen Noreika doesn't immediately set date\n\nMaryellen Noreika, the judge who presided over Hunter Biden's case, didn't set a sentencing date for the president's son on Tuesday.\n\n\"Usually when we do sentencing it is 120 days out, but we will get in touch with you,\" she said before the courtroom adjourned.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden guilty of?\n\nThe president's son was convicted on three firearms felonies. In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n2024:Hunter Biden guilty verdict adds to president's distractions ahead of Trump debate\n\nHunter Biden looks to lawyer, wife after verdict announced\n\nHunter Biden pat Abbe Lowell, his lawyer, on the back after his felony conviction was announced. He then turned to look at his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden and hugged other members of his defense team.\n\nHe was holding his wife's hand as he was ushered into elevators after the court adjourned.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Esteban Parra\n\nWhat's next for Hunter Biden?Sentencing, likely appeal and looming trial on tax charges\n\nHallie Biden received texts about drugs from Hunter Biden\n\nHallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, testified during the trial about how her brother-in-law introduced her to drugs. She also walked the jury through a series of text messages in the days after Hunter Biden bought the gun on Oct. 12, 2018.\n\nA text the next day said he was behind a baseball stadium in Wilmington “waiting on a dealer named Mookie.”\n\nHallie Biden later texted Hunter Biden, stating that she tried calling him “500 times in the past 24 hours.” He eventually responded: “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nHunter Biden called Hallie Biden ‘stupid’ for trashing gun\n\nHallie Biden told the jury she found the gun in Hunter Biden's car 11 days after he bought it. Rather than risk their kids finding it, she put the gun in a leather case and drove to a grocery store, where she threw it into a trash can.\n\n“I realized it was a stupid idea now, but I was just panicking,” Hallie Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden confronted her when he discovered what she had done.\n\n“It’s hard for me to believe anyone is that stupid,” Hunter Biden said in a text. “Do you want me dead?” he asked in a later text.\n\nRetiree found gun in grocery store trash can\n\nAn 80-year-old retiree, Edward Banner, who scavenged trash containers for aluminum cans, found the gun outside Janssen’s Market in Greenville. A state police lieutenant tracked him down and asked whether he’d found anything unusual.\n\n“I definitely remember finding that,” Banner said.\n\nFBI chemist found cocaine residue on Hunter Biden gun pouch\n\nForensic chemist Jason Brewer testified that he found cocaine in the residue on the leather pouch that held Hunter Biden’s gun. Two spots on the pouch had a “minimal amount” of “off-white powder,” which Brewer pointed out in a picture prosecutors projected onto a screen in Biden’s trial on gun charges.\n\n“Cocaine was identified within the residual white particles I sampled,” he told the jury.\n\nHunter Biden trial followed collapse of plea deal for gun and tax charges\n\nA plea agreement that fell apart last July offered the possibility Biden could avoid jail time for all of the charges. Noreika rejected the deal because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about Biden’s protection from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, a special counsel to continue an independent investigation. Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued unsuccessfully the charges should be dismissed because no new evidence had emerged since the plea agreement.\n\nThe gun indictment charged Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver. He was charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he was charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms. The three charges carried a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nThe tax indictment charges Biden with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors. He allegedly engaged in a scheme in which he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed taxes from 2016 through 2019, and also evaded tax assessment for 2018 when he filed false returns.\n\nThe previous agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, which could have resulted in no jail time, and enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied.\n\nBut Republicans blasted the agreement as a sweetheart deal and Hunter Biden became a lightning rod for criticism of his father.\n\nWhere does Hunter Biden live?\n\nHunter Biden lives in southern California. There, he faces tax charges in a separate trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nHis felony gun trial took place in Delaware because in 2018 he purchased the revolver and ammunition from a gun shop in Wilmington.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son. He's faced three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form. The third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/03/hunter-biden-trial-live-updates/73949001007/", "title": "Hunter Biden trial live updates: Jury selected in felony gun case", "text": "WILMINGTON, Del. − A jury was sworn in on Monday in Hunter Biden's felony gun trial, after a pool of dozens of potential jurors spent the day answering questions about whether they could remain impartial during the high-profile case.\n\nThey also addressed issues ranging from gun ownership to addiction and the Biden family's long history in Delaware.

The instructions include some basic warnings, including not to speak to anybody about the case or do any independent research.\n\nIt also included some basic instructions about taking notes, the case's flow and jurors' role evaluating the evidence. Afterward, she excused the jurors with instructions to return to begin again at 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nOpening statements by the parties are expected then. Prosecutors said their first witness will be an FBI agent responsible for investigating the case.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury sworn in for felony gun trial\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in at 4:20 p.m. for Hunter Biden's felony gun case, and opening arguments will begin on Tuesday.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWe have a jury pool, but not quite a jury\n\nThe court has churned its way through dozens of Delawareans and has a pool of 36 potential jurors. Now, both sides will get the opportunity to strike potential jurors without stating a specific reason.\n\nThe government will have six strikes and Hunter Biden's attorneys will have ten. Each side will also each have two strikes for alternate jurors.\n\nThis process should be done rending a jury of 12 and four alternates by the close of business today, meaning opening statements are likely to occur first thing Tuesday.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury selection expected to wrap up on Monday\n\nWhat's the timing for the rest of Hunter Biden's trial in Delaware?

He also faces nine tax charges in California in another case, in which he's accused of avoiding paying at least $1.4 million.\n\nHe's charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges tied to the allegations. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden being charged with?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘You can’t swing a cat without hearing something’\n\nOne potential juror was asked by the judge if he had previously heard about the case.\n\n“I live in Delaware, you can’t swing a cat without hearing something,” he told the judge, though he added that he had only heard about the case on the news but hadn’t researched it.\n\nProsecutors moved to strike the man because he said he had a family member who suffered from addiction and he holds strong feelings about second chances.\n\n“I think after people have been recovering, they need a second chance,” he said. “Everybody needs a second chance.”\n\nHe said he wasn’t sure what time period that second chance should come and that it should be down to the individual. He said this belief would not impair his ability to judge the evidence and he was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nThere's no rule that a president can't pardon a loved one. But if Hunter Biden is convicted on federal charges, it's not likely that his father would use his office to take action.\n\nThe White House last year ruled out President Joe Biden using his presidential authority to pardon his son. The president has given no indication that he planned to pardon Hunter Biden, but that hasn't stopped some critics from suggesting he might.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Joey Garrison\n\nCourt making progress selecting jurors\n\nSo far, the court has worked through more than three dozen potential jurors. Twenty-four have been selected to remain in the jury pool.\n\nThe court will continue to interview potential jurors until it has a pool of 36. After that, the parties will be granted what’s known as \"peremptory strikes\" until the pool is whittled to 16.\n\nThat pool will comprise 12 jurors and four alternates that will stand in if any of the 12 must be dismissed mid-trial.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nDrug addiction a common theme in juror interviews\n\nA common theme in the juror interviews so far: Many people have been touched by addiction among family and loved ones.\n\nMultiple people have told the court that someone close to them have struggled with addiction, some becoming emotional in answering the questions and some reporting that they’ve lost someone close to them to addiction.\n\nThat isn’t an automatic disqualifier as most potential jurors have answered that they could remain impartial in evaluating the evidence.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWill Hunter Biden's daughters be at the trial?\n\nHunter Biden's children were not in attendance at the trial on Monday. Hunter Biden and Melissa Cohen Biden have a 4-year-old son, Beau Biden, and he and his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, have three adult daughters: Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden and Maisy Biden.\n\nLunden Roberts, the mother of Hunter Biden's youngest daughter, is expected to provide testimony in the case. It's not clear if she would bring their 5-year-old daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, to the courthouse.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happened to Hunter Biden’s plea deal?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss secured two indictments for gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement in July that aimed to resolve the investigation.\n\nWeiss, as U.S. attorney in Delaware, had investigated Biden for years. Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhich jurors could be selected?\n\nThe court ruled some jurors were qualified after they answered questions about potential hardship in attending the trial, their political work in the past and family members who have suffered addiction.\n\nOthers were quizzed about their local connections and encounters with the Bidens. One potential juror said they worked at the same college as First Lady Jill Biden for a period. He also supported current Superior Court Judge Farris Wharton’s campaign for Delaware Attorney General against Hunter Biden’s brother, Beau, two decades ago. He said those aspects of his life would not challenge his ability to fairly view the evidence in the case and was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n“I’d listen to any testimony with an open mind,” he answered when quizzed about whether he’d be more apt to believe a police officer’s statement if it were in conflict with another person’s.\n\nAnother potential juror was a bartender at Two Stones Pub in New Castle County and said she served a Biden family member there from time to time, but didn’t know him. She was allowed to stay on.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCourt churns through potential jurors\n\nTwo hours into jury selection, a handful of potential jurors have been dismissed over concerns about their impartiality.\n\nOne was dismissed after expressing his opinions on rights around gun ownership might color his view of the law and evidence. Another noted his father was a police officer for 30 years and his grandfather worked for the FBI. He told the judge he felt he could not be impartial because of this.\n\nOne person told the court she read stories involving Hunter Biden from when his father, Joe Biden, was running for president.\n\n“I don’t know if I can be impartial from previous opinions about things I’ve heard,” the person told the court.\n\nProsecutors pressed her on what that opinion was. “Not a good one, sorry,” she responded and was dismissed.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden, Lunden Roberts and Kathleen Buhle could testify\n\nProsecutors have said they'll call about a dozen witnesses as they make their case against Hunter Biden during the trial, according to multiple reports.\n\nThose may include Hunter Biden's ex wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as the mother of his youngest daughter, Lunden Roberts. Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, is also expected to testify. She and Hunter Biden were in a relationship following Beau Biden's death.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\n\nHunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, could last more than two weeks.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said in court filings they will present photos, testimony and messages to show that Hunter Biden was an illegal drug user around the time he bought the gun and failed to disclose that as required on a federal gun purchase form.\n\nProsecutors also said they may use details gleaned from his phone, iCloud account and the infamous laptop that he allegedly abandoned at a repair store, including photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack and texts arranging meetings with illegal drug dealers.\n\n– Reuters\n\nMore:Hunter Biden bursts into public view: Here's how the president's son will play a central role in 2024\n\nMore:What is an addict? Hunter Biden is fighting what that means as gun trial looms\n\nSee the questions lawyers will ask potential Hunter Biden jurors\n\nHere are the 47 questions potential jurors will be asked as Judge Maryellen Noreika looks for twelve impartial Delaware residents to take their seats at Hunter Biden's federal gun trial. The questionnaire gets to the heart of the unusual case involving the president's son, drug addiction and firearms. Among the questions:\n\nDo you believe Robert Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States and a candidate for President?\n\nDo you have any strong negative views about past users of controlled substances, narcotics, or alcohol?\n\nDo you or a close family member have any experience purchasing a firearm (including a handgun, pistol, automatic rifle, hunting rifle, or other)?\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nJudge begins questioning potential jurors\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika began questioning potential jurors in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges and explained rules for participating in the case, including not reading media coverage.\n\nShe aims to seat 12 jurors and four alternates.\n\nNoreika is asking potential jurors whether they can impartially review the evidence in the case. Questions include whether potential jurors know anyone involved in the case, along with general inquiries about their thoughts on politics, law enforcement and issues surrounding addiction.\n\nJurors who answer “yes” to one of the screening questions will be further questioned by the judge. Those interviews are occurring now. Out of the first pool of what was scheduled to be 50 potential jurors, only one did not answer \"yes\" to one of the screening questions, meaning this process will likely take a long time.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nPresident Joe Biden supports Hunter as trial begins\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement Monday supporting his son as Hunter Biden’s federal gun trial begins.\n\n“Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Joe Biden said. “Hunter’s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.”\n\nJoe Biden said he wouldn’t comment as president on pending federal cases. But he said he has confidence in his son and respect for him.\n\n“Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,” Joe Biden said.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden also faces civil trial against his ex-wife over alimony\n\nHunter Biden isn't just facing sweeping legal problems over gun and tax charges. Axios reported last week that – in 2021 – a Washington court found he was in breach of an agreement with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. At the time, he owed her over $1.7 million in legal fees, spousal support and other costs from their 2017 divorce.\n\nSince then, Buhle and Biden's legal battle has continued, and her attorneys have argued he still owes her millions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden’s family stays close for federal trial\n\nHunter Biden’s relatives stayed close for his trial on federal gun charges, with his father, President Biden, remaining in Wilmington on Sunday night for the start of jury selection Monday.\n\nHunter Biden arrived at court holding hands with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden. His mother Jill and sister Ashley arrived separately. Hunter Biden's past drug use is at the heart of charges he lied on a federal form and to a gun dealer when buying a guy in 2018.\n\nThe two courtroom benches behind Hunter Biden and his defense team, where Jill and Ashley Biden were seated, were filled before the jury was called into the courtroom.\n\nMore:As Trump's trial nears an end, the Bidens prep for a month in legal purgatory\n\nThe family support contrasted slightly with the attendance at another high-profile trial, that of former President Donald Trump in New York.

Potential jurors won’t be asked about interactions at Pep Boys, worshipping at St. Joseph on the Brandywine or watching his grandchildren’s flag football games, but they will be asked about connections to the family.\n\n\"Are you, any member of your immediate family, or close friends acquaintances with Robert Hunter Biden or any member of his family?\" reads the seventh of 47 questions listed on the jury selection document.\n\n−Ryan Cormier\n\nMore:When everyone's met a Biden in Delaware, how hard will it be to find a jury?\n\nHunter Biden arrives at federal courthouse for trial on gun charges\n\nHunter Biden arrived about 8:10 a.m. Monday for the start of his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nHis sister, Ashley Biden, arrived about 10 minutes earlier.\n\n−Esteban Parra\n\nMore:'Karma' or 'political prosecution?' Voters weigh in on Hunter Biden criminal trials\n\nTrial's key moment: Was Hunter Biden sober on Oct. 12, 2018?\n\nA large part of Hunter Biden’s trial will boil down to a single day in October 2018, when he bought a .38 Special revolver at a Delaware gun store and checked “No” on a federal gun form that asked about drug addiction or drug use.\n\nThe federal drug form asked: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?”\n\n“At issue here is Mr. Biden’s understanding of the question,” his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. “Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.”\n\nSome drug treatment experts told USA TODAY they wouldn’t consider a patient cured of addiction after 11 days of treatment.

The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn’t the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is “irrelevant” and would confuse jurors. Noreika agreed and barred the form from trial, in one of two rulings Sunday against the defense.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:These are the people, places that will take center stage in Hunter Biden's trial\n\nJudge bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden’s proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden’s defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son.

He is charged with falsely filling out a federal firearms form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he is charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the deal as too lenient. But legal experts say the charges are rarely filed.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland testified at the House Judiciary Committee on Sept. 20 that Weiss was appointed by President Biden's rival, Donald Trump, and ran his investigation independently.\n\nWhat happened with Hunter Biden's plea deal?\n\nThe indictment came after a plea deal on tax and gun charges fell apart. The taxes charges could still be refiled.\n\nThe plea agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program for the gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied. The deal might have allowed him to avoid prison.\n\nBut Noreika refused to accept the deal because of disputes between government and defense lawyers about whether it protected Biden from potential future charges.\n\nHunter Biden's criminal charges are politically charged for Joe Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden stuck by his son, Hunter Biden, as he faces gun charges and the potential for tax charges, but the loyalty could cost the father politically during his campaign for reelection in 2024.\n\nJoe Biden said he was proud of his son before a plea deal on tax and gun charges collapsed in July.

In the hours after the verdict, he did not address it on social media, and people in his orbit issued contrasting messages, indicating they hadn't decided on a strategy for handling the guilty verdict.\n\nTrump and Joe Biden are scheduled to face each other for the first time this year in a presidential debate June 27.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSentencing is normally 120 days after the jury reaches a verdict, Judge Maryellen Noreika told the president's son on Tuesday. If that holds true in Hunter Biden's case, it would mean his family would find out how much time he would serve just days before the election.\n\nThe trial in Delaware laid bare graphic details of Hunter Biden’s yearslong struggle with addiction, at times causing Biden family members visible anguish in the courtroom. First lady Jill Biden, who is Hunter's stepmother, watched much of the testimony along with her daughter Ashley Biden and Hunter Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden. After about three hours of deliberation the jury found Hunter Biden guilty on three counts Tuesday.\n\nThroughout the the proceedings, the White House and Biden's campaign team refused to discuss the historic occurrence of the child of a sitting president facing felony criminal charges for the first time, which they called an internal family matter. Within an hour of the verdict, the president issued a statement that expressed his love for Hunter, saying he is “so proud of the man he is today.”\n\n“So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,” Joe Biden said.\n\nBut ultimately, the president underscored that he must respect the jury’s decision.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” Joe Biden said in his statement. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nThe president stayed away from the courthouse and avoided discussing the trial in public, but it has long been apparent that he is extremely protective of his youngest, and only surviving, son.\n\nJoe Biden halfway through the trial that if convicted, he would not pardon Hunter Biden.\n\nNonetheless, George W. Bush biographer Bill Minutaglio said the airing of Hunter Biden's dirty laundry has gone beyond what other president's children have been subject to, and that must eat at the president.\n\n\"I'm sure that he deeply, deeply cares for Hunter, and it must drive him crazy. It really must cause him a lot of sleepless nights to weigh the political calculus versus the personal calculus,\" Minutaglio said.\n\nThe family put up a united front in the Wilmington courtroom as it has for the unrelated year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Biden family's business dealings by House Republicans.\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about Hunter Biden?\n\nGOP officials largely avoided discussing the Delaware case, with some saying Republican voters were already up in arms about Trump's 34-count felony conviction and they didn't want to change the topic.\n\nHouse Republicans' impeachment inquiry into the president has largely stalled ahead of the election, though Republican leaders wrote to the Justice Department during the trial recommending Biden’s son Hunter and brother James be charged for making false statements to Congress during the investigation.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., who has been the face of that impeachment effort, called the verdict \"a step toward accountability\" but again urged the Justice Department to do its own investigation of Hunter Biden's overseas business.\n\nDuring the trial, Trump himself was asked to address the proceedings during an appearance on Fox News, but he instead pivoted to talk about addiction and his brother Fred Trump Jr., who died of complications from alcoholism.\n\nThat is noticeably different than how Trump acted in the 2020 contest. The former president repeatedly brought up Hunter Biden's business ties to Ukraine, and mocked his past drug abuse.\n\nThe former president's allies also released multiple reactions after the verdict.\n\nKash Patel, Trump's national security adviser, said in a statement that the verdict \"is a rare example of constitutional justice, one not where individuals receive biased treatment based on their last name\" and \"a fleeting moment of justice for all.\"\n\nHe attempted to contrast Hunter Biden's verdict with Trump's, saying in this situation the jury got to view all the evidence, a complaint Trump made in his case that the judge would not allow some evidence to be admitted.\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued an additional statement on Tuesday saying the Hunter Biden trial, “has been nothing more than a distraction” from the “real crimes” being investigated by Congress.\n\n“Crooked Joe Biden’s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on Nov. 5,\" Leavitt said.\n\nDuring their first presidential debate in 2020, Trump called out Hunter Biden for being administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nThe specter of Hunter Biden's legal troubles will likely rise again ahead of Election Day. He faces a second trial in September in California over his failure to pay taxes for several years.\n\nMore than half of Americans said in a Reuters/Ipsos poll last summer that they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he is the president's son. That includes 75% of Republicans, 42% of independents and 33% of Democrats, the survey showed.\n\nCongressional Republicans made similar claims Tuesday.\n\n\"Timing is everything. This is the veil of fairness in the Justice System under (the president),\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said on X, \"never forget DOJ tried to avoid this trial & verdict by giving Hunter a sweetheart plea deal. Until the judge exposed them.\" The gun case went to trial after a plea deal fell apart in July 2023 that could have resolved gun and taxes charges without prison time.\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict may also muddy waters for Democrats, who as of late have relished in calling Trump a convicted felon. Other progressive allies, however, may use this moment to undercut Trump and Republican claims that there is a two-tiered legal justice system.\n\nWill Hunter Biden's conviction matter to voters?\n\nWhether any of this will have an impact on the election is up for debate.\n\nRepublican thinkers hold varying opinions on how Hunter Biden’s legal woes could play out on the trail, with some suggesting Trump should take a no holds barred approach.\n\n“This takes the gloves off now that these law cases are part of the political system, and it’s perfectly clear now that they ought to be discussing Hunter Biden’s behavior. I do not think this should be left alone,” Jim Gilmore, a former Virginia governor who served in the Trump administration, told USA TODAY.\n\nPolling has shown the president's son isn't the top of mind for most voters, but other gauges show Joe Biden's son is a vulnerability.\n\nAn October 2023 AP-NORC poll found 68% of U.S. adults think Joe Biden acted either unethically or illegally in his son's business dealings. Just 30% said Joe Biden has done nothing wrong regarding Hunter’s business dealings.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican strategist, said it could be wise for Trump to mostly steer clear of talking about his son on the campaign trail.\n\n\"People already want to fire Biden, and where he's going to win the race is giving them a reason to rehire him and this has nothing to do with that,\" he said.\n\nBut Jennings said Hunter Biden's criminal charges could be used as a Republican jab against Biden when he speaks up for gun control or wealthier Americans paying a higher tax rate.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican political consultant who worked on former Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid, said the multiple Trump statements on Tuesday underscore that the presumptive GOP nominee’s team hasn’t figured out how to talk about this yet.\n\nShe said Trump won’t be able to resist bringing up Hunter Biden on the trail, but that may not win over pivotal voters.\n\n\"The problem is going to be fundamentally that Trump is on the ballot and Hunter isn’t,\" she argued. \"People really don’t care about Hunter as a criminal the way they care about Trump as a criminal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/13/joe-biden-donald-trump-hunter-biden-convicted-felon/74068598007/", "title": "Biden tagging Trump a 'convicted felon' muddied by son's conviction", "text": "WASHINGTON ― After Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts in his New York hush-money trial last month, President Joe Biden quickly embraced a new label for his successor and presumptive Republican nominee − \"convicted felon.\"\n\n“For the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,” Biden told supporters at a June 3 fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nYet with Tuesday's conviction of Hunter Biden on three gun charges by a federal court jury in Delaware, the same description now applies to the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict − a historic first for a child of a sitting president − could complicate the Biden campaign's efforts to use Trump's conviction for falsifying business records against the former president in the 2024 election.\n\nOfficials on Biden's reelection campaign and congressional Democrats have echoed the president calling Trump a \"convicted felon\" and \"convicted criminal.\" But after Tuesday's conviction of Hunter Biden, branding Trump a criminal might invite heightened scrutiny about Biden's family.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA source close to the Biden campaign said it won't shy away from calling Trump a \"convicted felon\" even after Hunter Biden's conviction, insisting Americans know the difference between verdicts for Trump, who is running for president, and Hunter Biden, a private citizen.\n\nBut Republican strategist Scott Jennings said Hunter Biden's guilty verdict could provide Trump an effective counter during his first of two televised debates with Biden on June 27.\n\n\"Especially if Joe Biden goes in on repeatedly calling Donald Trump a convicted felon, trying to get under his skin,\" Jennings said. \"I think Trump could fire back. It might give Joe Biden some pause on how hard he goes at the debate, because he's going to have to deal with a retort.\"\n\nTrump also faces indictments in three other pending cases, two of which are federal, including his handling of classified documents and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. Outcomes for each, however, might not come until after the November election.\n\nRichard Painter, a law professor at University of Minnesota who was chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said he doesn't believe the Hunter Biden case has any relevance on Biden attacking Trump as a convicted felon.\n\n\"Hunter Biden is not running for president,\" Painter said. \"The real problem is that Donald Trump is running for president, and he has serious legal difficulties, and a lot of them have to do with his conduct in office. That directly goes to whether Donald Trump is capable of being a good president for four years.\"\n\nHunter Biden verdict delivers blow to Republicans' argument of 'weaponized' DOJ\n\nUnlike Trump, who has sought to discredit the U.S. judicial system and decried a \"rigged trial\" after his conviction, President Biden said he will accept the outcome of his son's case, respect the judicial process as Hunter Biden considers an appeal and won't pardon him.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday would not say whether Biden would consider commuting Hunter Biden's upcoming sentence, which will come on a later date.\n\nDemocrats seized on the parties' strikingly different reactions to the two cases.\n\n\"The divide here is stunning, and it's a great reminder that one political party remains committed to the rule of law and the other doesn't − it's that simple,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass, said at a congressional hearing Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans' claim of a \"weaponized Justice Department\" orchestrated by the Biden administration and Democrats was undercut by Hunter Biden's guilty verdict. The case was brought by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed Justice Department special counsel, and was overseen by a Trump-appointed judge. Hunter Biden also faces another federal trial starting Sept. 5 in California for allegedly avoiding taxes.\n\nStill, Trump and Republicans responded to Hunter Biden's guilty verdict by calling his conviction on gun charges \"a distraction\" from bigger crimes, pointing to unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden profited as vice president from his son's overseas business dealings.\n\n\"As usual, the only 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' going on around here is on the other side of the aisle,\" McGovern said. \"People are saying that Biden orchestrated the conviction of his own son in order to justify the criminal charges against Trump. That is how you think when you are in a cult.\"\n\nHe added: \"Here's the bottom line: Republicans just can't wrap their heads around the idea that their presidential candidate, your presumptive nominee, is a convicted felon.\"\n\nJulian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University, said he doesn't believe Hunter Biden's guilty verdict handcuffs the Biden campaign from labeling Trump a convicted felon, particularly given Republicans' continued efforts to delegitimize the legal system.\n\n\"I don't think the fact that Hunter Biden was convicted for this complicates the message,\" Zelizer said. \"In some ways, Democrats are hoping it strengthens how Americans see the Democrats being committed to a legal process that many Republicans are essentially questioning.\"\n\nThe first family has stayed loyal publicly to Hunter Biden amid his legal troubles. First lady Jill Biden sat on the front row of a Delaware federal courtroom throughout his trial. \"As I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" President Biden said in his statement after his son's conviction.\n\nAfter giving remarks before a gun control advocacy group in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, Biden altered his schedule to travel to Wilmington, Delaware, where he embraced Hunter Biden with a hug on an airport tarmac.\n\nBiden left Washington on Air Force One Wednesday for Italy, where he is attending a Group of Seven nations summit. The president has not taken questions from reporters about his son's conviction.\n\nZelizer said the enormous media consumption of Hunter Biden's guns case, along with the upcoming tax evasion trial, poses a challenge for the Biden campaign because it risks drawing attention from its argument against Trump and the former president's own legal woes.\n\nAnd even though Hunter Biden's cases don't involve the president, Zelizer said Trump and Republicans \"will try to muddy the waters\" and argue \"somehow this is evidence that the Biden family and President Biden is corrupt.\"\n\n\"So I do think this is something that can hurt Biden and that he needs to figure out how to overcome it,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Phillip Bailey.

Specifically, prosecutors claim that Biden, in purchasing the gun, lied on federal forms by denying that he was addicted to any narcotics. The president’s son has acknowledged he was addicted to drugs at the time.\n\nThe charges carry the potential for 25 years in prison, though a first-time offender like Hunter Biden would likely not receive such a sentence if convicted.\n\nIn court filings and public statements, an attorney for Hunter Biden criticized the charges as illegitimate and said his client will plead not guilty Tuesday, setting up the potential for a criminal trial in Delaware sometime in the future.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhat’s happening Tuesday?\n\nHunter Biden's arraignment and initial appearance in the gun case is scheduled for Tuesday. The purpose of the hearing is essentially for the judge to ensure that Hunter Biden understands his rights and the charges against him, allow him to enter a plea, and for the court to set the terms of his pretrial release.\n\nThe hearing will occur in the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building on King Street in downtown Wilmington where dozens of national reporters will stage before and after the hearing. Attorneys on both sides expect the hearing to go quickly, according to their submissions to the court.\n\nIn recent weeks, Hunter Biden’s attorneys asked the court to allow him to attend via video conference.\n\nIn a letter written to the judge, attorney Abbe Lowell said his client understands his rights and the charges against him, intends to plead not guilty and so traveling from his home in California to Wilmington would be unnecessary for “what should be a rather short proceeding.”\n\nRECENT: Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges for allegedly lying about drug addiction\n\nProsecutors under Davis Weiss, the U.S. Attorney for Delaware, argued that Hunter Biden’s appearance in person was “important to promote the public’s confidence that the defendant is being treated consistently with others.”\n\nThey also argued that Hunter Biden’s in-person attendance will be more “conducive” to sorting out any issues that may arise, citing contradictory statements he made at a July hearing where a deal to stave off the charges he now faces fell apart.\n\nPresiding Judge Christopher J. Burke ultimately ruled that Hunter Biden must attend the hearing, which was originally scheduled to occur last week.\n\nWhat’s changed since July hearing?\n\nThis will be Hunter Biden’s second federal court appearance in Delaware in recent months.\n\nIn July, his attorneys had struck a deal with federal prosecutors. The plan for both sides going into that hearing was that Hunter Biden would plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a separate diversion agreement to stave off prosecution on the gun charges.\n\nThat diversion agreement gave him immunity from potential future prosecutions involving his finances as long as he abided by the terms of that agreement.\n\nHowever, the parties’ accord unraveled under questioning from presiding District Judge Maryellen Noreika.\n\nNoreika’s questioning exposed differing positions between defense attorneys and prosecutors over the scope of immunity the diversion agreement allowed. She also questioned what role she would have in potentially enforcing the agreement, accused both parties of seeking a “rubber stamp” and said she could not accept the plea deal without further information.\n\nShe ordered the parties to amend the wording of the agreement and submit further briefings, but the divide between the attorneys exposed in the hearing only grew after the court adjourned.\n\nLOCAL COVERAGE: How Hunter Biden's plea agreement fell apart in federal court, leading to not guilty plea\n\nSince then, federal prosecutors filed paperwork dismissing the tax charges and indicating they will refile the charges in either California or Washington D.C. They also told the court they regard the gun-diversion agreement as dead. Hunter Biden’s attorneys have told the court the agreement is still in place.\n\nIt is unclear if Tuesday’s hearing will address the disputed diversion agreement.\n\nWhat could come next?\n\nThe situation puts the president’s son on track for a potential criminal trial in Delaware as his father campaigns for reelection. But it’s likely defense attorneys will seek to have the charges thrown out ahead of that potential trial.\n\nIn a written statement published by USA Today, Lowell, one of Hunter Biden’s lawyers, labeled the new firearms charges as a product of political pressure. He said nothing changed in the weeks since prosecutors were willing to not pursue the charges with the diversion agreement.\n\nHe added that the previous agreement Hunter Biden had with prosecutors and recent court rulings elsewhere invalidate the charges.\n\nIMPEACHMENT HEARING RECAP:Here's what witnesses said about Joe Biden, Hunter Biden\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden’s finances are also part of a congressional inquiry by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives seeking to tie the president to his son’s business dealings overseas. Additionally, a handful of lawsuits over Hunter Biden’s laptop continue to move through the courts.\n\nMost recently, Hunter Biden sued Rudy Giuliani, claiming the then-campaign attorney for former President Donald Trump illegally copied, manipulated and distributed his private records.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN CASE:Lead prosecutor cut a contentious path during his time in Baltimore\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/20/hunter-biden-white-house-plea-deal-tax-charges/70337728007/", "title": "Joe and Jill Biden react to son Hunter's guilty plea: They 'love their ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden offered a one-sentence response to reporters who asked him Tuesday about Hunter Biden's decision to plead guilty to two counts of tax evasion and one firearm offense.\n\n\"I'm very proud of my son,\" Biden said in San Francisco at an event on artificial intelligence.\n\nBiden did not respond to questions about whether he had asked his son to accept a guilty plea.

White House officials have repeatedly declined to comment and have stressed that the administration has not discussed the case with Attorney General Merrick Garland or the Justice Department.\n\nBut it’s doubtful that Biden will be able to stay silent about the case for long.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have sought to turn Hunter Biden and the investigation into a political issue and already are ramping up their criticism in light of the plea agreement.\n\n\"Our system is BROKEN!\" Trump, who has been indicted on federal charges over classified documents and New York state charges over business records, said in a post on Truth Social after the plea agreement was announced. Trump claimed the Justice Department had let Hunter Biden off the hook by giving him \"a mere 'traffic ticket.'\"\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters on Capitol Hill that the agreement continues to show \"the two-tier system in America.\"\n\n\"If you are the president's leading political opponent, the DOJ tries to literally put you in jail and give you prison time,\" he said. \"If you are the president's son, you get a sweetheart deal.\"\n\nWhat McCarthy did not say: David Weiss, the U.S. attorney who oversaw the Hunter Biden case, was appointed by Trump and served under both of Trump's attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly sought to use the federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s private affairs as part of their campaign to portray the Biden family as corrupt. The plea agreement could reverberate into the 2024 presidential election and increase the pressure on Joe Biden to publicly address the case.\n\nThat doesn't mean he should, said William Howell, director of the Center for Effective Government at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"The political pressures may mount for Biden to issue some kind of public statement,\" Howell said. \"Just now, though, I think he’s right to stay quiet. Nothing he can say will likely convince Republican voters about the integrity of these investigations, particularly while Republicans leaders are leveling all kinds of accusations without recognizing, with due care, the material differences between these cases.\"\n\nIn the meantime, \"it’s best for officials other than the president himself to draw out these distinctions and to ground our discussions, for those willing to listen, in matters of fact and legal procedure,\" Howell said. \"For now, at least, Biden’s silence is well advised.\"\n\nHunter Biden's plea agreement is a no-win situation for the White House, Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.\n\n\"It’s more than likely that Biden will face growing pressure to address this matter publicly,\" he said. \"When Biden eventually answers questions about his son’s legal treatment, then it will be a political gift to Republicans. It simply feeds oxygen onto a crisis that the Democrats would prefer to get behind them.\"\n\nIf Biden remains silent, \"Republicans can continue to pound the drum that there’s a likely executive coverup and it looks like Biden has something to hide,\" Bonjean said.\n\nMichael Collins and Maureen Groppe cover the White House.

His court documents indicate that he currently resides in Malibu, California.\n\nFederal prosecutors also claim Biden possessed a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver despite being addicted to drugs. That is a violation of federal firearms laws, prosecutors claim.\n\nHe bought the handgun in October 2018 somewhere in Delaware. On a required form, he replied \"no\" when prompted to answer whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nBy his own account, Biden has battled drug addiction for periods, including 2018.\n\nWhat exactly is happening Wednesday?\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over what is scheduled as a change of plea hearing for the tax charge and his initial court appearance for the gun charge.\n\nAccording to court documents, Hunter Biden is expected to plead guilty to both of the tax charges at the hearing. In such hearings, the judge will typically ask the defendant a series of questions to ensure they understand their rights and are knowingly pleading guilty.\n\nLOCAL DEALINGS:What Hunter Biden's emails reveal about his investment in now-defunct Fisker Automotive\n\nThe firearm charge is a felony and much more serious in terms of potential punishment.\n\nThe hearing may cover the logistics of a pretrial diversion agreement between prosecutors and Biden that would see that charge struck from his record if he adheres to the terms of that agreement. Those terms have not been discussed publicly as of yet.\n\nCould this send the president's son to prison?\n\nHunter Biden is not expected to see any prison time despite facing potential maximum sentences totaling 12 years in prison. It is rare for a defendant, particularly one with Hunter Biden's background, to receive anything close to the maximum punishment.\n\nThe two tax charges are punishable by a maximum of a year in prison each, along with potentially six-figure fines. Citing unnamed sources, the Associated Press has reported that prosecutors will recommend a sentence consisting entirely of probation for the tax charges.\n\nDID HUNTER BIDEN GET A SWEETHEART DEAL?How these cases play out with other defendants\n\nA judge will consider standardized sentencing guidelines alongside recommendations from prosecutors and defense counsel in sentencing Hunter Biden. In some cases, judges sentence defendants on the same day they plead guilty. However, there is no indication in court documents that will happen in Biden's on Wednesday. Sentencing may occur at a future court hearing.\n\nThe gun charge itself carries a potential 10-year sentence, but the pretrial diversion agreement will likely head off any potential prison time and require Biden to adhere to terms and monitoring similar to a probationary sentence.\n\nLast month, following the unsealing of the case against Biden, his lawyer, Christopher Clark, said the president's son will take responsibility for \"mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\"\n\nLong-running Delaware investigation\n\nThe charges are being brought by David Weiss, U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware. Weiss began the investigation five years ago and was appointed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, Weiss was not asked to resign like most U.S. attorney Trump appointees. Biden officials said that decision was made to ensure continuity in the investigation into Hunter Biden.\n\nWeiss has been targeted by congressional Republicans that have characterized the case as a “slap on the wrist” for Biden and the result of preferential treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans are continuing their own investigations into Hunter Biden and his family.\n\nUSA TODAY COVERAGE: Hunter Biden, White House, House GOP clash over widening investigation of Joe Biden's son\n\nNew developments included the first public testimony by two IRS agents involved in the Hunter Biden investigation, along with the public release of an FBI document with unverified allegations against President Joe Biden.\n\nLaptop lawsuit brewing in Delaware courts\n\nMeanwhile, Hunter Biden is suing the Trolley Square computer repair shop owner who claimed Biden dropped off his computer at the Wilmington shop and never retrieved it, which led to the leak and publication of private photographs and correspondence belonging to the president’s son.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in response to a defamation lawsuit pursued by the computer repairman, John Paul Mac Isaac, which names as defendants Hunter Biden, as well as news publications CNN and The Daily Beast and U.S. Rep.

Before the vote, she said it would be a \"historic mistake\" for the council to reject the resolution.\n\nEleven members of the 15-person council voted in favor of the measure; three, including Algeria, voted against it and Guyana abstained. Russia and China are permanent members of the Security Council, which gives them and three other countries veto power.\n\nRussia's ambassador to the U.N., Vassily Nebenzia, called the resolution a \"pointless\" and \"empty rhetorical exercise,\" saying it did not \"demand\" or \"compel\" a cease-fire. He also said the resolution did not adequately address Israel's conduct in the war and effectively gives its military a go-ahead to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where more than 1 million people have taken shelter.\n\n\"To save the lives of peaceful Palestinians, this is not enough,\" he said. \"This would free the hands of Israel and it would result in all of Gaza and its entire population having to face destruction, devastation or expulsion.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said the resolution went through several drafts and was the subject of \"exhaustive negotiations\" with members of the Security Council. She added that, more than just calling for a cease-fire, it would help make a cease-fire possible, pointing to negotiations involving Qatar, Egypt and the U.S.\n\nEight nonpermanent members of the Security Council drafted an alternative resolution that demands a cease-fire and the unconditional release of hostages, Nebenzia said. Thomas-Greenfield criticized the alternative resolution, saying it undermines \"sensitive diplomacy in the region\" and could lead Hamas to \"walk away from the deal on the table.\" She further said the Security Council should not adopt any resolution \"that jeopardizes the ongoing negotiations.\"\n\nThe U.S. has historically vetoed Security Council resolutions aimed against Israel and has blocked multiple measures that demanded a cease-fire since the war began. Friday's resolution represented the toughest position the U.S. has taken on the war as a rift between the Biden administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deepens.\n\nIn addition to the cease-fire, the measure called on Israel to \"eliminate all barriers and restrictions on humanitarian aid\" in Gaza; said the Palestinian Authority should govern the territory after the war; and reiterated calls for a two-state solution. Netanyahu has said Israel will not bow to pressure from the international community to accept a Palestinian state and has repeatedly opposed the Palestinian Authority having any governing role in postwar Gaza.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday met with Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet to talk through gaps between Israeli leaders and the Biden administration, humanitarian aid for Gaza and the invasion of Rafah. After their discussions, Netanyahu said in a video statement posted on X that Israel will launch its planned operation with or without U.S. support.\n\n\"We have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafah and eliminating the remnant of the battalions there,\" he said. \"I told him that I hope we would do this with U.S. support but if necessary – we will do it alone.\"\n\nNegotiations for a cease-fire continued Friday in Qatar among mediators as well as CIA Director William Burns and David Barnea, head of Israel's Mossad spy agency. Speaking about the negotiations before Friday's vote, Thomas-Greenfield said \"we believe we're close – we're not there yet, unfortunately.\"\n\nThe main barrier to a peace deal has been Israel's vow to continue the war after a pause in fighting and Hamas' demand for a permanent cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nNearly 32,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the war, and thousands more are feared buried under rubble, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. The invasion of border communities in southern Israel by Hamas and other militants on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200 Israelis, most of them civilians, and 253 people were taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.\n\nContributing: Reuters; John Bacon and Jorge L.

This is The Excerpt. Today, the latest around a possible ceasefire in Gaza. Plus, what's being done to prevent soldier suicides, and chronic absenteeism is plaguing America's schools.\n\n♦\n\nThe Biden administration's proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza received the United Nations' endorsement yesterday when the Security Council voted 14-0 in favor of a resolution supporting the plan. Only Russia abstained, but did not veto. The US drafted the measure and finalized it Sunday after six days of negotiations among council members. The three-stage proposal would bring about an immediate stop in the fighting between Israel and Hamas, along with the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed misgivings about the version of the plan President Joe Biden announced on May 31st, though the White House has said Israel was involved in creating it. Netanyahu is under pressure from the far-right flank of his governing coalition to continue the war. The Security Council measure says Israel has accepted the truce proposal, presses Hamas to do the same, and urges both parties to fully implement its terms without delay and without condition.\n\nBut Netanyahu has not voiced such approval and a senior Israeli UN diplomat did not make that commitment either. Hamas leaders have responded favorably to the resolution and said in a statement that they are ready to cooperate with mediators over implementing the principles of the plan, quote, \"that are consistent with the demands of our people and resistance,\" unquote.

I spoke with USA TODAY Pentagon correspondent Tom Vanden Brook to learn more. Tom, thanks for hopping on today.\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nTaylor, good to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTom, what's the data tell us here on the frequency of soldier suicides?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, this is a study that goes back five years, so it's a five-year period that ended in 2019, Taylor. And what it shows is that suicide was by far the most prominent cause of soldier death. So you were nine times more likely to die by suicide if you were a soldier than you would've been in combat.\n\nThat's somewhat surprising, given that even though combat was waning from 2014 to 2019, it was still occurring. So it shows again, as we've reported in the past, that suicide remains a really stubborn problem for the military.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd, Tom, do we have any numbers since 2019 on this?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, we have some numbers that we know about and the suicide rate has largely increased since then. So it's unlikely that this is a trend that's changed in a positive direction.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat are some of the factors driving these deaths?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nThat's what is bedeviling the military and really society at large as well, because suicide has increased throughout society since the year 2000. Some of the concerns have been the operational tempo has been super high in some fields for the military. There's been, as we've reported in Alaska, there was the problem of isolation up there and it was causing a couple of really bad spikes in suicide during this period, 2014 to 2019, and when we were up there reporting back in 2022. So it's a multifaceted problem.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTom, you and I have talked previously about this issue. The military has worked to address this problem in recent years. What have they done and have any of these possible solutions worked?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nSome things have worked. After our reporting in Alaska about the suicides there they surged mental health resources up there and the suicide rate dropped pretty significantly. So that helped. It's not the be-all, end-all. There's a limited supply of mental health providers for one thing, and it's not the only issue.\n\nAnd one of the things that I was talking to Army officials about last week, they're treating it in a more holistic way now, that there's not just one cause for this. That they're trying to reach young soldiers and try to prevent some of the harmful behaviors that might contribute to it, like alcohol abuse, the same sorts of things that lead to the sexual assault problem. Heavy drinking, financial problems, those sorts of things. So they're thinking that there may be a way to get at the suicide problem by just attacking all sorts of different issues that may be contributing to soldiers' mental health issues.\n\nAnd then one specific issue is how they store their firearms, soldiers store firearms. So that if they're stored securely, they may be able to avoid an impulse to take their lives just by having their guns locked up, so there's been increased emphasis on that.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Tom Vanden Brook covers the Pentagon for USA TODAY. Thank you, Tom.\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nThanks, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAn FDA panel yesterday endorsed the experimental Alzheimer's drug donanemab, which studies showed slowed early stages of the fatal mind-robbing disease. The recommendation came despite questions from advisory committee members about potential side effects. Eli Lilly's drug is an antibody that removes beta-amyloid that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The FDA is not compelled to follow the recommendation of the advisory committee of outside experts, but it often does so. An exception came when the advisory committee recommended the agency reject Biogen's amyloid-clearing drug aducanumab, though the FDA in 2021 approved the drug. Biogen halted sales and gave up ownership of the drug earlier this year.\n\nThis week the advisory committee unanimously agreed the studies showed that donanemab was effective at treating people with an early stage of Alzheimer's, a stage known as mild cognitive impairment. The panel also said the benefits of drug outweighed potential risks for people with early stages of the disease.\n\n♦\n\nChronic absenteeism is plaguing schools around the country. I spoke with USA TODAY education reporter Alia Wong for more. Alia, thanks for hopping on.\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAlia, you wrote that chronic absenteeism has really become an epidemic in America's schools. Strong words. Just how serious has this gotten and what do the numbers say?\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nIt's gotten really, really serious. Chronic absenteeism is when a student misses at least 10% of the school year, so that's about 18 days if you're looking at a 180-day calendar. It's not a new problem by any means, there've always been kids who've missed a lot of school. But it has gotten worse in the years since COVID first struck. And while people hoped it would improve as society progressed and it got a better handle on how to deal with COVID, it's actually gotten worse in some cases.\n\nJust one striking statistic to put things in perspective. Between 2018 and 2023, the chronic absenteeism rate nearly doubled from 15% to 26%. So we're still seeing about a quarter of kids missing at least 10% of the school year, and that has all kinds of consequences.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, that's really staggering. Alia. What are some of the factors that may be contributing to this?\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nIn my piece I highlight five key reasons. I won't dwell on them now but I'll go through them quickly. One is simply boredom. Kids are just feeling disengaged and not really excited about school, so they don't want to attend. Another is mental health. We know that young people, particularly adolescents, are dealing with really high rates of anxiety and depression, and that is deterring them from school. Relatedly, we know bullying remains a huge problem, and bullying is often a reason that kids cite when saying they don't want to go to school.\n\nAnother reason and a ripple effect of the pandemic, it's confusion over the rules. During COVID parents were told, \"If your kid has the sniffles or says they're sick or looks like they might have the fever, when in doubt, keep them home.\" The protocols have changed but parents' perceptions that they should act out of an abundance of caution have not in many cases.\n\nAnd then lastly, family issues, poverty, just hardship. Hardship makes it really difficult to stick to a routine, whether it's because you don't have transportation to school or because you're just dealing with so much at home, and that's contributing to the problem as well.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAlia, what's the broader effect of this many students missing school? Both the students who are absent and also the students who do attend regularly.\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nSimply put, when kids aren't in school it's harder for them to learn. During the pandemic online learning was a good alternative, but it wasn't ideal. Kids simply learn better when they're in the classroom, and that's particularly evident when it comes to social and emotional skills, whether that's understanding how to comply with a routine, how to follow instructions, how to treat others nicely, how to problem solve and ask questions. All of these are skills that are really hard to replicate at home or in any place that isn't a classroom with your peers.\n\nAnd the absences affect all kids, not just the ones who are missing class themselves. And that's because when kids are absent, teachers will have to adjust their lesson plans. They might have to hold off on teaching a particular unit or then they'll have to spend a lot of time on catch-up, and it just delays the learning process in ways that wouldn't happen if all the kids were in school. And what we know from the pandemic is that the switch to online learning and the switch away from classrooms really took a toll on student performance. And schools are still reeling from this, performance has not returned to pre-pandemic levels and achievement gaps have really widened.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAlia, what is the solution here? Is this really a matter of punishments or keeping kids engaged in the first place so they want to show up for school?\n\nAlia Wong:\n\nPunishments and a punitive approach to chronic absenteeism have proven time and time again not to work. And in fact, they often make the situation worse. When you penalize someone for truancy, the last thing they're going to want to do is come to school more. They'll feel like school is an unwelcoming place that punishes them when they do something wrong.\n\nThe solution is really improving that family-school engagement. Really just showing families all the beautiful, wonderful, ineffable things that happen during the school day that can't be replicated, that can't be substituted when kids are not in school. That comes down to giving parents opportunities to participate in the school community. It means pairing kids up with buddies if they don't have friends. It means making the instruction and the classroom activities more engaging. It's about providing that one-on-one instruction. Just really using these different levers that have been proven to improve student performance in general can really make a difference in chronic absenteeism.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Alia Wong covers education for USA TODAY.

A year later, when the state of Israel was created, the first Arab-Israeli War broke out. Ever since Israel's victory and following several other wars, Palestinians have gradually been displaced from territory that they also see as their rightful homeland.\n\nHamas launched a shocking attack against Israel – including the Nova music festival located a few miles from the Gaza Strip, where Hamas gunmen killed more than 260 revelers in the biggest civilian massacre in Israeli history, according to the Associated Press – on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. Around 1,400 Israelis were killed and countless people were injured, leading to retaliation by Israeli forces waging battle on the ground and with airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMore than 200 hostages seized during the incursion are still being held by Hamas.\n\nHamas' offensive is connected not only to specific Israeli military activity but to what the group views as a decades-long campaign to rob Palestinians of their land and displace them by force. For years, the group has vowed to annihilate the state of Israel and claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks.\n\nThe war, which is the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides, has put millions of lives at risk as attacks have intensified day by day with hospitals and homes destroyed and some civilians held hostage.

He has privately and publicly signaled that he sees Democrats’ better-than-expected midterm results as an endorsement of him running for a second term – and he’s reveling in how many in his party seem to be agreeing with him.\n\nBiden and his aides believe that even with a potential recession looming next year, his reelection argument will grow stronger. They say voters will start to feel the benefits from the implementation of laws the president has signed over the past two years. They think House Republicans flexing their narrow hold on power through government shutdowns and debt ceiling showdowns to try to force repeals of those same laws will help them even more.\n\nAccording to CNN’s conversations with 24 Democratic elected officials, top operatives and Biden aides, the past two weeks have left them more confident that Biden would be their best bet to beat Trump in 2024. Some say they miscalculated how much appeal Biden continues to hold. Others now realize voters see him as a likable enough bulwark against extremism and a decent man, who can be a standard-setting, consensus choice amid historic polarization. Several onetime opponents say they’ve come around to thinking that maybe his approach in not responding with rage to the people raging at him has been more effective with voters.\n\n“What he did translated more with voters than favorability ratings, and that’s important for Democrats to remember as we go forward,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, adding that after talking to Biden on the election night call he received as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, he’d be “surprised” if the president doesn’t run again.\n\nWhen asked, though, how they’d feel about Biden’s chances against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Republicans who could make a generational argument without the baggage Trump brings, many Democrats’ voices tend to tighten. “Not great,” said one top operative. “Uneasy,” said two others, in separate conversations.\n\nOthers point out that nearly all of Democrats’ key midterm victories were narrowly won, leaving them worried about how little room for error there likely will be next time.\n\nFour Democratic members of Congress, asking not to be named to speak candidly, estimated that at least half of their colleagues would pick someone other than Biden as their 2024 nominee – if they could vote by secret ballot.\n\nAll four also said that if there were a second question about whom they’d want instead, the votes would be all over the place – with several noting that one of the strongest arguments for Biden running is that it would help Democrats avoid a chaotic primary and give their bench time to gain more experience before the 2028 election.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, the first Democrat in Congress to call for Biden not to run, said that regardless of his respect for the president, the midterm results or where Biden’s popularity lands, the party needs to “create pathways for new generations of leaders.”\n\n“There’s a pragmatic element of this too. I believe the country will be in a place where they’ll be looking for a new generation as well,” said Phillips, whom several colleagues note has become the person voicing feelings others are keeping private.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet, one of the few Democrats running in 2022 who appeared at an event with the president and scored an unexpectedly big reelection win in the onetime swing state, had long talked about how the best argument for another Biden campaign was that he could beat Trump again.\n\nAsked after Trump’s announcement if he’d be as confident in Biden against another Republican, Bennet dodged.\n\n“I just think that’s too contingent a question to answer,” the senator said.\n\nA few weeks ago, when many expected significant House losses for the party, Phillips was one of multiple Democrats predicting that the election aftermath would include more and louder calls for Biden to step aside. Phillips acknowledged last week that those calls haven’t come but attributed that more to the “culture of deference” in Congress than to renewed support for Biden.\n\n“It’s a little bit like when Trump was president, and none of the Republicans would say what they really thought on the record,” said one Democratic strategist.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ann McLane Kuster also expressed doubts about Biden running for reelection as she campaigned in New Hampshire. Back in Washington after winning a sixth term by a wider-than-anticipated margin, she said she’s still not convinced.\n\n“I’m still in a wait-and-see, and I think a lot of people are,” Kuster said, noting that she has “been a Biden fan since she I was pregnant with my son, who was just sworn into the New York Bar.”\n\nAsked how she’d feel about Biden going up against a Republican who was younger and fresher than Trump, Kuster initially responded with a long “Hmmmmm.” She said she’s less concerned about that because she believes if Biden does run, that will drive Republicans to Trump, while if Biden doesn’t, that will drive them away from Trump.\n\n“It is an easy thing for people to underestimate Joe Biden – and they’ve been doing it and being wrong for a couple of election cycles now,” said one Biden adviser. As for those who still have doubts, “there are some Democrats who aren’t happy unless they can be anxious about something,” the adviser added.\n\nIncoming members of Congress who won their seats this year are among the most openly enthusiastic about a Biden reelection campaign.\n\n“I think he’s the guy who can beat anybody,” said California Rep.-elect Robert Garcia, who’s close with both the West Wing and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Presidents get reelected if they’re successful and if the American people want them back, and to me there is nothing in the president’s first two years that points to that he shouldn’t run again.”\n\nMaxwell Frost, the 25-year-old Florida Democrat who is the first member of Generation Z (those born after 1996) elected to Congress, said he was supporting Biden too, minutes after borrowing a tie to make his first visit to the House floor to watch 82-year-old House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announce she’d be stepping down from leadership.\n\n“He’s been unafraid to put forth bold, transformational ideas and policies, and that’s really what excites young voters,” Frost said, citing the infrastructure deal and the health care, tax and climate package dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. Asked whether he was concerned about a potential generational contrast with Biden if the Republicans back someone other than Trump, Frost said, “I’d say good luck with whoever they put up.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter” who the Republican nominee is, argued Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, fresh off his own reelection in a swing state that Biden won narrowly in 2020. “The Biden-Harris administration will carry Nevada and will carry the country again.”\n\nDrawing a contrast with Trump\n\nAfter a strategy of not even saying Trump’s name at all in his first year and then pounding on Trump by name throughout the midterm campaigning, the president is expected to revert to talking about his predecessor “sparingly,” an adviser said. What Biden and aides will do, though – like with the new section of the White House website touting administration achievements, which was launched last week a few hours before Trump’s presidential announcement – is emphasize their record in contrast with Trump’s rhetoric.\n\nA Trump rematch might be easier, several Democratic operatives involved with the preliminary thinking said, because they’d know how to go about it. They hope that one lesson of the midterms is Democrats’ ability to make voters see many leading Republicans as extreme and tainted by Trump.\n\nAs they wait on a Biden decision that they expect to drag into at least January, and with members of the president’s own Cabinet divided on whether he’ll go through with a launch, aides are planning to head into next year with events and travel to showcase now-tangible achievements.\n\n“There’ll be a bridge built that wasn’t built this year, more of the impact of prescription drug benefits will be felt,” said Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an early and consistent Biden supporter.\n\nEarly planning is also underway for a string of state dinners, starting with one scheduled for December 1 to honor French President Emmanuel Macron, both to highlight what the White House says is Biden’s reasserting of American global leadership and to demonstrate another notch toward a post-pandemic normal.\n\nMeanwhile, aides are also gearing up for two years of trying to frame every move by the new House Republican majority as extremist overreach, including undermining the legitimacy of any investigations in the eyes of the media and the public. They’re counting on House Republicans who face tough reelections in 2024 to themselves back away from some of the biggest threats, such as impeaching the president. And as personally painful as any Republican inquiries of Biden’s son Hunter will be for the president, aides believe that the politics will boomerang in their favor by making Republicans look like they’re chasing conspiracy theories down rabbit holes rather than governing and by making Biden seem empathetic in a way that has consistently been his greatest strength.\n\n“The last two Democratic presidents lost the House – by far more than Biden did – and in both cases, that provided a powerful reelection foil,” said a person familiar with White House thinking. “We are dealing with a much more extreme Republican Party than they were. … But Biden does not provoke the Republican base in the way that other national Democrats have.”\n\nAge vs. ‘wisdom and experience’\n\nRepublican attempts to make Biden an anchor to Democratic midterm candidates by saying his name and flashing his image in ads about inflation, border control or gas prices don’t seem to have been decisive for independents and swing voters. Biden’s greatest weakness has repeatedly proved his greatest strength, several Democratic strategists said: People don’t feel strongly about him. There are few T-shirts with his face on them or flags with his name on them, but he also doesn’t inspire passionate hate. As Republican operatives tend to admit, voters’ sense of him is so well established that it’s hard to make anything stick to him.\n\nWhat does stick, in focus group after focus group: his age – he turned 80 on Sunday – and the sense that he’s not up to the job. One place where that caused problems: Pennsylvania, where Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was seen as independent from Biden – until the aftermath of his stroke. Then, focus groups noted, voters began to draw connections between the two men related to their physical fitness for office. (Fetterman, however, was able to overcome enough of those perceptions to help his party flip an open seat.)\n\nBiden “has his work cut out for him in terms of having folks believe he can command this job for four more years,” said one person familiar with the focus group findings.\n\nSome Democratic politicians and operatives shudder imagining a younger Republican nominee campaigning around the country at multiple stops a day, bounding onstage and reinforcing the skepticism that’s already in voters’ minds. These Democrats say their solace is fantasizing about Trump failing to snag the GOP nomination and then sabotaging the Republican nominee’s campaign, out of spite.\n\nBiden’s inner circle has seen the focus group data and has heard the same complaints. They’ve also seen how those concerns faded over the summer, as Biden signed more bills. That mattered for other Democrats too, with Rep. Dan Kildee, who just won a tight reelection race in Michigan, saying that people connecting with those legislative successes “got me over the finish line.”\n\nKildee said he believed Biden would be strong against Trump in Michigan, which Trump won by less than half a point in 2016 but Biden carried by 3 points in 2020. As for how he’d fare against another Republican, “there’s too many chess moves between now and then to figure that out yet,” Kildee said.\n\nAfter how unpredictable the factors shaping the 2020 and 2022 elections were, Biden’s circle doesn’t see a point in trying to guess exactly what he’d be campaigning on by the end of 2024. But the Biden adviser touted the president’s “wisdom and experience,” saying that had “allowed him to achieve an extraordinary legislative record and extraordinary record of global leadership in the first two years of his term.”\n\n“I don’t see anybody else that’s stronger. With all the things he’s doing, I don’t care how old he is,” said Eileen Reyes, a former Pete Buttigieg supporter from Luzerne, Pennsylvania, speaking ahead of Biden’s joint rally with Barack Obama in Philadelphia the Saturday night before the election.\n\nStephanie Schlatter, a lawyer in Washington who wore her old Biden-Harris white T-shirt to the celebratory speech Biden delivered at a Washington theater two days after the midterms, agreed.\n\n“My parents are older than he is, and they’re still whooping it up,” she said. “People are starting to come back from the nastiness, and they’re starting to see results.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/02/ucla-columbia-college-protests-live-updates/73538023007/", "title": "Instigators, agitators behind violence, schools say: Protest updates", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on campus protests for Thursday, May 2. For the latest news, view our live updates file for Friday, May 3.\n\nLOS ANGELES − \"Instigators'' and \"outside agitators'' have been behind some of the most violent and shocking incidents from the rash of pro-Palestinian protests that have swept college campuses across the nation, according to two university leaders who grappled with major disturbances this week.\n\nUCLA Chancellor Gene Block vowed the university will investigate the events from the last few days, especially \"Tuesday night’s horrific attack by a mob of instigators\" on a protest encampment in a prominent university plaza, which left at least 15 people injured and prompted the school to cancel classes.\n\nEarly Thursday, police in riot gear swept onto the UCLA campus and tore down makeshift barricades that bordered the antiwar encampment, which had drawn hundreds of demonstrators before being attacked by counterprotesters late Tuesday into Wednesday. More than 200 people were arrested in the raid, according to the school.\n\nBlock said the encampment began peacefully but had become disruptive and a flashpoint that endangered students, so it had to go. Hostilities were \"continuing to escalate,'' he said.\n\nAt Columbia, the campus was much calmer Thursday, two days after hundreds of New York Police Department officers arrived and reclaimed a building that had been broken into and occupied by pro-Palestinian demonstrators, resulting in 112 arrests. Of those, 44 took place inside the occupied Hamilton Hall, 13 of them involving people the university called \"outsiders.''\n\nMayor Eric Adams warned about the involvement of \"external actors'' in the protests just hours before sending law enforcement to campus. Columbia President Minouche Shafik also cited the participation of “outside agitators” accused of escalating protests in her decision to call for police intervention.\n\nThe college protests stem from concerns for civilian deaths in Gaza during the Israeli-Hamas war that began Oct. 7 when about 1,200 people in southern Israel were killed and more than 200 taken hostage in a Hamas-led attack. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli reprisal, the majority women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Pro-Palestinian protesters in New Jersey dismantled their encampment on the Rutgers-New Brunswick campus after they had successful negotiations with university officials Thursday afternoon, NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network reported. In a statement, Rutgers-New Brunswick Chancellor Francine Conway said the \"resolution was achieved through constructive dialogue between the protesting students and our leadership teams.\"\n\n∎ Several dozen students were peacefully evacuated from the University of Mississippi campus on Thursday after more than 200 counter-protestors started to throw objects and shout at the protestors, the Mississippi Clarion Ledger, part of the USA TODAY Network reported. About 50 to 60 protestors had gathered for a demonstration before the event escalated with counter-protestors outnumbering the pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\n∎ Officials at the University of California, Berkeley, have opened talks with student leaders regarding the encampment set up in front of the school's Sproul Hall since April 22, the Daily Californian campus newspaper reported. The school said \"skirmishes'' at the site between protesters and counterdemonstrators Wednesday evening resulted in three people sustaining minor injuries.\n\n∎ Florida Chancellor Ray Rodrigues has told state university presidents not to cancel or modify commencement ceremonies because of \"unruly\" demonstrators. \"While we are witnessing a descent into chaos all over the country, under the leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis, Florida has maintained law and order,\" Rodrigues wrote in a memo to the presidents.\n\n∎ Students at several French universities, including La Sorbonne and Sciences Po, have barricaded or occupied areas of their schools in protest of the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden speaks out on college protests:'Violence is not protected'\n\nReports: NYPD officer accidentally fired gun at Columbia building\n\nA NYPD officer accidentally discharged his firearm inside Hamilton Hall at Columbia University while police were clearing out protestors who were occupying the building, according to media reports. The officer's action were first reported by news outlet The City on Thursday.\n\nNYPD and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office confirmed the incident to media outlets. Doug Cohen, a spokesperson for the district attorney's office, told The City that the firearm did not appear to be aimed at anyone and no one was injured.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, NYPD said the officer was attempting to access a barricaded area and tried to use a flashlight attached to his firearm. He accidentally discharged a single round that hit a frame on the wall, according to the AP.\n\nNo students were in the \"immediate vicinity,\" according to the statement, and only police personnel were near the area.\n\nUCLA chancellor says encampment became 'focal point for violence'\n\nBlock explained his decision to put an end to the encampment in a letter to the campus community, saying the site had become \"a focal point for violence.\"\n\n\"Early this morning, we made the decision to direct UCPD and outside law enforcement officers to enter and clear the encampment,\" his statement reads. \"Officers followed a plan that had been carefully developed to protect the safety of protesters at the site. Those who remained encamped last night were given several warnings and were offered the opportunity to leave peacefully.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, about 300 protesters left the site voluntarily, while more than 200 resisted and were arrested.\n\n\"I also want to recognize the significance of the issues behind the demonstrators’ advocacy,\" Block said. \"The loss of life in Gaza has been truly devastating, and my administration has and will continue to connect with student and faculty leaders.\"\n\nMany 'outsiders' among those who occupied Columbia building\n\nOf the 112 people arrested Tuesday night at Columbia, 32 were not students, according to city figures released Thursday evening.\n\nCiting NYPD data, university spokesperson Ben Chang said 13 of the 44 people arrested inside the occupied Hamilton Hall weren’t affiliated with Columbia, though the definition of who is unaffiliated remains unclear. The remaining 31 people had connections to the university. Among the arrested: 14 Columbia undergraduates; six students at affiliated institutions such as Barnard College and the Union Theological Seminary; nine graduate students; and two Columbia employees.\n\n\"A significant portion of those who broke the law by occupying Hamilton Hall were outsiders,\" Chang said.\n\nColumbia’s campus remains closed to the public, including outside press, though student journalists have remained inside. Hamilton Hall is an active crime scene being investigated by police, a campus update Thursday afternoon said.\n\n“To give you a picture of campus today,” Chang said, “Hamilton Hall and the encampments have been cleared and materials removed. Campus has been calm and, on campus, there were no rallies or demonstrations.”\n\nUniversity of Minnesota, protesters reach deal\n\nPro-Palestinian supporters agreed to remove their four-day encampment at the University of Minnesota following an agreement made with school leadership. Interim University President Jeff Ettinger agreed to \"facilitate conversations\" with the career services department in response to the coalition's demand to ban companies that do business with Israel from attending campus events and partaking in job fairs.\n\nEttinger will also recommend the University of Minnesota Police Department not arrest or press charges against anyone on a criminal offense as a result of the demonstrations and allow the organizing coalition to address the Board of Regents on May 10 concerning its demand that the university divest from Israel.\n\nNorthwestern University and Brown University are among other schools that have resolved the protests through negotiations. The Minnesota deal \"grew out of a desire among those involved to reach shared understanding,' Ettinger said in a letter to the university community. \"While we do not condone tactics that are outside of our policies, we appreciate student leaders' willingness to engage in dialogue.\"\n\n− Sam Woodward, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBiden says speech is protected but not 'chaos'\n\nPresident Joe Biden condemned violence and destruction on college campuses while defending the right for pro-Palestinian protesters to peacefully demonstrate in his first public address on this week's unrest on college campuses. Biden, in previously unscheduled remarks Thursday from the White House Roosevelt Room, called peaceful protest \"in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues,\" but he said \"violent protest is not protected.\"\n\n\"Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduations, none of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"There’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.\"\n\nBiden said he does not believe governors should call out the National Guard to quell the protests and that the demonstrations have not compelled him to reconsider his Middle East policies.\n\n− Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nPulitzer Prize Board lauds student journalists covering protests\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize Board recognized student journalists across the country who are covering protests in the midst of \"great personal and academic risk,\" according to a statement released Thursday by the organization that awards journalism's highest honor.\n\n“We would also like to acknowledge the extraordinary real-time reporting of student journalists at Columbia University, where the Pulitzer Prizes are housed, as the New York Police Department was called onto campus on Tuesday night,” the board's statement said. “In the spirit of press freedom, these students worked to document a major national news event under difficult and dangerous circumstances and at risk of arrest.”\n\nFinalists and winners for the Pulitzer Prizes are set to be announced Monday at Columbia. The campus remained closed to outside press Thursday. Access has been heavily restricted, with the campus only open to students living on campus and essential personnel. This doesn’t include most faculty.\n\nPolice watch over demonstration at University of Pennsylvania\n\nA \"large demonstration\" took place on College Green at the University of Pennsylvania, the school's public safety office said in a campus alert, urging people to avoid the area and saying police were at the scene.\n\nStudents from the Gaza Solidarity Encampment climbed a campus statue of Benjamin Franklin, draped him with the Palestinian flag, and sang songs advocating for a free Palestine.\n\nCounter-protestors in support of the Jewish community also rallied, carrying Israeli flags and standing at the entrance of the encampment that was set up about a week ago.\n\nThe encampment consists of around 20 tents, a table with food and water, a small bookshelf, a craft table with art supplies for everyone to use, and a medical tent. Campus security watched from several spots surrounding the Ben Franklin statue, which had been power washed earlier the day to remove graffiti. Student protesters could be seen banging water bottles, playing tambourines and singing over loudspeakers.\n\nThe metal barricades surrounding the encampment were expanded Thursday, with the addition of a pen to separate the two groups of protesters. By late afternoon, a truck pulled up to the College Green and unloaded more fence pieces, signaling preparation for a continued occupation.\n\n− Annemarie Dooling\n\nAll quiet at Columbia University\n\nMore than a dozen law enforcement officers and security personnel remained posted Thursday along the metal barricades at and around the Columbia University gate where pro-Palestinian protesters were taken into custody Tuesday night.\n\nOutside Hamilton Hall, which was occupied by protesters early Tuesday, some people waited in line at a checkpoint to enter campus. The encampment that made Columbia the epicenter of campus protests across the nation lasted nearly two weeks before being taken down by police Tuesday.\n\nThe semester's remaining classes and final exams will be conducted online, the school's provost said Wednesday. Graduation is set for May 15, and university President Minouche Shafik has requested police maintain a presence on campus through at least May 17.\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nProfessors association lends support to protesters\n\nMembers of the Columbia University chapter of the American Association of University Professors \"unequivocally condemn\" the school administration's decision this week to summon the NYPD to remove student protesters from campus, the group said in a social media post Thursday. The group demanded the campus be immediately reopened to faculty, staff and students and that the NYPD be withdrawn.\n\nThe national chapter issued a statement in defense of the protests nationwide: \"The AAUP and its chapters defend the right to free speech and peaceful protest on university campuses, condemn the militarized response by institutional leaders to these activities and vehemently oppose the politically motivated assault on higher education.\"\n\nAlums, political landscape raised pressure on Columbia president\n\nA few days ago, Shafik indicated she had no intention of bringing police back to respond to pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia. Doing so would be \"counterproductive, further inflaming what is happening on campus, and drawing thousands to our doorstep who would threaten our community,” she wrote in a message signed by other school leaders.\n\nBut many alumni were clearly alarmed by what they were seeing, and so was New York City Mayor Eric Adams. By Tuesday night, the president had changed her mind. New York Police Department officers descended on campus en masse and for the second time arrested scores of protesters.\n\nShafik had to assess the political landscape, said Lincoln Mitchell, an adjunct associate professor of political science at Columbia. \"If you get an alumni base angry, you’re done,\" he said.\n\n− Zachary Schermele\n\nAlumni pressure, crime-fighting mayor:Both helped set the stage for Columbia arrests\n\nPolice clear protesters from occupied library at Portland State\n\nPortland State University's campus in Oregon was closed Thursday because of an \"ongoing incident at library,\" the school said in a social media post, and at 10:17 a.m. the Portland Police Bureau announced it had cleared protesters who had occupied the facility since Monday.\n\n\"We have found caches of tools, what appears to be improvised weapons, ball bearings, paint balloons, spray bottles of ink, and DIY armor,'' the PPB said on the X platform. \"None of this was used on police.'' The bureau said in another posting that 12 people were arrested, four of them Portland State students.\n\nEarlier this week the school asked police to help remove dozens of protesters occupying the building. Last week the university paused seeking or accepting gifts or grants from Boeing pending a review of weapons sales to Israel.\n\nColumbia faculty, students protest:Campus protests intensify\n\nAlmost half of NYC protesters arrested not affiliated with schools, reports say\n\nAdams said in an interview Thursday with NPR that more than 40% of the 282 arrested Tuesday at Columbia and City College of New York protests were not affiliated with either school. An NYPD official told CNN the department was able to determine the breakdowns by cross-checking records with the schools.\n\nShayoni Mitra, a theater professor at Columbia-affiliated Barnard College who has been logging arrests and injuries, said all those arrested at Columbia had been released by 5 p.m. ET Thursday. The vast majority if not all were charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing, she said. Those arrested at CCNY had also been released, protest organizer Nick Rodrigo said.\n\nBody-cam footage released by the NYPD on Thursday shows police removing barricades of tied-up tables and chairs at Columbia's occupied Hamilton Hall, then breaking locks and chains to enter. At one point an officer says, \"Let's deploy a flash bang,” followed by several booms. Officers then enter the area behind a protesters' barricade and find most of them sitting on the floor against a wall, their arms linked as a chant of \"Free, free Palestine'' can be heard. The video ends as police begin pulling protesters apart.\n\n− Contributing: Eduardo Cuevas\n\nProtesters at NYU undeterred by arrests\n\nThough law enforcement has removed demonstrators camping out at some universities across the city, encampments at schools including New York University persisted Thursday. Initially, the group established an encampment at a plaza near the business school, but after police arrested more than 100 people, the group relocated to a space next to the John A. Paulson Center, according to Ryna Workman, a third-year law student at NYU.\n\nWorkman said that as Black student having NYPD on campus and seeing her classmates and professors get arrested has been “jarring” and “a little traumatizing.” Still, she stressed students are not afraid of violence or further arrest and plan to continue to escalate.“It’s a scary thing, but at the end of the day I’m still going to be here for Palestine,” she said.\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nAt UCLA, first flash bangs, then the dismantling began\n\nHours before the move to dismantle the UCLA encampment at Dickson Plaza, officers in tactical gear began filing onto the campus as protesters chanted \"Peaceful protest\" and “We’re not leaving!” and “Who do you protect?” and \"Where were you last night?\"\n\nTwice before the main push, officers attempted to gain ground inside the encampment in the early hours Thursday, only to be fended off by protesters, some holding umbrellas and homemade wooden shields.\n\nShortly after 4 a.m., officers started firing flash bangs into the sky above the protest every few seconds, as deafening bangs echoed. Police then dismantled the main barricade piece-by-piece before moving in as a unit and systematically driving students out of the plaza, arresting those who did not comply.\n\nSome demonstrators tried to push back and shine bright lights at the officers, while others surrendered and were ushered away by police. A USA TODAY reporter witnessed one man gushing blood from a head wound who was rushed by protesters to the medic’s tent, where he was bandaged up before being helped away.\n\n“The UCLA administration has decided to take an approach of criminalizing students who are here trying to talk about what’s going on in Gaza and to talk about Palestinians’ lives,” Graeme Blair, an associate professor of political science and member of Faculty for Justice in Palestine at UCLA, told USA TODAY. “If our mission is a teaching mission, I can’t understand why they would choose to take the actions they have over the last 48 hours.”\n\nHundreds face charges across nation but will charges stick?\n\nHundreds of U.S. college students arrested this week while protesting the war in Gaza face criminal charges amid encampments, building takeovers and civil unrest. But how those charges play out remains a key question. On Tuesday night, New York police arrested nearly 300 people at Columbia University and the City College of New York. A day earlier, clashes with protesters at the University of Texas in Austin resulted in 79 arrests. Tulane University said 14 protesters were arrested at an \"illegal encampment\" on the New Orleans campus.\n\nAnd officers made at least 70 arrests late last week and over the weekend at Arizona State University. But scores of cases at other universities have already been dropped.\n\nRichard Serafini, a South Florida criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, explained that with hundreds of arrests at a mass protest, prosecutors still “have to be able to have the evidence” against each individual.\n\n“You can’t charge someone who just happened to be there,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Asher Stockler\n\nWhat are college protests across the US about?\n\nThe student protesters opposed to Israel's military attacks in Gaza say they want their schools to stop funneling endowment money to Israeli companies and other businesses, like weapons manufacturers, that profit from the war in Gaza. In addition to divestment, protesters are calling for a cease-fire, and student governments at some colleges have also passed resolutions in recent weeks calling for an end to academic partnerships with Israel. The protesters also want the U.S. to stop supplying funding and weapons to the war effort.\n\nMore recently, amnesty for students and professors involved in the protests has become an issue. Protesters want protections amid threats of disciplinary action and termination for those participating in demonstrations that may violate campus policy or local laws.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nCampus protests across the US:Hundreds were arrested.

Sarah Palin led a pack of almost 50 candidates in the primary for the special election earlier this summer.\n\n— Dylan Wells\n\nAlaska Senate race is a McConnell v. Trump proxy battle\n\nThe Republican primary for Alaska Senate is as much about former President Donald Trump’s rivalry with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as it is about the two candidates on the ballot.\n\nFor months Trump has been heckling McConnell, calling the GOP leader an “Old Crow” who got “played like a fiddle” after Senate Democrats successfully pushed through their health care, tax and climate package.\n\nThe former president is also holding a grudge against incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a McConnell ally who was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict him during his impeachment trial. As a result she is facing Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka, who has also pledged she won’t support McConnell to hold the majority leader position should the GOP regain the Senate this fall.\n\nThe Alaska primary mirrors the Wyoming GOP contest, where Rep. Liz Cheney, another Trump antagonist, was defeated on Tuesday.\n\nBut unlike Cheney, who was kicked out of House Republican leadership, Murkowski has retained the support of Senate GOP chiefs and its political establishment.\n\nIn April, for instance, McConnell’s super PAC — the Senate Leadership Fund — dropped $7 million in ad buys for Murkowski.\n\n— Phillip M.

Rand Paul of Kentucky, said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nOne of Cheney’s soon-to-be former colleagues, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, kept things short: “Girl, BYE!”\n\nSen. John Barrasso, of Wyoming, tried a more diplomatic approach, saying Cheney’s opponent, Harriet Hageman, will join the state’s federal delegation to make up a “strong, conservative, and effective team for the people of Wyoming.”\n\nThe Trump critics didn’t remain silent, however.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele quoted Cheney’s concession speech where she pledged to do everything to keep Trump from returning to the White House.\n\n“With every fiber of my being,” Steele said in a tweet Tuesday. “Sign me up for that mission!

Hageman campaigned for Cheney during previous congressional runs, calling her a “friend” and “constitutional conservative” who could fight for Wyoming.\n\nIn this cycle, it was Cheney’s commitment to the constitution that the congresswoman said would cost her a seat.

Liz Cheney, the highest profile Trump GOP target this primary season, has lost her primary to Trump-endorsed challenger Harriet Hageman, CNN and NBC projected.\n\nTrump singled out Cheney after she voted to impeach him over the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021. Trump and Hageman also criticized Cheney for working on the Jan. 6 congressional committee investigating the attack.\n\nCheney promoted her disdain of Trump throughout the campaign, saying Republican Party members in Wyoming and across the country need to move on from volatile and oft-investigated ex-president.\n\nHageman, an attorney and one-time supporter of Cheney, said during the campaign that the House member first elected in 2016 was more interested in pursuing Trump than in serving the needs of Wyoming voters.\n\n–- David Jackson\n\nHageman takes huge lead; Cheney backers brace; no call yet\n\nAs expected, Harriet Hageman has taken a huge lead over Liz Cheney in the Wyoming race, though the Associated Press and the networks have not yet projected a winner.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCheney plans speech on democracy, win or lose\n\nHundreds of supporters have gathered in Jackson for what many expect to be a concession speech - a unique one.\n\nCheney is expected to deliver an address about the threat to the country posed by former President Donald Trump.\n\nSignaling her approach in remarks with reporters earlier today, Cheney said democracy itself is at stake.\n\n“Those of us across the board – Republicans, Democrats and independents – who believe deeply in freedom and who care about the Constitution and the future of the country, I think, have an obligation to put that above party,\" Cheney said after casting her vote in Jackson\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow it happened:How Liz Cheney went from Trump backer and GOP leader, to his fiercest critic and GOP outcast\n\nHow have House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump fared?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's vow to seek revenge on the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for alleged incitement of the Jan. 6 Capitol attack is being tested in key primary elections this season.\n\nThe second House impeachment vote against Trump was the most bipartisan ever when those 10 Republicans defected from their party and joined with 222 other House Democrats to impeach him.\n\nTrump has dedicated much of his post-presidency to purging the GOP of anyone he sees as disloyal.\n\nFour of those 10 Republicans are retiring from Congress, while the other six faced re-election bids, including primaries in which Trump often loomed larger than their actual opponent.\n\nTonight, one of those Republicans, Wyoming Rep.

Endorsed by Trump, Palin finished first among 48 candidates to qualify for a special election. They were seeking to replace Young, who died in March at age 88, after 49 years as Alaska’s lone House member.\n\nPalin is now trying to secure the win against the No. 2 and 4 finishers, Republican Nick Begich and Democrat Mary Peltola.

It's also showing the deep fissures in the Republican Party.\n\nTwo candidates on the ballot for two different offices – Sen. Lisa Murkowski and former Gov. Sarah Palin – represent a growing divide in the GOP that is largely decided by a candidate's allegiance to former President Donald Trump. Murkowski is fighting off a Trump challenger. Palin is fighting as a Trump challenger.\n\nMurkowski is a moderate Republican who has crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats on some big issues. In February 2021, she was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote in favor of convicting Trump during his second impeachment, drawing ire from the former president and others in her party. She is the only one of the seven on the ballot this year.\n\nPalin, once John McCain's running mate in 2008, leans to the far right. She has been in lock step with Trump and joined him and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell last month at a \"Save America\" rally in Anchorage. After the FBI search last week of the former president's Florida residence, she called the country's top law enforcement agencies \"dangerous thugs.\"\n\nWho else is in Jackson Hole? Liz Cheney nemesis Kevin McCarthy\n\nLiz Cheney isn't the only prominent member of Congress in Jackson Hole on this primary Tuesday.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who turned on Cheney during her battle with Donald Trump, is reportedly hosting a two-day fundraiser in Teton Village, Wyo. That's about 10 miles from Jackson, where Cheney is expected to address supporters about her primary battle with Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman.\n\n10 Republicans voted to impeach Trump:Will any be left in Congress after November?\n\nNBC News reported that McCarthy would be in Wyoming on Monday and Tuesday \"raising money for both the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund.\"\n\nOther Republican lawmakers who now oppose Cheney are also at the resort where McCarthy is holding court, according to news reports. (So is Elon Musk, reportedly.)\n\nMcCarthy, who is hoping to become speaker of the House after the midterm election, initially supported Cheney after she voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6. He later changed his mind and backed Cheney's expulsion from House GOP leadership over the Trump issue.\n\nCheney said McCarthy sold out to Trump and is part of the problem Republicans face moving forward.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAnother break between Cheney and GOP: criticism of FBI\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called out fellow Republicans on Thursday for their criticism of the FBI in the hours and days after its agents searched the Florida home of former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I have been ashamed to hear members of my party attacking the integrity of the FBI agents involved with the recent Mar-a-Lago search. These are sickening comments that put the lives of patriotic public servants at risk,\" Cheney tweeted on Thursday, shortly after Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke at the Justice Department about the search.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday denounced the threats circulating online against federal agents and the Justice Department, calling them \"deplorable and dangerous.\"\n\nRead the whole story:GOP Rep.

The challenges we are facing require serious leaders who will abide by their oath and uphold the Constitution- no matter what.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMoney likely won't help Cheney win Wyoming primary\n\nMany elections are won by the best-funded candidate, but the money hasn't shown signs of helping Cheney.\n\nThrough June 30, Cheney raised $11.3 million, and Hageman raised $3.7 million. That’s $15 million in a state with about 280,000 registered voters. And yet, a July 15 poll from the Casper Star Tribune showed Cheney 22 points behind Hageman and an Aug. 11 University of Wyoming survey found that just over one quarter of GOP primary voters support incumbent candidate Cheney.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Cheney received 76% of her donations from large donors, and 73% were from out of state residents and political actions committees, or PACs, which are often formed to raise money for a candidate or group of candidates.\n\nHageman is getting 40% of her donations from Cowboy State residents and PACs. Hageman also has more pull with small donors, who make up 43% of her donations, a signal of grassroots support.\n\n– Erin Mansfield, Ella Lee\n\nMore campaign finance news:Trump PAC formed to push debunked voter fraud claims paid $60K to Melania Trump's fashion designer\n\nWho is Harriet Hageman, Cheney's Trump-backed opponent?\n\nWyoming lawyer Harriet Hageman is the leading Republican challenger for Cheney’s congressional seat. She unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wyoming in 2018.\n\nA former supporter of Cheney, having donated to her 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns, Hageman unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wyoming in 2018 and sat on the Wyoming state Republican committee until announcing her challenge to Cheney.\n\nThe main difference between the two candidates is their relationship with Trump. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to vote for Trump’s impeachment over his alleged incitement of a riot, and she lost her spot as head of the House GOP conference after refusing to endorse the former president’s false claims of election fraud. Hageman, on the other hand, has Trump's endorsement and is vocal in her support of him.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWhere are they now:10 House Republicans voted to impeach Trump.

CLOUD — On a Monday night in July, controversy over refugees once again flared up just off Division Street near downtown St. Cloud.\n\nInside the chambers of City Hall, residents had organized a protest following a recent New York Times article outlining the backlash toward Somali refugees. Against a backdrop of signs proclaiming “Hate has no home here\" and “We are greater than fear,” several residents called on two conservative City Council members to resign.\n\nBut as Ayan Omar, 31, stood before the City Council to address local leaders, she extended an invitation for conversation.\n\n\"I call on the two individuals not so much to resign, but more so to talk to me, not to talk at me,\" she said. “You’d be surprised — if you get to know me and individuals who look like me, talk like me and pray like me — how much we have in common.”\n\nIt was Ayan’s first City Council meeting. But the local high school teacher has long shared her story as a Somali refugee and Muslim American living in Central Minnesota.\n\nShe’s hosted diversity training sessions and seminars at churches, schools and organizations across St. Cloud since 2006, discussing race, religion and discrimination among predominantly white audiences.\n\nRecently, she's taken a more active political role, stepping into a contentious public debate about how the city should respond to its growing refugee population — an issue that hasn't gone away even as the number of new refugees arriving in Central Minnesota has drastically declined.\n\nIn St. Cloud, that debate has often played out in local politics.\n\nTwo years ago, the city received national attention for a proposal by former council member Jeff Johnson to temporarily halt new refugees arriving in St. Cloud until city officials could study the economic impact of the resettlement program.\n\nThe effort overwhelmingly failed in the face of vocal opposition. The mayor called the proposal unconstitutional and all six other council members voted against the moratorium, passing a welcoming resolution instead.\n\nHowever, the episode laid bare deep divides around immigration, refugees and race that have taken root not only in St. Cloud but across the country under the Trump administration.\n\nA local group of conservative residents has since formed C-Cubed, which supported two nativist candidates running for City Council in 2018 and bringing back the refugee moratorium. Both candidates were unsuccessful, but they garnered thousands of votes in the city elections.\n\nThe two conservative council members who did win 2018 — Paul Brandmire and Mike Conway — also ran for office raising concerns about the resettlement program and touting the moratorium’s benefits, although both say they are not affiliated with C-Cubed.\n\nBrandmire has continued to question the resettlement program, including in comments to the New York Times, drawing rebuke from pro-refugee activists who claim he's not helping to push back against more radical anti-Muslim and xenophobic views. Conway was not quoted in the New York Times article but has faced similar criticism.\n\nMayor David Kleis has also been faulted, with some residents saying the longtime city leader has not done enough to speak out against hate and continues to look past the problem.\n\nAyan, on the other hand, says she'll continue showing up to city meetings and addressing the council. This summer she started talking with Brandmire and Conway. She’s even considering a run for City Council next year.\n\n“I’m going to hold them accountable,\" Ayan said in an interview with the St. Cloud Times. \"Because as long as they are in that position, they serve me, people who look like me and all of St. Cloud.”\n\n'There is a difference in culture'\n\nTwo weeks after Ayan spoke, Paul Brandmire read a statement at a City Council meeting aimed at clarifying his views.\n\n“I saw the dangerous and ineffective way that the community was responding to the influx of the East African immigrants. My heart went out to them,” said Brandmire at the meeting. “But I also clearly saw what was the concern by the established residents. In other words: I saw and understand both sides.”\n\nKayla Shelley was one of several activists who called on Brandmire to resign after the New York Times article, saying his comments added legitimacy to xenophobic and \"racist claims\" championed by far-right groups like C-Cubed.\n\n\"Whether or not he’s a part of it [C-Cubed] or doesn’t matter, because he’s choosing to uplift the same narrative that C-Cubed is and has been,” said Shelley, a senior at St. Cloud State University.\n\nBrandmire, a conservative on the nonpartisan City Council, told the Times he still supports a pause on new refugees coming in and continues to have questions about the resettlement program’s impact on taxpayers.\n\n“I think the whole program was mismanaged,” he said. “We got too much, too fast. And we weren’t ready for it. We need to absorb what’s already here. Fix the infrastructure, which City Council can help do. Then if we decide we want more, then whatever. ”\n\nBrandmire said he doesn’t think the federal government and resettlement agencies like Lutheran Social Services adequately consulted the community about resettling people in St. Cloud.\n\nIf residents were asked for their input, Brandmire said, “I would have bet dimes to donuts that 90 percent of the people in St. Cloud would have said 'My heart goes out to those people, yeah bring them in.'”\n\nBut Brandmire says the costs of the program have not been clear for St. Cloud residents, although he admitted that he hasn't looked at the costs of the program “that closely” and hasn't yet read several reports that attempted to outline costs.\n\nStearns County officials say county costs for refugees are \"minimal,\" and they have held several public forums to break down the impact on local taxpayers. St. Cloud city officials have also said refugees have not increased city spending, particularly because most funding for the program is federal.\n\nA state review of the resettlement program’s fiscal impact last year found overall costs were difficult to determine because many state programs don’t track refugee status. But a 2017 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found over a 20-year period refugees pay on average more in taxes than they receive in benefits.\n\nKing Banaian, dean of St. Cloud State's School of Public Affairs and a former Republican state representative, says the initial investment that's put into refugees, like language courses and job training programs, pays off in the long run.\n\n\"They become people who pay taxes, they buy food, they rent apartments. They do all these other things,\" Banaian said. He believes refugees and immigrants can help fill St. Cloud's workforce shortage by taking over jobs left by the state's aging population, a view reflected by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development.\n\nHowever, some concerns have gone beyond economics. Brandmire repeatedly expressed a mix of sentiments largely centered on residents' dislike of perceived cultural changes stemming from the growing Somali community.\n\n“There is a difference in culture. And if I wanted to live in Somalia. I would have moved to Somalia. But now you go downtown here and there is a certain feel just looking around,” he said. “It feels different than it did 10 years ago. And people resent that.”\n\nThe number of primary refugees was probably manageable, but the migration of secondary Somali refugees — people who are initially settled somewhere else and legally moved to St. Cloud — “disrupted” longtime residents' “normal” way of life, Brandmire said.\n\nPart 1:Refugees search for safety, some don't find it\n\n“Let’s call it the way it is: They’re from a different culture. They’re from a different religion. They do stand out. You walk in, you can tell a Somali from the Europeans. Just walking in and looking. There is a fundamental difference in how they look, how they act, how they think. It’s different,\" he said.\n\n“Their culture is different. Their education system is different. Everything’s different. That’s not good, that’s not bad. It just is,\" Brandmire added.\n\nThough he acknowledges there’s no way to stop secondary migration, Bradmire says he doesn’t see the Somali community “assimilating” to American culture — a common refrain among many conservatives in St. Cloud.\n\n\"When I see a Somali car, I have never seen one that says ‘I heart America.’ I have never seen one with a U.S. flag on it. I have never seen a U.S. flag outside a Somali’s house,\" he said.\n\n“Personal culture is fine, and they have every right to do it, don’t get me wrong. If that’s what they want to do. We see Norwegian flags and German flags and whatever,\" Brandmire said. \"But if they want to be American, then they need to start being American.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump repeated those views at his most recent stop in Minneapolis earlier this month, promising to give local communities a \"greater say\" in refugee policy and bolster vetting. \"For many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers,\" he said.\n\nTensions in a conservative stronghold\n\nBrandmire’s views reflect broader concerns raised by conservatives in Central Minnesota, a deeply red area that heavily supported Trump.\n\nWhile pushback to Somali refugees in St. Cloud started years before Trump was elected, the president's rhetoric on immigrants and refugees has resonated with many of his supporters. Trump won the Sixth Congressional District, a longtime Republican stronghold that includes St. Cloud, by a margin of 25.5 points in 2016.\n\nIn office, Trump has gone forward with a travel ban from mainly Muslim-majority countries, including Somalia, and slashed refugee admissions into the country. On the campaign trail, he's singled out Minnesota's large Somali population.\n\nAt a rally in Minneapolis earlier this month, Trump promised to give local communities a \"greater say\" in refugee policy. \"For many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers,\" he said. The comment drew boos from the crowd.\n\nHe echoed those views During a 2016 campaign stop, highlighting the mall stabbing attack in St. Cloud. “Here in Minnesota, you’ve seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with very large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval,\" he said.\n\nThose views have taken hold in Central Minnesota, where conservative activists repeatedly pushed elected officials, including Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., to curtail the refugee resettlement program.\n\nPart 2:Growing optimism with every conversation\n\nOn a Tuesday night in mid-July, around 30 Republican lawmakers, local party activists and conservative community members gathered at the Red Carpet in downtown St. Cloud for an informal meeting hosted by local conservative radio personality Dan Ochsner.\n\nPassing around a microphone, many residents said they are being ridiculed and chastised for sharing their views on refugees, saying “the other side” has unfairly branded them \"Islamophobes\" and \"racists,\" and silenced those who dare question the resettlement program's costs.\n\nOthers echoed concerns about cultural changes. One man complained the local public school has not had pork on its menu in 10 years. Another said he’s heard of polygamy among Somali residents in rental properties.\n\nAt several points, attendees jokingly accused others of being “cowards” — mocking a St. Cloud Times editorial that criticized some residents for not speaking up against hate.\n\nMike Conway, one of the City Council members who's been criticized by pro-refugee activists, told the group that the community needs to have what he called “the family discussion\" — a tough but honest conversation where people can freely ask questions to one another.\n\n“But after we get out all the yelling and the screaming and the stopping and whatever, we find a way to move forward,\" he said.\n\nConway told the Times it’s time for people to move on to bigger issues. \"How do we work out the differences that we have,” he said. “What changes do we need to make and what changes do we expect the immigrants need to make?”\n\nSome people still might not be satisfied even if they were told the complete fiscal impact of refugees, Conway said. “There are going to be people — and some of them I call friends and constituents — that are just never going to get past that,” he said.\n\nMalik Stewart, a local DFL volunteer who attended the event, doesn’t believe those opposed to the refugee program care only about its costs.\n\n”Those questions have already been answered,” he said. “They didn’t like what they’ve heard and choose not to believe it.” Instead, he sees their concerns as \"explicitly, categorically a white nationalist argument,” which he said “appeals to more people than we would like to admit.”\n\nRon Branstner, a speaker who says Muslim refugees are detrimental to America, also attended the event, speaking out against the resettlement program.\n\nPart 3:Are efforts to counter anti-refugee hate working?\n\nIn an interview with the Times, Branstner — who splits his time between Eden Valley and California but often publicly participates in the St. Cloud conversation — echoed claims the refugee program was not administered correctly.\n\nHe also warned Muslims were imposing “creeping sharia” in the United States and claimed they would turn violent, if necessary, to convert others to Islam. “Either you accept the Constitution and the laws that are here, and don't propagate Allah. But the problem is that they can’t,” he said. “They have to renounce Islam if they accept the Constitution.”\n\nBranstner says one of his biggest influences is Bill Warner — the pen name of former Tennessee State University professor Bill French, who was cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center as part of a 10-person core anti-Muslim circle.\n\nLeadership questioned\n\nMayor Kleis has taken a more welcoming approach to the city’s refugee community.\n\nKleis, a former Republican state legislator turned independent, has served as St. Cloud's mayor since 2005. He's a familiar face at gatherings across the city, whether that’s a community iftar at the mosque or the bimonthly Dine and Dialogue event.\n\nThe efforts have earned the longtime mayor praise from some St. Cloud residents, including many in the Somali community who say Kleis has proven himself an ally.\n\nHowever, Kleis has increasingly come under fire from both sides of the refugee debate.\n\nConservative residents routinely criticize Kleis, claiming he hasn't been transparent about the resettlement program's impact. Pro-refugee activists fault the mayor for not condemning groups like C-Cubed and failing to forcefully speak out against hate.\n\nNatalie Ringsmuth, founder of #UniteCloud, said Kleis needs to take a stronger stance against anti-refugee rhetoric.\n\nThough Kleis is \"not as soft as he used to be,\" Ringsmuth said, “fully denouncing someone who has made themself a white supremacist is the only way forward here. And saying 'I don’t like some of the things they do' is too soft.\"\n\nKleis says his welcoming message has stayed consistent.\n\nIn a video responding to the New York Times article, Kleis said, “It saddens me so much when I see in an article hate. When I read on social media hate or emails. I denounce that with every fiber in my being.”\n\nHowever, Kleis told the Times he would not denounce C-Cubed, saying he would only denounce specific actions. “People are individuals, and I can’t speak for individuals. And I can’t speak for what’s in their heart and what their motive is,” he said. “If you are asking me to hate anyone I represent, I can’t do it. You’ve got the wrong person.\"\n\nConway, who also refused to condemn C-Cubed, said he may not like what the group is saying, but they have a right to say it. “The problem with using the word 'denounce' means, in my mind, is that they have done something wrong that I must condemn,\" he said. \"I’m not going to denounce a group for having their opinions and what they believe.”\n\nBrandmire at times took a similar stance but clarified he doesn’t support the group’s “anti-Muslim” views and overall tactics.\n\n“If C-Cubed did something physical or public, where they actually did something instead of just meeting in a booth somewhere, I’m not going to denounce that you have every right to meet,” he said. “I will denounce their philosophy. And that’s the reason I don’t join them. I don’t know what they're doing in the community is beneficial. I don’t think it’s right.”\n\nOther City Council members say they’ve made their stance clear when it comes to hate, pointing to a welcoming resolution overwhelming passed two years ago in response to the proposed refugee moratorium.\n\n“I think that feels like it represents the majority of the council,” said Jeff Goerger, the council's current president. “I think our responses have been adequate.”\n\nBut Ringsmuth says city leaders need to do more, pointing to mayors and city council members in other parts of the state, such as Willmar and Rochester, who have taken a more outspoken role advocating for diversity.\n\n“We don’t have a clear enough vision from the top,” she said. “It has to change from the bottom up because individuals have to change, but that’s going to take decades if we don’t have people at the top also circling that idea.”\n\n'We never give up on hope'\n\nToward the end of her speech at City Hall, Ayan Omar called upon council members to be \"part of the solution.\"\n\nShe believes her part in creating a more welcoming community starts with sharing her story — talking about her two young girls, her work as a high school teacher, her life as a \"young Somali Muslim American refugee.\"\n\nShe sees signs of progress, like more people willing to have conversations and, crucially, ask questions. But she also worries that the 2020 presidential election will heighten tensions.\n\n“It’s easy to sell the rhetoric of fear. The rhetoric of hate,\" she said. “I understand the fear. I'm sympathetic with the fear. But I’m also angry that that’s what we’re settling for in this community.\"\n\nHope & Fear in Minnesota's Heartland:Get involved, learn more\n\nAyan has been doing this work, sharing her story, since she first came to the city — and after more than a decade, she wonders how much longer it will take.\n\n\"How long? How much longer do I have to keep doing things like this. How much longer do I have to keep trying to convince people of my humanity. Will my daughters have to do it?” she said. \"How much longer? I don’t know.”\n\nBut whenever she has doubts or gets frustrated, she comes back to a familiar story: Her own.\n\n“Hope has always been the center of immigrant and refugee narratives,\" she said. \"We never give up on hope.”\n\nHow we did this project\n\nUSA Today Network reporter Austen Macalus spent two months reporting this story with the help of St. Cloud times photographers Dave Schwarz and Zach Dwyer.\n\nMacalus relied on data from the U.S. Census' American Community Survey, the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Demographic Center. His reporting was also aided by previous coverage by St. Cloud Times journalists.\n\nMacalus interviewed more than four dozen people, including: Somali residents, pro-refugee advocates and anti-refugee proponents; city leaders, state officials and local elected officials; researchers from the state Demographic Center and St. Cloud State University, and national experts on Islamaphobia; faith leaders, community activists and political organizers; people who’ve lived in St. Cloud most of their lives and those who recently arrived.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/12/weeding-robots-goat-lottery-liquor-shortage-news-around-states/117484386/", "title": "Weeding robots, goat lottery: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state agency said Friday that it will work with private organizations to encourage more elderly and disabled people to get vaccines for COVID-19, which is on the rise as the state’s inoculation rate trails the nation. With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/20/pigeon-hats-cushion-cash-chaka-khan-news-around-states/41032359/", "title": "More pigeon hats, cushion cash: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation’s first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War’s aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery’s role in fueling a civil rights movement. It’ll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state’s funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university’s most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. “Several horses died due to bullet wounds,” but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses “had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time.” Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state’s aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year’s springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don’t have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn’t know about all the money state departments take in that isn’t reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. “I’d like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion,” Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school’s Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot “highly offensive.” Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. “Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware,” says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year’s protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn’t there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. “Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don’t go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a “guarantor” for the state’s election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state’s outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can’t be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. “Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy,” Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation’s sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department’s director says the state is at a “critical juncture,” the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho’s expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city’s grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council’s certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana’s first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn’t meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church’s Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn’t have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. “We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured,” Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. “The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the “Queen of Funk” on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. “I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That’s pretty cool,” said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single “I Feel For You.” Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the “fiscally responsible thing to do,” Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. “Criminal-justice reform isn’t just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it’s the moral thing to do,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget” after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state’s attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn’t compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. “Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that,” Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride.” The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building’s exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads “Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse.” The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. “Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore,” his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. “His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. “I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do,” said Kirby, 54. “This is going to help them. I’m so happy for them.” The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won’t be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It’s Minnesota’s first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state’s major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state’s U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what’s the only state test not required by federal law. “It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment,” Mississippi Professional Educators, the state’s largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor’s lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s federal lawsuit accusing “entrenched interests” of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department’s “long history of racial discrimination.” She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is “a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve.” She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents’ basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL’s Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university’s students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it’s the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it’s quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. “Reno cares about our animals,” Newby says. “They need protection and don’t need to become a punchline.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims’ names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents’ plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They’re aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as “Obamacare.” New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the “Yellowstone of the Southwest” has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city’s so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four “immigration subpoenas” for information about inmates wanted for deportation. “This is not a request – it’s a demand,” Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. “This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York.” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. “New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America,” spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency’s mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation “detainers” or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the “Freedom Riders” who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That’s making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. “Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife,” said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. “We’ve been working on trying to address these impacts.” For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department’s conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf’s administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections’ officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state’s annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it’s important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman’s Mall have been cut down. They’ll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall’s, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult’s latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn’t know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult’s 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee’s office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn’t like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city’s three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain’s 500th anniversary of the “Voyage to the New World” celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state’s registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March’s Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don’t request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it’s too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state’s nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor’s Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday’s rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia’s solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified “credible evidence” that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a “violent insurrection.” Online, threats of violence have been “rampant” among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. “We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site,” the tribe’s Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. “Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it’s just unbelievable.” The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as “Medical Seat Belt Safety Days,” the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer’s Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It’s still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. “Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable,” Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/02/politics/mccarthy-house-speaker-fight-gop/index.html", "title": "GOP tension builds over House speaker race as McCarthy and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and his critics are gearing up for a potential floor fight over the speakership in January, raising the possibility of a messy intraparty showdown that could bring uncertainty and chaos just as Republicans prepare to enter their new majority.\n\nMcCarthy still insists he will have the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership. Conservative hardliners seeking to plot McCarthy’s ouster say otherwise.\n\nAnd what will happen if he can’t get 218 votes? No one knows.\n\n“You can’t beat somebody with nobody, and there’s nobody else running,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican who supports McCarthy for speaker. “Even if there was another announced candidate, that person would not be better positioned to get 218 than Kevin.”\n\nMcCarthy’s foes say another candidate will emerge and that talks have already begun to recruit a replacement. Some of Kevin McCarthy’s detractors have asked whether Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Tom Emmer of Minnesota would be willing to jump into the race, according to GOP sources familiar with the informal conversations. But all three men have made clear they’re backing McCarthy for speaker and wouldn’t challenge him for the job.\n\nIt’s still not known what would happen on Jan. 3 if McCarthy cannot get 218 votes to be elected speaker. But there’s an expectation that any number of Republicans could throw their hat into the ring if McCarthy stumbles or drops out.\n\n“There’s quality candidates who represent the conservative center of the Republican conference who are privately acknowledging that once it becomes clear it’s not going to Kevin McCarthy, they are interested in becoming speaker,” said Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who’s one of the handful of conservative hardliners publicly saying they are “hard no” votes against McCarthy. “And there are members who would excite the base, who would excite Republicans across the country, unite Republicans across the country as candidates, but they’re not going to raise their hand publicly until it’s clear to them that it’s not Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nIf McCarthy loses more than four GOP votes on January 3, he is expected to fall under the 218 votes he would need to claim the speakership. Then the House would keep voting until someone wins a majority of support from the members in attendance who are choosing a specific candidate and not voting “present.” If that happens, McCarthy insists he still won’t drop out.\n\n“Oh yeah, I’ll take the speaker’s fight to the floor,” McCarthy told CNN.\n\nMcCarthy also said he was willing to go through as many rounds of voting on the floor as it takes, predicting: “I’ll get there.”\n\nMeanwhile, the California Republican’s fiercest detractors are also digging in.\n\nMembers of the hardline House Freedom Caucus met with the chamber’s parliamentarian on Wednesday in order to get a briefing on the floor rules and procedures that dictate the process for the speakership vote. And some of McCarthy’s foes are reiterating their pledge to oppose him on the floor and calling on the GOP leader to drop out of the race now so they can start the search for a serious alternative.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analysis: One of Trump's biggest defenders thinks he has a chance to lead the RNC 04:02 - Source: CNN\n\n“He can avoid it now,” said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a former co-chair of the Freedom Caucus who lost to McCarthy for his conference’s nomination to be speaker, of a potential floor fight. “He doesn’t have the votes. We can move to different candidates. I’m willing to entertain anyone else.”\n\nThe commitment from both camps to take the speakership battle to January is shaping up to be a political game of chicken, with both sides signaling they’re willing to call the other’s bluff. But most Republicans are hoping it won’t come to that, worrying it would set the wrong tone as they enter into power and prepare for a tough two years of governing while working to protect their narrow majority.\n\n“I don’t want to see that happen. I can’t guarantee that not happening right now,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump ally who is backing McCarthy, said of a speaker showdown on the floor. “But the goal is to stop that from happening, to get everybody on the same page, and create unity so that we’re ready from day one.”\n\nAdded Tennessee Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, another McCarthy backer: “My hope is that we have unity and get this done on the first ballot, but we’ll see. … I’m hoping and praying for unity.”\n\nSome Republicans think the hardliners are bluffing.\n\n“Maybe they’re just trying to promote themselves a little bit?” said Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana, adding that conservative members’ views behind closed doors are more collegial than they may be publicly.\n\nAsked if he could instead vote for McCarthy’s No. 2, Scalise, for speaker, Pence said: “I’m voting for Kevin McCarthy. He’s gonna win.”\n\nTension builds in GOP Conference\n\nThe last time a vote for speaker had to go to multiple ballots was in 1923. And the longest time in history it took to elect a speaker lasted two months, with a total of 133 ballots.\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker on the floor.\n\n“Having a challenge on the floor is never going to be positive and really turn the floor over the Democrats,” McCarthy told reporters this week.\n\nBiggs, however, brushed off that possibility. And most Republicans don’t see it as a serious threat, though they privately acknowledge the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots.\n\n“I don’t buy it,” Biggs said. “Name the Democrat that a Republican would vote for.”\n\nSome moderates and mainstream Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with their colleagues’ threats to cause chaos on the floor. And some of them have a warning of their own: if the vote goes to a second ballot or more, they plan to just keep voting for McCarthy – potentially foiling the anti-McCarthy group’s plans to force him out of contention in the hopes of getting lawmakers to rally around an alternative.\n\n“Many of us are perturbed. We took a vote and McCarthy got 85%,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a district that Joe Biden carried in 2020, referring to the internal GOP election when Republicans backed McCarthy to be their nominee. “The right thing to do is coalesce around someone who has broad support. To do otherwise weakens the conference and hurts the team.”\n\nA group of mainstream House Republicans, known as the Republican Governance Group, sent a letter to their GOP colleagues on Friday urging them to unite behind McCarthy for speaker and warning that a floor fight over choosing their next leader could undermine the GOP as they enter the majority.\n\n“Such quarrels will only delay our ability to establish a working majority in the People’s House, which is critically important to successfully countering a Democrat-controlled Senate and Executive Branch,” the lawmakers wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN. “But make no mistake, we will not allow this conference to be dragged down a path to a paralyzed House that weakens our hard-fought majority.”\n\nThe letter, which is signed by 21 Republicans, also notes that while Republicans won the House, voters handed them power “skeptically” – a nod to the fact they only will have a razor-thin majority next year.\n\nRep. Dave Joyce of Ohio, who chairs the Republican Governance Group, said in a statement to CNN: “This Conference cannot handcuff itself to a burning building before we gavel in the 118th Congress. We are the dealmakers without whom this legislative body cannot govern, and we intend to provide the American people with a working majority.”\n\nSo far, at least five House Republicans have vowed to oppose McCarthy for speaker – a problem for him since he likely can only afford to lose four GOP lawmakers – though some of them have expressed openness to negotiating.\n\nMcCarthy’s foes say he has a much bigger problem.\n\n“Well, I think it’s a much larger number than people realize,” Good said of the McCarthy “no” votes. “My hope would be that more of them will start to come out publicly. So it just becomes increasingly clear that he doesn’t have the votes and we need to consider other candidates.”\n\nTheir efforts to recruit a viable alternative have been unsuccessful thus far. Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, has repeatedly said on the record he is supporting McCarthy and is looking forward to serving as majority leader next year.\n\nJordan, a McCarthy ally and co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he is not interested in the speaker’s gavel and just wants to be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and wouldn’t entertain questions about a hypothetical scenario in which McCarthy can’t get the necessary support to secure the speaker’s gavel. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has openly campaigned for Jordan to become speaker, told CNN he has asked Jordan to run “daily for two years.”\n\nAnd Emmer, who will serve as majority whip next year, said in a statement that “There is no one more deserving to lead House Republicans than Kevin McCarthy and he has my full support. Kevin has earned that right by raising hundreds of millions of dollars and helping Republicans win seats in back-to-back cycles.”\n\nTo win over holdouts, McCarthy has brokered negotiations on potential rules changes designed to empower rank-and-file members, such as enabling members to offer more amendments and giving them more notice before fast-tracked bills come to the floor.\n\nAnd McCarthy has also made public professions about what he would do as speaker, from dangling a potential impeachment inquiry over Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to threatening to investigate the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021 — both top priorities on the right.\n\n“We’ve got a long way to go,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, the current Freedom Caucus chief. But he added: “I think there is a burgeoning realization and acknowledgment that this place is broken. That’s a start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/02/03/iowa-caucus-live-results-updates-first-nation-caucuses/4602949002/", "title": "Iowa caucus results: Sanders, Buttigieg lead, but no winner named", "text": "Former mayor Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders were in the lead after the first round of Iowa Democratic caucus results were released Tuesday. But results from the state party only accounted for 62% of all precincts across the state's 99 counties, and there was no timeline for when additional results would be reported.\n\nThey were followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, with former Vice President Joe Biden in fourth place.\n\nBy late Tuesday night, 71 percent of the state's Democratic precincts had been reported, but the additional precincts did not impact Buttigieg's and Sanders' front-runner status.\n\nStung by a massive meltdown in producing the results for the Iowa Caucuses, state Democratic party officials were still unable to declare a winner Tuesday evening, nearly 24 hours after caucusgoers began gathering. Instead, 62 percent of all Iowa Democratic precincts would be reported shortly after 5 p.m. ET, state party chair Troy Price said in a press conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\nFor decades, the winner of Iowa’s caucuses has been decided by a complicated system of state delegate equivalents, which operates kind of like the Electoral College. Unlike in the November presidential vote, though, Iowa's tally of popular support was never released.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBut this year, the Iowa Democratic Party is publishing two raw vote totals and the delegate numbers from caucus night. So one candidate could win one or both of the delegate counts but lose the popular vote.\n\nThe results debacle unfolded under the glare of the national spotlight and drew sharp criticism from voters, the candidates themselves and even President Donald Trump, who handily won the Republican side of the caucuses.\n\nPrice said he could assure voters and candidates that the results were accurate and were backed up by a paper trail.\n\n\"We have worked with several security experts, nationally known security experts to test this out,\" Price said.\n\nIowa’s first-in-the-nation presidential contest had been revamped this year to try to avoid problems that arose in the 2016 caucuses, which were also plagued by late reporting and questions of whether the popular vote winner ended up winning the state delegate equivalents.Iowa Democratic Party officials said this year’s problems were not caused by outside interference. Rather, they were the result of a new reporting process involving a smart-phone app that caucus chairs were supposed to use to upload results. A coding glitch prevented many of the precinct chairs from reporting, which caused a backup telephone reporting system to be overloaded, leaving some chairs on hold for more than two hours.\n\nSanders rallies with fans in New Hampshire\n\nMILFORD, N.H. – Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night touted his performance in Iowa from the night before as the Iowa Democratic Party continued to count votes.\n\n\"I'm very proud to tell you that last night in Iowa we received more votes on the first and second round than any other candidate,” Sanders told more than 1,000 cheering supporters at a rally here.\n\nHis remarks came as the state party had released 62.7 percent of Iowa votes, showing former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg ahead with 26.9 percent of the vote and Sanders with 25.1 percent.\n\n\"For some reason in Iowa, they're having a little bit of trouble counting votes,” Sanders said. “But I am confident that here in New Hampshire, I know they’ll be able to count your votes on election night. And when you count those votes, I am going to win here in New Hampshire.\"\n\nSanders, who was set to give a public response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union in Manchester later Tuesday, said he would be returning to Washington to vote on President Donald Trump’s impeachment Wednesday.\n\n“Tomorrow the votes may not be there to impeach Trump, but I am absolutely confident that in November the votes will be there to defeat Donald Trump,” he said. “And with your help next Tuesday, we begin and continue the process of winning here in New Hampshire, going on to Nevada, going on to South Carolina, going on to California, to win those states and become the Democratic nominee.\n\nSanders, who has been polling in first in New Hampshire for weeks, concluded his approximately 30-minute speech by telling the crowd, “New Hampshire goes first in terms of primaries. You go first. The whole country will be watching. And a week from tonight, New Hampshire has the opportunity to tell not only this nation, but the entire world, that we together will stand for justice, for compassion and for children.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nCandidates tout standings as partial results trickle in\n\nShortly after the Iowa Democratic Party released initial caucus results, several candidates touted their standings in the partial results that the party released.\n\nFormer South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigeig while speaking at an event in Laconia, New Hampshire, choked up after speaking about the preliminary results.\n\n\"It validates the idea that we can expand a coalition not only unified around who it is we're against but around what it is that we're for,\" he said.\n\nLive results updates:\n\n\"It validates for a kid somewhere in a community wondering,\" he continued, \"if he belongs, or she belongs, or they belong in their own family. That if you believe in yourself and your country, there's a lot backing up that belief.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders' senior advisor Jeff Weaver praised the Vermont senator's standing with the raw vote totals, not state delegate equivalents.\n\n“We want to thank the people of Iowa. We are gratified that in the partial data released so far it’s clear that in the first and second round more people voted for Bernie than any other candidate in the field,\" Weaver said in a statement.\n\nWarren in a tweet said she's proud of the \"powerful grassroots movement\" her campaign has built.\n\n\"We’ve come out of Iowa in the top three and we are in a strong position heading into New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and Super Tuesday,\" she continued. \"Let’s go!\"\n\nFollowing the release of the partial caucus results, Klobuchar's campaign said that this is now a five person race.\n\n\"What these results make clear is that this is a five person race,\" Klobuchar campaign manager Justin Buoen wrote on Twitter. \"Some of Amy's strongest counties haven't been fully reported and the current data doesn't tell the full story. We're in a virtual tie with VP Biden and we look forward to making our case in New Hampshire.\"\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBernie Sanders says he's proud of Iowa, confident in New Hampshire\n\nMILFORD, N.H. – Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night touted his performance in Iowa from the night before as the Iowa Democratic Party continued to count votes.\n\n\"I'm very proud to tell you that last night in Iowa we received more votes on the first and second round than any other candidate,” Sanders told more than 1,000 cheering supporters at a rally here.\n\nHis remarks came as the state party had released 62.7 percent of Iowa votes, showing former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg ahead with 26.9 percent of the vote and Sanders with 25.1 percent.\n\n\"For some reason in Iowa, they're having a little bit of trouble counting votes,” Sanders said. “But I am confident that here in New Hampshire, I know they’ll be able to count your votes on election night. And when you count those votes, I am going to win here in New Hampshire.\"\n\nSanders, who was set to give a public response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union in Manchester later Tuesday, said he would be returning to Washington to vote on President Donald Trump’s impeachment Wednesday.\n\n“Tomorrow the votes may not be there to impeach Trump, but I am absolutely confident that in November the votes will be there to defeat Donald Trump,” he said. “And with your help next Tuesday, we begin and continue the process of winning here in New Hampshire, going on to Nevada, going on to South Carolina, going on to California, to win those states and become the Democratic nominee.\n\nSanders, who has been polling in first in New Hampshire for weeks, concluded his approximately 30-minute speech by telling the crowd, “New Hampshire goes first in terms of primaries. You go first. The whole country will be watching. And a week from tonight, New Hampshire has the opportunity to tell not only this nation, but the entire world, that we together will stand for justice, for compassion and for children.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nButtigieg chokes up over historic significance of his bid\n\nPete Buttigieg, the candidate known for his unflappability but criticized for not showing more emotion, let his heart show Tuesday.\n\nRelaying to New Hampshire voters the breaking news that he is leading in Iowa caucus returns, Buttigieg choked up when describing the significance of that for gay people and others who have felt excluded.\n\n“It validates for a kid, somewhere in a community, wondering if he belongs, or she belongs, or they belong, in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there's a lot backing up that belief,” Buttigieg said.\n\nThe former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, did not come out as gay until 2015. He has said that he long believed he could either be out or be in politics, but not both.\n\nAfter his strong showing in Iowa, where the results are still being tabulated, the leader of a group that backs openly gay candidates said Buttigieg’s candidacy represents a revolution in American politics.\n\nAnnise Parker, head of LGBTQ Victory Fund, said Buttigieg is “upending traditional notions of electability and proving America is ready to elect its first openly gay president.”\n\nA recent national USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll showed, however, some qualms remain about the electoral appeal of a gay candidate.\n\nBeing a gay man makes a candidate less appealing, according to 32% of Americans and 23% of Democratic voters. Half of Americans and two-thirds of the Democratic voters said it doesn't make a difference.\n\nIt made a big difference to one Iowa caucusgoer, captured on video, who wanted to withdraw her support for Buttigieg after learning he’s married to a man.\n\n“I don’t want anybody like that in the White House,” she said. “So can I have my card back?”\n\nThe precinct captain responded that she respects the other woman’s view but suggested she dig deep inside and ask if Buttigieg’s sexuality really matters.\n\n“What I teach my son is, love is love and we’re all human beings,” she said.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nMajority of results to be released by 5 p.m., Iowa Dems say\n\nOfficials from Iowa's Democratic Party told the candidates' campaigns in a private conference call Tuesday that they planned to release a majority of the results by 5 p.m. EST, an Iowa Democratic Party spokesperson told the Des Moines Register.\n\nThe state party chairman, Troy Price, told the campaigns they expected to have at least 50% of the results by that time but was unable to say when they expected to have the rest of the data compiled.\n\n\"We will continue to work through the process,\" Price said, according to AP, which monitored the call. \"We want to get some results out there.\"\n\n– William Cummings, USA TODAY\n\nBiden spokesperson: The integrity of the Iowa caucuses at stake\n\nNASHUA, NH – The national communications director of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign said Tuesday the “integrity” of the Iowa caucuses is at stake as she urged the state party to take their time to get the results right but denied reports suggesting the campaign is weighing litigation.\n\n“What we are saying is there’s some inconsistencies with the process, the integrity is at stake, and the Iowa Democratic Party needs to check that data, check it again, check it a third time, and check it a fourth time, because it’s important to get it right,” the campaign’s National Communications Director Symone Sanders said.\n\nHer remarks came after the release of the results of Monday’s Iowa caucus was put on hold after a new cell phone app used at caucus sites had malfunctions. Unverified internal numbers put out by the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders showed Biden in a distant 4th place. But Biden, addressing supporters at a girls social services nonprofit in Nashua Tuesday, offered optimism about his Iowa performance.\n\n\"As my mother would say, hope springs eternal, pal,” Biden, appearing with former New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, told a crowd of a couple hundred people. “We’re not giving up. We’re not giving up.\"\n\n“I said it last night. Let’s give them time,” he said of the Iowa Democratic Party. “I’m not being critical. Let’s give them time to work out those issues carefully because a lot depends on them.”\n\nBiden left the event without taking questions from reporters. “I don’t know what happened in Iowa this morning,” he said, raising his hands and walking away.\n\n– Joey Garrison, USA TODAY\n\nWarren on releasing half the results: 'I just don't understand'\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, said at a campaign event in New Hampshire that she was confused by Iowa Democrats' plan to release at least half the results by 5 p.m. EST.\n\n\"I just don't understand what that means, to release half of the data,\" she said. \"I think they ought to get it together and release all of the data.\"\n\nShe said her campaign was sharing what data they had to assist in the vote count and called on other campaigns to do the same.\n\n– William Cummings, USA TODAY\n\nSanders 'extremely disappointed' Iowa Democratic Party hasn't released results\n\nAs Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., prepared to board a plane for New Hampshire, he told the Des Moines Register that he is \"extremely disappointed\" that the results of Monday's Iowa caucuses have not been released.\n\n\"Obviously, I suspect I speak for all of the candidates, I am extremely disappointed by the inability of the Iowa Democratic Party to come up with the results in a timely manner. I don’t know why in 2020 it should take so much time,\" Sanders said in a car at the Des Moines airport tarmac.\n\nIowa Democratic Party officials have said they would release partial results from Monday's caucuses at 5 p.m. ET, amid critiques and confusion over the lack of any results data Monday night.\n\n– Nick Coltrain, Des Moines Register\n\nSen. Durbin questions whether a ‘credible result’ will come out of Iowa\n\nDemocratic senators expressed concern about the management of this year’s Democratic caucuses, and a top Democrat called the delay in results a “political asterisk.”\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told reporters the caucuses might not conclude in a “credible result.”\n\n“Right now it's turned out to be a political asterisk. We just don't know if it's going to end up a credible result. That's a shame for everyone,” he continued.\n\n“Yeah, I think it needs to be changed,” said Sen. Michael Bennet, when asked about the process for the Iowa caucuses. Bennet, D-Colo., is also a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was the party’s 2016 vice presidential nominee, said the situation in Iowa was “unfortunate.”\n\n“I think what happened last night is so unfortunate for all the volunteers, for all the voters, for all the candidates,” he said.\n\nKaine prefers the open primaries in Virginia.\n\n“I like our system and I think primaries lead to more participation than caucuses, but I've never felt like it was my duty to tell a state party how to do their process, but certainly that's going to have to be a discussion,” he said.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said the general election was more important than any stumbles in February.\n\n“A lot is going to happen between now and November, it's probably not going to be how the Iowa Democratic Party stumbled in February that determines a single person's vote,” he said.\n\n– Nicholas Wu, USA TODAY\n\nNevada Dems confident they won't suffer same fate as Iowa\n\nAs in Iowa, Nevada's state Democratic Party plans to use an app to report the results of its caucuses. But party officials said they don't anticipate the same problems for their voters on Feb. 22.\n\n\"NV Dems can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada on February 22nd,\" said the party's chairman, William McCurdy. \"We will not be employing the same app or vendor used in the Iowa caucus.\n\n\"We had already developed a series of backups and redundant reporting systems, and are currently evaluating the best path forward.\"\n\n– James DeHaven, Reno Gazette Journal, and Mike Snider, USA TODAY\n\nApp that contributed to reporting issues linked to Clinton 2016 campaign\n\nThe smartphone application blamed in part for the ongoing delay in reporting results of the Monday Iowa caucuses is linked with key Iowa and national Democrats associated with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe app was issued by Jimmy Hickey of Shadow Inc., metadata of the program the Des Moines Register analyzed Tuesday shows. Gerard Niemira and Krista Davis, who worked for Clinton’s 2016 campaign, co-founded the company\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price worked as Clinton’s 2016 Iowa political director. He did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday about the relationship between the party and Shadow, which it paid $63,184 for website development and travel expenses, according to reports filed with the Iowa Ethics & Campaign Disclosure Board.\n\nSecurity watchdogs had called on Iowa Democrats to be more transparent about the development and testing of the app prior to Monday’s caucuses. But Democrats declined to name the developer or provide testing details, saying top cybersecurity experts advised against releasing too much information because it could result in the vendor being targeted.\n\n– Jason Clayworth, Des Moines Register\n\nButtigieg addresses early 'victory' declaration\n\n\"I think it’s safe to say no one in the country is more impatient than I am to hear the official results from the party,\" former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said Tuesday on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nWhen asked if his boast of victory was \"premature,\" Buttigieg – whose declaration was derided by supporters of other candidates using #MayorCheat on Twitter – repeated his claim.\n\n\"Looking at all the data we've got it was an extraordinary night. And we are absolutely victorious coming into New Hampshire,\" he said.\n\nElaborating on what he meant by victory, Buttigieg said, \"The fact that this campaign was able to gather support in urban, suburban, and rural areas alike – in counties that Hillary Clinton won, counties that Donald Trump won – we are thrilled and absolutely consider that a victory.\"\n\n– William Cummings\n\n'Coding issue' caused incomplete reports, Dems say\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party said early Tuesday the \"underlying data collected\" on the app used to report caucus results \"was sound\" but the system was only reporting out partial data.\n\nThe error was caught early as precinct caucus results started coming in and the Iowa Democratic Party ran them through accuracy and quality checks, said party chair Price in a statement. He added precinct chairs reported data accurately, and it will take time to finalize results.\n\n\"We have determined that this was due to a coding issue in the reporting system. This issue was identified and fixed,\" he said in the statement. \"The application’s reporting issue did not impact the ability of precinct chairs to report data accurately.\"\n\nPrice did not say when results from the Iowa caucuses would be released.\n\n\"Because of the required paper documentation, we have been able to verify that the data recorded in the app and used to calculate State Delegate Equivalents is valid and accurate,\" he said in the statement. \"Precinct level results are still being reported to the IDP. While our plan is to release results as soon as possible today, our ultimate goal is to ensure that the integrity and accuracy of the process continues to be upheld.\"\n\nHe added the party has \"every indication\" the app was secure and there was no cyber intrusion or hacking of the system.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses kicked off at 7 p.m. CT Monday in church basements and school gyms across the state.\n\nAt about 10:30 p.m. CT, when no results had rolled in, the party issued a statement saying the party found inconsistencies in the three data sets — the first alignment, the second alignment and the overall delegate numbers — and that it would take longer than expected to report results.\n\n– Kim Norvell, Des Moines Register\n\n'Duh Moines': Newspapers take on Iowa's 'chaos'\n\nNewspapers across the country used various approaches to describe the uncertainty in the wake of Iowa’s Democratic caucuses Monday night after the state party did not report any results.\n\n“Duh Moines,” the New York Post’s frontpage headline read.\n\nThree other newspapers summed up the situation as chaotic -- a description the New York Post also used.\n\n“Iowa delivers caucus chaos,” the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s front page headline read.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times used the same phrase.\n\nAnd the Los Angeles Times used the headline “Iowa caucuses turn to chaos as party fails to name victor.”\n\n“Anticipation quickly turns to apprehension in Iowa,” was the Boston Globe’s front page headline.\n\nAnd the Miami Herald called the results delay in Iowa, a “poor start” to the 2020 nomination season.\n\n–Joshua Gargiulo, USA TODAY\n\nIowa Democratic Party: Results expected 'later' Tuesday following manual recount\n\nThe head of the Iowa Democratic Party said the organization is manually recounting the results of the Iowa Caucuses and he expects the numbers to be released sometime Tuesday.\n\nIt’s unclear how quickly the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process will be able to reveal who won the contest.\n\nBut “the integrity of our process with the results have and always will be our top priority,” Iowa Democratic Party (IDP) Chair Troy Price told reporters at a conference call at 1 a.m. CST. “At this point, the IDP is manually verifying all precinct results. We expect to have numbers to report later today. “\n\nPrice repeated the party’s early assertion that the technical glitch with the system “is a reporting issue not a hack or an intrusion. And it’s exactly why we have a paper trail and systems in place to uphold the integrity of our process.”\n\n“They’re validating every piece of data we have against our paper trail,” he said. “The system is taking longer than expected but it’s in place to ensure we are eventually able to report results with full confidence.”\n\nPrice said the IDP has reached out to the various campaigns and is keeping them updated.\n\nPiyce comments followed criticism from some campaigns, notably former Vice President Joe Biden’s who called the reporting problems “acute failures.”\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nBiden campaign slams Iowa Democratic Party for ‘acute failures’\n\nJoe Biden’s campaign is slamming the Iowa Democratic Party, saying the “considerable flaws” holding up election results for the Iowa Caucuses demand a complete and speedy answer.\n\n“We appreciate that you plan to brief the campaigns momentarily on these issues, and we plan to participate,” Dana Remus, general counsel for the former vice president’s campaign wrote in a letter Monday night as delays extended into early Tuesday morning.\n\n“However, we believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond before any official results are released,” the letter said.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party which runs the caucuses reported “inconsistencies” in the reporting of the result.\n\n“In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,” said Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the state party. “This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.\"\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nTrump campaign blasts Democrats for caucus delays, calling it 'sloppiest train wreck in history'\n\nThe Trump campaign was quick to seize on Monday night's delays in caucus results, calling it the \"sloppiest train wreck in history.\"\n\n\"Democrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in an emailed statement.\n\nHe also raised concerns about \"the fairness of the process\" after suggesting in a tweet that the \"quality control\" issues Democrats cited in the delay were part of a scheme to rig the results.\n\n\"And these are the people who want to run our entire health care system?\" he asked.\n\nParscale also touted the president's easy victory earlier in the night in Iowa's Republican caucuses, where he faced no significant challenge.\n\n\"Tonight President Trump posted a record performance in the well-run GOP Iowa caucuses with record turnout for an incumbent,\" Parscale added.\n\nIn the days leading up to the Iowa caucuses, the Trump campaign sought to project a massive GOP show of force in the Midwest state, deploying 80 presidential surrogates, including much of Trump's cabinet and members of his family.\n\nThe president also held a campaign rally in Des Moines on Thursday that brought out more than 7,000 supporters to the city's Drake University.\n\nMeanwhile, Iowa's GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann said he supported the IDP's decision to ensure the results are \"correct rather than quick.\"\n\n\"Accuracy doesn't run on deadline,\" he tweeted.\n\n- Courtney Subramaniam\n\nButtigieg: Iowa has proved the skeptics wrong\n\nThe last of the Democratic frontrunners to speak while the candidates still waited for results, Pete Buttigieg went farther than others had in claiming victory.\n\n“We don’t know all the results. But we know by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation,” Buttigieg said. “Because, by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.”\n\nThe boisterous crowd alternatively chanted “Boot-edge-edge” and “President Pete!” throughout his speech.\n\nThe former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said there were plenty of skeptics who said: “not now, not this time” of a presidential bid by the 38-year-old, openly gay candidate.\n\n“Iowa, you have proved those skeptics wrong,” he said.\n\nButtigieg said his campaign brought together a coalition of progressives, moderates and a good number “of what we like to call future former Republicans.”\n\nHis campaign had said it exceeded internal projections in counties that had voted for President Barack Obama before flipping to Trump that he’d heavily targeted.\n\n“This is the coalition that no pundit saw coming,” Buttigieg said. “And it’s the coalition the president won’t see coming either.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nResults from Iowa caucuses delayed because of 'inconsistencies'\n\nIowa Democratic Party officials are holding a phone call with campaigns amid delays in reporting caucus results, and pushing back on reports that of a voting app malfunction and hacking.\n\nPeople familiar with the decision spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to describe the private call.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party said earlier Monday night that it was experiencing a delay in reporting results from the first-in-the-nation caucuses because of unspecified “quality checks.”\n\nCommunications director Mandy McClure said in a statement Monday night that the delay is also the result of the party reporting three sets of data for the first time.\n\nMcClure says the party has data so far from “around 25%” of the state’s 1,765 precincts and “and early data indicates turnout is on pace for 2016.\"\n\n\"We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results. In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.\"\n\nBret Niles, chairman of the Linn County Democratic Party, said he was aware of eight of 86 precinct officials in that county that had trouble logging into the app as of about 2:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nPrecinct chairs were provided a PIN to test the mobile app, which was different than a login required for Caucus Day. Some might have entered the wrong login credentials Monday, creating temporary problems, Niles said.\n\nSeveral Democratic precinct chairs reported Monday afternoon they were unable to log into a new phone app to report results.\n\n- Courtney Subramaniam, Lee Rood and Jason Clayworth, Des Moines Register, Associated Press\n\nBernie Sanders: Change is coming\n\nHours after the caucusing ended, Sen. Bernie Sanders started his remarks to supporters saying he imagines “that, at some point, the results will be announced.”\n\n“And I have a good feeling we’re going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa,” he said while flanked on stage by his wife, son and grandchildren. “The message that Iowa has sent to the nation, the message shared by the American people, is that we want a government that represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors and the 1%.”\n\nSanders said Monday’s caucus “marks the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.” He called the president a pathological liar who is corrupt and doesn’t understand the Constitution,\n\nSanders went through his campaign promises on health care, minimum wage, student debt and climate change before declaring: “Change is coming.”\n\n“Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!” the crowd responded.\n\nHe called his campaign the “strongest grassroots movement this country has ever seen.”\n\n“And now it is on to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, California,” he said while smiling, “and onward to victory!”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nWarren: ‘One step closer’ to defeating Trump\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren isn’t sure how she did in the Iowa Caucuses due to reporting delays, but she told supporters Monday she’s confident Donald Trump’s days as president are numbered.\n\n“Tonight as a party, we are one step closer to defeating the most corrupt president in American history,” she said.\n\nTomorrow Donald Trump will make a speech about the state of the union,” she told a cheering throng gathered. “But I have a message for every American: Our union is stronger than Donald Trump. And, in less than a year, our union will be stronger than ever when that one man is replaced by one very persistent woman.”\n\nThe true winner of the Iowa Caucuses may not be known for hours due to technical glitches in the election reporting system.\n\n\"It is too close to call,\" Elizabeth Warren tells supporters, \"so I'm just going to tell you what I do know.\"\n\n\"You won!\" a man in the audience shouted. The crowd cheered and Warren laughed.\n\nThe Iowa Democratic Party is reporting “inconsistencies in the reporting” results, and that it will “take time” for official results to come out.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nVictory speeches before the winner is known\n\nThe candidates are not waiting for the election results of the Iowa Caucuses to declare victory.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar gave her remarks in Des Moines. Former Vice President Joe Biden followed shortly after. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are expected to follow suit.\n\nIt’s rare for candidates to speak without knowing the final outcome. But glitches with the new reporting program has made it unclear when the delegate totals will actually be known.\n\n“We’re going to be here, it looks like, a really long time tonight,” Klobuchar told her supporters as she promised to head to the next campaign stop in New Hampshire.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nAmy Klobuchar takes the stage in Iowa before results\n\nAddressing supporters in Des Moines, presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar vowed late Monday to continue her campaign into the New Hampshire primary – even before the results in Iowa are anywhere near clear.\n\nKlobuchar, who has not polled in the top tier of candidates in the weeks leading into the Iowa caucuses, spoke during a delay in results that left the nation hanging for the results. Her early remarks underscored an important concern for many of the candidates: They must quickly shift focus from Iowa to the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. That could be particularly true for Klobuchar, who will face headwinds in the New England state where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Bernie Sanders will have something of a home-state advantage.\n\nKlobuchar, speaking through a hoarse voice, said she is “feeling so good tonight” and hinted at the delay in the results.\n\n“Someway, somehow I’m going to get on a plane tonight to New Hampshire,” Klobuchar said.\n\n\"We are going to be here, it looks like, a really long time tonight,\" Klobuchar said, joking that the national audience watching her remarks would have extra time to visit her campaign website.\n\n-- John Fritze\n\nDiverse turnout on Des Moines' north side\n\nMore than 130 people filled the Bosnian Islamic Center Zen Zen on Des Moines’ north side for a satellite caucus that catered to immigrants and non-English speakers on Monday night. The caucus is being held in a mosque, so everyone removed their shoes before entering.\n\nAs the proceedings got underway, Deven Sapkota volunteered to translate what caucus chair Zlatka Kendic, 34, was saying into Nepali. As volunteers began to count the caucusgoers, Sapkota said he didn’t expect to be translating for the room.\n\nMost of the attendees picked up Sen. Bernie Sanders stickers or signs before taking their seats around 7 p.m. Volunteers from Sanders’ campaign handed out flyers that outlined his biography and positions in Bosnian and English.\n\nHari Pokhrel, who attended the caucus with her two daughters, said she liked Sanders’ plans for “Medicare for All” and debt-free college. She had written statements of support on her Sanders sign in both English and Nepali.\n\nAt 7:34 p.m., a volunteer had all the caucusgoers raise their hands to be counted. He then counted each of them aloud. Preference groups would need 21 supporters to meet the 15% viability threshold.\n\n-- Austin Cannon, Des Moines Register\n\nIowa resident 'tired of the phone ringing'\n\nMarried couple Chris Martin, 53, and Melissa Murphy, 51, walked into their Liberty High caucus site in Johnson County still undecided. With twenty minutes until the doors closed, the two argued about who to support. Martin leaned toward Warren or Biden, who he feels has powerful connections in Washington. Murphy disagreed, leaning toward Warren or Buttigieg, saying she likes the way they both speak and feels “like their tweets would not be misspelled.”\n\nThey do, however, both agree they are ready for campaign staff to leave Iowa. Murphy estimates she’s had more campaign volunteers knock on her North Liberty door in the last year than she’s had trick-or-treaters in the last 15 years.\n\n“I will be freaking relieved, because I’m so tired of the phone ringing,” Murphy said.\n\n- Aimee Breaux, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\nIowa caucus::What is a delegate equivalent? Or a viability threshold? The Iowa caucuses, explained.\n\nMisinformation spreads in Iowa\n\nIowa’s Republican secretary of state chastised a right-wing D.C.-based foundation Monday for circulating false claims on social media suggesting inaccurate voter registrations heading into Caucus Day.\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton said on Twitter, Facebook and in a news release that eight Iowa counties had total voter registration rates larger than the eligible voter population.\n\nBut Secretary of State Paul Pate said early Monday that Fitton’s claims were “patently false,\" providing a link to actual county-by-county voter registration totals.\n\n\"It’s unfortunate this organization continues to put out inaccurate data regarding voter registration, and it’s especially disconcerting they chose the day of the Iowa Caucus to do this,\" Pate said in a news release.\n\n- Jason Clayworth and Lee Rood, Des Moines Register\n\nMore:How do the Iowa caucuses work and how they are different than a primary?\n\nPresident Donald Trump wins Republican caucuses in Iowa\n\nPresident Donald Trump is the winner of the 2020 Iowa Republican caucuses, a largely symbolic vote as he was facing no significant opposition.\n\nStill, Trump’s campaign was using Monday's contest to test its organizational strength, deploying Cabinet secretaries, top Republican officials and Trump family members to the state.\n\nIt's unusual for Iowa to even be holding a GOP contest with an incumbent in the White House. The Iowa Republican caucuses were canceled in 1992 and 2004. But GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufman said state officials were determined to keep the caucuses in place this year to maintain the state’s status as the first in the nation to cast its ballots.\n\n- Associated Press\n\nA bar where the hamburger is cheaper than a can of chew\n\nGrant, Iowa, population 92 as of 2010, is hosting a Democratic caucus for the first time ever Monday evening — and it’s being held at The Hayloft, the town’s local bar and grill.\n\nThe Hayloft is owned by Zelda Swartz, a spry 74-year-old open Republican who’s run this establishment for 48 years. Hamburgers cost $2.50. There’s a Skoal chew dispenser behind the bar, at $7 a can.\n\nThe original plan was to host this precinct at Grant’s firehouse, just up the road, but they declined, Swartz said, because they would have to move the trucks outside. So the Iowa Democratic Party called Swartz. Of course, she said.\n\nThe front bar features signs and a TV in the far corner — and would later host a Grant City Council Meeting before the caucus. A rustic vibe fills the back room, where farm memorabilia is scattered, old signs hang and a pool table sits prominently. In the back, horse saddles and a Santa-like sleigh sit in the back.\n\nOn the floor, supporters for Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg claimed tables on both sides. They are friendly with one another and are collectively hopeful that 30 people show up to help decide who will receive the three delegates up for grabs in Montgomery County’s fifth precinct.\n\n– Cody Goodwin, Des Moines Register\n\nThe political questions answered tonight\n\nWith caucus night upon us, there are some questions that caucusgoers across the state — and voters throughout the country — will see answered when the night is over.\n\nThe big question will obviously be momentum coming out of Monday night and heading into next week’s New Hampshire primary. Campaigns, pundits and even voters look at Iowa’s results to see who has a chance of continuing to the New Hampshire primary or who should call it quits.\n\nAlthough the Iowa results won’t predict what happens in New Hampshire, it will be looked on as a guide.\n\nAnother question that will be answered is whether one of the big four candidates — former Vice President Joe Biden, former mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren — will win. All four candidates at some point have led the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll over the past several months. In addition, those four candidates have been within the top five nationally over the past couple of months.\n\nVoters will also be looking to see whether Sen. Amy Klobuchar makes a run at the top tier. Klobuchar has seen a small bump in polling since a strong debate performance in December. And we’ll see Monday night whether that momentum continues. If she does well, it could lead to a bump in New Hampshire.\n\nBut several campaigns might declare themselves the winner, which the Associated Press will determine by state delegate equivalents. The Iowa Democratic Party will for the first time release raw numbers from the first grouping, as well as the final vote total after realignment.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nThe Trumps are making their presence known in Iowa\n\nThere's bustle outside of the Democratic caucuses today, too. President Donald Trump's eldest son was speaking in West Des Moines when a male protester interrupted to say that the president's policies and rhetoric have led to more Jewish deaths than those of any past president.\n\nSecurity pulled the man out of the conference room as Donald Trump Jr. shouted back about misinformation spread by Democrats and members of the national media. His surrogates rose in applause as he yelled into the microphone.\n\nAt the press conference in West Des Moines, members of Trump's family also attacked Democrats as out of touch. Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Trump Victory Finance Committee National Chair Kimberly Guilfoyle, both described Democratic presidential candidates as \"socialists\" and \"communists.\"\n\n\"We're going to beat them again,\" said the president's other son, Eric Trump. \"We're going to beat them so much harder this time.\"\n\nTrump's children also took shots at some specific candidates. Donald Trump Jr. referred to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg as \"mini Mike.\" (Bloomberg's height was trending on Google as 5 feet, 8 inches.)\n\nDonald Trump Jr. also recalled campaigning for his father at Pizza Ranches in Iowa before the 2016 caucuses. He said he drew only about 15 people in the early events, a crowd size he compared to that of what former Vice President Joe Biden has drawn.\n\n\"That is a fight I would pay a lot of money to see,\" he said of a potential Biden-Trump match-up in the general election.\n\nAmong the Republican heavyweights in Iowa Monday: Trump's daughter-in-law and campaign adviser Lara Trump; Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross; Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos; U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows; U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise; and U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz\n\n- Tyler Jett, Des Moines Register\n\nGroup gathers to demand union rights\n\nAn hour before the 4:30 p.m. caucus at the Drake University Fieldhouse began in Des Moines, the building was already awash in activity.\n\nDemonstrators from the Fight for 15 movement gathered outside the building on the corner of Forest Avenue and 27th Street to demand a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights.\n\n“We chose the caucus site tonight because we want our voices to be heard and we know this is where it’s gonna happen,” said 33-year-old organizer and Popeyes employee Delores Davis.\n\nFight for 15 has not endorsed a candidate for president in 2020. Several Democratic contenders have marched with workers from the movement.\n\nDavis said she plans to caucus later tonight, but she hasn’t decided which candidate she’ll support.\n\n“I want somebody that’s going to stand with us on the union,” she said.\n\nTo the tune of muffled chants from outside, student-athletes in the Fieldhouse practiced discus and softball on an astro-turf field. Drake softball players Kristen Arias, 19, and Emily Valtman, 18, finished a game of catch about 30 minutes before the event began.\n\nValtman is from Newton, but said she’s not sure if she will caucus tonight, as she was planning to attend a study hall instead.\n\n— Katie Akin, Des Moines Register\n\nIowans caucus around the world\n\nHours before the caucuses got underway in the United States, Iowans were taking part all over the world.\n\nDes Moines native Colyn Burbank hosted a mixture of Iowans, observers and press, at his apartment in Glasgow for one of the three International caucus events aimed at helping Democrats pick someone who can beat President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nOn a blustery and rainy Monday, 20 Iowans showed up at Burbanks' residence in Scotland's capital to express their preference for who should be the Democrats' next standard-bearer. Despite a Friday NBC/WSJ national poll that showed Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden statistically tied, the former vice president did not receive a single vote.\n\nSanders garnered the most support, with 9 Iowans backing him to receive the nomination, followed by 6 for Elizabeth Warren and 3 for Pete Buttigieg. One voter chose not to express a second preference after her candidate did not receive enough backing to make it to a second round. Another was unable to vote because she turned up late.\n\n\"Not to put too fine a point on it but it feels like the future is at stake with this election,\" said Lucy Schiller, 31, who is teaching American literature and creative writing at a college in Germany and traveled to Glasgow for the caucus. She previously taught at the University of Iowa, in Des Moines. \"This is the last off-ramp we have before climate disaster.\"\n\nSchiller, who backs Sanders, said the Vermont Senator's policies were the most appropriate to meet this challenge.\n\nBurbank, who is studying for a master's degree in social care in Glasgow, lives in the apartment with his wife and young daughter along with another Iowan couple, and their cat, Lewis. The couples had decorated their home with pictures of famous Iowans such as the actor John Wayne, American late-night television host Johnny Carson and Grant Wood's iconic 1930 painting \"American Gothic,\" which shows a farmer holding a pitchfork next to a stern-faced woman.\n\nThey also put on an Iowan-type spread of corn chips, homemade chocolate cookies, pretzels and what they claimed was an Iowan staple called \"puppy chow\": a twisted midwestern masterpiece consisting of Chex cereal, peanut butter, chocolate and powdered sugar. Lewis, the cat, darted in and out of the room amid heated political discussion.\n\nMonday’s very first Iowa caucus took place without a hitch in a city that has spent long periods under Persian and Russian rule. Tbilisi, in Georgia, is an ex-Soviet republic and the heart of the Caucasus region, an area that straddles eastern Europe and Western Asia. Tbilisi was also the first of the so-called Iowa satellite caucuses to see action Monday, as voters there chose their preferred Democratic candidates for the 2020 race for the White House. No matter that only three Iowans showed up.\n\n“The Tbilisi caucus was conducted successfully, over a traditional Iowan meal of pizza and ranch dressing – accompanied by a Georgian wine,” its organizer Joshua Kucera tweeted, about 8 hours ahead of when many of the caucuses in Iowa are due to kick off. Alongside his comments, Kucera posted a picture of Iowa’s vertical red, white and blue tricolor flag with a bald eagle in its middle.\n\nThe caucuses - internal party meetings, essentially - don’t guarantee a candidate’s nomination but can provide momentum ahead of primaries this summer. Kucera said that the results from the Tbilisi event would be reported after the rest of the Iowa caucuses take place.\n\nAt stake Monday in Iowa are 41 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Iowa’s Democratic Party has permitted this year 87 satellite caucuses, three of them international. In addition to Tbilisi, caucuses will also be held in a graduate student’s apartment in Glasgow, Scotland, and in Paris, France, where the mayor of France’s capital has agreed to let an American overseas college student host an Iowa caucus event.\n\nAll of the satellite caucus sites are being treated as one big county, so the out-of-state and international results won’t be known until all of the non-precinct locations report their results.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWant to talk more about politics?:Join our Facebook group: ‘Across the Aisle, Across the Nation.’\n\nThe media has taken over Iowa\n\nNot only have presidential campaigns taken over Iowa, so has the media.\n\nHundreds of reporters from across the country, and even internationally, have descended on the state for the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nIn downtown Des Moines, the NBC network has taken over a local coffee shop, Java Joe’s Coffee House. Several large trucks for the network crowded the street outside the shop. A sign that says “MSNBC at Java Joes” is displayed right when you walk in.\n\nMSNBC’s “Morning Joe” was hosted live from there, and MSNBC anchor Katy Tur also went live at 2 p.m.\n\nDell Radcliffe, 68, said she went down to Java Joe’s to “see what was going on” after missing “Morning Joe” in the morning. But when Radcliffe, who is from Des Moines, walked in, she found out that Tur — whom Radcliffe said she didn’t know — was going to go live in the afternoon and decided to stick around.\n\n“I started plugging my meter,” Radcliffe said. Radcliffe said she is still undecided with who she is going to caucus for but is leaning to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but her husband, Mike Delaney, is going to caucus for Joe Biden.\n\nDiane Miles, who is also from Des Moines, was sitting at Java Joe’s with a volunteer for Biden that she is hosting for the caucuses. The volunteer, John Douglass, is a retired Air Force general who is going around different states volunteering for Biden’s campaign.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nFirst Iowans caucus overseas and in the state\n\nOTTUMWA, Ia. — The Iowa caucuses have officially begun, with Democrats in southeastern Iowa declaring their preferences and kicking off a day that will help determine the fates of the seven presidential hopefuls who have staked everything on this state.\n\nThe Ottumwa satellite precinct caucus — which kicked off at noon at the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 230 union hall — was the first of roughly 1,700 caucus locations in Iowa to meet Monday.\n\nAt those locations across Iowa, the country and the world, Democrats will get the first take on what voters think about the field of presidential contenders. Before the vast majority of the country gets to weigh in, Iowans will already have made their mark.\n\nThough nearly all of Iowa's precincts will convene their caucuses at 7 p.m. CDT, local Democrats petitioned the Iowa Democratic Party to host this so-called satellite location earlier in the day. It's designed to accommodate those who work the second shift at the local pork processing plant and during the evenings at other service industry jobs when the caucuses are traditionally held.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont won the precinct's first alignment, with 14 of the precinct's 15 people. One person caucused for U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Warren's supporter said she did not wish to caucus for Sanders on the second alignment. The Iowa Democratic Party will award delegates from the satellite caucus locations based on their final turnout later in the evening. The ultimate winner of Iowa's caucuses will be based on those delegate numbers.\n\n– Brianne Pfannenstiel, Des Moines Register\n\nMonday's first caucus was overseas\n\nMonday’s very first Iowa caucus took place without a hitch in a city that has spent long periods under Persian and Russian rule.

California career shows she likes a ...", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – Sen. Kamala Harris shocked fellow presidential hopeful Joe Biden at the Democratic debate in Miami last month by dressing him down over busing. She immediately saw her poll numbers jump and the nation got a glimpse of a steely competitor.\n\nBut for those who have been a part of Harris’ long tenure in California politics, the moment was pure déjà vu – a vintage Harris move fostered in the bare-knuckled, hyper-competitive cauldron of Bay Area politics.\n\n“San Francisco is a political crucible that has chewed up and destroyed a lot of fairly talented and ambitious people,” says Dan Newman, a close adviser to California Gov. Gavin Newsom who also was a strategist on various Harris campaigns.\n\n“There’s an intense interest in politics here, robust political journalism and an engaged electorate,” he says. “Those who have the ability to survive and thrive here tend to do so at broader national level.”\n\nHarris, who gets both another chance to show the nation her stuff and a Round Two with Biden during the next Democratic debates on July 31, showed early on that she had such mettle.\n\nIn 2003, during her first run for public office as San Francisco’s district attorney, Harris faced down two male rivals, incumbent Terence Hallinan and former prosecutor Bill Fazio.\n\nHarris’ political consultant, Jim Stearns, warned her that the men would choose an upcoming public meeting at a city church to attack her candidacy as being propped up by kingmaker and then-Mayor Willie Brown, whom Harris briefly had dated in the mid-90s.\n\n“Those two men quickly learned what Joe Biden found out in Florida,” Stearns says. “You don’t mess with Kamala Harris. There’s always a double bind for female candidates, but she’ll throw an elbow if she needs to.”\n\nIn Stearns’ retelling of the event, Harris calmly walked around her rivals and – after casually mentioning that Hallinan had pilloried Fazio for being caught at a massage parlor, and Fazio had criticized Hallinan for staffers having sex at work – told the crowd the race should be run on the issues only.\n\n“The whole crowd stood up and applauded,” Stearns says with a laugh. “We never heard about Willie Brown after that.”\n\nHarris has her detractors\n\nHarris' impressive resume mushroomed from there. The one-time city attorney, now 54, became the first female – let alone biracial race – district attorney in the city’s history, winning again four years later before claiming another brass ring as California's first female attorney general in 2010.\n\nShe was reelected by a wide margin in 2014, and then successfully ran for a U.S. Senate seat vacated by veteran Democrat Barbara Boxer in 2016. Harris' Senate move allowed then-Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom to successfully push for the governor's perch last fall, a plum that might have gone to his friendly rival and peer had she sought that office.\n\nNow, Harris has her eyes on a new prize, the presidency.\n\nDespite her scene-stealing moment at the debates and her campaign's subsequent gains, Harris lags in polling and fundraising against the Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Biden.\n\nHarris also is second to Biden in recent California polls, increasingly a critical gauge of success ever since the massive blue state announced it was moving up its primaries to March 2020, making a victory in the Golden State imperative for any Democratic nominee looking to stand out after first-in-the-nation contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nHarris, of course, has her detractors, most of whom point to her law enforcement days in San Francisco and Sacramento as evidence of establishment bona fides that are at odds with the growing progressive choir in the party as exemplified by freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n\"Harris's work as DA and California AG cannot be described as progressive,\" says Gayle McLaughlin, chair of the California Progressive Alliance, a volunteer-based network that promotes progressive ideals.\n\n\"She has a reputation for protecting the status quo and shrinking from controversial issues,\" says McLaughlin, citing Harris's tough-on-crime approach that saw some parents arrested for their children's truancy. \"California progressive activists are well aware of her opposition to or silence on many criminal justice reform issues.\"\n\nSome Bay Area political experts also question whether Harris, who drew 20,000 supporters for her campaign kick-off rally in her native Oakland, can draw the support of African American voters, long considered a key constituency for Democratic candidates. The issue, again, is her law enforcement background.\n\n\"She calls her approach being smart on crime, but it seems she just found a less racist way of using the police apparatus to carry out her duties,\" says James Taylor, who lectures on politics and African American studies at the University of San Francisco. \"She's had a failure to launch among blacks, likely because of being connected to policing issues in the Black Lives Matter era.\"\n\nTaylor adds that African American voters will come to her side if she succeeds on being the nominee, much as did in 2008 when there was a shift to Barack Obama’s candidacy once he started picking up primaries.\n\n“If they feel she has a chance, they’ll move over,” he says. “Black people want to get Trump out of office. That’s the priority.”\n\nHarris loves hand-to-hand politicking\n\nThose who have worked alongside the senator during her California days caution that her big electoral milestones here were come-from-behind victories born out of a fierce love of hand-to-hand political combat – the very kind of combat that the presidential hopefuls will begin engaging in across New Hampshire and Iowa.\n\n“In San Francisco, all politicians have to run the gantlet of countless groups and constituencies and somehow make their cases to all of them convincingly, a mirror of what happens in the primaries” says Nathan Ballard, a longtime Bay Area political operative who now runs The Press Shop media strategy firm.\n\n“Our city here is just a great training ground for politicians, just look at Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and now Gov. Gavin Newsom,” he says. “Politics is the sports of San Francisco. You have to be engaged, from the mansions of Pacific Heights to the inner city of Bayview-Hunters Point.”\n\nFeinstein echoes that observation, noting that because of the diverse economic and cultural nature of the Bay Area, politicians have to connect with voters and build bridges across issues.\n\n“That’s the only way to get things done, it’s not a place where you can sit behind a desk and be successful,” Feinstein says via an email to USA TODAY.\n\n“California’s population of 40 million is larger than 21 states and Washington, D.C., combined,” she writes. “Because of that size, many of the challenges Sen. Harris faced at the local and state level weren’t unique to California, but rather representative of what the entire country is facing.”\n\nOne might think that San Francisco, a longtime bastion of Democratic values, would be a cakewalk for its candidates.\n\nBut political experts here say the opposite is true; that precisely because the city is represented by endless shades of blue, candidates for office have to work harder to address a range of concerns from both center- and far-left parts of the party.\n\n“Political wars in San Francisco are all civil wars, and they’re the worst,” says Brian Brokaw, who ran Harris’ first campaign for attorney general back in 2009. “So it’s down to hand-to-hand combat, true retail politics, shaking as many hands as you can.”\n\nBrokaw, who calls Harris “a tough, scrappy fighter who’s always counted out before she wins,” says much like clutch baseball hitters who can deliver home runs in the ninth inning, Harris “performs well in crunch time, just like the best prime time players. And she learned all that here.”\n\nCritically for Harris’s presidential bid, which soon will test her across-the-aisle appeal, San Francisco demands that its politicians develop both a thick skin as well as deft political instincts, says Jason McDaniel, associate professor of political science at San Francisco State University.\n\n“If you can get elected here, it is a product of your talent because it means you’ve succeeded in winning over the support of a wide range of people concerned about a wide range of issues,” he says.\n\nMcDaniel says broad coalition building is a hallmark of successful Bay Area politicians, as is the ability to connect directly with voters.\n\n“If she can do well in Iowa, she’ll be formidable,” he says. “In San Francisco and later in California more broadly, she showed she has the ability to appeal to both a multiracial group but also, though her prosecutorial experience, with those who are look for that strength of character. She’s the real deal.”\n\nHarris: Oakland born and bred\n\nThe story of Harris and her against-the-odds rise in state politics is increasingly familiar to national voters now as her presidential campaign intensifies.\n\nDaughter of an Indian-born breast cancer scientist mother, Shyamala Gopalan, and Jamaican economics professor father, Donald Harris, Harris – and her younger sister Maya – grew up in a politically charged home in Oakland, singing in a Baptist choir and also attending a Hindu temple.\n\nHer parents divorced when Harris was 7. When her mother was granted custody a few years later, the family of three moved to Canada for a university researcher position, and the sisters found themselves at a school for native French speakers.\n\nAfter graduating from historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C., Harris returned to San Francisco for her law degree from the University of California-Hastings College of Law. That led to a job as a prosecutor in nearby Alameda County, where her intense, and often controversial, passion for criminal justice reform took root.\n\nA template was forged: That of an outsider – female and mixed-race – having to work hard to assimilate and appreciate a range of cultures and beliefs. It was a multicultural, multiperspective upbringing that would serve the future politician in Harris well.\n\n“When she first announced she was running for DA, people started saying ‘You can’t do this,’ because you know, DA in San Francisco is a white man’s game,” says Amelia Ashley-Ward, publisher of the San Francisco Sun-Reporter, a 75-year-old publication focused on the African American community whose anniversary Harris helped celebrate with a visit this past spring.\n\nAshley-Ward – who considers Harris a “girlfriend’s girlfriend, someone who will laugh and cry with you, who always keeps a secret” – said her publication ended its longstanding support of the incumbent Hallinan, a progressive force in local politics, to endorse Harris.\n\nShe says the young candidate’s ability to garner support from a range of constituents instantly made her a force.\n\n\"Kamala can deal in the ‘hood, and she can work up top” with monied society donors, says Ashley-Ward, recalling Harris’ decision to put her campaign headquarters in the impoverished and often crime-challenged neighborhood of Bayview-Hunters Point. “We first met in 2000, and even then I was impressed how focused she was.”\n\nFriends and former campaign staffers recall a tireless campaigner who would hop on and off cable cars pressing the flesh. She would set up on a street-corner with an ironing board as a desk, so as to be able to pack up and move on with pace.\n\nHarris proudly drew on her Asian roots to garner support in an often divided Chinese American community, making sure a dragon was part of the victory parties.\n\nCookies, music and determination\n\nWhen she won that first DA race, her small team moved into the DA’s office the very next day only to find that Hallinan’s cadre had removed all the furniture overnight.\n\n“She worked out of a chair there, with a phone and no desk, for weeks, it didn’t stop her,” says Debbie Mesloh, a longtime Harris advisor who has worked on all of her campaigns.\n\nWhat Mesloh witnessed over the next decade was a force of nature who balanced a fierce conviction about what was right – defiantly refusing to call for the death penalty for a man who shot a police officer in 2004, while Feinstein actively called for the opposite – with a mothering desire to keep her team of intimates happy.\n\nIn those early years as DA, Mesloh says, Harris would insist on an afternoon cookie break for staffers. But the die-hard foodie, who often would regale friends with new recipes, would also encourage them to join her for workouts.\n\nMusic also was an obvious passion, says her friend. Harris' favorite song was the one her mother adored, and it would play often in the office: “Oh Happy Day,” originally cut by Edwin Hawkins & the Northern California State Youth Choir.\n\nOther staples included the music of reggae legend Bob Marley as well as the unique funk of Prince. Later, in 2016, when Prince died, Harris and her husband – Los Angeles attorney Doug Emhoff, \"danced all night to his music in their backyard,\" says Mesloh.\n\nAnd if it’s your birthday, “expect a call and a song from her,” Mesloh adds with a laugh. \"She never forgets.\"\n\nBut that gentle side of Harris also has a steely doppelgänger. Some of that was inculcated into young Kamala early by her mother, who exposed her daughters to many of the freedom movements that were a hallmark of their late-‘60s youth in Oakland.\n\nNewspaper publisher Ashley-Ward tells a story about Maya Harris introducing her sister after she won the DA race. “She said, ‘My mother would ask Kamala, what do you want?' and Kamala would shout back, “Fee-dom,” because she couldn’t say an R,’” says Ashley-Ward. “To me, it seems like she’s always looking for that. Freedom.”\n\nThat search to become her true self would require grit. Harris’ mother “instilled in Kamala not just a toughness, but also that desire to be a fighter for things that mattered, to not sit on the sidelines of life,” says Rebecca Prozan, a longtime San Francisco political operative who managed Harris’s DA campaign and now is chief of public policy and government relations for Google.\n\n“We met way back in the ‘90s, and all I remember is she was very nice, very smart and really tough, she wouldn’t give up,” says Prozan.\n\nWhen Prozan agreed to manage that first campaign, she didn’t hold out much hope for a win. “She was polling at 8%, and I thought, where’s the big earthquake going to come from to change things,” she recalls. “But Kamala just said, ‘Get me into a runoff, and I can win.’”\n\nHarris immediately harnessed her network, which included connections to monied donors who were friends with Mayor Brown. She raised more than $200,000 – exceeding an agreed upon cap, which drew an apology from the Harris camp – and besieged voters with flyers listing her progressive credentials.\n\nMostly, she hammered the fact Hallinan’s office was a poorly run shop that needed diligent oversight to be effective. As she writes in her recently published memoir, “The Truths We Hold,” she wanted to bring “a professional operation” to the DA’s office.\n\n“I believed the district attorney was undercutting the whole idea of what a progressive prosecutor could be,” Harris writes. “My vision of a progressive prosecutor was someone who used the power of the office with a sense of fairness, perspective, and experience” to hold criminals accountable while preventing crime in the first place.\n\nWhen the local San Francisco Chronicle endorsed her, the tide turned.\n\nFazio tried another attack on Harris’ connections to Brown, which had led to her being appointed to lucrative state boards, but the move backfired and he lost ground.\n\nSuddenly, that desired runoff loomed, and Harris picked up Fazio’s voters and beat Hallinan with a deft piece of political advertising: a direct-mail flyer that said simply “It’s time for a change,” followed by photos from a century filled with white, male district attorneys.\n\n“Kamala Harris is all about breaking barriers and redefining what leadership looks like,” says former campaign advisor Newman. “Forever, it was considered impossible for a black woman from San Francisco to be elected statewide, especially as attorney general, a last bastion of largely Republican white men. But she did it.”\n\nThe Harris voters nationwide are getting to know as the presidential campaign ratchets up is the same woman who has startled, frustrated, delighted and captivated many Californians for the past two decades: a fearsome politician who loathes to take no for an answer.\n\n“You’ll see her out there campaigning with that smile, she is like velvet in some ways, nice, loving and fun,\" says Newman. \"But ask her opponents and even her staff, and they’ll tell you about the steel. You underestimate her at your own peril.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY national writer @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/04/flagpole-feat-death-row-kidney-donor-civil-rights-medals-news-around-states/50450533/", "title": "Flagpole feat, death row kidney donor, civil rights medals: News ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State officials said Thursday that they will move forward with plans to build two supersize prisons despite a bond sale falling more than $200 million short amid a volatile market and pressure from activists. The Alabama Corrections Institution Finance Authority hoped to sell $725 million in bonds for the construction project but was only able to sell $509 million. The bond issue is a key funding piece for the $1.2 billion construction price tag. State Finance Director Bill Poole told reporters that the state had hoped to “sell a little bit more,” but officials were pleased with the result. He said the outcome would not affect the construction, and the state still anticipates opening the prisons in 2026. He said the state will look at options for the remainder of the money, including seeking additional funding from the Legislature or conducting another bond issue when conditions are more favorable. Gov. Kay Ivey called the bond sale a “significant and positive step forward in our prison construction process.” While state officials blamed a volatile market, a group of activists and impact investors had urged buyers to stay away from the the bond offering. “They didn’t just fall short. They fell well, well, well short,” said Eric Glass, an adviser to Justice Capital, an investment fund that joined the call for a boycott.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Dozens of people experiencing homelessness will now camp at a city-owned site where bears recently tumbled through belongings, as a major local shelter closes. The Sullivan Arena, which provided shelter for hundreds of people nightly for more than two years, closed Thursday. The use of Anchorage’s Centennial Campground as a place for people to stay is seen as a stopgap measure, with indoor shelters full and Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration clearing illegal campsites, citing fire danger, the Anchorage Daily News reports. On Wednesday, the sound of an air horn blasted through the campground as a black bear and two cubs sauntered into the site. Individuals who were camping there and local health department workers tried to scare the bears off with the horn, shouts and claps. Jimmie Hartley said he planned to string cans filled with gravel on a fishing line around his site to warn him of approaching bears. Many of those who were arriving at the campground from Sullivan Arena had minimal gear. One major question is determining how many people the campground can safely accommodate, along with site rules, local Parks and Recreation Director Mike Braniff said. “Right now, we’re not allowing any fires here,” he said. “Food safety and bear safety is at the top of our list.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The elected county recorder and the elections director in Yavapai County are resigning after more than a year and a half of threats and heated criticism from backers of ex-President Donald Trump who accept his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. County Recorder Leslie Hoffman said Friday that she is fed up with the “nastiness” and has accepted a job outside the county. Her last day will be July 22. She said longtime elections director Lynn Constabile is leaving for the same reason, and Friday is her last day. “A lot of it is the nastiness that we have dealt with,” Hoffman said. “I’m a Republican recorder living in a Republican county where the candidate that they wanted to win won by 2-to-1 in this county and still getting grief, and so is my staff. ... I’m not sure what they think that we did wrong. And they’re very nasty. The accusations and the threats are nasty.” Constabile was busy Friday doing a required pre-election “logic and accuracy test” for the upcoming primary and unavailable for comment. Arizona’s 15 county recorders are responsible for voter registration and ensuring mail ballots are properly sent to the more than 80% of voters who vote by mail. They earn just $63,800 a year, a salary set by the Legislature that has not risen in the decade Hoffman has been in office.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The market for industrial hemp has not grown as fast as the plants in Arkansas, despite a promising climate for the crop touted a few years ago as a moneymaker and a new source for clothes, textiles, building materials, fuel and food. Although hemp plants with 0.3% THC became legal on the federal level when the 2018 farm bill passed, the market has not been as exciting, said Jim Correll, a University of Arkansas professor of plant pathology who has been studying hemp in the state. “There was a lot of excitement about the crop and how to make money. It has waned,” said Correll, who is studying diseases and other conditions that affect the quality of hemp and the yield. “The number of growers has dropped substantially.” There are about 20 industrial hemp growers currently in Arkansas, said Bill Morgan, a hemp research farmer who farms west of Fayetteville. Some farmers’ hemp has tested too high in THC, meaning the crop had to be destroyed. There were just 49 licensed hemp growers in Arkansas in 2021 – 78 fewer than when the program opened in 2019. The total number this year is expected to drop again. In 2020 there were 121 growers, and the first growing season for legalized hemp in 2019 started with 125 growers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a new state law that will stop police from arresting people for loitering for prostitution, an issue that divided sex workers and advocates during a rare nine-month delay since legislators passed the bill last year. “To be clear, this bill does not legalize prostitution,” Newsom said in a signing message. “It simply revokes provisions of the law that have led to disproportionate harassment of women” and transgender adults, he said, nothing that Black and Latino women are particularly affected. The bill will bar police in California from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution. State Sen. Scott Wiener and other supporters said such arrest decisions often rely on an officer’s perception. While Newsom said he agreed with the intent of the repeal, “we must be cautious about its implementation.” He said his administration will track crime and prosecution trends “for any possible unintended consequences” and, if found, work to correct them. “For far too long, California law has been used to profile, harass and arrest transgender and gender-nonconforming people simply for existing in public spaces,” Tony Hoang, executive director of the LGTBQ rights group Equality California, said in praising the repeal. The measure also will allow those who were previously convicted to ask a court to dismiss and seal the record of the conviction.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Life expectancy in the state dropped for the second straight year in 2021. Driven by the pandemic, it’s the kind of decline not seen in decades, data from the state health department shows. The average life expectancy for Colorado residents fell to 78 years last year. That’s slightly lower than 2020, the first year of the pandemic, when it was 78.4 years, but the slide represents a persistent and significant drop of nearly three years compared to 2019. “The last time life expectancy dropped like this was in 1943, which was the most fatal year of World War II, for the nation,” said Dr. Eric France, the state’s chief medical officer. “It is tragic that we see life expectancy drop. Death rates increased by 20%.” Key drivers for the decline were COVID-19 and overdose deaths. The data vary by demographic group. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among Hispanics, as well as non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Native Alaskans, the data shows. Dr. Lilia Cervantes, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said she wasn’t surprised by the new numbers. “The Latino community makes up the majority of the essential workforce,” said Cervantes, a member of the Colorado Vaccine Equity Taskforce.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Friday creating a new commission charged with planning the state’s multiyear celebration and commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence signing. The Connecticut Semiquincentennial Commission will be a state-level group, similar to the United States Semiquincentennial Commission recently established by Congress. The executive order requires the panel of volunteers to be wide-ranging, including not just representatives from historical organizations and state officials but also designees from the state’s two federally recognized tribes. The 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and subsequent formation of the U.S. will occur July 4, 2026. Former Secretary of the State Denise Merrill, who officially resigned from her post Thursday to spend time with her ailing husband, noted that Connecticut requires all high school students to take a civics class before they graduate. “This is a chance for all of us to have that lesson and to have everyone included and to have a chance to review the incredible history here in Connecticut of the founding of this country,” she said during a ceremony at the Old State House. “And this time, we can retell it. We can include everyone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The jury in the corruption trial of State Auditor Kathy McGuiness acquitted her Friday of felony charges of theft and witness intimidation but found her guilty on three misdemeanor counts. Jurors deliberated for about four hours over two days before finding McGuiness, a Democrat elected in 2018, guilty of conflict of interest, official misconduct, and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. It marks the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official has been convicted on criminal charges. Even though fellow Democrats quickly called on her to resign, the misdemeanor convictions don’t prevent McGuiness from holding public office, and she said she still plans to seek reelection in November. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of McGuiness’ daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness, who still works for the auditor’s office. Prosecutors alleged Saylar McGuiness, 20, was hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges, including access to a state vehicle and permission to work remotely while away at college in South Carolina, that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A truck hit a bicyclist and careened into a fireworks stand Saturday evening at an intersection in northeast Washington, killing the bicyclist and a man working in the stand, police said. No other injuries were reported. The accident at the corner of Minnesota Avenue and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue NE occurred about 5:30 p.m., the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. The adult male victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Assistant Police Chief Wilfredo Manlapaz said the driver of the truck apparently was suffering a medical emergency when the accident occurred and was being treated at a local hospital. The bicyclist was in the crosswalk when he was struck, Manlapaz said. A photograph posted online by the MPD showed a demolished stand amid scattered debris.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A person using a flamethrower set fire Saturday to a Pan-African flag flying on a pole outside the headquarters of the Uhuru Movement, a Black international socialist group based in Florida. Security video released by the group shows the driver of a white Honda sedan pulling up outside the group’s St. Petersburg headquarters, removing a flamethrower from the trunk and shooting a tower of fire at the flag flying about 30 feet above the ground. The group says the man stopped when a worker inside the building yelled at him. The video shows him putting the flamethrower back in the trunk and then driving away. A photo supplied by the group shows the flag with a large hole. St. Petersburg police said they were investigating the fire and working to identify a suspect. The Uhuru Movement is part of the African People’s Socialist Party, which says it is “uniting African people as one people for liberation, social justice, self-reliance and economic development.” Akile Anai, the group’s director of agitation and propaganda, said the attack is in the same vein as the May killing of 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. Police say the arrested suspect in the Buffalo massacre is a white nationalist. Akai said such attacks are caused by the decline of a “social system and facade of normalcy based on oppression, colonialism and exploitation.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A group of students want U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ name scrubbed from a building at the Savannah College of Art and Design. At the dedication of the building in 2010, Thomas praised his hometown’s hospitality. “You always long to go back to a place of comfort. The roots are here, and the roots are very, very deep here,” he said. The Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation is located in the former convent where Thomas spent his early years attending school. The university has removed the sign from the building but did not respond to emails asking for the reason. An online petition that had garnered more than 1,800 signatures by Sunday cites Thomas’ comments on the Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, in which the court repealed the constitutional right to abortion. Thomas indicated he would like to see a repeal of protections for gay marriage, access to contraception and privacy in the bedroom, calling the initial rulings that granted those rights “erroneous decisions.” He also has been accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, who testified against him during his 1991 confirmation hearings, and, more recently in 2016, by Alaska lawyer Moira Smith, who alleged that Thomas groped her in 1999.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: A Navy investigation released Thursday revealed that shoddy management and human error caused fuel to leak into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year, poisoning thousands of people and forcing military families to evacuate their homes for hotels. The investigation is the first detailed account of how jet fuel from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a massive World War II-era military-run tank farm in the hills above Pearl Harbor, leaked into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. Some 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms. After months of resistance, the military in April agreed to an order from the state of Hawaii to drain the tanks and close the Red Hill facility. A separate report the Defense Department provided to the state Department of Health on Thursday said December 2024 was the earliest it could defuel the tanks safely. The investigation report listed a cascading series of mistakes starting May 6, 2021, when operator error caused a pipe to rupture and 21,000 gallons of fuel to spill when fuel was being transferred between tanks. Most of that fuel spilled into a fire suppression line and sat there for six months, causing the line to sag. A cart rammed into this sagging line Nov. 20, releasing 20,000 gallons of fuel. The area where the cart hit the line isn’t supposed to have fuel, so the officials who responded to the spill didn’t have the right equipment to capture the liquid.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not clear whether a pair of laws from the early 1970s making it a felony to “knowingly aid” in an abortion or to publish information about how to induce one will be enforced alongside the state’s newer, near-total ban. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, lawyers in Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden’s office are going through all the state’s abortion statutes with a fine-toothed comb, said Wasden spokesman Scott Graf. When the Legislature passed a trigger law in 2020 that would automatically prohibit nearly all abortions 30 days after the fall of Roe, lawmakers took some steps to avoid conflicts by making it clear that the law would supersede other bans. Lawmakers put similar language in another ban passed earlier this year. But they may have overlooked a few clauses in the decades-old statutes. The 2020 trigger law says the person seeking the abortion can’t be charged with a crime, instead focusing prosecution efforts on the provider. That would seem to override a 1973 law that makes it a felony for a person to undergo an abortion, but it’s not clear if another portion of the older law making it a felony to knowingly aid in an abortion could still be enforceable. It will be up to individual county prosecutors, at first, to decide how to proceed, said Twin Falls County prosecutor Grant Loebs, who is also president of the Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association. From there, judges will figure it out. Ultimately, he expects legislators will have a lot of fine-tuning to do in the years ahead.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A yearlong suspension of the state’s sales tax on groceries began Friday. Illinois’ tax relief program will also postpone a gas tax increase until January and cut school supply taxes from 6.25% to 1.25% from Aug. 5 to 14. “Starting tomorrow, every Illinoisan will get tax relief on essentials: groceries, gas, your home, and back-to-school supplies, with even more tax relief going into effect next year,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a news release Thursday. The measures are part of a $1.8 billion state tax-break deal signed by Pritzker in April. GOP leaders derided the measures as a campaign tool for Pritzker and other Democrats in an election year. The plan also provides automatic $50 income tax rebates for individuals who made less than $200,000 in 2021, $100 for couples filing jointly who made less than $400,000, and $100 per dependent claimed in 2021, up to three. Additionally, the Illinois state earned income credit will increase from 18% to 20% of the federal credit, and eligible homeowners will receive property tax rebates equal to their 2021 property tax credit, up to $300. Illinois’ 1% sales tax on groceries will be suspended through June 30, 2023, which will net $400 million in consumer savings, the governor’s release said.\n\nIndiana\n\nJeffersonville: Police are investigating after more than 30 bodies, some decomposing, were found inside a southern Indiana funeral home. Police in the Louisville, Kentucky, suburb of Jeffersonville responded to Lankford Funeral Home and Family Center on Friday evening and found 31 bodies, including some “in the advanced stages of decomposition,” Maj. Isaac Parker said. He said the county coroner’s office had reported a strong odor emanating from the building. Inside, officers wearing hazmat gear found bodies “in different places around the building.” Some of the bodies had been at the funeral home since March, Parker said. Police also found the cremated remains of 16 people. “It was a very unpleasant scene,” Parker said. “The conditions were not good.” The owner of the funeral home has been speaking with police since Friday, Parker said, and an investigation is ongoing. The owner did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment Sunday. The remains were taken to the Clark County Coroner’s Office for identification, and police asked anyone who may have information to contact the coroner’s office.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a long-standing precedent that allowed landowners to sue for damages when a neighboring hog farm causes water pollution or odor problems that affect quality of life. The court concluded, 4-3, that a 2004 decision was wrong. The earlier ruling established that a portion of Iowa’s law providing immunity to livestock farms from neighbors’ nuisance lawsuits violated the inalienable rights clause of the Iowa Constitution. It also found neighbors could sue if they had lived in the area long before the farm began operating, had sustained significant hardship, and did not benefit from the nuisance immunity granted to the livestock farm. Justice Thomas Waterman wrote in the Thursday decision that “protecting and promoting livestock production is a legitimate state interest, and granting partial immunity from nuisance suits is a proper means to that end.” Iowa is the nation’s leading pork producer with 23 million pigs, most kept in large confinement buildings that collect nitrogen-rich manure from the animals and use it to fertilize fields. The court said judges must use a rational basis to review future court challenges – a standard that will be difficult to overcome because it presumes state laws are passed for the benefit of the public.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local government has agreed to pay $12.5 million to a man and his mother after he spent 23 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. The Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City approved the settlement Thursday and said in a statement Friday that it admits no guilt in the wrongful conviction of and two life sentences given to Lamonte McIntyre in the mid-1990s. McIntyre was 17 in 1994 when he was arrested in Kansas City for the shooting deaths of 21-year-old Doniel Quinn and 34-year-old Donald Ewing. McIntyre was freed in 2017 after a local prosecutor asked the court to vacate his convictions and drop all charges, calling his case an example of “manifest injustice.” Prosecutors presented no physical evidence tying McIntyre to the killings, and their case largely hinged on testimony that was allegedly coerced. The following year, McIntyre and his mother sued the unified government and former Kansas City police Detective Roger Golubski, whom they have accused, along with other police, of framing McIntyre for the killings. Their lawsuit sought up to $123 million in damages. McIntyre and his mother have said Golubski coerced her into sex and then framed her teenage son for the double homicide because she rejected the detective’s later sexual advances. They also allege that he abused dozens of Black women for years and that many officers were aware of his conduct. Federal authorities are investigating Golubski.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Court of Appeals rejected Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s effort to stop abortions in the state just two days after a court order allowed them to resume. Cameron is now asking the state Supreme Court to consider his case. In an order issued Saturday, appeals court Judge Glenn Acree denied Cameron’s appeal of a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by Jefferson Circuit Judge Mitch Perry. That means abortions may continue for now while a legal challenge to a state law banning almost all abortions in Kentucky continues before Perry. Cameron had argued that Perry erred in allowing abortions to resume in Kentucky and sought to have the restraining order blocked by the appeals court. Lawyers for Kentucky’s two abortion providers filed a response Friday, arguing procedural rules and case law bar lifting Perry’s restraining order. Cameron said in a brief statement Saturday he was “disappointed” with the decision, and on Sunday, he announced he had filed his request with the high court, saying his office is “exhausting every possible avenue.” Meanwhile, Perry has scheduled a hearing Wednesday on whether to grant an injunction, which would continue to block the law while the case proceeds.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: A former north Louisiana police officer pleaded guilty Friday to kicking a man in the face as he lay on the ground with his hands behind his back during an arrest in 2020, federal prosecutors said. Jared Desadier, 44, of Monroe, entered the plea before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Foote to a charge of deprivation of rights under color of law, U.S. Attorney Brandon B. Brown’s office said in a news release. At the time, Desadier was an officer with the Monroe Police Department. Authorities said he and other officers detained a man for questioning and found he was carrying drug paraphernalia. The man ran, and officers pursued him. Another officer caught up with the man and ordered him to the ground. The man complied, and as the officer prepared to handcuff him, Desadier ran up on them and kicked the man in the face, authorities said. Desadier admitted in court that his assault was without justification, as the man did not present a threat to any officer or other person on the scene, Brown’s office said. Desadier also admitted he knew his actions were unjustified and unreasonable under the circumstances. Desadier faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is set for Nov. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Children from 47 families using the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard’s child care center are being removed from the program due to a U.S. Department of Defense order. Shipyard families were notified June 17 that the Navy is reimplementing a priority child care program access policy, which puts children of active military members ahead of children of the Navy’s civilian employees. The policy was scheduled to take effect two years ago but was delayed by COVID-19. “In accordance with the Policy Change Concerning Priorities for Department of Defense Child Care Programs Memorandum, your child has been identified for supplanting to accommodate a higher priority family,” the families were told in a letter. Given 45 days to find alternative child care services, the last day will be Aug. 1 for children from the affected families using the shipyard’s Child Development Center. “Child care is a workforce issue that directly impacts the efficiency, readiness and retention of the total force,” said Jeremy Lambert, spokesperson for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. He said the “supplanting” policy prioritizes single and dual active military member households, active-duty service members with a spouse working full time, combat-related wounded warriors, and children of staff at the Child Development Center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: New restrictions on crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay will take effect this year after the blue crab count plummeted to its lowest level since surveys began in 1990. Tighter harvest limits are being issued as officials and industry leaders try to protect the iconic species and boost reproduction in the nation’s largest estuary. The Baltimore Sun reports Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources is issuing the first-ever limits on how many bushels of male blue crabs can be hauled in each day. Limits typically regulate the harvesting of female crabs to ensure that enough of them spawn. The new rules starting this month for Maryland limit the number of bushels that can be hauled in each day. The cuts will translate to about 15% to 25% of daily commercial harvest limits compared to the 2021 crabbing season, depending on the license. It’s unclear how much of an effect the new restrictions will have because watermen don’t hit their limits every day. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an independent conservation group, said the harvest limits are an encouraging step, but more needs to be done to address the likely causes behind the low crab count. Those include “poor water quality, loss of key habitat such as underwater grasses, and the proliferation of blue catfish and other invasive predators,” said Allison Colden, the foundation’s Maryland senior fisheries scientist.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Republican former state senator who’s running for Congress has been charged after allegedly stealing a gun from an elderly constituent and misleading investigators about what happened, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said Friday. Investigators said Dean Tran, 46, of Fitchburg, used his position as a public official to intimidate the constituent into parting with her late husband’s firearms, making her sign a pre-prepared contract and giving her $1,500 in cash for at least eight guns while visiting her in June 2019. When asked to return them the next day, Tran complied. But a day after he gave the guns back, he returned to the woman’s home, forced his way in and demanded a key to the gun safe, according to investigators. He then stole a Colt .45 while the constituent hid in her bedroom, investigators said. That gun was also later returned to the woman. Tran issued a statement Friday evening, calling the allegations “untrue and categorically false.” His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Investigators say Tran allegedly gave conflicting stories and reasons for taking the guns when interviewed by police, including denying any type of firearm sale, later producing a sales contract for the weapons, and disparaging the constituent’s mental capacity before demanding a written apology from her. Investigators also allege Tran made false statements on his May 2019 license-to-carry renewal application.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Elevated levels of arsenic have been found at seven sites where buildings were demolished in 2017-18 and filled with soil, The Detroit News reports. The results followed concerns raised by federal inspectors that 200 sites may have been filled with risky dirt. Tests show unsafe levels of arsenic at seven sites so far, and an eighth “did not fully meet quality standards,” the city said Thursday. Detroit ordered a contractor to replace soil at seven sites and test or replace soil at another 127 sites, according to the newspaper. “Whenever we become aware of a breach of contract instance, we require the contractor to address the situation at their own cost,” said Raymond Scott of the buildings department. Arsenic is a natural element found in water, air and soil. Chronic exposure can cause health problems. “Scientists, pediatricians, and public health professionals are concerned about subtle and long-range health effects of low-level exposures to arsenic in people,” according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Detroit said temporary fences would be installed around the sites.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: More households in the state are qualifying for a federal program that provides assistance with food at a time when inflation has caused grocery prices to rise. The Legislature, during its last session, increased the income limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from 165% of the federal poverty level to 200%. That means households of three making $3,600 a month or less are now able to receive food stamp benefits. Peter Woitock, a government relations specialist with Hunger Solutions, advocated for the change and said about 1,400 additional households in Minnesota will be eligible. He said many people were above the income level to qualify for SNAP, but they were still struggling to put food on the table. “We saw during the early part of the (coronavirus) pandemic a lot of policies that were put into place to help put food on the table for those who are struggling. But many of those policies and waivers were temporary,” Woitock said. Food shelf operators say visits to their pantries have risen 39% since January 2022, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Woitock said SNAP also contributes to the local economy. “I think in 2020, it served over 412,000 individuals, so that was about $780 million of federal funds that came into the state,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A look at how African Americans traveled during the Jim Crow era is on display at the Two Mississippi Museums. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a Smithsonian traveling exhibition, opened Saturday at the downtown venue, which is part of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, a Smithsonian affiliate. It includes artifacts from business signs and postcards to historic footage, images and firsthand accounts to convey not only the apprehension felt by Black travelers but also the resilience, innovation and elegance of people choosing to live a full American existence, officials said. Mississippi artifacts include items from the historic Riverside Hotel in Clarksdale and Hotel E.F. Young Jr. in Meridian. Two Mississippi Museums director Pamela D.C. Junior said she was ecstatic to have the exhibit housed at the venue. “During the Great Migration, families moved across the U.S.; thus, the necessity to travel and visit relatives was born,” Junior said. “Postal worker Victor Green innovatively responded to this need with a roadmap of havens to eat, rest and visit. This safety net was a key guide for people of color throughout the Jim Crow South and other parts of America.” The exhibition will run through Sept. 25 in the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Exhibition Hall at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A legislator has resigned her seat after being convicted of falsely claiming she was giving patients stem cell treatments for COVID-19. State Rep. Tricia Derges, R-Nixa, sent her resignation letter to Missouri House Speaker Rob Vescovo on Friday. She was convicted in June on 22 counts including wire fraud, illegal distribution of controlled substances and making false statements to investigators. Federal prosecutors argued she claimed nearly $900,000 in federal funding for COVID-19 treatments that weren’t performed or had already been performed. They also alleged she promoted amniotic fluid as a COVID-19 treatment and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. Her narcotics license was placed on probation for three years in January. At the time, she refused to resign her House seat but was stripped of her committee assignments and barred from party caucus meetings. The state GOP prohibited her from running for reelection as a Republican this fall. Her sentencing on the federal charges will be determined in the coming months, and the jury voted to allow the government to keep $300,000 in CARES Act money she received for her clinic’s COVID-19 testing that had already been reimbursed. Derges pushed in the Legislature to allow assistant physicians like herself a path to licensing.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: A Blackfeet researcher has received a $75,000 federal grant to run a yearlong study to train dogs to sniff out chronic wasting disease and toxic waste that might otherwise be ingested by people who hunt wild game and gather traditional plants. The project aims to protect tribal members’ health by letting them know where the disease has been detected and where toxic waste has been found to preserve safe spaces to conduct traditional practices, Kaiser Health News reports. Chronic wasting disease has been detected in just one white-tailed deer on the Blackfeet reservation, but once it’s present, it’s impossible to eradicate, according to wildlife managers. The disease is already forcing tribal members to alter or abandon some traditional practices, said Souta Calling Last, executive director of the nonprofit cultural and educational organization Indigenous Vision. And some families depend on meat from the deer, elk or moose they can hunt several months out of the year. That’s where the dogs come in for Calling Last’s study. Standing near a wetland full of cattails, she said the dogs trained by the nonprofit organization Working Dogs for Conservation will detect chronic wasting disease in deer and elk scat at such sites that serve as watering holes for herds. The dogs also will sniff out mink and otter scat so it can be tested for chemicals and contaminants in illegal dumpsites of old cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A special election that was the tightest race in decades in a GOP-dominated U.S. House district is boosting confidence among Democrats hoping to energize voters by tapping into public outrage over the U.S. Supreme Court’s abortion ruling. Republicans still won the open seat as expected last week, but the margin surprised even some Democrats who have grown accustomed to lopsided, morale-crushing defeats. Republican Mike Flood beat Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks with 53.2% of the vote in last Tuesday’s special election, according to unofficial results. Pansing Brooks received 46.8%, with less than 7,200 total votes separating the candidates. The win was the narrowest in decades in the Republican-heavy, mostly rural 1st Congressional District, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the House since 1964. The two were competing to replace disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican who routinely claimed at least 60% of the vote in his district before he was convicted in March on charges that he lied to FBI agents about an illegal campaign donation. He resigned shortly after a jury found him guilty and was sentenced to probation Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles. He began the process of filing an appeal Wednesday. Flood and Pansing Brooks will face each other again in November to determine who will serve a full term starting in January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sunken boat dating to World War II is the latest object to emerge from a shrinking reservoir that straddles Nevada and Arizona. The Higgins landing craft that has long been 185 feet below the surface is now nearly halfway out of the water at Lake Mead. The boat lies less than a mile from Lake Mead Marina and Hemenway Harbor. It was used to survey the Colorado River decades ago, sold to the marina and then sunk, according to dive tours company Las Vegas Scuba. Higgins Industries in New Orleans built several thousand landing craft between 1942 and 1945, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. About 1,500 “Higgins boats” were deployed at Normandy on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day. The boat is just the latest in a series of objects unearthed by declining water levels in Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the U.S., held back by the Hoover Dam. In May, two sets of human remains were found in the span of a week. Experts say climate change and drought have led to the lake dropping to its lowest level since it was full about 20 years ago. As both Lake Mead and Lake Powell drop, states in the West increasingly face cuts to their supply from the Colorado River. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said last month that the agency would take action to protect the system if the seven states in the Colorado River basin don’t quickly come up with a way to cut the use of up to 4 million acre-feet of water – more than Arizona and Nevada’s shares combined.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLittleton: Graffiti that was spray-painted on an anti-abortion pregnancy center is being investigated as a potential hate crime, police said. Someone spray-painted the words “fund abortion abort God” on the side of the Pathways Pregnancy Care Center last Tuesday, Littleton police said. The act happened days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave full leeway to ban abortion back to the states. Pathways is a Christian ministry founded in 1996 that offers programs and information about alternatives to abortion. Police said the people who work and volunteer at Pathways are concerned for their safety and are taking internal steps to increase their security.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s largest casino employer said Friday that a new contract it reached with a key union provides for “historic” raises. And the parent company of the city’s top-performing casino said the pact is “a good agreement for everyone.” Caesars Entertainment owns a third of Atlantic City’s nine casinos: Caesars, Harrah’s and Tropicana. It reached an agreement late Thursday night with Local 54 of the Unite Here union on a tentative deal to avoid a strike that had been threatened for the July Fourth weekend, traditionally one of the busiest times of the year for the casinos. The Borgata also reached a deal earlier Thursday. In a statement issued Friday, Caesars Entertainment said it has operated in Atlantic City for over 40 years “with an unwavering commitment to the community and its residents.” MGM Resorts International, which owns the Borgata, also praised the deal it reached with the union. Terms of the deal were not immediately released. But union President Bob McDevitt said Thursday night that the deal is “the best contract we’ve ever had.” The union said it was seeking “significant” wage increases in a new contract to help workers keep pace with rapidly rising prices for gasoline, food, rent and other expenses, as well as to compensate them for helping the casinos get through the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Renewed efforts are underway to investigate and possibly discipline two attorneys who helped the Donald Trump campaign challenge New Mexico’s 2020 presidential election results in the weeks prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. A group including former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez on Thursday asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and ensure an investigation in public view of the two attorneys who represented the Trump campaign for possible violations of standards of professional conduct. The complaint cites possible violations of conduct rules by New Mexico-based attorney Mark J. Caruso and another attorney, Michael Smith, who lists a Texas address and a Washington law license. The state’s chief disciplinary counsel and disciplinary board chairman previously determined in confidential proceedings that there was no violation of rules against frivolous litigation by Caruso and Smith. Caruso said by email that he was confident the Supreme Court would stand behind the previous finds, describing the accusations as “political claims by N.M. Democrat attorneys.” President Joe Biden won the 2020 vote in New Mexico by about 11 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 ballots. But the Trump campaign still filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in Albuquerque that sought to invalidate absentee ballots cast at drop boxes and halt the certification of New Mexico’s presidential electors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Legislators approved a sweeping overhaul Friday of the state’s handgun licensing rules, seeking to preserve some limits on firearms after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. The measure, signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul after passing both chambers by wide margins, is almost sure to draw more legal challenges from gun rights advocates who say the state is still putting too many restrictions on who can get guns and where they can carry them. Hochul, a Democrat, called the Democrat-controlled Legislature back to Albany to work on the law after last week’s high court ruling overturning the state’s long-standing licensing restrictions. Backers said the law, which takes effect Sept. 1, strikes the right balance between complying with the Supreme Court’s ruling and keeping weapons out of the hands of people likely to use them recklessly or with criminal intent. But some Republican lawmakers, opposed to tighter restrictions, argued the law violated the constitutional right to bear arms and predicted it too would end up being overturned. Among other things, the state’s new rules will require people applying for a handgun license to turn over a list of their social media accounts so officials could verify their “character and conduct.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly wrapped up its chief work session for the year Friday by finalizing proposed state budget adjustments for the new fiscal year, crossing off other must-do legislation but leaving some big policy matters unresolved or thwarted. The Republican-penned spending measure, which alters the second year of a two-year budget plan enacted last November, received strong bipartisan support again, as it did while securing initial House and Senate approval on Thursday. The bill would spend $27.9 billion for the new year that began Friday while setting aside several billion additional dollars in reserves and construction projects. It also contains additional pay increases for teachers and state employees, although they’re not as large as those sought by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who was reviewing the measure, a spokesperson said. He’ll have 10 days to decide whether to sign the bill into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. With more than 30 legislative Democrats voting for the measure, Cooper appears hard-pressed to have any veto he issues stick should GOP leaders attempt an override later this month. The House voted 82-25 and the Senate 36-8 for the measure with little debate Friday, approving it after Thursday’s more robust discussion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state’s attorney general has found the sale of more than 2,000 acres of prime farmland to a group tied to Bill Gates complies with a Depression-era law meant to protect family farms because the land is being leased back to farmers. Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley had inquired into the land sale and on Wednesday issued a letter saying the transaction complied with the archaic anti-corporate farming law. The law prohibits corporations or limited liability companies from owning farmland or ranchland, but it allows individual trusts to own the land if it is leased to farmers. The purchase of the land had raised legal questions, as well as concerns that ultra-rich landowners do not share the state’s values. Gates is considered the largest private owner of farmland in the country, with some 269,000 acres across dozens of states, Gates’ firm, Red River Trust, purchased $13.5 million worth of land in two counties from wealthy northeastern North Dakota potato growers Campbell Farms. In a curious move, the Campbell family in February filed a partnership name certificate with the North Dakota secretary of state naming their farming operation the Red River Trust – the same name as Gates’ firm. But an attorney for Gates’ firm wrote to the attorney general’s office that the Campbells registered the name without his knowledge.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A new law taking effect this fall will establish uniform rules for carrying knives across Ohio to prevent municipalities from enforcing local regulations, proponents say. The bill’s main sponsor, state Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, said varying regulations create a confusing patchwork of laws that are tough to follow and enforce. Her legislation restricts local regulations on knife-carrying but doesn’t change the types of knives the state allows people to carry. In committee hearings, Democrats questioned the need for the mostly Republican-backed bill. Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron, asked whether a change in law was necessary if no data exists to show the patchwork of knife regulations is a problem in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill in June. It takes effect in mid-September. Similar legislation was passed in Arizona in 2010 and has since been passed in at least 10 states, Roegner said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday set execution dates for six death row inmates, just hours before an attorney filed a motion for a rehearing in one case. Execution dates for James Coddington, Richard Glossip, Benjamin Cole, Richard Fairchild, John Hanson and Scott Eizember were scheduled, starting Aug. 25 with Coddington and followed on Sept. 22 with Glossip. Glossip, whose first conviction and death sentence were overturned, was hours from being executed in September 2015 following a second conviction and death sentence when prison officials realized they had received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used previously to execute an inmate, and executions in the state were put on hold. Executions in Oklahoma resumed in October with John Grant, who convulsed on the gurney and vomited before being declared dead. Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, later Friday filed for a new hearing based on an investigation by a Houston law firm that contends Glossip is innocent. The report by the law firm Reed Smith alleges that evidence was lost or destroyed and that a detective improperly asked leading questions to co-defendant Justin Sneed to implicate Glossip in the slaying of Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where Glossip worked.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Fender’s blue butterflies are only found in the Willamette Valley, living in prairie meadows among the Kinkaid’s lupine. But their numbers have shrunk as their habitat has disappeared. Environmentalists and federal officials are trying to change that. One of the largest known populations of the butterfly exists in the Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge, in Polk County west of Salem. In 2020, the Trust for Public Land secured 183 acres adjacent to the refuge to protect the habitat for the butterfly. Now, a secluded area of woods and prairie southeast of Brownsville is being targeted for a habitat restoration project by the Bureau of Land Management, which could include cutting down conifers in a commercial timber sale to protect its Fender’s blue butterfly population. BLM is seeking the public’s input on the tentative project through July 13. Over the years, conifer trees have encroached on the prairie meadows of the Oak Basin Prairies, reducing them by at least 20% since 1875. BLM now is stepping in with the goal of protecting both the butterflies and their host plant, Kincaid’s lupine, which is federally threatened. Cutting down the trees would in turn expand meadows for butterflies and reduce competition for oak trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state court on Thursday permanently blocked Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to toll as many as nine major bridges on interstates in Pennsylvania, siding with three Pittsburgh-area municipalities that argued his administration had violated procedures in getting to the advanced stage of considering the idea. A panel of Commonwealth Court judges granted the municipalities’ request to effectively declare the plan dead because Wolf’s Department of Transportation had not followed the law. One key element on which the court agreed with the municipalities is the claim that PennDOT was required to propose specific bridges to toll when it asked the Public-Private Transportation Partnership Board in 2020 for permission to move forward with a bridge-tolling plan. PennDOT did not, however, identify specific bridges it wanted to toll until months after the board approved a bridge-tolling plan. As a result, parties potentially affected by a tolling project, such as municipalities, had no opportunity to meaningfully give input to the process before the board’s decision, the court said. Republican lawmakers hailed the decision, while Wolf’s administration would not immediately say whether it would appeal it to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The loss for Wolf’s administration was the second in a row: A Commonwealth Court judge in a separate case in May had imposed a temporary injunction on the tolling projects.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJohnston: In a town where politics is often a family affair, the Democratic primary for state House District 42 could wind up looking more like a family feud. Dennis Cardillo Jr. has filed to run against his uncle Edward T. Cardillo Jr., who currently holds the seat. A second challenger, Kelsey Coletta, is the daughter of another lawmaker from the opposite side of the state, Rep. John “Jay” Edwards, D-Tiverton. The younger Cardillo, who oversees the night shift at a Pepsi-Cola plant, said he’s more educated than his uncle and wasn’t expecting him to seek reelection. The elder Cardillo, a former mechanic, did not respond to interview requests. Coletta – a social worker who said she’d be a more active representative than the incumbent – has her own unique family dynamic. She’s advocated at the State House for liberal causes such as reproductive rights and a less punitive approach to addiction, while her father tends to be slightly more conservative. Over time, she’s been able to inform his views on some issues, she said. Dennis Cardillo Jr. didn’t cite any specific disagreements with his father’s brother, who has typically been aligned with the conservative faction of the Rhode Island Democratic Party. “I don’t believe in talking badly about someone, but there is a difference in education level,” said the younger Cardillo, who has a bachelor’s in business administration from the University of Rhode Island. “I believe his highest level is just a high school diploma.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A cache of civil rights-era items with a local provenance has finally returned to the city, part of the holdings of the College of Charleston’s Avery Research Center thanks to a donation from the Merrill C. Berman Collection. Avery staff plan to mount an exhibition in 2023 contextualizing and interpreting the materials for public consumption, The Post and Courier reports. The collection includes the original tape of a Martin Luther King Jr. speech delivered July 30, 1967, at Charleston County Hall, as well as a recording surreptitiously made of a Ku Klux Klan rally the night before King’s appearance. It also contains audio of Ralph Abernathy’s lengthy speech of April 1, 1969, delivered during the Charleston Hospital Workers Strike. The items had belonged to Columbia-based journalist Eugene Sloan, who covered the events and made the recordings when he worked for The State newspaper. Avery Director Tamara Butler said the collection will help her team update a narrative that has long portrayed Charleston as a relatively mild-mannered place that saw far less confrontation and violence than cities such as Birmingham or Montgomery in Alabama. There’s a reason King came to Charleston in 1967, she said, with groundwork laid by local activists over many years in one of the freedom movement’s essential hubs. Butler wants to use the new gift and the history it represents as a tool to find related testimonies of racial resistance and rebellion.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she has applied for permission to hold a fireworks show at Mount Rushmore to celebrate Independence Day 2023, persisting even though the National Park Service has denied her requests for the past two years. In 2020, a fireworks display, featuring a fiery speech from then-President Donald Trump, was held at the monument after a decadelong hiatus. The Park Service has cited environmental concerns and objections from Native American tribes in denying subsequent permit applications. A federal judge last year rebuffed the Republican governor’s lawsuit that sought to force the Park Service to allow her to shoot fireworks over the granite monument. Noem has appealed that decision. “As Americans all across our great country make preparations to celebrate their Independence Day, we have once again been denied the opportunity to celebrate at our nation’s enduring symbol of freedom, Mount Rushmore National Memorial,” the governor said in a statement last week. The Department of Interior declined to comment on Noem’s application. Noem is running for reelection and is widely considered to be a potential Republican contender for the 2024 White House ticket. She often cites 2020’s fireworks celebration, when she shared the stage with Trump, as a highlight of her first term.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Nashville civil rights veteran Diane Nash, who led sit-ins, coordinated freedom rides and was jailed while pregnant for teaching minors nonviolent protest tactics, will be honored with a Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press office announced that Nash, and 16 others will receive the prestigious award Thursday. Famed Alabama civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, who attended school in Nashville and later led some of the most pivotal legal cases of the civil rights movement, will also receive the honor. The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, reserved for those who have made significant contributions to the “prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,” the White House said. Nash, born in Chicago, moved to Nashville when she transferred to Fisk University in 1959. Incensed by the overt racism she saw, Nash joined the Rev. James Lawson’s nonviolence workshops, where participants role-played as demonstrators and attackers to ready themselves for all possibilities. Nash was elected chairperson of the Nashville movement, and she and the Student Central Committee staged sit-ins at lunch counters across the city. The city’s lunch counters were the first in the South to desegregate.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An inmate who is set to be put to death in less than two weeks asked that his execution be delayed so he can donate a kidney. Ramiro Gonzales is scheduled to receive a lethal injection July 13 for fatally shooting 18-year-old Bridget Townsend, a southwest Texas woman whose remains were found nearly two years after she vanished in 2001. In a letter sent Wednesday, Gonzales’ lawyers, Thea Posel and Raoul Schonemann, asked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to grant a 30-day reprieve so the inmate can be considered a living donor “to someone who is in urgent need of a kidney transplant.” They included a letter from Cantor Michael Zoosman, an ordained Jewish clergyman from Maryland who has been corresponding with Gonzales. “There has been no doubt in my mind that Ramiro’s desire to be an altruistic kidney donor is not motivated by a last-minute attempt to stop or delay his execution. I will go to my grave believing in my heart that this is something that Ramiro wants to do to help make his soul right with his God,” Zoosman wrote. Gonzales’ attorneys say he’s been determined an “excellent candidate” for donation after being evaluated by the transplant team at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. His rare blood type means his donation could benefit someone who might have difficulty finding a match.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Managers of the Switchpoint Community Resource Center held a ribbon-cutting and hosted tours Thursday to celebrate the first harvest of the center’s new RISE Garden, a grant-funded venture that endeavors to grow fresh food in a water-efficient way for southern Utah residents. Not only does the RISE Garden provide for those using Switchpoint services, but 80% of the harvest also goes toward the Southern Utah community each week, according to Linda Stay, Switchpoint’s development director. St. George Mayor Michele Randall and City Councilwoman Danielle Larkin made appearances at the ceremony and were among the first to purchase greens and goods from RISE Garden. “Switchpoint is the model for the entire state of Utah – and I think the country – and we are mentioned all the time, over and over and over again, for the great things we’re doing,” Randall said. Switchpoint uses towers that reuse water in order to take a more water-conservative approach to gardening. Subscriptions will be made available for those who want to make weekly pickups. According to the Switchpoint website, the garden uses aeroponic or vertical farming, and the RISE Garden saves 95% more space and water with no pesticides or genetically modified seeds.\n\nVermont\n\nPlymouth: The community of Plymouth Notch – birthplace of Calvin Coolidge, the only U.S. president born on the Fourth of July – commemorated his 150th birthday this holiday weekend. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site in Plymouth Notch hosted the celebration of Coolidge’s 150th birthday Monday, with a Vermont National Guard delegation leading a march to the Plymouth Notch Cemetery, where a birthday wreath from the White House was placed at Coolidge’s gravesite. “Calvin Coolidge preferred understated events, but the celebration of what would have been his 150th birthday, on the 246th birthday of our great nation, deserves some pomp and circumstance,” Vermont State Historic Preservation Officer Laura Trieschmann said in a news release. The Coolidge Cup, a national invitational speech and debate tournament sponsored by the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, also brought competitors to town for the weekend to compete for more than $15,000 in scholarship money. Coolidge served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929, elevated from the vice presidency after Warren Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack. Coolidge, a Republican, then won the 1924 election. The President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site includes his boyhood home, the homes of relatives and family friends, his family’s cheese factory, and his father’s store, which was used as the Summer White House in 1924.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: As American citizens celebrated freedom and liberty in their nation on Independence Day in 1961, a government founded on notions of the inalienable human rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness took action at a local level to deny those rights to their fellow citizens whose skin was not white. This little-taught chapter of local history is being brought to life in an original play, “Buried Deep,” produced through Endstation Theatre Company, affiliated with Randolph College. On that sweltering July day in Lynchburg, as many residents sought the relief offered by public pools, the city closed those pools down because some Black residents went to swim in the whites-only pools at Miller and Riverside parks. They were exercising their civil rights and making intentional strides toward integration and equality when many people were content to drag their feet despite a federal court’s recent ruling that mandated desegregation nationwide. Today, if one visits Riverside Park, an indentation in the ground where a pool once stood remains as a permanent scar of racial tensions in the not-so-distant past. “Buried Deep” is part of Endstation’s New Works initiative, a program that supports playwrights who create a script based on some aspect of Lynchburg-area history.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A nonprofit land trust has made its largest purchase ever to conserve 175 acres of forest and 3,500 feet of nearly pristine shoreline. Staff at the Whidbey Camano Land Trust said they knew they had to act quickly when a 226-acre beachfront property south of Coupeville came on the market last December. From the water, boaters may have seen the red house, old windmill, and cattle grazing atop the bluffs. The property near Keystone is home to one of the oldest farms on Whidbey Island. It also features a large forest and long stretch of beach. The site was at risk of being sold and developed into 22 high-end homes, according to the land trust. In late April, the land trust bought the property for $9.1 million, the most expensive purchase in the nonprofit’s nearly four-decade history. “We don’t get many opportunities to protect a chunk of habitat that size,” conservation director Ryan Elting told the Everett Herald. With the new property, called the Keystone Preserve, the trust will focus on habitat improvement and marine restoration. There are also plans to open public beach access as soon as 2024, as well as a trail network. The land trust has partnered with the Organic Farm School to manage the site. The nonprofit school on Whidbey Island will oversee the 50 acres of prairie and farm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hershel W. “Woody” Williams, the last remaining Medal of Honor recipient from World War II, will lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday. “Woody Williams embodied the best of America: living a life of duty, honor and courage,” Pelosi said in a joint statement. Schumer called Williams “an American hero who embodied the best of our country and the greatest generation.” Williams, who died Wednesday at 98, was a legend in his home state for his heroics under fire over several crucial hours at the battle for Iwo Jima. As a young Marine corporal, Williams went ahead of his unit in February 1945 and eliminated a series of Japanese machine gun positions. Facing small-arms fire, Williams fought for four hours, repeatedly returning to prepare demolition charges and obtain flamethrowers. Later that year, the 22-year-old Williams received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman. The Medal of Honor is the nation’s highest award for military valor. In remarks at a memorial Sunday in Charleston, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said Williams “never quit giving back.” That included raising money for gold star families – immediate family members of fallen service members – with an annual motorcycle ride. “It’s raised hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Manchin said. He joked that “it’s not going to be stopping, because Woody would come after me in a heartbeat.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: In four years, the city will lose its claim to having the world’s tallest free-flying American flag. The Acuity Insurance flagpole – the “World’s Tallest Symbol of Freedom” – stands 400 feet high. On July 4, 2026, the Flagpole of Freedom Park near Maine’s southeast coast is proposing to erect a flagpole larger than the Empire State Building. As the site is on a hill 315 feet tall, the 1,461-foot-high flagpole will reach 1,776 feet above sea level, which Flagpole of Freedom Park spokesperson Sarah Martin said pays homage to the year the United States declared independence. Although the Wisconsin flagpole will lose its distinction in the coming years, Acuity Communications Manager Paul Miller said it will still be a landmark. “The flagpole is one of the most visible landmarks on the Interstate 43 corridor and welcomes people to the Sheboygan community,” he said. “Many people stop to visit the flagpole, which is seen by drivers and passengers in over 50,000 vehicles that pass by our headquarters every day.” In addition to the flagpole, Acuity has a veterans memorial. There are 766 pavers with names of Sheboygan County residents who passed away serving in the line of duty in conflicts dating back to the Civil War. Miller said Acuity has no plans to increase the height of its flagpole because notching a record wasn’t the goal for building it.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Capitol insurrection dominated Thursday’s debate among U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney and her four Republican primary challengers, with Cheney pressing her Donald Trump-backed opponent on whether she agreed with the ex-president’s claim that widespread fraud cost him reelection. Harriet Hageman said there were “serious concerns” about the 2020 election but stopped short of repeating Trump’s false claim that drove thousands of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Even so, Hageman was dismissive of the U.S. House commission vice-chaired by Cheney that has been investigating the insurrection and events leading up to it. “They’re focusing on something that happened 18 months ago. They’re not focused on things that are important to the people of Wyoming,” said Hageman, a Cheyenne ranching and natural resources attorney. Republicans, she said, were being punished for “exercising their First Amendment rights” – a remark on which Cheney pounced as suggesting the insurrection was justified. Cheney’s role as one of just two Republicans on the Jan. 6 panel has stirred a backlash in deep-red Wyoming. The state GOP last year censured Cheney and voted to no longer recognize her as a Republican. “I will not violate my oath of office, and if you’re looking for someone who will, you need to vote for someone else on this stage,” she said during Thursday’s debate.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}]}

A consent decree with school officials in the east Alabama county, located on the Georgia line, the government and attorneys with the Legal Defense Fund includes construction of a new school and more opportunities for Black students in the county of roughly 35,000 people, officials said. The agreement was announced Friday to end a desegregation order that’s been in place since 1970. It followed a previous, interim agreement reached in 1993. “We are pleased to arrive at a consent decree that addresses the many concerns our clients raised as key to ensuring the effectiveness of the desegregation process in Chambers County,” said GeDá Jones Herbert, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund. “It was particularly important that Black students in the district are afforded equal and high-quality educational opportunities in safe and modern facilities.” Before the end of the next school year, the district must pick a site to build a new, consolidated high school to replace LaFayette High School, which is heavily Black, and Valley High School, which has a large population of white students.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state had about 6,700 more jobs last month than a year earlier, but jobs in most sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the state labor department reported Friday. There were about 11,800 fewer jobs in April than in April 2019, the year before the pandemic, the department said. The biggest year-over-year gain was in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had about 3,900 more jobs last month than in April 2021. The transportation, trade and utilities sector had about 1,400 more jobs than the prior year, and there were about 500 more jobs in oil and gas. But job numbers in most sectors lag levels reported in April 2019, the department said. The education and health sector had 100 more jobs last month than in April 2019. But there were 1,700 fewer jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, 1,100 fewer in leisure and hospitality, and 2,700 fewer in oil and gas last month than in April 2019. Karinne Wiebold, an economist with the department, said recently that Alaska began seeing year-over-year growth in total employment in April 2021, a year after the “initial employment shock” from the pandemic hit. She said high oil prices could encourage more employment in the oil and gas sector but said it’s unclear if the sector will reach its past highs. She noted that job gains in that sector have so far been slow.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: The city has preemptively adopted new rules regulating short-term rental properties before it welcomes a bevy of visitors for the 2023 Super Bowl. Ordinances approved by the Glendale City Council on May 10 amend the city’s codes on short-term rentals and nuisance parties. Owners of homes rented out for brief vacations must now provide contact information to the city in case law enforcement needs to reach them for an emergency or disturbance. Glendale’s ordinance additionally prohibits short-term rental properties from being used for operating as a retail enterprise or an adult-oriented business. Because Glendale currently doesn’t have a registry of short-term rental homes, local leaders say it’s difficult to know how much of a nuisance these properties are creating in the community, 12News reports. “It is possible that officers are responding to noise complaints at short-term rentals and just don’t know they are short-term rentals,” Deputy City Manager Rick St. John said during a council meeting. In another ordinance, Glendale’s police officers have the ability to assess fees to individuals hosting “nuisance parties,” or any social gathering that “constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The barrage of television ads and mailers leading up to Tuesday’s primary election makes the most influential Republicans in the state clear. Tom Cotton’s making the case for fellow U.S. Sen. John Boozman, talking up his conservative bona fides while the two-term senator fends off challenges from the right. Donald Trump’s image appears in ads for Boozman and for Sarah Sanders, who served as the ex-president’s White House press secretary and is now running for governor. Sanders, whose endorsement is almost as sought after as Trump’s, is helping make the closing argument for Boozman in a TV ad. But conspicuously missing from the ads and the campaign trail is the state’s top elected Republican, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is entering the final stretch of his term with strong approval ratings and a raised national profile. Hutchinson’s advisers say he’s concentrating on helping more Republicans nationally as he looks to the future – which might include a White House bid. Sanders has avoided publicly criticizing Hutchinson, even when her former boss labeled the outgoing governor a “RINO” – Republican in Name Only – for his decision to veto an anti-transgender law. Sanders said she would have signed the measure, which bans gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: New rules about how and when actors can use guns while filming failed to pass the Legislature on Thursday, just months after a gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding went off and killed a cinematographer on a movie set in New Mexico. Democrats in California had filed two bills in response to the tragedy, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza. With competing proposals, Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the author of one of the proposals, said he “strongly urged” entertainment industry groups to “work collaboratively to bring forward a consensus approach.” But no one did. On Thursday, Portantino decided to hold both bills in committee, meaning they are unlikely to pass the Legislature this year. “It’s a powerful and ruthless industry. First the industry killed Halyna. Then they killed the bill that would’ve made people like her safe,” said state Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat who authored the other proposal. Cortese’s bill would have banned the use of guns and blank ammunition containing gunpowder or other explosive charges from film sets, with some exceptions. Portantino’s bill would have allowed guns with blank ammunition on set, but only under the supervision of an armorer who has completed a state gun safety course.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A late spring snowstorm dumped several inches in the Denver metro area Saturday and knocked out electricity for about 210,000 customers, officials said. The wet snow weighed down tree branches and sent them toppling onto power lines, the television station KUSA reports. Much more snow fell in mountainous regions of Colorado. By Saturday night, power had been restored to 160,000 customers, but about 50,000 still did not have it back, the Xcel Energy Colorado utility said in a statement. The small Colorado community of Cripple Creek near the base of Pike’s Peak got 20 inches of snow, KUSA reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Eligible families can begin applying next month for the new one-year child tax rebate program that’s included in the newly revised state budget, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. Rebates of up to $250 per child are expected to be issued in late August. The rebates will be provided for up to three children per family. While any Connecticut resident who claimed at least one dependent child under the age of 18 on their 2021 federal income tax return may be eligible for the rebate, the amounts are dictated by income. To receive the maximum amount, the income threshold is $100,000 or less for those single or married filing separately; $169,000 or less for those filing as head of household; and $200,000 for those married filing jointly. Those with higher incomes may be eligible to receive a reduced rebate. The Department of Revenue Services will accept applications from June 1 through July 31. Families can apply online on the DRS website and click on the “2022 CT Child Tax Rebate” icon. DRS is reaching out about the program to more than 300,000 households in the state that may meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report by Amtrak’s inspector general found that the train service’s $41 million purchase of an office building in the city has failed to provide savings that were projected. Amtrak estimated it would save close to $50 million by consolidating operations in the building that it purchased in Wilmington in May 2020. But a report filed May 13 by Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General found those savings haven’t materialized for a variety of reasons. Dispatching and police communications were supposed to be consolidated in the building, but that has not occurred because Amtrak has not yet been able to determine if the building can accommodate a large generator necessary to provide emergency power. In addition, Amtrak has been unable to move forward with a plan to move more than 400 information-technology workers to Wilmington. The report found that so many workers would refuse the transfer that operations would be unacceptably disrupted. Amtrak now estimates it won’t need as much space in the building as originally thought.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A moment of happiness and celebration at the Lincoln Memorial turned into a headache for workers with the National Park Service, WUSA-TV reports. The Lincoln Memorial was temporarily closed to the public Saturday morning after celebrating university graduates reportedly left a mess on the steps of the monument, a National Park Service official said. NPS tweeted a photo of the closure Saturday, claiming the graduation celebration left broken bottles, spilled wine and champagne covering the steps of the national monument. “We will reopen as soon as the area has been cleaned and made safe,” NPS said on Twitter. Facilities staff members worked through the morning and were able to clean the mess within a few hours. The Lincoln Memorial reopened about 11:30 a.m. NPS did not say from which school the celebrating graduates hailed, but many online theorize the students could be from Georgetown University. A spokesperson for the school called the incident “concerning and disappointing.” The spokesperson noted that Georgetown was one of many universities having ceremonies over the weekend and said it no university-sponsored events at or around the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: A billionaire developer from Dubai is set to purchase the site of a South Florida condominium that collapsed last June, killing 98 people, for $120 million after no other bids were submitted by the Friday evening deadline for this week’s auction. Michael Fay, of Avison Young, said hundreds of potential buyers had shown interest in the property, but none were ultimately prepared to match the strong initial bid of Hussain Sajwani, of DAMAC Properties. Avison Young is the commercial real estate firm that was appointed to market the land as part of a class-action lawsuit. The auction for the 1.8-acre parcel in Surfside was scheduled for Tuesday. Earlier this month, families of the victims reached a $997 million settlement with local officials, the developers of an adjacent building and others whom they hold responsible for the collapse of the 40-year-old, 12-story beachside building during the early hours of June 24. Most of the Champlain Towers South collapsed suddenly about 1:20 a.m. last June 24 as most of its residents slept. Only three people survived the initial collapse. No other survivors were found despite the around-the-clock efforts of rescuers who dug through a 40-foot pile of rubble for two weeks. Another three dozen people were in the portion of the building that remained standing.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWatkinsville: Two Republican front-runners hoping to clinch primary majorities made their final pitches to voters Saturday ahead of Tuesday’s election. Gov. Brian Kemp and former football star Herschel Walker hope to win GOP nominations for governor and U.S. senator Tuesday without runoffs, with polls showing both men backed by more than 50% of voters. Kemp met voters at a rally in Watkinsville, near his home in Athens, with Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts showing up to support him. Walker spoke to Republicans in Columbus, having moved into a more public campaign phase in recent days despite continued questions about his past. Walker has been accused of threatening his ex-wife’s life, exaggerating his business record and lying about graduating from the University of Georgia. An Associated Press story Saturday found that Walker was actually a paid spokesman for a for-profit veterans program that Walker has described as a way he helps veterans. Walker’s speech focused on his life story and general attacks on Democratic policies. “It is time that we get back to where we started,” Walker said, arguing that Democrats have strayed from American values. Other candidates making final pitches include former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, Kemp’s top rival for the Republican nomination, and state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and Navy veteran and former banker Latham Saddler, Walker’s rivals for the Senate seat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Board of Education has selected the former principal of Waipahu High School to be the next superintendent of the state’s public schools. The board voted 8-1 Thursday to select Keith Hayashi, who has been interim superintendent since August. At Waipahu High School, Hayashi pioneered the Early College program, which allows high school students to take college classes through a partnership with the University of Hawaii. College professors teach the classes on high school campuses for which students receive both high school and college credit. The program is now available at 36 high schools across the state. The board’s chairperson, Catherine Payne, said the board was looking for a candidate who could heal the school system, bring the community and stakeholders together, and transition schools out of the pandemic. “His work at Waipahu High School has really touched a lot of students who were struggling and helped them to move forward into successful lives,” Payne said. “So looking at how that might be able to be applied throughout our system is really important.” Hayashi’s appointment will take effect July 1. Payne said his salary and other contract details will be negotiated. The state Legislature has set a maximum salary of $250,000 a year for the job.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s unemployment rate in April dropped a tenth of a percent to 2.6% to mark a third consecutive month of historic lows since record-keeping started in 1976, state officials said Friday. The Idaho Department of Labor said 913,000 workers have jobs, while about 24,000 are looking for work, as Idaho’s red-hot economy continues. The state’s labor force of 937,000 in April represents a labor force participation rate of 62.1%, an increase of a tenth of a percent over the previous month. Idaho’s peak participation rate was 71.4% in September 1998. The labor force participation rate is calculated from those 16 years and older working or looking for work. The Labor Department said there are more than two jobs available for every unemployed Idaho resident looking for work. Idaho’s nonfarm jobs exceeded expectations with an increase of 3,000 jobs to 815,500 in April. Industry sectors showing the most gains include natural resources, wholesale trade, professional and business services, and private educational services. Those showing greatest job declines include arts, entertainment and recreation, and information. Idaho’s unemployment rate continues to run below the national unemployment rate, which was 3.6% in April.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An officer who shot and seriously wounded a 13-year-old boy who ran away after being pulled over while driving a stolen vehicle was relieved of his police powers Friday, officials said. “He’s still an active member of the Chicago Police Department,” police spokesman Don Terry told the Chicago Tribune about the officer, whose name hasn’t been released. “He’s not going to be patrolling the streets, and he won’t be able to arrest people.” The action means the officer will still get paid but will be assigned to “desk duty,” Terry said. The officer had already been placed on administrative duties while the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigates the shooting. Police Superintendent David Brown said Thursday that the fleeing teenager turned toward the officer during Wednesday’s encounter before the officer fired on him. No shots were fired at the officer, Brown said. The boy jumped from the car as officers approached the vehicle, which police said was stolen Monday and used in a carjacking Tuesday. The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital, Brown said Thursday. He did not elaborate, and no charges have been announced. No weapon was found at the scene, COPA said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democrats and activists are holding out little hope of getting the votes needed to uphold the governor’s veto of a bill banning transgender athletes from competing in school sports. The Republican-dominated Legislature is slated to override the veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, who said in March that the legislation doesn’t provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports.” But the bill passed by wide margins, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate pledged to override Holcomb’s veto with simple majorities. Although two Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate voted against the measure, Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis said the override will likely be successful when the Legislature reconvenes for one day Tuesday. “This bill was filed, I believe, with the intention to specifically go after transgender Hoosiers because it was a politically savvy thing to do for the Republican base,” Ford said Friday. Still, Ford said Democrats continue to have conversations with lawmakers across the aisle, noting that some Republicans might be inclined to change their votes following the primary and the governor’s veto.\n\nIowa\n\nBettendorf: Students are once again attending class in the 1873 Forest Grove School. After raising about $200,000 over seven years to restore the falling-down, one-room school, supporters have opened the building for free “reenactments” of a typical student day. A schoolmarm teaches subjects and skills as they might have been taught during the 1920s, the time period to which the school was restored. Iowa once had 12,000 to 14,000 one-room school houses, depending on the report consulted, but with either number, Iowa had more than any other state in the nation. Supporters of Forest Grove preservation efforts want Forest Grove to be used to interpret and teach the role these schools played in the state’s history, Sharon Andresen, project coordinator for the nonprofit group, told the Quad-City Times. Because of legislation requiring consolidation of schools, Iowa’s last one-room school closed in 1967; Forest Grove closed 10 years earlier in 1957. Half- or full-day reenactments are open to any public, private or homeschool classes in the Quad City area. Fourth grade is a good target level, but Diane Borcherding, a retired Bettendorf High School biology teacher who is volunteering her time as the schoolmarm, is open to other grades, depending on the circumstances.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Supreme Court on Friday disbarred former prosecutor Jacqie Spradling for her conduct during a double-murder trial in Topeka in 2012. The court said while Spradling was a prosecutor in Shawnee County, she engaged in “repeated patterns of misconduct” during the trial of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of killing her husband and his fiance. Chandler’s convictions were later overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct. She is scheduled for a new trial later this year. The Supreme Court said Spradling ignored a court order, made arguments not supported by evidence, lied in her briefs and oral arguments, and made false statements during a disciplinary investigation. The Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys recommended in June 2021 that Spradling be disbarred for her “win at all costs” attitude in the Chandler case and in the 2017 conviction of Jacob Ewing, of Holton, on rape and sodomy charges. The state Supreme Court found Spradling did not violate ethical standards in Ewing’s case. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed Ewing’s conviction in 2018, but he later accepted a plea deal. Last year, Spradling resigned from her position as assistant county attorney in Allen County and as county attorney in Bourbon County.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Katy Perry earned her zookeeper stripes at the Louisville Zoo on Saturday. Zoo staff welcomed the pop music icon with an up-close encounter featuring the zoo’s own superstars, Simon, a black-footed penguin, and Sebastian the sloth. The “Roar” singer has been staying in Kentucky recently with her daughter, Daisy Dove, while fiancé Orlando Bloom shoots his new movie, “Red Right Hand.” Production on that film is expected to wrap up in June. At the zoo, Perry was “Walking on Air” through Wild Lights, a lantern festival featuring 50,000 LED lights. She also posed like a penguin next to Simon and admired the hang-ten skills of Sebastian the sloth, who “truly connected” with Perry, according to a post on the zoo sloths’ Twitter page. The Louisville Zoo features over 1,200 animals in exhibits with themes from all over the world, including Africa, home to Simon and other African penguins, as well as Australia and South America, where the sloths hang out. Earlier this month, Chelsea Handler hosted Perry on her podcast, “Dear Chelsea,” to chat about Perry’s stay in the Bluegrass State. “I’m like, living in Kentucky, and I have for almost a month now. And that’s quite an amazing experience because it reminds you that Hollywood is not America,” Perry said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has agreed to remove the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of shots students are required to get to enroll in school, officials said. The state health department said in a news release Wednesday that it will continue to strongly recommend the vaccine, in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, but acknowledged that the vaccine had not yet received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for those under age 16. “While we strongly recommend all eligible children be vaccinated against COVID-19 now, if they have not already been so, we are making this decision to give families and schools the time they need to prepare accordingly,” the news release said. Because the vaccine is not fully approved for those age 15 and under, requiring it would have made little difference to most students in kindergarten through high school, Edwards noted during his monthly call-in radio show. State Sen. Fred Mills, R-New Iberia, announced on the Senate floor that the administration agreed to remove the requirement after meeting with legislators. Legislation that would have removed the COVID-19 vaccine from the requirement list had stalled earlier in the session.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A teacher whose LGBTQ lesson plan for kindergartners was removed from a state website said Friday that the governor and education department succumbed to outside pressure. The governor and department “caved to pressure instead of standing up for some of the most vulnerable people, families, and students in Maine,” Kailina Mills wrote in a social media post. The lesson plan was at the heart of a Republican attack ad that accused Democratic Gov. Janet Mills of spending $2.8 million to create “radical school lessons” aimed at kindergartners. On the video, the teacher discusses “Freedom Holidays” like the Fourth of July, Juneteenth and Women’s Equality Day before discussing freedoms won by the LGBTQ community, including same-sex marriage. She talks about sexual identities under the umbrella of “LGBT+” in the discussion. The governor previously said she agreed with the Department of Education’s review that concluded the lesson wasn’t age-appropriate. Kailina Mills disagreed with that assessment, citing a study that showed gender identities are solidified between ages 5 and 7. She wrote Friday that she’s taught preschoolers who are transgender and nonbinary and said that “those children and those families deserve to be represented in their school curriculum.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A western Maryland race track has evicted the remnants of a trucker protest that had used the site as a staging ground. The People’s Convoy had conducted a series of rolling protests around the Capital Beltway in March to protest pandemic restrictions and other grievances. After a hiatus, a smaller group of truckers returned Wednesday to the Hagerstown Speedway. But Speedway General Manager Lisa Plessinger asked the group to leave amid infighting over its next steps. The last of the truckers left Friday night, she said. She compared the convoy to “like when your mother-in-law comes to visit and decides to stay.” A press release issued Friday on a Facebook page for The People’s Convoy “declares victory and announces its conclusion of the national convoy portion of this great movement.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: More than 40 people – including marine mammal experts, interns and volunteers – spent several hours battling an incoming tide to help rescue seven dolphins that got stranded in the shallow waters of a Cape Cod river last week. The International Fund for Animal Welfare first got word that the Atlantic white-sided dolphins got stranded in a shallow gut of the Herring River in Wellfleet on Wednesday morning, and rescuers were on the scene in about an hour, the organization said in a statement. It’s not unusual for dolphins to get stranded in the area because of its shape as a hook within the larger hook of Cape Cod’s shoreline and because of large tidal fluctuations in Cape Cod Bay. “The dolphins appeared alert and in good health, but the day was sure to be sunny and warm, and we needed to move quickly,” said Misty Niemeyer, of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue & Research team. The tide was also coming in, and dolphins often risk getting stranded again when it rolls out, she said. The dolphins – all likely young males, 6 to 8 feet in length and weighing up to 250 pounds – were then taken in a vehicle custom-designed to transport dolphins and released in deeper waters off Provincetown in the early afternoon.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Nearly all of the power lost following a deadly tornado that killed two people and flattened parts of a northern Michigan community has been restored, state police said Sunday. Police also said everyone had been accounted for in Gaylord, where Friday afternoon’s EF3 twister also left more than 40 people injured. Authorities had said Saturday that they were not able to account for one person. Cleanup continued Sunday in the town of 4,200 people about 230 miles northwest of Detroit. About 6,100 utility customers in Otsego County, where Gaylord is the county seat, lost power due to Friday’s storms, according to Jackson-based Consumers Energy. State police said Sunday that electricity had been restored to 99% of utility customers in Gaylord. The tornado packed winds of 140 mph that tore roofs and walls from businesses and largely destroyed a mobile home park. Such storms are uncommon in northern Michigan. State police Lt. Derrick Carroll has said the city doesn’t have tornado sirens, though anyone with a mobile phone got a “code red” warning from the weather service about 10 minutes before the tornado hit. The Nottingham Forest mobile home park was one of the first places hit by the tornado. Two residents, described by police as being in their 70s, were killed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRedwood Falls: A partial skull that was discovered last summer by two kayakers will be returned to Native American officials after investigations determined it was about 8,000 years old. The kayakers found the skull in the drought-depleted Minnesota River about 110 miles west of Minneapolis, Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said. Thinking it might be related to a missing person case or murder, Hable turned the skull over to a medical examiner and eventually to the FBI, where a forensic anthropologist used carbon dating to determine it was likely the skull of a young man who lived between 5500 and 6000 B.C., Hable said. “It was a complete shock to us that that bone was that old,” Hable told Minnesota Public Radio. The anthropologist determined the man had a depression in his skull that was “perhaps suggestive of the cause of death.” After the sheriff posted about the discovery Wednesday, his office was criticized by several Native Americans, who said publishing photos of ancestral remains was offensive to their culture. Hable said his office removed the post. “We didn’t mean for it to be offensive whatsoever,” he said. Hable said the remains will be turned over to Upper Sioux Community tribal officials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Gilbert Mason Jr., who grew up in the civil rights movement and became a physician and a Black and civil rights historian, has died at age 68. Mason died Wednesday and funeral arrangements were not yet complete, according to Infinity Funeral Home in Biloxi. Mason was 5 years old in 1959 when he watched his father, Gilbert Mason Sr., lead Biloxi’s first wade-in to desegregate beaches, the Sun Herald reports. And his name was on the 1971 lawsuit that made Biloxi schools the state’s first to integrate. Like his father, Mason became a physician who served poor people. His practice was in the New Orleans area, but he returned to Biloxi when his father became ill. The elder Mason died in 2006. The son spent his last years documenting civil rights and Black history and his father’s accomplishments, the newspaper reports. Father and son both had photographic memories, said Clemon Jimerson Sr. He said the younger Mason’s memories helped to document the history of scouting on the Mississippi Coast, the music history of Biloxi and other areas for the Mississippi Blues Trail, the integration of Coast schools, and the preservation of Nichols Elementary, the historically Black school in East Biloxi.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: City officials have approved a new ordinance that clarifies when people may witness or record police officers’ actions without being arrested. The Kansas City Council on Thursday approved the ordinance to settle a federal lawsuit filed by three women who were arrested during racial injustice protests in 2020. The women were charged with violating city laws involving resisting or interfering with an officer. The lawsuit said those laws were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, KCUR reports. The ordinance approved Thursday says witnessing or recording police officers does not violate city law unless the offender is substantially impeding the officer’s duties. The women were among more than 200 nonviolent protesters arrested at or near the Country Club Plaza during protests after the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The settlement did not require the city to pay any monetary damages.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A full month after a judge temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to undergo surgery before they could change their gender on their birth certificate, the state still isn’t in compliance with the court order, the ACLU of Montana said. Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the state health department, said the agency is still working with the Department of Justice to review the April 21 ruling and its implications. He did not respond to an email asking if that meant the state was evaluating whether to appeal the order. “We have continued to be patient in allowing the state time to comply with the court ordered preliminary injunction,” the ACLU of Montana said in a recent statement. “However, close to one month has passed and the State’s willful indifference to the court order is inexcusable.” Montana is among a growing list of Republican-controlled states that have moved to restrict transgender rights, including requiring student-athletes to participate in sports based on their gender assigned at birth or making it illegal for transgender minors to be treated with hormones or puberty blockers.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: A pilot died after a single-engine plane crashed at the Wayne Municipal Airport, officials said. The Cessna 140 crashed Friday evening during the MayDay STOL Drag Races. The organization that planned the events said in a Facebook post that the pilot crashed on final approach at the airport after apparently stalling and spinning. No one else was aboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The pilot’s name was not released. STOL, or short take-off and landing, drag racing involves pilots flying side-by-side 2,000 feet down and back up. The rest of the weekend’s planned events were canceled.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: COVID-19 emergency declarations for Nevada ended Friday as the public health agency for metro Las Vegas noted that the pandemic isn’t over and said it will continue to monitor spread of the coronavirus and provide assistance with vaccinating and testing. While most of the state’s pandemic measures, including business restrictions and mask mandates, have already been lifted, the Southern Nevada Health District said it was important to remind the public that the virus that causes COVID-19 continued to circulate. “Cases are currently increasing, and new variants are emerging,” said Dr. Fermin Leguen, chief medical officer for the district. Gov. Steve Sisolak on Thursday signed a proclamation ending the state’s emergency Friday – a planned action he announced two weeks ago, saying he wanted to ensure that there would be no gap in services. “Today, we are turning the page on the State of Emergency caused by COVID-19 and are laser focused on ensuring our recovery from the public health, fiscal and economy crisis serves the needs of Nevada’s families,” Sisolak, a Democrat running for reelection, said Thursday in a statement. Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas area, on Thursday announced the end of of its emergency declaration, which was declared March 15, 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConway: A forest fire in northern New Hampshire that’s burned 106 acres is nearly contained, officials said Friday. The Bemis Fire in Crawford Notch State Park, the White Mountain National Forest, and on private land began May 13 in steep, rugged terrain. The cause is under investigation. “It’s important for the public to know that the Bemis Fire remains an active fire scene, and there are still firefighters and equipment on site,” said Capt. Adrian Reyes of the New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau. “This weekend is expected to bring record temperatures to the region, and we ask that anyone wishing to spend time outdoors avoids the area of the fire, for their own safety as well as for the safety of the wildland crew,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear population appears to be increasing, based on the number of reported serious encounters with humans, but as New Jersey has had no official bear management plan for the past two years, the Division of Fish and Wildlife doesn’t know for sure. Without the plan, the division did not make an estimate of the bear population in the state’s northwest area last year and won’t do so this year. The last count was done in 2020 and coincided with the last statewide bear hunt. At that time there were about 3,158 bears in northwestern New Jersey, specifically in the areas previously designated as bear hunting zones north of Route 80 and west of Route 287. Records show that reported serious encounters with bears since the count have gone up nearly ninefold. “The DEP does not have a statewide population estimate, though sightings of black bears have been reported in all 21 counties,” said the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the Division of Fish and Wildlife. At least two people in Sussex County were injured in separate black bear encounters just outside their homes, and at least three dogs were killed or injured. The 2020 count shows the bear population doubled from the 1,522 counted in 2018, the last year a bear hunt was allowed on state-owned lands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMora: As more than 2,700 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Sunday, many evacuees were growing concerned about their future after weeks away from home. The biggest fire in the state’s recorded history has been burning for six weeks now, and some of the hundreds forced to evacuate say their financial resources are dwindling. Amity Maes, a 30-year-old Mora resident who said she is 81/ 2 months pregnant and penniless, told the Santa Fe New Mexican she bounced around for weeks before finding shelter at an evacuation center in Glorieta, where she believes she contracted COVID-19. Officials at Glorieta Adventure Camps said there have been 67 coronavirus cases among evacuees, including some that required hospitalization. After her isolation period, Maes said she was urged to leave and go to a hotel in Santa Fe where she could be closer to a hospital if she went into labor. But the hotel didn’t have her reservation when she arrived, and when she finally got a room, it was only for one night. “They keep encouraging us to go to Albuquerque” where evacuees are being housed in hotels, Maes told the newspaper. “We don’t have gas. We don’t have no income. There’s no gas vouchers. There’s no anything. I’m on a quarter-tank of gas, and I don’t know what I’m going to do.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street inside the city’s sole Army base now bears the name of a Black Congressional Medal of Honor recipient rather than a Confederate general. Fort Hamilton changed the road’s name to John Warren Avenue on Friday morning, following a years-old push by local officials to remove Confederate symbols nationwide. The base had previously called the street General Lee Avenue, after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Lt. John Warren, of Brooklyn, was killed at the age of 22 in 1969 in the Vietnam War when he fell in the direction of a grenade and shielded at least three men from the blast. His Congressional Medal of Honor citation says Williams’ “ultimate action of sacrifice to save the lives of his men was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.” Warren is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, and his Congressional Medal of Honor was posthumously presented to him in 1970. The base will also rename its Stonewall Jackson Drive, which is named after another Confederate general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Advocacy groups and voters who this year persuaded state courts to overturn the Legislature’s congressional redistricting plan asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to avoid hearing arguments on whether such courts must be curtailed in reviewing U.S. House maps. Attorneys representing the state also joined with outside lawyers to file four legal briefs with the justices urging them to reject a petition from Republican legislative leaders to take up the issue. Through their own private lawyers, the GOP lawmakers already asked the court to formally rule on whether a provision in the U.S. Constitution delegating to state legislatures the manner of holding U.S. House elections means that state judges can’t void congressional district lines created by the General Assembly. The authors of Friday’s filings say the Supreme Court already has ruled before that some decision-making on congressional redistricting can be delegated by a state’s citizens. The same holds true when the North Carolina Legislature passed laws two decades ago setting in place the authority of courts to review redistricting plans that they approved, the lawyers wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nPembina: One of the largest employers in northeastern North Dakota is closing later this year. Winnipeg, Manitoba-based New Flyer Industries is shutting down its charter and transit bus manufacturing plant in Pembina, located close to the Canadian border. Pembina Mayor Mike Fitzgerald said company was notified of the decision in a letter. The company told Fitzgerald that it was having difficulty finding qualified employees, a factor in its conversion to electric vehicles, and the plant’s location has become an issue. New Flyer has a plant in Crookston, Minnesota, which is about 100 miles from Pembina. Fitzgerald called the move “devastating” and said it will put more than 200 employees out of work, KFGO radio reports. The Pembina plant opened in 1963.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit pairing photographs from two moments of societal crisis – the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic – aims to help visitors see parallels between the human tolls felt across generations. The show, “Chronicles: The Great Depression and the Pandemic,” opened Saturday at the and runs through Aug. 28. It couples images of day-to-day life gathered by 10 Depression-era photographers and five contemporary Ohio photographers. The 1930s photographers – including Dorothea Lange, Esther Bubley, Jack Delano, Russell Lee, Carl Mydans, Gordon Parks, John Vachon and Ben Shahn – were hired by the U.S. government Works Progress Administration’s Farm Security Administration. The Ohio photographers are Autumn Bland, Donald Black, Jr., Angelo Merendino, Jane Alden Stevens and Shane Wynn. Their pictures document the ravages of the coronavirus across different social and economic groups. Special events tied to the exhibit include a talk with co-curators Christine Fowler Shearer and Arnold Tunstall on Sunday, a history lecture on the WPA, an artist talk with Wynn, and classes on smartphone photography and enhancing Instagram accounts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With the state only days away from enacting the toughest ban on abortion in the U.S., questions remained Friday about enforcing the law’s limited exceptions. The law allows abortions to save a pregnant patient’s life “in a medical emergency,” and supporters said doctors still would decide what an emergency is, though that could change later if it becomes perceived as a loophole. There’s also an exception for cases of rape, sexual assault or incest that have been reported to law enforcement, but that doesn’t help victims who don’t report the crimes to police. Abortion providers said they are likely to be cautious because the new law, like a ban at about six weeks enacted earlier and a similar 2021 law in Texas, will expose them to potentially expensive lawsuits over alleged violations. They’re planning to refer some patients to states like Colorado or Kansas, but some won’t be able to manage the extra time or travel involved. Oklahoma will provide a preview of what is in store for other states if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through on a draft opinion leaked earlier this month overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The law also is likely to prompt Oklahoma residents – and Texans who’d traveled to the neighboring state – to go elsewhere to end their pregnancies.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A Democratic state lawmaker is calling for an investigation into a ballot-printing fiasco that will delay results from Tuesday’s primary by weeks, with a key U.S. House race hanging in the balance in a state that prides itself on voter access and election transparency. Tens of thousands of ballots in the state’s third-largest county were printed with blurred barcodes, making them unreadable by vote-counting machines – a mistake that wasn’t caught until ballots were already being returned in the vote-by-mail state. Elections workers must now hand-transfer the votes from those ballots to new ones that can be read in a painstaking process that also raises the possibility of duplication errors. As the scope of the crisis became apparent, local, state and federal lawmakers Friday all escalated their criticism of Clackamas County Elections Clerk Sherry Hall, who defended her actions at a news conference Friday and said she had learned from the mistakes. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who represents voters in the county, called the situation “unreasonable, and untenable,” and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents some Clackamas voters in Congress, called Hall’s slow reaction “unconscionable.” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan demanded a written plan from Hall detailing how she would get results tabulated by June 13, the state deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Summer Lee has won a five-way Democratic primary for a Pittsburgh-based U.S. House seat, making her the favorite in the heavily Democratic district to win the fall general election and become the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Friday was the fourth day of counting ballots after Tuesday’s primary in the closely contested race for the open 12th District seat. Lee, a second-term state House member, lawyer and former labor organizer, comes from the party’s progressive wing. She was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two-time presidential candidate and a leading voice in the Democratic Party’s left wing who came to campaign for Lee. Lee beat out second-place Steve Irwin, who was endorsed by the Allegheny County Democratic Party and backed by prominent Democrats from the county. The seat is open because longtime Rep. Mike Doyle – first elected in 1994 – is not running again. It also has new boundaries since Pennsylvania’s congressional districts were redrawn to account for a decade of demographic changes identified by the 2020 census. Lee will face the Republican nominee of the same name as the outgoing Democratic incumbent – Mike Doyle – in the fall general election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Dr. Anthony Fauci urged graduates of Roger Williams University on Friday to fight what he called the “normalization of untruths,” which has become a growing and more troubling problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and the face of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus, was the commencement ceremony’s keynote speaker but addressed students at the private Rhode Island college remotely because he had to attend a memorial service for a family member. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have experienced firsthand something that has troubled and saddened me – a deepened divisiveness in our nation,” he said. “Unfortunately, differences of opinion or ideology are propped up by deliberate distortions of reality to the point of fabrications, conspiracy theories, and outright lies.” He told the students to apply the analytic skills they have learned during their time at the university to challenge and renounce untruths, which he called a threat to the nation. “Reject the politicization of science that denigrates evidence and facts,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two new state laws require elementary school teachers to get a 30-minute break each day without students and ban districts from turning over school lunch debt to collection agencies. The bills were passed in the final days of the 2022 General Assembly session and signed into law by Gov. Henry McMaster. Both passed the House and Senate unanimously. The break bill requires teachers in elementary school and special education teachers who have students in their classes for most of the day to get 30 minutes without any assigned duties or responsibilities. Teacher groups requested the law, saying some teachers never had time to eat a lunch or even use the bathroom because they were watching students. A second bill prohibits school districts from turning over debt a student owes for school lunches to a collection agency. Supporters said students need to eat regardless of their ability to pay, and turning debt over to a collection agency was too drastic of a step.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled a sex crime conviction doesn’t require an actual victim. The court last week upheld the conviction of a man stemming from a sting operation during the 2017 Sturgis motorcycle rally. Carlocito Slim argued he was just looking for a massage when he responded to an ad on the Backpage website under the headline “Women Seeking Men.” Slim was actually responding to an ad that was a sting setup and unknowingly texted a special agent with South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation. The agent, posing as a pimp, told Slim he could meet a 15-year-old girl. And when Slim showed up at the assigned meeting place with condoms and $200, he was arrested and later convicted of two federal felonies. Slim argued there couldn’t be a conviction because there was no pimp and no crime victim. Defense attorney Terry Pechota told the judges his client simply didn’t understand the text communications and was only looking for a massage, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “He doesn’t ask about whether or not the girl is 16, or whether they’re going to engage in any funny stuff or illegal stuff,” Pechota said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman said Slim knew what was going on and later told investigators he thought he was meeting a girl for sex.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Friday that he doesn’t have a timeline yet on when his administration might roll out a long-blocked school voucher program that saw its biggest legal roadblock removed by the state’s high court last week. The Republican told reporters it was a “good first step” for the Supreme Court to rule Wednesday that the voucher initiative doesn’t violate the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. The decision upends earlier court rulings that have kept the program that passed in 2019 from ever being implemented. The program applies only to Nashville and Shelby County, which includes Memphis, the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The two counties were among the entities that sued over the program. But the governor also said there are “legal decisions yet to be made” and “a lot of steps that have to come to fruition” before the program can get up and running. “Once we determine the speed with which the court will make its final decisions, then we can move forward with the particulars to make sure this works and fits, and how it is that we roll it out,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMentone: The top elected official in a rural, sparsely populated West Texas county has been arrested after being accused of stealing cattle. Loving County Judge Skeet Jones, 71, and three other men were arrested Friday on charges of livestock theft and engaging in organized criminal activity. All four men were taken to the jail in neighboring Winkler County, where they have since been released on bond. Jones hadn’t returned a call seeking comment Sunday. The arrests came after a yearlong investigation, according to a statement from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. The association has commissioned peace officers known as special rangers who investigate agricultural crimes, including the theft of cattle and horses. The rangers also determine the ownership of stray livestock. The association’s special rangers allege Jones and the others gathered stray cattle and sold them without following procedures set forth in the Texas Agriculture Code. Those procedures include calling the sheriff to report stray livestock and allowing the sheriff to search for the animal’s owner. The association declined to provide additional details about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. The theft of livestock charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and the organized criminal activity charge up to 20 years in prison.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Southern Utah’s first 24-hour child care center is opening soon, aiming to help families break away from poverty. The new Stepping Stones day care center is slated to open June 1 and will be housed under SwitchPoint, the St. George-based nonprofit that runs and operates the area’s largest homeless shelter, food bank and other programs aimed at helping people living in poverty. The center will stay open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and will aim to help parents and guardians who struggle who pay the costs of child care elsewhere. “We’ve got to create something that can help alleviate keeping families trapped in poverty,” said Carol Holloway, the executive director of Switchpoint, to a packed room of people at a ribbon-cutting event at the center Tuesday. Kamie Blake, the program director for the care center, said it will be the only 24/7 child care center in southern Utah and one of the few in operation in the state. Children as young as 6 weeks old and up to 12 years old will be eligible to attend. At full capacity, Stepping Stones can take up to 270 kids each day and has a kitchen, laundry and sleeping areas to accommodate the round-the-clock operations. There are five classrooms on site, with lessons scheduled based on age.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have created a drug use standards advisory board within the state sentencing commission, saying it “places no limits on which drugs can be contemplated for legalization or the amounts.” The board would determine “the benchmark personal use dosage and the benchmark personal use supply” for regulated and unregulated drugs, with a goal of preventing and reducing the criminalization of personal drug use, according to the bill. Scott, a Republican, said in his letter Thursday to the General Assembly the bill includes “absolutely no recognition” of health and safety impacts of using fentanyl, heroin and other drugs, and it doesn’t acknowledge law enforcement’s role in stopping dealers. Scott also vetoed a bill that would have expanded eligibility for the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent crimes. “Ultimately, I find this bill inconsistent with the State’s responsibilities to keep the public safe,” he wrote. Rep. Selene Colburn, P-Burlington, who supported both bills, said she was upset about the outcome, WCAX-TV reports. “We are not talking about reducing penalties for violent crimes or changing expungement eligibility. We are simply talking about treating people who have used drugs and who have struggled with substance use disorder with dignity and respect and the basic belief that their lives are valuable,” she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Attorneys for the U.S. government have indicated they will not oppose a plan to lift all remaining restrictions next month on John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington ruled last year that Hinckley can be freed unconditionally in June if he continues to follow the rules placed on him and remains mentally stable as he continues to live in Williamsburg. Hinckley, 66, has indeed remained mentally stable and violated no conditions, according to a letter filed by U.S. attorneys with the court Thursday. That determination was based on letters from the Washington’s Department of Health, which has overseen Hinckley’s care. A court hearing is scheduled for June 1. Hinckley was 25, suffering from acute psychosis, when he shot and wounded the 40th U.S. president and injured three others. When jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment and not a lifetime in confinement. A 2016 court order granted him permission to live with his mom full time, after experts said his mental illness had been in remission for decades. She died in July. He signed a lease on a one-bedroom apartment in the area last year and began living there with his cat, Theo, according to court filings. In recent years, Hinckley has sold items from a booth at an antique mall that he’s found at estate sales, flea markets and consignment shops. He’s also shared his music on YouTube.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An invasive European green crab was captured last week in Hood Canal, the farthest south the species has been found in the Salish Sea. Volunteers with Washington Sea Grant trapped the male European green crab in Nick’s Lagoon near Seabeck in Kitsap County, The Seattle Times reports. The organization has been tasked by the state with early detection of the crab’s spread. Washington Sea Grant marine ecologist Emily Grason said in a news release the crab arrived at the lagoon last year, based on its size. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife in response will increase trapping there to assess the scope of the green crab presence and try to locally eradicate the species. Gov. Jay Inslee issued an emergency proclamation in January to address a significant increase in European green crab populations within the Lummi Nation’s sea pond near Bellingham. The crab is highly adaptable and preys on juvenile clams before they reach harvestable age. It also out-competes native crab species and wreaks havoc on marine and estuary ecosystems. It was first found in Washington’s inland waters in 2016.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that social services workers will receive a 15% pay increase by tapping funds from existing vacant positions after such efforts failed in the Legislature. About 970 employees of the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Social Services will receive the raises starting June 18. There are more than 6,500 children in the care of the state. According to the DHHR, there is a 30% vacancy rate statewide for foster care employees. “I told you we’d get this done, and we got it done without spending any excess money,” the Republican governor said in a statement. “I always say we need to mind the store, and we’ve done it the right way. As a result, we’re now able to compensate these people that are doing incredible work.” Employee pay raises and other key provisions were stripped from a social services bill before it died on the final day of the regular legislative session in March. After the pay raises were gutted, DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch told a Senate committee that the department would reduce the number of open positions to provide the much-needed raises to child protective services employees. Crouch said Thursday those vacant positions indeed funded the raises.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A disorderly conduct conviction can’t disqualify someone from obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a unanimous decision that could dramatically broaden who can carry hidden firearms, knives and stun guns. The court found that disorderly conduct isn’t a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law and therefore doesn’t disqualify a person from holding a concealed carry license. Justice Jill Karofsky, a member of the court’s liberal minority, concurred but in a separate opinion called on legislators to close a “dangerous loophole” that will allow domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons. Lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill a year ago that would have reconciled the language, but it never got got a hearing. “Though legally correct, this result is as nonsensical as it is dangerous,” Karofsky wrote. “When a domestic abuse perpetrator, who has engaged in threats to kill or any other type of domestic violence, has access to a gun, the lethality risk for his victim increases significantly.” The case revolves around Daniel Doubek, of Green Bay. According to court documents, Doubek broke into his estranged wife’s trailer in Door County in 1993 waving a board and shouting threats. He was ultimately convicted of disorderly conduct.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local reservoirs are likely to be nearly drained this summer amid lingering drought in the Snake River basin, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Federal officials predicted Thursday during an annual water meeting at the Teton County Library that reservoirs like Jackson Lake and Palisades could fall to 2%-10% if summer proves particularly hot and dry, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/27/humpback-whale-alert-monk-seal-attacks-northwest-sizzles-news-around-states/50531153/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nClanton:Two Chilton County deputies and two Clanton Police Department officers wore body cameras that offered a 360-degree view of the environment surrounding the officer during a weekslong field test. Called the Nexx360, the officer’s collar holds four wide-angle cameras. Instead of capturing footage of a narrow field of view in front of the officer, this system gives an all-around view. “This has the potential for being a game-changer,” said Sheriff John Shearon. “There are times when we don’t get good footage of an encounter. The officer may be moving to protect themselves or others; the other person may be moving. An officer doesn’t need to think about where they need to be to get the best body camera footage. This solves that problem.” The cameras serve as a “dispassionate observer,” said Terry Luck, a longtime defense attorney whose practice is in Montgomery. The technology also allows dispatchers – and supervisors – to get real-time images of what’s happening. That’s a huge advantage in rural counties, where help in the form of backup can be 20 minutes or more away, Shearon said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she recently tested positive for the coronavirus. In a statement on social media, Murkowski said she recently tested positive after experiencing flulike symptoms. The statement did not specify the timing of the test. Her campaign posted photos of events that Murkowski participated in Friday and Saturday in Fairbanks. “I will be following guidance and advice from doctors and will be quarantining at home in Alaska while continuing my work remotely,” Murkowski’s statement said. Karina Borger, a spokesperson in Murkowski’s Senate office, said by email that Murkowski is “vaccinated and boosted.” Borger said she had nothing more to share beyond the social media post.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Beginning this month, students whose jobs or income were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can receive free tuition, monthly stipends and employment help in a range of workforce programs from manufacturing to health care at Maricopa County’s 10 community colleges. Phoenix is using $7 million of its federal pandemic relief funds to finance the “Route to Relief” program, which will run through December 2024. Eligible students can get up to $5,000 for tuition, fees and books. Training-related expenses, job search expenses and career services in programs such as semiconductor, health care, business, manufacturing and information technology also are covered. Students also will get monthly stipends during their studies of up to $1,500 for other expenses such as child care and transportation.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Power has been restored across the Arkansas River Valley after storms last week caused outages in Roland, Oklahoma and Paris. But a heat wave will continue through the first part of this week with triple-digit temperatures in Fort Smith. There is a 50% chance for rain Thursday with a high of 98 degrees, the National Weather Service reported. An excessive heat warning was issued for 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday in Fort Smith and Sebastian County. High fire danger continues during an ongoing drought.\n\nCalifornia\n\nForest Falls: A man died and a woman was injured when the pair tumbled down a waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains, authorities said. Rescue crews responding Sunday afternoon found the woman performing CPR on the man at Big Falls near the community of Forest Falls, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said. The man, a 43-year-old resident of Hemet, died at the scene, the department said. The 43-year-old woman from Riverside was airlifted to a hospital, officials said. Their names were not immediately available. Officials said the pair fell from the middle falls to the lower falls at the popular destination along a hiking trail about 80 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has temporarily blocked the city of Superior from enforcing parts of a new gun control ordinance, including a ban on the sale and possession of assault weapons, after it was challenged by gun rights groups. U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Moore issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, noting the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, the National Association for Gun Rights and a Superior resident, Charles Bradley Walker, had established a likelihood to prove their case in challenging two sections of the ordinance. Moore scheduled an Aug. 4 hearing to determine whether to continue to keep Superior from enforcing those sections. The other section requires people who had assault weapons before the law took effect on July 1 to get a permit to continue to possess them but largely only on their own property. The law defines assault weapons as a number of different semi-automatic weapons. Moore’s ruling included several references to last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a New York law that required people to show why they needed a concealed weapons permit. He noted that the court found that Americans have the right to bear commonly used arms in public, subject to reasonable and well-defined restrictions, and that governments must identify “an American tradition” to justify any limits on their use.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The City Council gave the green light to the Norwich Community Development Corporation to apply for a $500,000 Brownfield Remediation Grant from the state’s Community Investment Fund to help remediate and redevelop the Reid and Hughes department store, a vacant building on Main Street. Mayor Peter Nystrom said the funding is needed to take care of asbestos, lead pipes, and other areas that aren’t up to modern code compliance. The plan for the building is to create 17 apartments and a first-floor retail space. Heritage Housing, Inc. is the developer interested in the Reid and Hughes building. It already owns the Wauregan Building across the street.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Senate Democrats voted in a special session to seek to remove Delaware’s state auditor from office, an action criticized as meaningless “political theater” by the Democratic House speaker. Senators voted 13-7 for a resolution to hold a joint session of the Legislature regarding the removal of Auditor Kathy McGuiness, a Democrat. Senate Democrats contend that McGuiness should be removed from office for betraying the public trust. McGuiness, who is responsible as auditor for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was convicted this month on misdemeanor charges of conflict of interest, official misconduct and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. She was acquitted on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. The case marked the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official had been convicted on criminal charges. The Senate resolution must also be approved by the House, but Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf said he has no intention of calling his chamber into special session. “This isn’t taking decisive action: it’s political theater,” Schwartzkopf, a longtime political ally of McGuiness, said in a statement issued by Democratic House leadership.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police are investigating after a 7-year-old boy was hit by a car driven by an 11-year-old boy in Southeast D.C. on Monday night, WUSA-TV reported. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, the unidentified boy was hit in a playground parking lot, located on the 3500 block of Stanton Road, just after 6:30 p.m. Police believe the juvenile driver lost control of the car and wasn't able to hit the brake before running into the child. The car also hit a curb. When first responders arrived, they found the boy conscious and breathing. The 11-year-old driver of a 2020 Kia Optima ran away from the scene after the crash, but was located by police Tuesday. The family of the injured boy said he is expected to be OK, but he is recovering from a leg injury in the hospital.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Four people, including a 5-year-old boy, were injured when a car crashed through an unoccupied toll booth and ended up in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said. The crash happened just before 5 p.m. Sunday along Daytona Beach, where vehicles are allowed on the sand. The driver of the car, Christian Rivera Rosado, 28, of Springfield, Massachusetts, apparently had a seizure and lost control of his Nissan Altima, according to a report from Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. The car smashed through the empty toll booth at the International Speedway Boulevard beach approach in Daytona Beach and ended up in the water, Volusia County Beach Safety officials told news outlets. The child, identified as David Alamos of Nashville, Tennessee, was taken to a hospital in Daytona Beach and then airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. The child he was released from Halifax Health Medical Center later Sunday. Rosado was also taken to the hospital as a trauma alert, the report said. Rosado, who said he didn’t remember the incident, was cited for careless driving, the report stated. The crash remains under investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge rejected an appeal by a group of voters and affirmed the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is eligible to run for reelection. The five voters from Greene’s district sought to have her removed from the ballot, saying she played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. That was a violation of a rarely invoked provision in the 14th Amendment against insurrection or rebellion, they argued.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A swimmer at a beach in Waikiki was injured last weekend after encountering an endangered Hawaiian monk seal with a young pup. Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a nonprofit conservation organization that helps monitor protected species, said their workers witnessed a swimmer come into contact with the mother monk seal known as Rocky on Sunday morning. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement the victim is a 60-year-old elementary school teacher from California. The woman received lacerations to her face, arm and back, the agency said. State officials said they would not recommend charges or fines for the woman and are not naming her because she requested anonymity. The Hawaii Marine Animal Response said in a statement the seal gave birth to a pup about two weeks ago on Kaimana Beach in Waikiki, the same area where the swimmer was injured. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaii Marine Animal Response have been watching the pair and warning people to stay away. It is against the law to touch, harass, injure or kill monk seals, of which there are less than 1,600 remaining in the wild. People are told to stay at least 150 feet away from a mother seal and pup, though that recommendation is not a law.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Tom Arkoosh, an attorney from Boise, said he’s running for Idaho attorney general as the Democratic nominee. Arkoosh announced his candidacy amid family and friends at the Statehouse. He’s replacing Steve Scanlin, who withdrew from the race last week and was a placeholder for the Democrats. Arkoosh will face former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador in the November general election. Labrador defeated five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the May Republican primary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man who died after being stabbed on a commuter train early Monday apparently threatened or tried to rob the person who wounded him, authorities said. The stabbing occurred at about 3 a.m. on a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line train on the city’s South Side, police said. Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said video footage reviewed by investigators suggested the man was with a group who threatened or tried to rob someone else on the train. Video showed the man holding a gun before the individual targeted by the group used a knife to stab him, Deenihan said during a news conference. The man suffered wounds to his chest and later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Deenihan said investigators haven’t identified anyone else involved yet. No arrests have been made.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Thousands of people arguing the abortion issue surrounded the Statehouse and filled its corridors Monday as lawmakers began to consider a Republican proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the effort during a meeting with Democratic state legislators. Harris said the abortion ban proposal reflected a health care crisis in the country. Despite the bill’s abortion ban language, anti-abortion activists lined up before a legislative committee to argue the bill wasn’t strict enough and lacked enforcement teeth. Indiana is one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court decision last month overturning Roe v. Wade. Indiana’s Republican Senate leaders proposed a bill last week that would prohibit abortions from the time an egg is implanted in a woman’s uterus with limited exceptions – in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. Republican Senate leaders said the bill would not add new criminal penalties against doctors involved with abortions, but they would face possibly having their medical licenses revoked for breaking the law.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:As three more families sue Tyson Foods over COVID-19 deaths among workers at its Iowa plants, the meatpacking giant is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for protection. Tyson’s attorneys filed the petition Friday, asking the country’s highest court to hear their case and rule that a March 2020 executive order by President Donald Trump shielded the company from legal liability, Bloomberg Law reported. Trump’s order instructed the secretary of agriculture to take “all appropriate action” to keep the country’s meat and chicken processing plants open as COVID-19 spread, though it did not prohibit them from temporarily closing their plants. In their petition, according to Bloomberg, Tyson’s attorneys wrote the company followed “the federal government’s instructions to help avert an impending national food shortage.” They added that Tyson executives “will not be so eager to willingly aid the federal government in a crisis” if the company is subject to lawsuits.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State Attorney General Derek Schmidt is trying to get ahead of arguments that an anti-abortion measure up for a statewide vote next week would hinder medical care for patients with life-threatening pregnancies. Schmidt, a Republican running for governor who supports the measure, argued in a legal opinion issued Friday that treating miscarriages, removing dead fetuses and ending ectopic pregnancies do not fall under Kansas’ legal definition of abortion. The proposal on the ballot Aug. 2 would amend the Kansas Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. It’s the first referendum on abortion policy by a state since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Funding is available to help boost the Kentucky tourism industry, which saw a decline in visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The state will allocate $75 million over the next several weeks to help eligible tourism organizations that apply and show the impact of the virus, Gov. Andy Beshear’s office said. The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan Act and was allocated by the General Assembly earlier this year. It will be distributed in four ways. Officials said $25 million will go to local tourism commissions to market their communities, $25 million will be used to attract conventions and meetings, $15 million will go toward statewide marketing and $10 million will be available for multicounty collaborations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Mayor-President Josh Guillory said he has checked himself into a rehabilitation facility for treatment of alcohol addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Guillory said in a news release he will be at an in-patient facility for 21 days. A statement from the city said Guillory will remain in authority over Lafayette Parish and city government. Through arrangements with the facility, Guillory will have access to a computer and internet service and will be able to review and sign contracts, ordinances and other documents. Guillory’s biography on the city’s website said he enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard in 2001 and led a platoon in Iraq in 2005.\n\nMaine\n\nNewry: A decision by state regulators could make it difficult for the owners of a potentially rich lithium deposit in western Maine to extract the metal. The owners of the Newry property asked the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to review the possibility of quarrying at the site. However, regulators decided earlier this month the site would be viewed as a metallic mineral mine and not a quarry operation, said Maine mining coordinator Michael Clark on Monday. Maine’s mineral mining laws are among the strictest in the country. The Freeman family, which owns the land, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. New sources of lithium are in demand in the U.S. because the metal is crucial to the development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric and hybrid cars.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Democratic U.S. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger has tested positive for the coronoavirus, his office said Monday. Ruppersberger, who represents Maryland’s 2nd District, tested positive on Sunday night. The congressman’s symptoms are mild and he is working from home while isolating, his office said. He is fully vaccinated and has had a booster shot. Ruppersberger, 76, is serving his 10th term in Congress. This is the second time this year that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. He also had a positive test in January and reported mild symptoms at the time.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: After a whale crashed into a fishing boat and others were seen off the South Shore coast in the past week, the state is warning boaters to use caution as a group of young humpbacks feeds in Plymouth Harbor. The state’s environmental agencies have warned all boaters, kayakers, paddleboarders and others on the water to watch out for three juvenile humpback whales that have been feeding near Plymouth for at least a week. The young whales’ behavior is “very unpredictable,” the state said, and they are feeding on schools of fish in shallow waters. A whale on Sunday struck a fishing boat off the coast of Plymouth after breaching with several boats nearby. The whale hit one of the boats and caused the bow to dip down into the water. Two people on the boat braced themselves as the boat tipped forward and back, a video showed. A paddleboarder had a close encounter with a whale off Manomet last week, and amateur wildlife photographer Suzanne O’Shea managed to photograph a breaching whale off the coast of Plymouth on July 19. The whales feeding and breaching in the area have brought residents and tourists in the hopes of catching a glimpse. Most of the whales have been humpback, which can measure up to 55 feet and weigh up to 40 tons, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a nonprofit group dedicated to the conservation of whales. It is illegal to harass marine mammals under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act. Harassment includes any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance that can injure or disrupt the feeding behavior of the animal. The National Marine Fisheries Service recommends that boaters stay at least 100 feet away from whales and take caution given the unpredictable behavior of whales and the potential safety hazards involved.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Dozens of University of Michigan medical students walked out of a weekend ceremony to protest a speaker who publicly opposes abortion rights. Dr. Kristin Collier, an assistant professor of medicine, was the keynote speaker Sunday at an annual event where new medical students are formally welcomed and given a white lab coat. A video of some students walking out was posted to social media and has received more than 11 million views. Collier didn’t refer to abortion in her remarks, but she has shared her opinions on social media and in interviews. A petition signed by 340 medical students, including some of the new ones, had urged the university to drop Collier as a speaker. Spokeswoman Mary Masson said the university “does not revoke an invitation to a speaker based on their personal beliefs.” Dr. Joseph Kolars, a senior associate dean, said Collier was nominated to speak by members of a medical school student honor society. He told the audience that she is an “enormously popular teacher and physician.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mekhi Speed, 18, a cousin of Amir Locke, was sentenced to more than 16 years for his role in a January murder that prompted police to execute a no-knock warrant on the apartment where Locke was killed by a SWAT team officer. Speed pleaded guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony – namely aggravated robbery – in connection with the Jan. 10 killing of 38-year-old Otis Elder. Speed, who was 17 when Elder was shot, told the court during his plea hearing that he had a handgun when he and others tried to rob Elder of drugs in St. Paul, and there was a struggle and a shot was fired. Speed said he had no memory of pulling the trigger and didn’t know if his accomplice was armed. As St. Paul police were investigating Elder’s murder, they identified Speed as a suspect and obtained search warrants for Minneapolis apartments associated with him. Locke, Speed’s cousin, was not a target of the investigation and was not named in the warrants, but he was in one of the apartments as a Minneapolis SWAT team entered the unit without knocking on Feb. 2. Video showed Locke, 22, who was Black, was shot seconds after police entered the apartment before 7 a.m. He was on a sofa wrapped in a comforter, and video showed he was holding a gun in the moments before he was shot. Minnesota prosecutors declined to file charges the against Officer Mark Hanneman, saying his use of deadly force was justified.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia: With a population of 64, the village of Satartia in Yazoo County is Mississippi’s smallest town, but it will soon hold a celebration of something unusually large – a fictional catfish named Eli that lives in the nearby Yazoo River. The Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River Festival on July 30 will be an evening of music, food, fireworks and might be one of the only festivals around where you can rent a catfish. “It’s going to be epic,” said Michele Harris, president and event coordinator of the non-profit Moving Satartia Forward. “It’s going to be so much fun.” Eli isn’t a real catfish. He’s the focus of an award-winning children’s book; Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River. He lives in the river under a bridge, which is a stone’s throw from the village. In the book, a boy and girl set out to do what no one has done – catch the legendary fish. Instead, they develop a friendship with Eli and become his protectors. Eli is now a part of the town’s identity. There’s even a 3,500-pound wooden sculpture of the fish in downtown Satartia created by artist Alexander Brown.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis has joined a growing list of Democrat-led cities seeking to help women gain abortion access, even in red states that have largely banned the procedure. Not long after Democratic Mayor Tishaura Jones signed a measure providing $1 million for travel to abortion clinics in other states, Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued to stop what he called a “blatantly illegal move to spend Missourians’ hard-earned tax dollars on out-of-state abortions.” The give-and-take is emblematic of city versus state fight playing out since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The St. Louis law called for using federal COVID-19 relief money for a “Reproductive Equity Fund.” The funding is part of a larger health care package that also offers postpartum support, lactation help, doula assistance and money for COVID-19 testing and vaccine incentives. Jones said during a news conference before signing the bill that she expected a lawsuit from Schmitt, who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in the Aug. 2 primary, and who has filed dozens of lawsuits ranging from efforts to halt mask mandates in schools to a suit against China over the coronavirus.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A helicopter search crew looking for two missing Montana climbers in Glacier National Park spotted their bodies Monday, park officials said in a statement. The men, both 67, were reported overdue Sunday from their planned climb of Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s center. They set out for the climb on Thursday and planned to hike out on Friday. Park rangers found their vehicle at a trailhead Sunday and search crews first took to the air later that day, park officials said. Authorities were making a plan to recover the men’s bodies and their belongings, the park statement said. Their identities were not immediately disclosed.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts remains noncommittal about calling a special legislative session to address abortion, despite many Republican lawmakers pushing to outlaw the procedure. Abortion opponents don’t appear to have the 33-vote super majority needed to overcome a filibuster waged by abortion-rights supporters. Abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Nebraska. Those seeking an abortion must receive counseling and wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. People under 19 must have parental consent to undergo an abortion.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thirteen Nevada Republicans announced a new coalition to endorse Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford in his re-election bid against their party’s nominee, Sigal Chattah, a conservative who bested a more moderate Republican primary contender. The announcement of “Republicans for Ford,” first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, signaled a major shift in party support as the group is headlined by a former rival of Ford’s – former state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson, along with former GOP Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian. Chattah won the June Republican primary by 11 percentage points over Tisha Black, a more moderate candidate who had the backing of Nevada’s Republican establishment. A Las Vegas-based lawyer, she is one of a few conservative GOP candidates in Nevada who won their primary races against more moderate opponents. Chattah sued Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak over pandemic restrictions on behalf of a church and has often painted Black as a Democratic sympathizer throughout the primary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state sued several pharmacy chains Tuesday, becoming the latest government entity seeking to hold them accountable for fueling the nation’s opioid epidemic. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General John Formella called CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and their subsidiaries “the last link in the opioid supply chain and the critical gatekeeper between dangerous opioid narcotics in the public.” It accused the companies of flouting their duty to protect public health and safety by failing to stop suspicious prescriptions and diverted drugs. Opioids – including prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly produced fentanyl – have been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000, and the number of cases reached a record high in 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBernards: Capt. Robert Terry and his wife Estelle were posthumously awarded the Tuskegee Airmen Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony Thursday at the couple’s former home across from the original Somerset Hills Airfield off Lord Stirling Road. The gold medals were commissioned by President George W. Bush in 2001. “This is outstanding,” said Qaaim Saalik, son of Robert and Estelle Terry, accompanied by his daughters Malika Ra and Ramdasha Bikceem, cousin David Booker and close family friend Kumar Best. “I am very proud of them. I know my parents would look down on this occasion with great, great joy.” Brooks Betz, researcher for the Mr. Local History Project, campaigned for the couple’s honors. Over two years, he prepared a detailed story about the couple’s experiences with the Airmen. Robert Terry served as a Tuskegee Airmen flight instructor and pilot from 1943 to 1945. He helped train 992 pilots, 350 of whom were deployed in the war and served with distinction. A licensed pilot, Estelle Terry might have been the first Black woman pilot in New Jersey, Betz said. She also served among the 14,000-member ground support personnel as a mail clerk and packing parachutes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Mayor Tim Keller said the city’s most visible unsanctioned homeless encampment will close next month. Keller said the exact date for Coronado Park’s closing hasn’t been decided. City officials said an estimated 120 people camp nightly at the park and occupants will be told about other housing options. They said increasingly dangerous conditions such as narcotics trafficking and usage combined with prolonged damage to the park’s irrigation and vegetation created safety concerns and were the leading factors in the decision to close the park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A preacher known for his close friendship with Mayor Eric Adams was robbed of more than $1 million worth of jewelry Sunday by armed bandits who crashed his Brooklyn church service, just as he was sermonizing about keeping faith in the face of grave adversity, police said. Bishop Lamor Miller-Whitehead, who embraces his flashy lifestyle and can often be seen driving around the Big Apple in a Rolls Royce, was delivering a sermon at his Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries when police said three robbers walked in. They showed guns and demanded property from Miller-Whitehead and his wife, Asia K. DosReis-Whitehead, police said. The service was also being livestreamed online. In the video, which appears to have been removed from the church’s social media channels, Miller-Whitehead is heard asking his flock, “How many of you have lost your faith because you saw somebody else die?” moments before the robbers entered the church. He’s then seen dropping to his hands and knees and repeatedly saying, “all right, all right,” before a man holding a gun and wearing a black sweatshirt enters the frame. The man, who was also wearing a black mask, is then seen approaching Miller-Whitehead, who was hiding behind a gold-colored lectern, and stuffing the bishop’s jewelry into his pockets. Another man, dressed in similar garb, is then seen heading toward Miller-Whitehead, lingering near him for a few minutes and then running off. Miller-Whitehead said in a video posted to Instagram that the robbers ripped his collar off to grab his chain and held a gun to his infant daughter’s face while stealing his wife’s jewelry. Police said the robbers fled in a white Mercedes that was last seen on Avenue D near the church, in Brooklyn’s Canarsie neighborhood. Neither Miller-Whitehead, 44, nor DosReis-Whitehead, 38, were physically injured, police said. They daughter was also unharmed.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A construction worker at Charlotte Douglas International Airport was electrocuted, according to a California-based company for whom he worked. The Charlotte Observer reported Rosendin Electric, a company based in San Jose, California, filed a report Monday morning confirming Sunday’s death at the airport. John Mallow, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said the death was caused by electrocution. The worker’s identity has not been released and the labor department is investigating the incident, Mallow said. It’s not immediately known what project the worker was involved with when he died, or what time it happened. The airport began several construction projects in 2015. The west side of a $608 million terminal lobby expansion recently opened to passengers, but some parts of the lobby, such as ticketing booths and additional lighting, are still being installed. There also are other ongoing projects across the airport complex.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Republican U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer said the U.S. Environment Protection Agency awarded $280,000 to the state Department of Environmental Quality to implement a program to provide drinking water assistance to underserved, small and disadvantaged communities in the Tri-County Water District.\n\nOhio\n\nMilford Township: A medical helicopter responding to the scene of a fatal accident crashed early Tuesday when it hit power lines, but no one on board the aircraft was seriously injured, authorities said. Three crew members were in the CareFlight helicopter on the way to an accident involving two pickup trucks that occurred about 4:15 a.m. in Milford Township, according to the Butler County Sheriff’s Office. The aircraft was approaching the scene when it crashed into the power lines and went down. According to a statement issued by CareFlight, no patients were in the aircraft, which was being operated by Air Methods, and the crew members were able to safely exit the helicopter. The cause of the crash will be investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration. Butler County Chief Deputy Anthony Dwyer told WXIX-TV that one crew member suffered “an unknown injury” and was taken to a hospital. The other two crew members were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Authorities said one person was killed in the vehicle accident and three other people were injured. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A couple has been charged in the death of a woman whose body was found last year wrapped in plastic in the basement of a home. Margarita Sandoval, 19, had been missing for three years when police found her body in May 2021 in a box hidden underneath some stairs in a home in Norman. After a 14-month investigation, Normal police charged Sandoval’s brother, 35-year-old Octavio Sanchez, and her sister-in-law, 27-year-old Desiree Sanchez, each with murder and unlawful removal of a dead body. Earlier this month, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Sandoval’s death a homicide. Investigators said Sandoval had moved in with the couple in their Norman home in January 2018. Several months later, other family members began looking for Sandoval after not hearing from her. Police said Sandoval, who had limited cognitive abilities, had called authorities to report that the couple had been abusive to her. Police alleged the Sanchez couple had continued to collect Sandoval’s disability payments up until her body was discovered.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Temperatures soared to 102 degrees Fahrenheit in Oregon’s largest city on Tuesday, which was expected to be the hottest day of a scorching spell that will be unusually long for this part of the U.S. It was also a new daily record for the city for July 26, besting the previous high set in 2020. Oregon health officials said there has been an uptick in the number of people reporting heat-related illness in emergency departments, and the number of those calling emergency services numbers for similar symptoms. “Heat-related illness daily visits are above expected levels statewide,” said Jonathan Modie, lead communications officer at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division. He said there were 32 such visits to emergency departments on Monday compared to three to five per day before the heat wave began. Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency across much of the state, warning the extreme temperatures might cause utility outages and transportation disruptions. Portland officials opened cooling centers in public buildings and installed misting stations in parks. TriMet, which operates public transportation in the Portland metropolitan area, will allow passengers who cannot afford fares to ride for free when heading to cooling centers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBaden: Punk’s Ice Cream Shoppe has been forced to temporarily close after a car crashed into the building Sunday night. Owner Mariellen Ketterer said the incident occurred about 7 p.m. when a car struck the building’s left side along State Avenue in Baden. The shop was open for business at the time but was forced to close immediately, and Ketterer announced on Facebook it would remain closed until further notice. It is unknown why the car crashed into the building or if the driver or anyone else was injured during the accident. Officers from the Baden Police Department were unavailable to comment on Monday afternoon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The ACLU of Rhode Island said it is concerned a system recording audio and video in the City Clerk’s office might be illegally capturing conversations between visitors in the room. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown wrote to Mayor Roberto L. DaSilva earlier this month, after receiving a complaint from someone visiting City Hall who saw a sign indicating that video and audio surveillance was taking place. In his letter, Brown asked DaSilva for more information about the system and asked that he “take immediate steps to address the legitimate privacy concerns that this surveillance technology raises.” DaSilva, in a three-page response to Brown, wrote a video system has been in place since 2014, but that audio in the clerk’s office was added several weeks ago after “a few customer complaints related to their interactions with city employees.” “Please be assured that the City believes that its use and placement of cameras and audio recordings is fully compliant and consistent with ‘reasonable expectations of privacy’ and various statutory requirements,” DaSilva said in his letter to Brown.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolina can continue enforcing its six-week abortion ban after a judge denied a request to temporarily block it amid a legal fight that is now headed to the state Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and other plaintiffs had asked the judge for an injunction while their lawsuit challenging the ban moves through the courts. The lawsuit argued the law violates the state constitution’s rights to privacy and equal protection. South Carolina Deputy Solicitor General Thomas Hydrick on Tuesday argued voters did not intend to cover abortion rights when they approved the state’s right to privacy in 1971.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:An animal rights organization filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking for an investigation into a Sanford Research scientist. The complaint from Stop Animal Exploitation Now was filed by the group after it obtained a document showing that privileges to perform experiments on animals by Shanta Messerli had been permanently revoked. A letter from Sanford Research to the USDA’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare indicated Messerli’s privileges were revoked in January 2021. After an appeal to the Sanford Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, her privileges were restored to perform two specific experiments under direct supervision. But the letter, signed by David Pearce, the president of innovation and research for Sanford’s World Clinic, said Messerli received a subsequent report of noncompliance while conducting an experiment with funding from the Department of Defense. The USDA has the authority to regulate animal research laboratories. The self-reported letter from Sanford Research to USDA was dated May 2. A Sanford spokesperson did not immediately respond for comment. The USDA did not immediately respond.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a new commander for the second time in about a month. Col. Brian D. Sawser assumed command of the expansive district at a ceremony Friday in Memphis, the Corps said in a news release. Lt. Col. Robert W. Green had been named commander in mid-June, and the Corps had said Green would be handing over command to Sawser this month. Sawser now leads a district that covers 25,000 square miles in parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. He is responsible for flood damage reduction, navigation, environmental stewardship, emergency operations and other civil works along 610 miles of the Mississippi River and the White River. The district manages levees, tributaries, harbors and navigation channels connected to the river.\n\nTexas\n\nBalch Springs: A grass fire apparently sparked on the shoulder of a freeway swept about 300 yards across tinder-dry open field to a suburban Dallas subdivision Monday, burning through wooden fences and torching a row of at least eight homes on the subdivision’s edge. The blaze was the latest in drought-stricken north Texas, which has been vulnerable to wildfires for at least two weeks. It was initially unknown what sparked the fire just off Interstate 20 in Balch Springs about 4 p.m. Monday. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Aerial video showed the fire spread up and down the street as firefighters and homeowners working in 103 degree heat tried to prevent the fire from spreading to more of the bricked frame homes. One end of the fire spread to a home where a panicked dog ran back and forth before running through a pet door at a neighboring home. The dog’s fate was not immediately known. Fire crews from Dallas and other nearby suburbs have gone to the scene to assist Balch Springs crews.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 6,870 new cases. That’s down 11.8% from the previous week’s total of 7,789. Utah ranked 34th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Cases fell in seven counties, with the largest declines in Salt Lake County, with 2,765 cases from 3,162 a week earlier; in Utah County, with 1,156 cases from 1,284; and in Tooele County, with 167 cases from 226.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Federal prosecutors said a man charged with killing his mother at sea in 2016 in a plot to inherit millions should remain behind bars pending trial because he poses a flight risk and danger to others. The prosecutors filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Burlington on Friday, opposing a request by Nathan Carman to be released. Carman, 28, who lives in Vernon, was charged in May with killing his mother, Linda, of Middletown during a fishing trip in 2016 off the coast of New England in which his boat sank. He was found floating in a raft and rescued eight days after departing from a Rhode Island marina. He pleaded not guilty in May in his mother’s death. Prosecutors also have accused Carman of killing his grandfather, John Chakalos, who they said was shot in his home in Windsor in 2013 as part of a scheme to obtain money and property from his grandfather’s estate. Carman has not been charged in that case. Earlier this month, Carman’s attorneys filed a motion seeking his release, saying the evidence against him is “tenuous at best” and he does not pose a flight risk or danger. The attorneys said Carman is willing to surrender his passport, submit to electronic monitoring and turn over all the money he has – $10,000 – to a third party or post some of that money as bail.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state police has temporarily reduced the operating hours for its Med-Flight helicopter service in central and southwest Virginia because of a shortage of pilots. The state police said until more pilots can be hired and trained, the service has been reduced from 24-hour coverage to 16 hours a day, from 8 a.m. through midnight, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The changes went into effect on Sunday. In the meantime, private, for-hire air ambulance services such as those offered by VCU Health Systems and HCA Hospitals will fill the gap in the Richmond area. Med-Flight is free, but the private services bill patients for the transport. In most cases, the fee is covered by a patient’s health care insurance.\n\nWashington\n\nRoyal City: A Moses Lake woman drowned Sunday trying to rescue a dog in a canal, according to the Grant County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies and medics responded at about 12:45 p.m. to a report of a woman who fell into a canal off Dodson Road Southwest, near Road 12 Southwest, about 3 miles east of Royal City, the Longview Daily News reported. Witnesses told deputies the 46-year-old woman, later identified as Brigetta Delgado, was trying to rescue a dog when she fell into the canal. She went under and did not resurface, becoming trapped by the turbulence in a plunge pool. Her body was recovered once the water released its grip. Delgado’s body was transported to the coroner’s office for an autopsy and her family was notified.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is now able to process some services that have been affected by a system mainframe outage. The agency is using a workaround to process commercial driver’s licenses, driver’s licenses, instruction permits and driver’s license reinstatement transactions, according to a news release Tuesday from the Department of Transportation. The division is continuing to work with the Office of Technology to restore all services, the release said. Customers should visit the DMV website for up-to-date alerts before they visit a regional office or try the online portal, the Department of Transportation said. The outage was first reported last Wednesday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Former President Donald Trump plans to visit Wisconsin to campaign for his endorsed candidate for governor, Tim Michels – an announcement made just two days after Michels said he wouldn’t prioritize a key piece of Trumps’ agenda: to decertify the 2020 presidential election results. Trump plans to hold a rally at the Waukesha County Fairgrounds at 7 p.m. Aug. 5, the Friday before the Aug. 9 primary election. Gates are expected to open at 2 p.m., with first speakers to deliver remarks at 4, followed by Trump at 7. Michels faces former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Tim Ramthun in the Republican primary for governor and has surged in recent polling to the top of the field as he spends millions of his own money to blanket television airwaves since entering the race in April. The primary winner will go on to run against Democratic incumbent Gov. Tony Evers in the general election.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A lawsuit filed Monday by a Casper women’s health clinic and others seeks to block Wyoming’s new abortion ban just before it’s scheduled to take effect. The lawsuit claimed the new law violates the state constitution with restrictions that will discourage potentially life-saving pregnancy health care in Wyoming, forcing pregnant women to go to other states for necessary procedures. As with all Wyoming laws challenged in court, Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill will defend the new law set to go into effect Wednesday, Michael Pearlman, spokesman for Gov. Mark Gordon, said by email. Gordon, a Republican, signed the ban on nearly all abortion in Wyoming in March. The ban was to take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which happened June 24. After a more than three-week review, Hill last week gave the go-ahead for Gordon to certify the law to take effect Wednesday. The law will outlaw abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. Wyoming until now has allowed abortions up to the point of viability outside the mother, or about 23 weeks into pregnancy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/15/alaska-volcano-field-dreams-seal-pup-visits-beach-news-around-states/50072729/", "title": "Alaska volcano, 'Field of Dreams,' seal pup visits beach: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFultondale: Marcel Walker was sworn in Tuesday as police chief of the Fultondale Police Department after serving as interim chief since early March. He replaced D.P. Smith, who retired in November after 35 years in law enforcement, six as chief. Walker began his law enforcement career in 1997 as a patrol officer with the Birmingham Police Department. He also worked as a narcotics and homicide investigator in the department’s North Precinct. In 2011, he was promoted to sergeant and supervised at the city’s South Precinct.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Hundreds of small earthquakes have been reported near a volcano in southeast Alaska believed to have been dormant for at least 800 years. The cause of the quakes under Mount Edgecumbe, a volcano near Sitka that resembles Mount Fuji in Japan, are not known. However, they might not be an indication of volcanic activity, said Dave Schneider, a research geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage. Mount Edgecumbe is a 3,200-foot stratovolcano located on Kruzof Island, about 15 miles west of Sitka. The volcano is part of a larger underwater volcanic field of lava domes and craters. The quakes are somewhat unusual because temblors in the area are usually tectonic, not volcanic, he said, adding there is no need for a huge amount of concern at this time. The last Mount Edgecumbe eruption preserved in the geologic record was about 4,500 years ago.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Embry Health said it was forced to close 60 coronavirus tests sites in Arizona because of a lack of funding. The Health Resources and Services Administration provided funding for uninsured people to get free tests. On March 22, the HRSA ran out of money. Embry continued to fund testing for the uninsured until April 5. As 60 testing Embry sites in Arizona have closed, 37 other test sites in other states also have been closed because of the lack of funding. Embry started circulating a petition to keep providing free tests to people. It had more than 31,000 signatures as of Wednesday night. There are 79 Embry test sites still operating across Arizona.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Attorneys for an Arkansas jail and doctor being sued by inmates who said they were unknowingly given ivermectin to treat COVID-19 said the lawsuit should be dismissed because the men are no longer being held in the county facility. In a motion filed Tuesday, attorneys for the Washington County jail and Dr. Robert Karas noted the four inmates who filed the lawsuit are now being held in state prisons. Sheriff Tim Helder in August revealed that Karas had prescribed ivermectin to treat some inmates with COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions. The FDA has not approved its use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. The inmates said they were never told ivermectin was among the medications they had been given to treat COVID-19, and instead were told they were being given vitamins, antibiotics or steroids.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSantee: A stolen pickup truck with police SWAT gear and weapons inside was recovered and a suspect was arrested after a pursuit near San Diego, authorities said. The silver Ford F-150 was reported stolen – or possibly carjacked – about 9 p.m. Wednesday near a 7-Eleven store in Santee, said San Diego County sheriff’s Lt. Scott Roller. Among the items believed to be inside a lockbox in the truck were a bulletproof vest and “possible firearms,” Roller told the San Diego Union-Tribune. The property was believed to be the property of the El Cajon Police Department or an officer from that agency, he said. The truck was spotted in eastern San Diego County about three hours later and the driver led law enforcement on a high-speed pursuit before crashing into a fire hydrant, the Union-Tribune reported. The driver was arrested after a short foot chase.\n\nColorado\n\nLas Animas: Two wind-whipped grassland fires in rural southeastern Colorado destroyed two homes, briefly closed a state highway and forced temporary evacuations in the unincorporated community of Fort Lyon, fire officials said. The fires erupted Tuesday west and east of the town of Las Animas and had blackened nearly 8 square miles by Wednesday, according to the Bent County Office of Emergency Management. Crews had contained 25% of a fire that threatened Bent’s Old Fort National Historical Site in Otero County. The blaze fed on brush surrounding structures on the property – site of a 17th-century trading post along the Santa Fe trail – until La Junta firefighters beat it back, KKTV reported. A second fire east of Las Animas briefly forced evacuations near Fort Lyon. Crews from across the state were working the blazes. The cause of the fires is unknown.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut Attorney General William Tong has tested positive for the coronavirus, his office said. Tong, 48, is experiencing mild symptoms and will remain in isolation for five days, according to a news release from his office Wednesday. The announcement of Tong’s positive test came the same day that Gov. Ned Lamont left quarantine after testing positive for the virus last week. The Democratic attorney general is fully vaccinated and boosted, his office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: A grey seal pup has found its way to the sand in Dewey Beach on Thursday morning. Dewey Beach police have been watching the seal as respondents from the Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute in Lewes work to monitor the pup and educate the public. Although MERR is waiting on more information to determine the health and status of the seal, Executive Director Suzanne Thurman said it’s common for pups to rest on Delaware beaches, especially after being weaned from their mothers. She said it’s possible that this pup could be a member of the seasonal seal colony off the coast of Lewes – a local colony that has been growing over the last decade – but it’s also common for pups to find respite in Delaware as they head south from northern destinations in New England. Seal pups often spend more time outside the water while they’re molting, a process similar to a snake shedding its skin or birds losing feather where the seal’s “baby fur” falls away as they mature.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said a bus full of undocumented migrants arrived in D.C. on Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Abbott first announced April 6 the state would send people who are undocumented and crossing the U.S. border from Mexico to the steps of the US Capitol. Abbott’s announcement came as he voiced opposition to President Joe Biden lifting Title 42, the public health policy the Trump administration started during the COVID-19 pandemic. It allows the government to quickly expel migrants and asylum seekers who come to the U.S. from countries where an infectious disease -- such as COVID-19 -- is present. Abbott said the bus that arrived in D.C. on Wednesday was filled with migrants from Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. More migrants were seen arriving at Union Station on Thursday morning. The governor did not specify how many migrants total are being bused to D.C.. It was not specified what, if any, resources the migrants would be provided.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Emergency preparedness officials warned Floridians not to get complacent during the upcoming hurricane season, particularly in coastal areas that haven’t experienced strong storms recently. Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center, said they worried that many Floridians living in coastal communities have become complacent about making hurricane preparations because theey haven’t lived through major storms in recent years. Some of these coastal communities act like a cat “with nine lives” in that hurricanes seem to be heading their way but then change course at the last minute, lulling residents into believing their neighborhoods will never be hit, Criswell said at the National Hurricane Conference in Orlando. Forecasters at Colorado State University are predicting the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season will have 19 named storms and nine hurricanes, slightly higher than the yearly average for the past three decades. The season starts in June and ends in November.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock said his fundraising has set a record as Georgia’s Senate campaign shapes up to be one of this year’s most expensive races. Warnock reported Thursday he raised $13.6 million in the first three months of 2022, outpacing what was a hefty $9.8 million raised in the last three months of 2021. The senator’s campaign said it was the most money raised by a U.S. Senate candidate in the first quarter of an election year, giving Warnock $25.6 million in cash on-hand. Warnock is a heavy favorite to defeat Tamara Johnson-Shealey in the Democratic primary. Republican Herschel Walker is the front-runner among six GOP candidates in the May 24 primary. Libertarian Chase Oliver will also be on the general election ballot in November.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Mayor Rick Blangiardi, 75, tested positive Wednesday for the coronavirus, his office said. “He is currently isolating and resting at home and is in good spirits despite experiencing mild symptoms related to the infection,” his office said in a release. Blangiardi is fully vaccinated and boosted, his office said. He was scheduled to get his second booster shot later this week, said spokesperson Ian Scheuring. This is Blangiardi’s first time contracting COVID-19, Scheuring said. The office is notifying those who had close contact with the mayor in recent days. The mayor is working remotely as needed and is expected to remain out of the office until sometime next week, his office said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a request by the Roman Catholic Church in Idaho to intervene in a lawsuit over a new Idaho law banning nearly all abortions. The court did not explain why the church was excluded after the Diocese of Boise on Monday asked to be allowed to join the lawsuit in support of the ban. Idaho last month became the first state to enact legislation modeled after a Texas statute banning abortions after about six weeks. The Idaho law would allow the potential fathers, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles the aborted baby to sue abortion providers for at least $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortions. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but rapists’ relatives have permission to do so. The Diocese of Boise on Wednesday didn’t immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment about the high court’s decision.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: The Murray Baker Bridge will be lit in white, sparkling lights overnight on Friday for Good Friday and on Sunday for Easter. The bridge will be lit in “white sparkle dynamic” — a slow, random blinking, creating a sparkling effect, said city spokesperson Stacy Peterson. “Community members have really enjoyed the variety of color schemes that we’ve used in the past, but this weekend people will enjoy the slow sparkle of white lights across this landmark cantilever bridge,” she said. It will be the second annual special bridge lighting for both days. New multi-hued LED lights were added to the bridge when its deck was reconstructed in 2020.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: Homeowners in a lake-filled housing development in northern Indiana will no longer be on the hook for major repairs to six aging dams under a new state law. An amended law that takes effect July 1 removes the state Department of Natural Resources’ jurisdiction over the dams at the Hidden Hills housing addition near the city of Peru, the Kokomo Tribune reported. Larry West, who owns property on one of the dams, said the cost to make repairs under DNR regulations would have been up to $4 million. But now, the dams’ maintenance costs will be about $100,000. Dams previously fell under DNR jurisdiction if they met one of three criteria. But the amended statute now requires dams to meet two of those criteria to fall under DNR’s jurisdiction.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: The new owners of the “Field of Dreams” movie site plan to use $80million in private investment to make the popular tourist attraction a destination for youth baseball and softball tournaments. The Des Moines Register reported that Go the Distance said in a news release the money will be used to build baseball and softball fields, team dormitories and a hotel, among other improvements. Go the Distance’s CEO is longtime Chicago White Sox star and Hall of Famer Frank Thomas. The site in rural Dyersville, Iowa, has long been a popular destination since the 1989 Kevin Costner movie. Thomas’ group purchased controlling interest in the site last year for an undisclosed amount. The company said it expects the overhaul to be completed in phases by the end of 2023.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A judge dismissed a legal challenge by voting rights advocates to two provisions of a state election law enacted last year. Four voting rights groups, including the League of Women Voters of Kansas, argued in a lawsuit filed in June that the law will make it more difficult for several groups, including the disabled, senior citizens and minorities, to vote. Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson dismissed the groups’ challenges to a provision that restricts people from delivering ballots for other voters, and another provision that requires election officials to match the signature on an advanced ballot to the one on record. In her ruling, Watson said any restrictions on voting access were outweighed by the state’s interest in preventing voter fraud, The Topeka Capitol-Journal reported. The voting rights groups are currently appealing an earlier decision by Watson that allowed the state to enforce the law.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Abortion-rights groups went to court Thursday seeking to restore abortion services in Kentucky, a day after the two remaining abortion clinics signaled they couldn’t immediately comply with new restrictions imposed by the Legislature. Two lawsuits filed in federal court in Louisville asked a judge to intervene to block the law from taking effect while the case is litigated. The GOP-dominated Legislature overturned Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of the sweeping abortion measure Wednesday. As lawmakers voted, abortion-rights activists standing vigil near the chambers chanted “bans off our bodies,” which echoed through the statehouse. The new law includes 72 pages of revisions to Kentucky’s abortion laws, with many new requirements that clinics must meet. Kentucky’s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, said he is ready to defend the new law.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Legislature could end public health emergency declarations by future governors under legislation approved Wednesday by a House committee in Baton Rouge. A 6-5 vote by the House and Governmental Affairs Committee sent the bill by Republican state Rep. Lawrence Frieman of Abita Springs to the full House. The bill comes after two years of periodic conflicts between some lawmakers and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards over now-expired emergencies declared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frieman’s bill, as amended by the committee, would enable the Legislature to end an emergency declaration – or remove some provisions of one – by a petition signed by a majority of the House and of the Senate. It tweaks state law allowing either chamber by itself to end an emergency declaration, which was challenged and blocked in state court. The bill applies to declared states of disaster or emergency. In the case of public health emergencies, it requires lawmakers to consult with a public health specialist before petitioning to end or alter the emergency declaration.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government has approved a proposal to increase at-sea monitoring of some commercial fishing trips to 100%. At-sea monitors are workers who collect data on board commercial fishing boats to help inform regulations and management of species. The government approved the new, higher percentage of trip cover Tuesday, said Michael Pentony, a regional administrator with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The rules apply to valuable species that are harvested in the Northeast such as cod, haddock and flounder. Pentony said the new rules will replace the process of calculating a target for the level of monitoring coverage every year. The coverage target will instead be 100% for four years as long as federal funding can support agency and industry costs, he wrote in a letter to fishery managers. At-sea monitoring is a controversial subject in commercial fisheries because many fishermen see it as an added cost that complicates fishing trips. The practice is depicted in the 2021 movie “Coda.”\n\nMaryland\n\nPomfret: State officials confirmed that a man found dead in his home earlier this year with more than 100 snakes died of a snake bite. A medical examiner’s office told local news outlets Wednesday the victim died of “snake envenomation” and the death was accidental. The 49-year-old man was found dead at his home in Charles County in January. Authorities said at the time that 124 snakes were inside, including venomous rattlesnakes, cobras and black mambas, according to WTOP, which reported it took hours to get them all out of the house.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Tuition across all University of Massachusetts campuses will increase this fall for the first time in three years, ending a pandemic-era freeze as the higher education system’s leaders grapple with dark financial clouds on the horizon. UMass overseers voted 12-2 on Wednesday to approve a package of tuition and fee hikes first proposed at a committee meeting last week. Two student trustees, Derek Houle of UMass Lowell and Narcisse Kunda of UMass Dartmouth, cast the only dissenting votes. Tens of thousands of in-state undergraduate UMass students face a 2.5% jump in tuition for the 2022-2023 academic year, representing between $346 and $395 more a year, as well as increases in room-and-board costs ranging from 1.9% to 3.9%. Out-of-state undergraduates face roughly similar tuition increases next year, as do all graduate students at the Amherst, Boston and Lowell campuses\n\nMichigan\n\nHowell: Drivers on a portion of East Grand River Avenue can expect detours and possibly delays throughout the summer as work takes place to replace water mains, officials said in a news release. On Monday, construction company Hubbell, Roth & Clark will begin replacing water mains and leads along East Grand River, from Barnard Street to Lucy Road. According to the release, traffic will continue during construction, but temporary lane closures and detours will occur. Mail service and trash collection will continue throughout the construction process. The project is expected to be completed by fall.\n\nMinnesota\n\nTaopi: Residents of a small farming community in southeastern Minnesota are working to recover from a tornado that destroyed half of the town’s homes, toppled tall trees and left piles of debris in its wake. An EF2 tornado with peak wind speeds of 130 mph struck Taopi near the Iowa border late Tuesday, tearing the roofs off houses, overturning vehicles and bringing down power lines. There were no reports of serious injuries. Volunteers from the area arrived Wednesday to help residents clean up the debris in the community of about 80 people. Family members sifted through rubble looking for keepsakes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves is defending his decision to again name April as Confederate Heritage Month, nearly two years after he signed a law retiring the last state flag in the U.S. that featured a Confederate battle emblem. The Republican governor signed a proclamation without fanfare Friday. It does not mention slavery – the defense of which was Mississippi’s stated reason for trying to secede from the U.S. In response to a question at a news conference Wednesday, Reeves said he issued a Confederate Heritage Month proclamation “in the same manner and fashion that the five governors that came before me, Republicans and Democrats alike, for over 30 years have done.” Four governors before Reeves – not five – issued Confederate Heritage Month proclamations. By state law, Mississippi also has a Confederate Heritage Day in April, which is a holiday for state employees.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The GOP-led state House voted to allow local elections over whether to ban transgender girls from competing on K-12 girls’ sports teams. House members voted 89-40 in favor of adding Republican Rep. Chuck Bayse’s proposal as an amendment to an elections bill in a late-session attempt to pass the legislation before lawmakers’ mid-May deadline. Under the amendment, Bayse said public school boards and administrators could call elections over whether to allow transgender girls to compete on all-girls sports teams. Bayse said the goal of the measure is “to protect women’s sports.” He said transgender girls have an unfair advantage against other girls and parents should have a chance to weigh in on the policy. Missouri’s current public high school sports rules prohibit transgender girls from competing on girls teams unless they’re undergoing hormone therapy.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Malmstrom Air Force Base announced an “all clear” and is resuming normal activity on base after earlier reports of a “suspicious package.” According to the update, the package was determined to be a “nonthreat.” The package was reportedly found at Building 400, which was evacuated along with Buildings 45202, 1710, 1712, 1205, 44200, 1531 and 407, according to a post from the base.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State and federal agriculture officials have confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in a flock of 1.7 million laying hens in northeast Nebraska. The Nebraska and U.S. departments of agriculture said the outbreak in Dixon County is the largest of the highly contagious virus in the state, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. State Veterinarian Roger Dudley said the farm has been quarantined and the birds will be euthanized. Post Holdings said in a news release the farm is owned by its Michael Foods subsidiary, which has several egg farms in the area. The company said the 1.7 million birds represent about 4% of its total egg-laying supply. During a bird flu outbreak in 2015, nearly 5 million birds had to be destroyed in Dixon County.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The metro Las Vegas school district will provide electronic panic-button devices to teachers as it moves to boost security in the wake of incidents that include a violent after-school attack that left a teacher injured and unconscious in her classroom. In addition to providing teachers with panic devices equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, the Clark County School District will upgrade security cameras and ask police agencies to increase their presence at schools, officials said Tuesday. The panic devices will be issued first at El Dorado High School, the site of last week’s attack. A 16-year-old student faces sex assault and attempted murder charges in the incident.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Police are searching for a driver who led them on a pursuit on Interstate 93 in Concord before fleeing from a crash, and they found some suspected fentanyl left behind, authorities said Thursday. A trooper attempted to stop the northbound car in Bow at about 12:20 a.m., which reached a speed of 115 mph, police said in a news release. The driver lost control of the car while attempting to avoid stop sticks and one tire deflated, police said. The car went off the road into a median, and the driver fled. Police said they found 100 grams of suspected fentanyl at the scene. They said they have a person of interest in connection to what happened, but did not identify the person.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Long Branch: A new Monmouth University poll showed nearly two-thirds of residents oppose bringing back mask mandates and social distancing requirements as New Jersey sees an uptick in COVID-19 cases because of a new variant. It's a reversal from last fall, when 6-in-10 voters backed masking requirements. In this poll, released Thursday, just 1-in-3 supported masking and 64% opposed it. Support for bringing back COVID restrictions has declined among every partisan group, the poll showed, but the largest drop was among Democrats — from 89% who supported the measures in September to 50% who back them now. The poll also said concern about COVID illness is at a record low. The poll came amid a rise in cases from the BA.2 variant, a highly infectious strain of the coronavirus. Cases are expected to rise with the upcoming spring holidays, too, Gov. Phil Murphy said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRuidoso: The remains of a New Mexico couple were found near their burned home as a wind-driven wildfire charred more than 200 residences on the edge of a mountain community in the southern part of the state. Fire crews on Thursday pointed to a break in what has been a steady stream of relentless gusts as their chance to make headway against the wildfire, which is believed to have killed the two people, Ruidoso spokesperson Kerry Gladden said. Police investigators and firefighters found the older couple’s remains Wednesday afternoon after family members notified Ruidoso police that the two had tried to evacuate but were unaccounted for. The remains were found near the home but not in it, and no additional information was immediately available, Gladden said. Authorities were working to confirm the identities of the two people. Authorities have told as many as 4,500 people to evacuate. Overnight, crews kept the flames from pushing further into the village, said Laura Rabon, a spokesperson for Lincoln National Forest. Elsewhere in New Mexico, wildfires were burning northwest of Ruidoso, along the Rio Grande south of Albuquerque, in mountains northwest of the community of Las Vegas and in grasslands along the Pecos River near the town of Roswell.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: A decommissioned World War II-era destroyer docked near downtown Buffalo was taking on water and listing perilously on Thursday. Crews were working to keep the USS The Sullivans from sinking at its berth at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, where it had been open for tours. Park President Paul Marzello said they believe there was a breach on the right side of the hull Wednesday night. He said crews trying to stabilize the 79-year-old vessel are pumping out up to 13,000 gallons a minute. “I think we’ve seen the worst, but I don’t know,” he said. The USS The Sullivans, a National Historic Landmark, was named in honor of the five Sullivan brothers from Waterloo, Iowa. The brothers were killed in action when the USS Juneau was sunk by the Japanese in the South Pacific during World War II. More than $1 million was raised last year to repair the ship’s breached hull. Crews paused work over the winter and were to resume repairs Monday, Marzello said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: City officials have settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former female firefighter who said she endured a hostile work environment in which the fire chief and others inflicted emotional distress. John Hunter, the attorney representing former Asheville firefighter Joy Ponder, confirmed his client will get $155,000 in compensatory damages. She also voluntarily dismissed her claim in U.S. District Court, Hunter said. A trial had been scheduled for May 9. Ponder, who resigned from her post as Asheville Fire Department division chief in September 2020, said she faced years of harassment and gender discrimination from Fire Chief Scott Burnette after she led outside research on the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among city firefighters.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDevils Lake: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed multiple cases of the bird flue in North Dakota in wild birds, backyard poultry and commercial poultry flocks. There have been 31 confirmed cases in wild birds located in Burleigh, Stutsman, LaMoure, Renville and Foster counties. Avian influenza surveillance and testing in wild birds is being done by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the North Dakota Department of Game and Fish. People are asked to report wild sick and dead birds at gf.nd.gov/wildlife/diseases/mortality-report. Wild bird avian influenza questions can be directed at (701) 204-2161.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:Gov. Mike DeWine might skip a rally with former President Donald Trump on April 23 to honor another ex-president: Ulysses S. Grant. DeWine said Thursday he made a commitment to attend the kickoff of Grant's 200th birthday, which is scheduled for 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. April 23 in New Richmond. Trump's event begins at 7 p.m. that day at the Delaware County Fairgrounds – about a 21/ 2 -hour drive away. \"So we'll have to kind of see if that works out,\" DeWine said. The campaign did not immediately respond to a question about whether Lt. Gov. Jon Husted would attend.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 200 of the 422 convicts who got early release on Nov. 4, 2019, have been arrested again, according to a list kept by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Gov. Kevin Stitt is now under fire over the mass commutation he described at the time as giving nonviolent, low-level offenders a second chance. This election year, dark money groups are spending millions of dollars on attack ads that accuse the Republican of being soft on crime. The accusations against the 208 who have been re-arrested ranged from trespassing to murder. Dozens were taken into custody multiple times, bringing the total of arrests to more than 460. One was arrested 15 times. Several were armed. Overall, Stitt signed commutations for more than 520 inmates in November 2019 after their drug and property convictions were no longer considered felonies in state law. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommended the commutations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Climatologists said rare April snow along with rain sweeping across the Pacific Northwest this week could increase water supplies, slow snow melt and lengthen the irrigation season. Impacts, however, will vary by region, and experts predicted drought will persist, the Capital Press reported. Larry O’Neill, state climatologist and professor at Oregon State University, said the statewide average snow-water equivalent April 11 was at 69% of normal compared to 57% of normal last week. But farmers across Oregon face strikingly different outlooks. “If you’re reliant on irrigation or surface water in the southeastern two-thirds of Oregon, you should have a contingency plan in place and be prepared for water shortages,” said Scott Oviatt, snow survey supervisor for Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Students at Pennsylvania’s state-owned universities won’t see tuition increase next year under a unanimous vote Thursday by the the system’s board. The State System of Higher Education’s Board of Governors passed what will be the fourth year of flat tuition, as the struggling system hopes the Legislature will approve hundreds of millions in additional funding in the 2022-23 state budget. The board six months ago sought $550 million in state funding for next year, an increase of about 15%, along with $201 million in student aid and about $75 million in federal funds to help pay for system changes. The board could still increase tuition ahead of the coming school year if the state budget subsidy is not sufficient. Tuition is about $7,700 for in-state undergraduates. The typical graduate leaves with $39,000 in student debt.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Roger Williams University has changed the name of its School of Architecture after hundreds of students and alumni objected to adding “real estate” to its name, saying it would damage the department’s reputation. Last week, the university announced having received a gift of $20 million, the largest in its history, from the Cummings Foundation, whose founders are major real estate entrepreneurs in Massachusetts. In recognition, RWU also announced it was changing the school’s name from the School of Architecture, Art and Historic Preservation to the Cummings School of Architecture and Real Estate. The new name for the school will be Cummings School of Architecture, and housed within the school will be the Cummings Institute for Real Estate, honoring Bill and Joyce Cummings and the Cummings Foundation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A judge ruled a lawsuit brought by four death row inmates challenging South Carolina’s execution methods can move forward as the state attempts to carry out its first execution in more than a decade. Circuit Judge Jocelyn Newman agreed to a request by the prisoners’ attorneys to closely examine officials’ claims that they can’t secure lethal injection drugs, leaving the electric chair and the firing squad as the only options for capital punishment. Attorneys for the inmates, who have largely exhausted their appeals, argued that dying by gunshot or electrocution would be a brutal process which violates a state ban on cruel, corporal and unusual punishments, and that prison officials have shown little proof they can’t get the drugs needed to carry out lethal injections instead. The decision came a week after the state Supreme Court scheduled the April 29 execution of Richard Bernard Moore, 57, who has spent more than two decades on death row after being convicted of the 1999 killing of convenience store clerk James Mahoney in Spartanburg.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The leader of the state Senate on Wednesday named Pennington County prosecutor Mark Vargo as the lead prosecutor for the impeachment trial of state Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg and scheduled it for June 21-22. The announcement from Republican Sen. Lee Schoenbeck came a day after House lawmakers voted to impeach Ravnsborg for a car crash that killed a pedestrian. Ravnsborg, a Republican, is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota history and must take a leave until the Senate decides whether to remove him from office.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State lawmakers are close to sending Republican Gov. Bill Lee a proposal that would threaten felony penalties against homeless people who camp on local public property – including in parks – and misdemeanors for camping around highways. The Senate voted 20-10 on Wednesday to advance the bill, with four Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The House passed a version of the legislation last year. Both Republican-dominated chambers need to hash out differences in what they approved.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott has agreed to ease state inspection requirements for commercial vehicles at one Texas-Mexico border crossing, partially backtracking on his directive after nearly a week of intense backlash and substantial delays at the border. Abbott said Wednesday state troopers will no longer inspect every commercial vehicle entering the country through the Laredo-Colombia Solidarity International Bridge after coming to an agreement with Nuevo León Gov. Samuel Alejandro García Sepúlveda. The states share about 9 miles of border and one port of entry, which processed about 40,000 commercial vehicles during the first two months of the year. In exchange, García said Nuevo León would agree to enhance security enforcement measures at the border. But this agreement still leaves every other Texas-Mexico bridge subject to the inspection mandate, offering little relief to businesses and consumers on both sides of the border. So far, the additional inspections have been limited to bridges in El Paso and Laredo. Abbott said he wants to work with governors of the three other Mexican states bordering Texas – Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Chihuahua – to come to similar agreements, noting that those conversations are slated to start Thursday.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Irrigation ditches created by homesteaders in the late 1800s are being dug up by nonprofit service provider American Conservation Experience Mountain West in the campgrounds of Zion National Park. Of the six historic ditches, four are National Historic Places, and most are underground, covered with years of dirt and debris. For the homesteaders, pioneers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the ditches were a vital artery helping them survive in the arid desert and were something they learned from the Southern Paiute Tribe, who had ditches in the area, Rebecca Finnigan, environmental compliance archivist for the park with the Great Basin Institute, said. Unearthed ditches can be seen in the Watchman and South campgrounds, which are consistently full of visitors throughout the busy season. Last year, Zion saw a record 5 million visitors.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Green Mountain Power’s Sun Match Pilot Program will offer up to 500 eligible customers the opportunity to sign up for a new solar rate that should save an average of about $150 on their electricity bills over the course of a year. To qualify, customers must meet the eligibility requirements for seasonal fuel assistance and have a gross household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty level. The 2022 federal poverty level for a family of four is $27,750, according to HealthCare.gov. The pilot program encourages customers to use energy at times when solar is plentiful – basically daytime hours – to receive power at a discounted rate that will show up as a bill credit. Customers can opt out any time. The program is free to join. Customers can sign up here.\n\nVirginia\n\nWallops Island: Navy divers recovered an aircraft that crashed last month in the water off the Eastern Shore near the Virginia-Maryland line, killing one sailor. The E-2D Hawkeye was conducting routine flight operations in the vicinity of Wallops Island when it went down about 7:30 p.m. on March 30, a Navy spokesperson said. One of the three sailors on the plane died in the crash, and the other two were rescued by Maryland State Police, who found them injured and on top of the partly submerged wreck. The plane, an advanced tactical airborne early warning aircraft, is based out of Naval Station Norfolk and assigned to an East Coast Airborne Command and Control Squadron. The crash remains under investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials with Washington State Ferries said the system is short on staff and in need of dozens of new recruits. A March report from the ferry system said staff shortages are unprecedented in the system’s 70-year history, KING-TV reported. Delays and cancellations have been typical during the pandemic. Washington State Ferry spokesman Ian Sterling said a staffing shortage had been expected even before the pandemic began. The Washington State Ferry system is competing with for-profit companies, particularly for engine room crews, but the system has hired “well over a hundred people in the last six months,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University ceramics students are conducting an annual fundraiser next week to help feed needy families. The 19th annual Empty Bowls event will take place April 22 at Pullman Square in Huntington, the university said in a news release. Marshall students and volunteers are making ceramic bowls to be purchased at the 6-hour event. The bowls are $20 each. Bowls also will be sold online after the event by the Pottery Place. The fundraiser will benefit the Facing Hunger Foodbank. Each bowl sold will provide 180 meals for those in need. The Facing Hunger Foodbank serves 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio. The fundraiser is part of a community impact course in Marshall’s School of Art and Design.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Wisconsin Department of Transportation docked the Merrimac ferry on Thursday because of high winds. The ferry, which connects Highway 113 between Okee in Columbia County and Merrimac in Sauk County, closed at about 9 a.m. as winds began picking up across southern Wisconsin. The ferry began running 24/7 at the end of March after it was idled for the winter. The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory until 7 p.m. Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee recorded a wind gust of 55 mph.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State Rep. Sue Wilson, R-Cheyenne, who has represented District 7 since 2012, has announced her plan to retire, Wyoming.com reported. Since she was elected, Wilson has served as chair of the House Labor, Health and Social Services Committee for the past three years, in addition to four previous years as a committee member. Wilson also served on the Revenue and Appropriations committees.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/21/treehouse-isolation-python-masks-farm-food-bank-news-around-states/111577110/", "title": "Treehouse isolation, python masks: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board reported a 10% increase in sales last month, and medical professionals say the spike in demand may signal struggles with mental health. The ABC Board made over $6 million more in sales in March 2020, compared to last March, WBMA-TV reports. The sales boost is being attributed to the new coronavirus, which has led to social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders. “When you can’t go out with your buddies, or you can’t have your friends in for a nice meal and an alcoholic beverage, then you tend to want to keep something out of that scenario normal, and that is the sale of alcohol,” said Dean Argo of the ABC Board. But measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus could exacerbate mental health conditions that lead to some people consuming more alcohol, the television station reports.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Protesters have demanded that the mayor shut down a homeless camp they say is contributing to crime and threatening public health during the coronavirus pandemic. A group of 25 demonstrators gathered Friday across from the camp included people who live, work or own businesses nearby, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The group called for Municipality of Anchorage Democratic Mayor Ethan Berkowitz to close the camp as part of the enforcement of a statewide order to remain in place to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. People camping outside are a “difficult population” to deal with, but police are stepping up patrols, and Berkowitz said he is listening to the recommendations of frustrated residents. “We are doing what we can to reduce the number of people who are engaged in conduct that is criminal, and if there is a crime, that has been reported to (Anchorage Police Department),” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state considering reopening its economy May 1, health experts said Arizona isn’t yet doing enough COVID-19 testing or collecting good enough data to responsibly lift stay-at-home orders. Arizona had done 51,000 tests through Saturday, a fraction of the COVID-19 tests needed to judge how widespread the outbreak is in a state this size. Measured in tests per million residents, the state was in the bottom 10 nationwide last week. And data the state provides is widely seen as inadequate. The state is missing demographic data about positive cases and deaths, its location data mixes hospitals with private residences, and the state won’t provide data about cases and deaths on Indian reservations or in nursing homes. “It just isn’t going to work unless you have crystal clear data,” said William Haseltine, an infectious disease expert and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The first death of a health care worker in the state is among two additional deaths in Arkansas due to COVID-19, state officials said Sunday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson also said nearly 2,000 inmates will be considered for early release in response to questions about possible compassionate release of people in state prisons. The death of a worker at Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pine Bluff is one of two that bring to 40 the number who have died in the state due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith. The number of coronavirus cases rose by 42 to at least 1,781. Hutchinson said 348 inmates at the state’s maximum-security unit have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 118 from Saturday. The governor said he’s asked the state parole board to review 1,990 nonviolent, non-sex-offender inmates statewide who are due for release within six months for possible early release.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state reported its first prison inmate death from COVID-19 on Sunday as it steps up efforts to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable populations, including people living in nursing homes, on the streets or in homeless shelters. The inmate died at a hospital after contracting the coronavirus at the California Institution for Men in San Bernardino County, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. Statewide, 115 inmates and 89 corrections employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, corrections officials said. In recent days, California released for the first time details about nursing homes facing outbreaks as the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the state continue to rise. The information released by the Department of Public Health showed nearly 260 skilled nursing facilities with more than 3,000 total positive cases among patients and staff.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest outside the Capitol on Sunday against the state’s stay-at-home order and its closure of thousands of nonessential businesses as ways to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Horn-honking motorists lined up for several blocks on an avenue leading to the Capitol building, then circled it as pedestrians, some not wearing masks, congregated closely outside the building. Many waved American flags and held signs that read “End the Virus, Not the Economy” and “We need stability to stay healthy,” The Denver Post reports. Other signs expressed support for President Donald Trump, who has called for a rapid economic reopening, and against Gov. Jared Polis, whose orders shuttered thousands of nonessential businesses. Police officers wearing masks and gloves kept tabs on the protest.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two consecutive days of reductions in the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state are a promising sign in its fight against the outbreak, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. But Lamont, a Democrat, said people will need to keep up social distancing and noted infections are still accelerating in the greater Hartford area. “We are starting to flatten the curve,” Lamont said in an interview with WNPR. Statewide, more than 17,000 residents have tested positive for the virus, and 1,127 have died. The highest numbers have been reported in Fairfield County, on the New York state line. Lamont said widespread testing for the virus will be a key to easing some of the social distancing. He said he would like to set up more rapid testing centers like one in New Haven that he visited over the weekend. “There’s some nice smiles when the vast majority found out that they were not infected,” he said. “But overall I think about 15% did find they were infected, and that is troubling.”\n\nDelaware\n\nHarbeson: Coronavirus cases have hit every corner of the state, including southern Delaware’s chicken processing plants, which employ more than 6,000 people and offer contract work for hundreds of local farmers. While industry officials last month touted safety measures, those who work there offered a different picture of what they’re seeing behind closed doors, citing a lack of social distancing. “We’re not giving people chicken,” one employee said, on condition of anonymity. “We’re infecting more people.” Nelson Hill, vice president and assistant to the president at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 27, said that “there’s a big fear with regard to those non-union plants. ... You’re at-will. You can be terminated for any lawful reason that the company sees fit. So there’s a natural fear that folks will lose their position if they were to speak out.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The number of bad air quality days has plunged in the metro D.C. area since the start of March, WUSA-TV reports, citing data from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. The drop in bad air quality days likely comes in response to shelter-at-home orders linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Through April 18, COG data shows there has been only one “yellow,” or moderate, air quality day in metro D.C. The sole moderate air quality day since March 1 came March 19. In the same period in 2019, the district recorded 10 moderate air quality days in March and seven moderate air quality days April 1 through April 18. Car and truck pollutants, such as particulate matter and ozone, are major contributors to poor air quality, which raises the risk of respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer.\n\nFlorida\n\nDania Beach: As people across America make coronavirus masks with everything from T-shirts and pillowcases to vacuum cleaner bags, one Sunshine State resident is using python skin. Brian Wood, owner of All American Gator Products in Dania Beach, is crafting decorative mask coverings from the skin of the Burmese python, the infamous invasive species wreaking havoc on the native wildlife of the Everglades. “People are going to have to cover their faces, and unfortunately the situation may last longer than we imagined,” said Wood, owner of All American Gator Products in Dania Beach. “Some people want to make a fashion statement even during this pandemic, so I want to give them options.” The python skin itself doesn’t provide protection, but his mask design allows for a filter or a lining to be inserted and removed. The python masks will be made with holes framed by black, silver or gold metal rings, which will add a hint of luxury to the items, he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The governor announced plans Monday to restart the state’s economy before the end of the week, saying many businesses that closed to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus could reopen as early as Friday. Georgia’s timetable, one of the most aggressive in the nation, would allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors to reopen as long as owners follow strict social distancing and hygiene requirements. Elective medical procedures would also resume. Bars, live performance venues and amusement parks will remain closed. But by Monday, movie theaters may resume selling tickets, and restaurants limited to takeout orders could return to limited dine-in service. Such a swift reopening runs counter to the advice of many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top authority on infectious diseases, who warned again Monday that resuming business too soon risked a fresh spike in infections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Transient vacation rental units are proving difficult for officials to regulate during the coronavirus pandemic as they serve as shelter for many of the state’s visitors. Many of the 2,970 visitors who arrived in Hawaii during the 23 days prior to Sunday are believed to have stayed in transient vacation rentals, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Transient rentals are defined as “a room, apartment, house, condominium, beach house, hotel room, suite, or similar living accommodation” rented for less than 180 consecutive days, according to the state Department of Taxation. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued 14-day mandatory self-quarantine orders for passengers arriving on trans-Pacific and interisland flights to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau plan to add extra verification steps to confirm information from arriving passengers, authority President and CEO Chris Tatum said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: St. Luke’s Health System says it’s significantly increasing its testing capacity for the coronavirus by using its own labs starting Monday. Hospital officials said they hope facilities in Boise, Twin Falls, Ketchum, Meridian, Nampa and McCall can start using their own labs that could boost testing capacity past 1,700 per day by May. But that depends on getting particular testing supplies that have been in high demand. St. Luke’s also said drive-up screening tents for the coronavirus would be operating from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. seven days a week in Boise, Meridian and Twin Falls starting Monday. The screening tents had been operating to 6 p.m., but officials said volume is greater in the morning. Idaho has at least 1,668 virus cases and 44 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally Monday.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Five northern Illinois mayors have asked Gov. J.B. Pritzker for the authority to reopen businesses next month, urging local control over restrictions and “common sense modifications” to a statewide stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker has said he’s continually evaluating an extension of the order, which expires April 30. The Winnebago County leaders – of communities ranging in population from roughly 1,300 to 23,000 people – said in a letter to Pritzker that thousands of employees, including in the restaurant, fitness and salon industries, are being unnecessarily harmed because they’re not considered essential workers, according to the Rockford Register Star. The leaders are from Loves Park, Machesney Park, South Beloit, Cherry Valley and Durand. However, the mayor of Rockford, the county’s largest city, disagreed with the effort, saying it’s not the time to reverse course.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University students who operate a small community farm are raising crops for local food banks to help feed students and local residents alike during the coronavirus pandemic. The Purdue Student Farm usually sells its produce to Purdue food services, which serves those vegetables at the university’s dining service. But the student farm found itself without customers after on-campus classes were canceled and most students returned home amid the pandemic. “We didn’t want to stop producing the food because we know there would be a need in the community,” said Steve Hallett, a horticulture and landscape architecture professor and adviser to the student farm. Chris Adair, who manages the students who work at the farm, said they’re currently harvesting spinach and bagging it for donation to the Food Finders Food Bank, which serves residents in the area, and Purdue’s own food bank.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A beef processing plant that was idled after the coronavirus outbreak resumed production Monday, one day after the state said 177 workers there have tested positive. The Iowa Premium plant in Tama, owned by National Beef, had suspended production after the company confirmed multiple workers had the virus. On Sunday, the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds said 177 out of more than 500 National Beef workers tested were positive for coronavirus. A woman who answered the phone at the plant confirmed that production resumed Monday. The company closed the plant for what it called a regularly scheduled cleaning two weeks ago. The governor’s office also said Sunday that another 84 employees of Tyson Foods had tested positive. Tyson said its Waterloo pork plant remained open Monday, defying calls from local officials to suspend production. Its Columbus Junction plant remained closed, and its Perry plant was idled for a one-day cleaning.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: The state has received more personal protective equipment and supplies to expand COVID-19 testing in communities with meat processing plants. Gov. Laura Kelly announced Monday that the federal supplies will go to Finney, Ford and Seward counties in southwest Kansas and Lyon County in the east-central part of the state. As of Sunday, 247 people in those counties were infected with the coronavirus out of 1,849 statewide. Cargill, Tyson Fresh Meats and National Beef have said employees at their processing plants tested positive. Kansas Department of Health and Environment is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track clusters connected to the processing plants. Controlling the outbreaks is crucial: Plants in southwest Kansas account for 25% to 30% of beef processing in the country.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s public schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year, capping off an unprecedented academic year. Students should continue their education at home through distance learning plans, Gov. Andy Beshear told superintendents Monday afternoon. “It’s been recommended Kentucky schools do not return to in-person classes for the rest of 2019-20 year,” the Kentucky Department of Education tweeted. State education officials will work with school districts to finish distance learning by the end of May, although many districts may finish earlier. The elongated closure means teachers will not get to say goodbye to their students in person. Graduating seniors likely won’t get to experience end-of-year celebrations before heading off to the next stop. But weeks of distance learning are taking a toll on educators and parents, many of whom are being asked to act in multiple roles as kitchens and living rooms become makeshift classrooms.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A 69-year-old prisoner at the Louisiana State Penitentiary is the first state prisoner known to have died after being diagnosed with COVID-19, state corrections officials announced Monday. Corrections officials did not identify the prisoner, who was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. They said he had an underlying health condition and had been hospitalized since April 15 before dying Saturday. Last week, the corrections department said an employee at the prison died with the disease. The coronavirus death toll in Louisiana was 1,328 as of midday Monday. Louisiana has started the process for temporarily furloughing up to 1,200 inmates, in a bid to decrease the virus’s potential spread in the close confines of prison facilities. The ACLU of Louisiana has called the process a start but far less than what is needed to reduce the prison population and protect public health.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: About 200 people rallied in the capital Monday demanding the state open back up, despite officials’ insistence on a cautious approach in order to prevent another coronavirus outbreak. Similar rallies have elsewhere in the country, with participants including gun-rights activists, opponents of stay-at-home orders and supporters of Republican President Donald Trump. Maine’s event was organized by Republican state Rep. Chris Johansen, of Aroostook County, who urged participants to maintain social distance, wear masks and abstain from openly carrying guns. He also used social media to call on demonstrators to “fill up your gas tanks and get ready to rumble” in Augusta. Many directed their ire at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who placed the state under a stay-at-home order starting March 31. Mills defended the order while acknowledging closures have been hard on people and businesses.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Doctors in the state say they’re worried that fewer people with symptoms of a stroke or heart attack are showing up at emergency rooms. The Baltimore Sun reports doctors believe some people have chosen to avoid the emergency room because of the coronavirus pandemic. Such behavior could put possible heart attack and stroke victims at even greater risk. Doctors say some people may be concerned they’ll contract the virus by visiting the hospital. Or there may be confusion over stay-at-home orders. Providers in Maryland say avoiding the hospital increases the chance of serious health complications for stroke and heart attack victims. Recoveries are often tied to how fast people are treated. Dr. Mark Vesely, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, said people will fare better if doctors can get to them more quickly.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two more field hospitals set up to deal with a surge of COVID-19 patients opened in the state Monday. The hospitals at Joint Base Cape Cod in Bourne and at the University of Massachusetts Lowell’s Recreation Center can each handle about 100 patients who are not in critical condition but are not well enough to be sent home. Cape Cod Healthcare is managing and staffing the Cape Cod hospital, while Lowell General Hospital is managing the UMass site. Field hospitals have also opened at the DCU Center in Worcester and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. A fifth is expected to open at UMass Dartmouth in about a week. Massachusetts is in the middle of a surge of patients, Gov. Charlie Baker has said. The state now has more than 38,000 cases and has reported more than 1,700 deaths, including 146 on Sunday, according to the state Public Health Department.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The governor said Sunday that she was eager to loosen businesses restrictions while also avoiding new flare-ups of the coronavirus illness that has killed nearly 2,400 people in the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said a lack of virus testing supplies is delaying such steps but maintained that most residents support her actions despite a protest drawing thousands of people to the Michigan Capitol last week. “Not going to the gas station to fill up your boat, so that you can go tooling around, is a sacrifice, but it is one that is worth it, because who among us wouldn’t rather forgo jet-skiing or boating right now if it’s going to save your grandparents or your neighbor’s life?” Whitmer said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Whitmer has faced pressure from protesters who don’t like her orders to keep people at home and businesses closed because of the outbreak.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: The coronavirus pandemic has limited the mobility of independent older adults in Central Minnesota, so they’re showing up online for yoga classes and lectures and tapping into meal programs at much higher rates than before the COVID-19 outbreak. “Older adults are really resilient,” said Laura Hood, aging services director for the city of St. Cloud. “They’ve been through wars. They’ve supported communities. They’ve built communities.” And the community programs that serve seniors adjusted quickly to do so after Gov. Tim Walz’s stay-at-home order and other precautions meant to limit spread of the virus. Staff at the Whitney Senior Center have been able to connect with 70% of members electronically, Hood said. And those who are not available online get phone calls. Every week, the center emails a newsletter with resources, including links to live, interactive exercise classes and lectures. Staff provide some technical support and schedule programs that allow for group engagement, include exercise and covering other topics such as container gardens and mindfulness.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians says he has tested positive for COVID-19, and he is urging people to follow the advice of health professionals to try to slow the spread of the highly contagious new coronavirus. Chief Cyrus Ben said in a video posted to the tribe’s Facebook page Saturday that he had not experienced any symptoms. He said he is quarantined with his family and continuing to work remotely. “It only takes one person who has been exposed to the virus to go out in public and expose everyone that they could come in contact with,” Ben said. “That includes their families, their friends. And that is why we say take precaution, be vigilant.” The Choctaws have 11,000 members in 10 of Mississippi’s 82 counties. The tribe’s Pearl River Resort in central Mississippi’s Neshoba County has two casinos and hotels. The resort is closed indefinitely because of the pandemic.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A growing national movement against stay-at-home orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus arrived in the Show-Me State this week. Protests were planned Monday in Kansas City and Tuesday in Jefferson City. A flyer advertising the Kansas City protest encouraged people to “flood the streets of downtown Kansas City and demand that businesses be allowed to open up, people allowed to work, and lives returned to normal.” The protesters contend the stay-at-home orders are unnecessary and are seriously damaging the economy. Government and health officials argue orders asking people to stay home except for essential business and to maintain social distancing are necessary to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kansas City Mayor Quenton Lucas announced last week that he was extending the city’s stay-at-home order until May 15. Gov. Mike Parson said the state plans to take steps to begin reopening its economy May 4.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: For the first time since the state lab started running tests for coronavirus, the health department reported no positive COVID-19 tests among the 153 tests that were performed Sunday. Toole County, in north-central Montana, reported its fifth COVID-19 death Monday, raising the state’s total to 11. The latest victim was a woman in her 80s who was not identified. All 29 of the cases in Toole County, population about 4,800 residents, have been traced to close contact rather than community transmission, said Blair Tomsheck, director of the Toole County Health Department. Nearly all are tied to an assisted living facility and to the hospital in the city of Shelby, officials have said. Montana has reported 433 cases of COVID-19, with just over 11,000 tests performed. Nineteen people were still hospitalized out of 57 who required hospital treatment.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s primary election next month could see strong turnout if most people who requested ballots by mail return them in time. Secretary of State Bob Evnen told the Omaha World-Herald that 340,000 Nebraskans had requested mail-in ballots as of Friday. Another 50,000 voters who live in rural counties where voting by mail is the only option will also receive mail-in ballots. That total of 390,000 ballots is approaching Nebraska’s highest-turnout primary in 1972, when 413,015 people voted. Nebraska voters can request mail-in ballots from their county election officials until May 1. Those ballots must be returned before 8 p.m. May 12, which is election day. Officials said more than 72,000 Nebraskans have already voted. State officials still plan to open the polls May 12 for anyone who wants to vote in person. Election workers will be provided protective gear, including masks and gloves.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The agency promoting tourism in the city is quickly redoing its budget, with coronavirus casino closures and business shutdowns projected to result in a two-thirds cut in hotel room tax funding for the fiscal year starting July 1. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority chief executive Steve Hill said authority room tax revenue is expected to drop from $300 million to between $100 million and $120 million for the upcoming fiscal year, the Las Vegas Sun reports. At Hill’s request, the tourism agency board last week agreed to delay until next month consideration of a new budget. “Fiscal year 2021 was set to be an exceptionally strong year,” Hill said. “We were set to set records in a number of different ways.” Now, he said, “fiscal year 2021 is going to be a difficult year.” He said the authority was likely to lose another $60 million in income due to postponements and cancellations of conventions, meetings and trade shows at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other locations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge is considering whether Republican Gov. Chris Sununu can spend the state’s $1.25 billion in coronavirus relief aid without legislative approval. The Democratic leaders of the New Hampshire House and Senate and its joint fiscal committee sued the governor last week to halt the new Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge David Anderson held a hearing on their request Monday, saying he will issue a ruling as quickly as possible. Representing the governor’s office, Solicitor General Dan Will pointed to a 2002 law granting the governor authority to take immediate action during a statewide crisis. Democrats argue that the governor’s general powers under the law Sununu cites do not override a more specific law that says during an emergency, “the governor may, with the advice and consent of the fiscal committee, authorize such expenditures, by any department or agency, as may be necessary.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 outbreak is stabilizing, with the number of patients leaving hospitals outpacing those being admitted, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Despite the stabilization, 177 more people died since Sunday’s update, bringing the death toll to 4,377, Murphy said. There are nearly 89,000 people with the coronavirus, he said. There’s growing evidence that social distancing is helping contain the virus, according to the governor. It now takes three weeks for the number of cases to double in northern New Jersey, up from just three days over the past few weeks. For the first time, the number of people discharged from the hospital – 583 – outpaced newly admitted COVID-19 patients, which stood at about 460. Benchmarks to reopen the state’s economy will be coming in a number of days, the governor said. Murphy is allying with neighboring states to coordinate restarting the economy. More testing will be needed, among other things, he said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGallup: A high school is reopening its gym as a 60-bed alternative care facility to help hospitals treat an increasing number of coronavirus patients, a federal engineering agency said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was expected to turn over the keys to Miyamura High School to local and state health officials Monday, about two weeks after construction began, the Gallup Independent reports. Vinyl flooring and rubber pads were fixed to the gym floor, swamp coolers were placed on the roof to provide cool air, and two large exhaust ducts were installed to provide proper ventilation, said Lt. Col. Robin Scott, deputy commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Albuquerque District. The gym now features 60 patient pods separated by medical curtains, which each include one electrical outlet, an ethernet jack, lighting and oxygen, Project Manager Amanda Velasquez said. Laundry sinks are positioned throughout the gym as hand-washing stations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city won’t allow public events in June, including three of the city’s major annual celebrations: the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, the Celebrate Israel parade and the Pride parade on its 50th anniversary. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that the events would be canceled or at least postponed, saying it was a painful but necessary step as the city continues to fight the coronavirus. “They will be back, and we will find the right way to do it,” he said, allowing that it’s not yet clear whether it will be realistic to reschedule the events this year. The Pride parade began in 1970 as a way to commemorate the Stonewall rebellion the year before, when a police raid at the Stonewall Inn bar sparked a resistance by gay men, bisexuals, lesbians and transgender people and led to the development of more extensive and militant LGBTQ activist groups than the U.S. had seen before. The Puerto Rico and Israel parades are also touchstones in a city that has the largest Jewish population outside Israel and the biggest Puerto Rican community off the island.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIndian Trail: A miniature donkey named Mambo is getting some online love in the state, where a farm is getting in on the idea of having animals spice up tedious virtual meetings during the coronavirus pandemic. Peace N Peas Farm will rent Mambo, the 8-year-old miniature donkey, and his friends to crash company conference calls, The Charlotte Observer reports. This camera-crowding donkey is “like a pesky little brother” that “doesn’t let anyone relax too long,” said Francie Dunlap, Mambo’s owner. Companies can choose other farm animals they want to invite as guests on their video calls. According to the farm animals’ meeting registration website, they include three horses, Heiren, Zeus and Eddie, along with some chickens and ducks. “I think it would get some laughs,” Dunlap said. Customers can reserve 10 minutes with the animals for $50, and Dunlap said co-workers can also choose a virtual meeting name for the farm animal. Since she created the website Saturday, Dunlap said she has also gotten requests from teachers who want the animals to crash their virtual classrooms.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s largest manufacturer, Doosan Bobcat, resumed operations Monday after a two-week shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, putting some 2,300 people back to work. Doosan Bobcat restarted operations at plants in Gwinner, Bismarck and Wahpeton after making several changes aimed at protecting workers. The company said it is not aware of any workers who have tested positive for the virus. The equipment manufacturer says it increased cleaning and disinfecting at its facilities, implemented social distancing, and limited visitors while encouraging people to work remotely when possible. “The No. 1 goal is the safety of our employees,” company spokeswoman Stacey Breuer said. The company’s restart came as the state is wrestling with an outbreak in Grand Forks that has shut down LM Power, a wind turbine manufacturing plant, that as of Monday had grown to 128 employees or associated people.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Inmates make up nearly 1 in 4 of the state’s coronavirus cases following a spike in identified infections as universal testing takes place inside three state prisons. Figures released Sunday show 1,828 positive tests at Marion Correctional Facility in north-central Ohio, out of about 2,500 total inmates, according to the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. In addition, 109 employees at Marion have tested positive, out of a total of about 350 workers. One Marion prison guard died earlier this month. Systemwide, 2,400 inmates have tested positive, and six have died, including five at Pickaway Correctional Facility in central Ohio, where 384 inmates have tested positive out of a population of about 2,000. Even the head of the prison guards’ union, Christopher Mabe, is in self-quarantine after his wife, a guard at Lorain Correctional Institution, tested positive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The term “artist in residence” has taken on new meaning as the populace confronts the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s probably safe to say that every artist these days is an artist in residence since they are having to stay at home just like everyone else,” Lauren Rogers, communications specialist at Gilcrease Museum, told the Tulsa World. During a discussion about how the temporarily shuttered Gilcrease might still find ways to connect with audiences, staff came up with a plan. The first call for artists to contribute to the “#ArtistsinQuarantine” project went out March 20, and so far, more than 50 artists have responded. Gilcrease staff members selected certain images that it features regularly on its various social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Rogers said artists wishing to submit their work for the “#ArtistsinQuarantine” project may do so on any of the museum’s social media sites using the hashtag.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Taproot Lounge & Cafe and its second location, TAO (Taproot Annex One), are both closed until further notice, but the staff is far from idle. Taproot owner Christopher “Toph” Holland and his longtime friend Brian Sullivan are mobilizing out-of-work restaurant employees and community volunteers to sew face masks. “We had a bunch of employees with nothing to do,” Holland said, “so if we can’t serve (at the restaurant), we’ll keep serving by doing something else.” The project came about when the Centers for Disease Control updated recommendations, instructing individuals to wear face masks in public places. The City of Salem asked for the public’s help sewing masks to be donated to local nonprofit organizations. In response, Sullivan and Holland reached out to friends, asking to borrow sewing machines and soliciting donations of fabric and notions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will ease some restrictions on building construction and vehicle sales, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday as hundreds of protesters defied a ban on mass gatherings to stage an anti-shutdown rally at the Capitol. Wolf announced a first, tentative step toward reopening the state’s economy after weeks of social distancing to combat the new virus, which has killed more than 1,200 Pennsylvania residents and sickened more than 33,000. Wolf said he was signing online-notary legislation that would pave the way for online vehicle sales. And limited building construction work may resume May 8, he said. “We are taking small steps toward regaining a degree of normalcy in Pennsylvania,” Wolf said. As he spoke, protesters gathered outside the state Capitol to demand that Wolf reopen the state’s virus-battered economy.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island COVID-19 Response Fund has distributed another $2.1 million to nonprofits across the state to help people struggling to pay for groceries, rent, utilities or health care during the coronavirus pandemic. The fund, established last month by the Rhode Island Foundation and United Way of Rhode Island, has now distributed about $6.7 million. Children’s Friend, the Jonnycake Center of Peace Dale, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, Progreso Latino and Thundermist Health Center are among the organizations that received grants ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 in the latest round of funding announced Monday. The need continues to grow, foundation President Neil Steinberg said. “The need is beyond even what we expected,” he said in a statement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Retail stores and public beach access points that had been closed to halt the spread of the coronavirus will be allowed to reopen this week, The Post and Courier reports. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster was issuing an order Monday to allow for the reopenings to take place Tuesday, the governor’s chief of staff, Trey Walker, told the newspaper. The order will apply to numerous nonessential stores, including department stores, flea markets, florists, bookstores and music shops. Grocery stores, pharmacies, home improvement stores and medical facilities have been allowed to stay open during the pandemic. Occupancy in each store will be limited to five customers per 1,000 square feet of retail space or 20% occupancy, whichever is less, the newspaper reports. Local governments will still be allowed to make their own rules about waterway access. Sullivan’s Island, Isle of Palms and Folly Beach are among those that have banned access to nonresidents.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Sanford Health says a critically ill patient has received a transfusion of plasma from a recovered coronavirus patient, the first use of the therapy by the health care provider. Sanford’s treatment is part of a national clinical trial to test the effect of blood plasma in treating COVID-19. The use of plasma is for hospitalized patients with severe cases of coronavirus. The plasma may lessen severity or shorten the length of the illness caused by the virus. “This is another step forward in our efforts to find effective treatments for this virus,” said Dr. Allison Suttle, chief medical officer for Sanford Health. “It’s still early, but we are optimistic that the disease-fighting antibodies found in plasma could potentially slow the progression of the disease in our sickest patients.” Because the therapy is still considered experimental, the plasma is being administered under a program led by Mayo Clinic.\n\nTennessee\n\nCarthage: A truckload of medical masks and protective surgical gowns was destroyed when a tractor-trailer caught fire on a highway, news outlets report. First responders told WKRN-TV at the scene in Smith County on Saturday that N95 masks and special hospital gowns were among the items ruined. Shortages of these masks, which filter out 95% of all airborne particles, have created high demand among medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. It was unclear where the shipment was headed. Photos posted by news outlets on social media showed the frame of the charred vehicle smoking, with dozens of cardboard boxes strewn along the road reportedly carrying the masks. Green bundles that appeared to be surgical gowns were pictured laying in the wreckage. The fire started in a rear wheel and spread, officials told news outlets. The driver was not seriously injured, authorities said.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Many health care workers are taking precautions to protect their families from exposure to COVID-19, but one emergency room doctor is talking self-isolation to another level. Jason Barnes, 39, is a physician at Christus Spohn Hospital Beeville and Christus Spohn Hospital South. He couldn’t risk exposing his wife, Jenna, and sons, Stiles and Bentley, to the coronavirus, so he packed his things and made his kids’ backyard treehouse a temporary home. Working in the emergency room, Barnes has treated patients who came in for problems, such as a hurt leg, only to find out they were infected with coronavirus. Barnes has now spent nearly three weeks in the cabin treehouse. “Luckily the WiFi reaches the treehouse, so I have my laptop and my own little command center here,” he said. His living situation is similar to camping. He started with a bucket as a toilet but now has a camping toilet with biodegradable bags.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A day before a large weekend rally that drew hundreds of people to protest the city’s stay-at-home order, a man was arrested who police say threatened a “civil war” if Mayor Erin Mendenhall did not “open up the city,” according to charging documents. Marlin Richard Baer was arrested Friday on suspicion of making a terrorist threat and electronic communication harassment after he made the phone call to Mendenhall’s office demanding that she cancel the stay-at-home order she invoked March 29, police said. He was arrested before he could attend a rally Saturday at city hall that he referenced in his call that drew about 1,000 demonstrators. Baer mentioned the rally in his call and said if things didn’t change, a “civil war” would be coming, and police wouldn’t stop him, the charging document alleges. Baer also commented on Facebook that people should bring guns to the rally.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: More than 8,300 checks for $1,200 were being sent Monday to people whose unemployment claims were delayed due to a variety of administrative issues, according to the Vermont Department of Labor. The checks were prepared over the weekend after officials were unable to resolve stringent federal requirements that kept those individuals from receiving regular unemployment payments. “Given the overwhelming demand on the system, being able to provide timely claims processing while meeting all federal standards became virtually impossible,” interim Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington said in a news release issued late Sunday. “Ultimately, we needed to put people over process and get people their benefits.” The checks provide two weeks of federal benefits approved to help people affected by COVID-19-related layoffs. The department says the checks likely do not provide the full amount owed but serve as an initial installment.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: For the third straight day, health authorities are reporting a drop in the state’s number of new coronavirus cases. Numbers released Monday by the Virginia Department of Health show 453 new coronavirus cases reported in the prior 24 hours, bringing the total to 8,990. The death toll increased from 277 to 300. The drop in new cases marks the first time since the virus arrived in Virginia that the state has reported three consecutive days of declines, according to data kept by the Virginia Public Access Project. Northam and federal officials have indicated they want to see a 14-day trend of declining cases before phasing in an end to the restrictions on businesses that Northam imposed in a series of executive orders to fight the spread of the virus. Also Monday, the Virginia Department of Corrections said it is stepping up coronavirus testing at state prisons. The state health department was sending staff into prisons Monday to facilitate the increased testing.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Boeing this week is restarting production of commercial airplanes in the Seattle area, putting about 27,000 people back to work after operations were halted because of the coronavirus. The aerospace giant says it is taking extra precautions and has instituted comprehensive procedures at all of its sites to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new virus-slowing measures will include the use of face masks and other protective equipment, hand-washing sites, staggered shift times and employee wellness checks. Employees for the 737, 747, 767 and 777 airplanes were to return as early as Monday, with most returning to work by Tuesday, officials said. Employees for the 787 program will return next Thursday and Friday. Boeing’s shutdown went into effect March 25 after workers tested positive for the virus and a longtime inspector for the company died.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: An annual fundraiser at Marshall University to help feed needy families has moved online. Marshall says its art school is teaming up with a pottery studio for the Empty Bowls alternative event. The school said in a news release that the Pottery Place of Huntington has more than 500 bowls and T-shirts listed on its website. The bowls were made by Marshall ceramics students, but some were not finished before the school and the fundraiser were shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. The bowls and T-shirts cost $15 apiece. Purchased items can be picked up at the store. Proceeds will go to the Facing Hunger Foodbank, which serves 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Ohio. Last year’s fundraiser raised a record $18,000. Pottery Place owner Jessica Stone, a 2004 Marshall graduate, was part of a group of ceramics students who launched Empty Bowls 17 years ago.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Tavern League of Wisconsin is calling on Gov. Tony Evers to allow bars and restaurants to reopen May 1, more than three weeks ahead of the end of the current stay-at-home order that has forced the closure of most nonessential businesses. The lobbying group argued in a statement late Sunday that bars, restaurants and supper clubs could reopen by implementing a variety of safety measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19. Those steps include requiring all employees to wear masks and gloves; not allowing anyone to be closer than 6 feet from one another; spacing all tables at least 6 feet apart; not allowing more than six people to sit at any one table; and reducing the number of people allowed inside by 50%. The group also said it would eliminate paper menus, all table condiments and salad bars in order to reopen early. There will have to be a decrease in positive coronavirus cases over 14 days before the state can start a phased reopening of nonessential businesses, Evers said Monday when releasing new criteria for when the state will begin to reopen.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Since early March, the county’s top health official has been begging the state to support his restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus in Teton County. Emails obtained by the Jackson Hole News & Guide through the Wyoming Public Records Act show a back-and-forth that became heated as Teton District Health Officer Dr. Travis Riddell pushed state officials to allow him to enact a stay-at-home order. Riddell initially sought the state’s blessing for an order narrowly tailored to just the most vulnerable people – seniors and those with underlying medical conditions. But Senior Assistant Attorney General Jackson Engels fought back. Jackson Hole, he wrote, was not as unique as Riddell’s order suggested. While stating “support” for county-level orders, Gov. Mark Gordon has avoided imposing a statewide stay-at-home order, leaving Wyoming as one of eight states without such a decree.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/24/josh-fight-revived-roses-vr-rehab-news-around-states/50275581/", "title": "Josh Fight 2.0, revived roses: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHomewood: Republican U.S. Senate hopefuls made last-minute pitches to primary voters Monday in the tight race for the GOP nomination for a seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Richard Shelby. The three leading candidates in Tuesday’s primary – U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, former Shelby aide Katie Britt and veteran Mike Durant, a businessman best known as the helicopter pilot held captive in the “Black Hawk Down” battle in Somalia – concentrated their efforts in Republican strongholds in north Alabama, attempting to sway undecided voters and combat a flurry of negative attack ads in the race. The fractured field increases the chances the primary will go to a June 21 runoff, which will be required unless a single candidate captures more than 50% of the vote. Brooks appeared at a rally in Huntsville with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, as he seeks to overcome ex-President Donald Trump’s harsh criticisms and decision to rescind his endorsement. Trump had initially endorsed Brooks – who had been a key champion of the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen – but Trump reversed in March, citing Brooks’ languishing performance and accused the congressman of going “woke” for saying it was time to move on from the 2020 presidential outcome and focus on upcoming elections.\n\nAlaska\n\nKetchikan: The 750-mile Race to Alaska has returned after the pandemic led to its cancellation in 2020 and 2021. The engineless boat race takes competitors from Port Townsend, Washington, to Ketchikan, Alaska Public Media reports. The first-place prize of $10,000 cash is nailed to a board at the race’s end, and the runner-up wins a steak-knife set. A new documentary, “The Race to Alaska,” elevated recognition of the competition, according to Alaska Public Media.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The state’s second most populous city has signaled it may forgo part of its allotment of Colorado River water delivered by the Central Arizona Project aqueduct in order to help forestall a shortage declaration for Lake Mead that would trigger mandatory reductions. The Tucson City Council included its potential willingness to take 20% less CAP water in voting Thursday to direct city officials to discuss with other jurisdictions the possible of coordinated conservation agreements to keep more water in the reservoir, which has seen its level plummet due to drought. “We have a responsibility to protect our precious water resources and preserve our water supply,” the council said. “With today’s direction we are taking action to safeguard Lake Mead and Lake Powell from the threat of climate change and over-use.” Lake Mead’s surface has dropped more than 170 feet since 1983, and the lake is down to about 30% of capacity. Tucson receives about 144,000 acre feet of CAP water annually but uses only about 100,000 and has been storing the surplus underground. Several American Indian tribes and local jurisdictions, including Phoenix, have not taken their full allocations of CAP water, and Tucson previously said it would also participate if needed, KOLD-TV reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Emergency officials reported an explosion early Monday caused by a fire in a grain silo. There were no injuries, police said, but traffic was being diverted and motorists advised to avoid the area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRedding: Several people were injured when a bull jumped a fence and escaped an arena during a popular Northern California rodeo, authorities said. The escape occurred Friday during the final section of the Redding Rodeo’s bull riding event, the Redding Rodeo Association said on Facebook. The bull leapt over a fence, then ran through a crowd of spectators and across a parking lot before it was captured near a bridge about a half-mile from the arena. At least six people were treated for minor injuries, including 15-year-old Jordan Greco, a sophomore at Redding’s Enterprise High School. Greco said the bull’s horn’s clipped his leg as the animal charged through the arena’s VIP section. “Getting hit by a bull was an experience,” Greco said. “To be honest, I didn’t feel it at the time because my adrenaline was pumping, and I had to make split-second decisions.” At least one person was hurt near the Sundial Bridge, where the animal was finally caught, placed in a trailer and returned to its ranch, Redding police Cpl. Aaron Holleman said. “We wish the best to all those affected. The safety of our fans is our highest priority and we appreciate their support,” the Redding Rodeo Association’s statement said. The incident occurred on the third day of the four-day annual rodeo.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Roses once planted at a site where people of Japanese descent were detained during World War II may soon bloom again. Bonnie Clark, an archaeologist with the University of Denver, and her team found the bramble crawling across the remnants of a barracks doorway at Camp Amache in 2012. It had survived a dark time in American history and the unforgiving extremes of Colorado’s southeastern plains. During World War II, the U.S. government sent some 10,000 Americans of Japanese descent to the camp near the Kansas border, formally known as the Granada Relocation Center. The land recently became a national historic site. Clark, who leads the DU Amache Research Project and Field School, said she believes people who were imprisoned at the camp planted the roses. There is no chance they were growing there before the camp was built, she said, because the land is bone-dry and was mostly uninhabited at the time. “They are living,” Clark said. “But I have never seen them bloom.” But soon that may change. Clark, eager to see the roses flourish and to share the experience with survivors and their descendants, eventually reached out to Denver Botanic Gardens. Horticulturist Mike Bone and his team traveled to Camp Amache last fall to examine the rosebush and take cuttings. They kept the clippings moist and transported them in a cooler to a special propagation greenhouse at the botanic gardens in Denver. The plants are thriving and may blossom by mid-summer, Bone said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Mayor Justin Elicker nominated a high-ranking city police official for chief Monday following a nationwide search. The mayor announced Assistant Chief Karl Jacobson was his pick to lead the department. The nomination will now go before the city’s Board of Alders. “By far the individual that was the most qualified was right here at home,” Elicker said at a news conference. Jacobson came to the New Haven Police Department 15 years ago after a nine-year career with police in East Providence, Rhode Island. He has been assistant chief in New Haven for the past three years. The nomination comes after Elicker’s first pick for chief, Renee Dominguez, was rejected by the Board of Alders after some residents criticized her for not doing enough while serving as acting chief to reduce violent crime and to diversify the department. Dominguez, who would have been the first woman to permanently lead the department, retired earlier this month after a judge ruled she must step down from the acting chief’s job because she served longer than the six months allowed under the city charter. Former Chief Otoniel Reyes retired last June.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Tuition will increase by 3% for students at the University of Delaware for the upcoming school year. The university announced the tuition increase Friday. In real dollars, it amounts to an increase of $390 for in-state students and $1,050 for out-of-state residents. The university is not increasing its mandatory fees. As a result, full-price tuition, room and board for in-state students will be $29,644 and $52,164 for out-of-state students in the 2022-23 school year. The university said it has budgeted $168 million in undergraduate financial aid for the academic year, an increase of 86% since 2016. Nearly 19,000 undergraduates and nearly 4,300 graduate students are enrolled at the university.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city’s air quality improved early in the pandemic, and local officials hope they can keep that trend going as the coronavirus’ spread slows, WUSA-TV reports. The District Department of Energy and Environment found that ozone levels in 2020 were exceptionally low due to a reduction in traffic congestion. The department said while 2021 was close to a return to pre-pandemic conditions for ozone levels, they remained a bit lower. Kelly Crawford, associate director for the air quality division of DOEE, said if 2022 stay relatively normal in terms of the pandemic, she would expect D.C. to continue to exceed the health-based national ambient air quality standards for ozone levels. “There’s always a concern that as we return to more normal levels of traffic in the district that we’ll see increases in local air pollution,” Crawford said. “However, we are still working on those measures that reduce air pollution in the district.” Crawford said D.C. is working to get more electronic vehicles on the road while encouraging more people to use public transit or bicycles to get to work. She also pointed to the role heat plays in increasing ground ozone levels. The city is expected to have two straight days of 90+ degree heat this week, which is abnormal for mid-May.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The already slow slog of picking jurors in the penalty trial of Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz hit a new stumbling block Monday when a potential juror’s T-shirt honoring those killed and traumatized in the 2018 massacre resulted in the dismissal of her entire group of 10. The 58-year-old high school teacher was wearing a T-shirt in the burgundy and silver colors of Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that read: “Teacher Strong.” Below that were two hashtags that were commonly found on T-shirts and bumper stickers throughout South Florida long after the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting: #msdstrong and #NeverAgain. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to murdering 17 people and wounding 17 others. The trial will decide whether he is sentenced to death or to life in prison without parole. The woman had been brought into the courtroom separately from the other nine potential jurors because she had written on her questionnaire that she has a medical condition that would prevent her from sitting for long stretches of time. After that was discussed, Melisa McNeill, Cruz’s lead public defender, asked her about her T-shirt and how much contact she had with the other jurors. The woman said she hadn’t talked to the others, but they had all seen her shirt. McNeill told Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer the entire group should be dismissed because the shirt possibly could have been prejudiced others against Cruz. Prosecutors agreed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Tybee Island’s beaches will officially become a smoke-free zone June1. The City Council narrowly passed the smoke-free ordinance Thursday, with Mayor Shirley Sessions breaking a tie. The ban – which encompasses smoking, vaping and other tobacco-related products – applies to beaches, crossovers and the pier. Smokers are getting warnings during a grace period through the end of May. But once the ordinance goes into effect, those who are caught smoking or vaping on the beach will be fined $300. Surveillance cameras will aid code enforcement. Tybee officials say there will be designated smoking zones off the beach. Fight Dirty Tybee, a nonprofit group that regularly does beach cleanups, has pushed for a smoke-free beach since 2015 after bearing witness to the pounds of cigarette butts they’ve individually plucked off Tybee’s shores. Tim Arnold, the group’s president, said he’s relieved about the council’s decision. During tourist season, he and other volunteers can fill an entire 18-gallon bucket with cigarettes over a one-month span. Most of that is concentrated around the pier. “It’s not a little problem; it’s a massive problem,” Arnold said. “It’s a literal ashtray out there.” Fight Dirty Tybee picks up all types of litter from the beach, but a majority – nearly 70% – is smoking-related, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Volunteers gathered Sunday to clean up a section of the Kalihi neighborhood that’s become an illegal dumping ground. “We have keiki that reside in this area,” Joanna Polevia, a State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers administrative assistant who organized the event, told HawaiiNewsNow. “And they walked to school through all of this.” Auiki Street had been plagued by bulky rubbish, overgrown vegetation and graffiti, according to the news outlet, but more than 100 residents, business owners, community leaders and others came out to transform the site.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials have released an environmental study for a proposed nuclear test reactor to be built in eastern Idaho that backers say is needed to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants. The U.S. Department of Energy earlier this month released the environmental impact statement for the Versatile Test Reactor that would be the first new test reactor built in the U.S. in decades. It would give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors. Plans call for building the reactor at the Energy Department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory by the end of 2026. The environmental impact statement notes that the reactor would produce spent nuclear fuel beyond 2035, going past a deadline the Energy Department has with Idaho concerning spent nuclear fuel at the site. The document states that the Energy Department would explore possible approaches with Idaho regarding that issue. Construction of the proposed reactor depends on funding from Congress.\n\nIllinois\n\nSt. Charles: A weekend fire that damaged portions of a shuttered suburban Chicago resort took firefighters a full day to extinguish, and officials are still working to determine how it started. The fire began Saturday afternoon at the former Pheasant Run Resort in St. Charles, sending huge plumes of smoke into the sky. More than 20 local fire departments, including the St. Charles Fire Department, battled the blaze before it was extinguished late Sunday afternoon. No firefighters or civilians were injured in the fire in St. Charles, a city in DuPage and Kane counties that’s about 35 miles west of downtown Chicago. The blaze was contained to the center structures of the shuttered 18-acre complex, Deputy Chief Erik Mahan with the St. Charles Police Department told the (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald. He said investigators are still trying to determine how the fire began, saying that “many questions are unanswered.” While the idled resort had been the target of vandals during the past year, Mahan said there is no evidence anyone had been living on the closed property before the fire began Saturday. The Pheasant Run Resort closed in March 2020 after attempts to auction the property were unsuccessful.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In the past five years, the city has denied the vast majority of tort claims for pothole damage. Just 84, or 3%, of the 2,600 claims the city received from 2017 through 2021 were awarded settlements, according to data provided by the Office of Corporation Counsel. The state’s tort claim law says claims that sit for more than 90 days are automatically considered denied. Year to year, the percentage of cases that get settled varies from less than 1% in 2018 to about 10% in 2017. Those settlements over five years amounted to just over $34,200, or about $400 a claim. For the city to consider itself responsible for pothole damage, the city has to have received notice of the pothole and had a “reasonable opportunity” to fix it prior to the person’s striking it, Deputy Chief Counsel Misty Mercer said. How often the 90-day rule gets invoked has varied widely in the five-year period, as has the sheer number of claims. In 2017, more than half were decided within a month, and only a sliver were left sitting more than 90 days. Things changed in 2018, when a particularly brutal freeze-thaw cycle led city Department of Public Works Director Dan Parker to call it “pothole-mageddon.” The number of tort claims jumped fivefold. All but 1% were denied. And one-fifth sat for more than 90 days. The only way to push back against the city’s denial is to sue in small claims court, and for a $200 to $400 claim, most people don’t bother, said attorney Gary Selig, whose law firm offers tort claim services.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal to divert about $55 million from public schools to private school scholarships will not pass in the state House because of a lack of Republican support, House Speaker Pat Grassley said Monday. Reynolds’ plan to provide taxpayer-funded scholarships for up to 10,000 students to attend the private school of their choice was one of her top priorities for the legislative session. The measure passed the state Senate in March with only Republican support but won’t clear the House, despite the GOP holding a 60-40 edge in the chamber. The opposition largely came from lawmakers in rural areas and smaller communities who were concerned about the loss of money to public schools. Reynolds targeted at least one Republican, Jon Thorup of Knoxville, by supporting his opponent in the upcoming June primary election over his opposition to her bill. “It doesn’t look like were going to be able to put the votes together in the House this year to pass that; however, we want to continue to work with the governor to get something achieved that’s been a big priority of hers moving toward next session, and we’ll work on that in the offseason,” Grassley said. He said the session likely will end this week. Adjournment has been delayed over the issue of private school scholarships.\n\nKansas\n\nMcPherson: A couple well-known for their philanthropy have donated $25 million to McPherson College, the largest gift in the college’s 135-year history. Melanie Lundquist announced the gift from her and husband Richard while she gave the commencement address Sunday at the private liberal arts college about 60 miles north of Wichita. The college said the gift would be used to complete a fundraising campaign started in October 2019. With the Lundquists’ gift, the campaign has raised $53 million, which will be used to build a campus commons, strengthen academic programs and support a project that enables students to graduate debt-free. Richard Lundquist owns Continental Development Corp., a property development firm based in El Segundo, California. He and his wife are noted philanthropists, with an emphasis on education and health care. The couple did not attend or graduate from McPherson. Their relationship with the college began in 2012. Previous donations to the school have included $1 million and an Enzo Ferrari 1972 365GTB/4 Daytona to its automotive restoration program. Richard Lundquist, who will become a member of McPherson’s Board of Trustees, said he and his wife hope the gift “spurs more support of well-run small liberal arts colleges in the U.S.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A police officer who was fired for threatening to kill his colleagues and supervisors in the homicide unit is asking the city Merit Board to give him his job back, saying he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Former homicide unit detective Christopher Palombi was fired March 2 for violating two department policies – obedience to rules and regulations and conduct unbecoming – after a contentious series of communications Jan. 13-14 with two officers in which he threatened a “shootout” suicide, killing all his colleagues in the homicide unit and killing four commanding officers whom he named. Palombi’s attorney, Thomas Clay, said at Thursday’s Merit Board hearing that the department wrongfully terminated Palombi because of his disability, PTSD, and blatantly ignored state and federal law that prohibits such action. Clay said during the hearing he plans to prove that Palombi suffered punishment because of his disability and he was otherwise qualified to perform the job. The board is expected to make a decision this week at the conclusion of what’s expected to be a four-day hearing. The threats stemmed from Palombi’s frustration after he was turned down for a transfer to the Office of Sexual and Physical Abuse Investigations, Lt. Donnie Burbrink, commander of the homicide unit, said Thursday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A three-day comment period opens Tuesday for a proposed group housing site for Hurricane Ida survivors in one southeast Louisiana parish, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday. Up to 75 families could be housed at the site in the St. Charles Parish community of Killona, the agency said in a news release. FEMA says the parish needs 79 units for residents whose houses were destroyed or are still unlivable because of damage from the hurricane that made landfall Aug. 29, 2021. Comments would be about a draft environmental assessment. Instructions for getting that document and posting comments are available on the agency’s website. FEMA says it’s a short comment period because of a housing emergency among survivors of the hurricane. Developing the proposed 13-acre site would need clearing, grading, road construction, the placement of concrete pads, utilities and installation of transportable temporary housing units. The agency notes that such group sites are generally occupied by families who lived in the area before the hurricane. That means they typically don’t increase demands for local services such as schools and police and fire protection. Once the direct housing program ends, FEMA will remove all housing units and infrastructure, returning the property as close as possible to its original state.\n\nMaine\n\nPassadumkeag: The small town has effectively shut down because it no longer has a town clerk, code enforcement officer, assessor or animal control officer. The Bangor Daily News reports that Christen Bouchard resigned last month from her position as town clerk in Passadumkeag, a town of about 350 residents north of Bangor. She also had been serving as deputy treasurer and was in charge of licensing pets, registering vehicles and maintaining vital records. The town office has been closed since April 21, and it’s unclear when some of the key positions might be filled.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The former chief of staff to Gov. Larry Hogan abused his position as leader of the Maryland Environmental Service, in part by arranging for an unprecedented $233,647 severance payment, according to a legislative investigation. The investigation also said Roy McGrath collected exorbitant personal expenses and improperly hired close personal associates, The Baltimore Sun reports. Lawmakers announced the results of the investigation Friday in an 82-page report detailing McGrath’s conduct and recommending that MES seek financial restitution for money McGrath and his associate Matthew Sherring spent on activities irrelevant to their jobs. State Senate President Bill Ferguson called the report “deeply troubling on all levels.” “Mr. McGrath’s conduct and flouting of long-established rules and policies to enrich himself and loyal friends is beyond the pale of what we expect of our public servants,” Ferguson, D-Baltimore, said in a statement. House Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, said the behavior outlined in the report “dissolves the public’s trust in our entire system of government and can never be tolerated.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two police officers who killed suspects in two unrelated shootings in 2019 acted within the law and will not face criminal prosecution, the city’s top prosecutor said Monday. The officers’ actions in both cases “were lawful and reasonable exercises of self-defense and/or defense of others,” the office of Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement. “I am deeply aware of the impact these cases have on everyone involved,” Hayden said. “Our office moved forward with all these investigations with the utmost respect for all those affected by these traumatic events. We met with the families of those killed, the officers involved and their respective departments regarding these findings in advance of releasing them to the public. These were thorough, meticulous investigations conducted with one primary goal – to gather and review all the relevant facts.” In one case, Boston Officer William Hull shot Kasim Kahrim in the city’s Roxbury neighborhood early Feb. 22, 2019, after Kahrim shot and injured Hull’s partner, Officer Mark Whelan, the prosecutor’s office said. In the other shooting, which occurred Aug. 4, 2019, in Revere, Everett Officer Alex Vieira shot and killed Oscar Ventura-Gonzales after a “dangerous high-speed” vehicle pursuit, according to the investigation.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A foundation connected to billionaire Dan Gilbert is investing $13 million in a fund to help low-income city residents facing eviction. The Gilbert Family Foundation said Monday that $12 million will be invested over three years in three Detroit-based organizations that will provide legal representation for renters with children. It is expected to benefit nearly 6,000 families each year. The funding will be made directly to the United Community Housing Coalition, Michigan Legal Services and Lakeshore Legal Aid, which will manage the program. They also will hire lawyers, legal supervisors and legal aids. The Gilbert Family Foundation also has allocated up to $1 million for a long-term study into the program’s effectiveness and the city’s eviction defense ecosystem. City officials recently passed an ordinance that provides renters facing eviction with legal representation in all eviction proceedings and housing-related administrative proceedings that threaten the occupancy of their homes. Dan Gilbert is founder and chair of Rocket Companies, which includes mortgage loan provider Rocket Mortgage.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State utility regulators have decided pipelines that carry carbon dioxide are hazardous and therefore subject to state approval. The decision by the Public Utilities Commission on Thursday affects two multibillion-dollar carbon dioxide pipelines proposed to cross Minnesota and carry waste from several ethanol plants in the Midwest. Commissioners interpreted a 1998 state law on pipelines that carry hazardous materials includes those transporting carbon dioxide. The decision initiates a rulemaking process that could take a year to complete. Actual approval of any CO2 pipeline could take months after that. The companies seeking to build the pipelines disagree with the commission’s decision. The Midwest Carbon Express, proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions, would run for 150 miles in Minnesota, connecting to seven ethanol plants. The Heartland Greenway, proposed by Navigator CO2 Ventures, would run for 12 miles, linking to one ethanol plant west of Fairmont. Commissioners left open a possible exemption for Navigator’s pipeline since it only goes through one county, the Star Tribune reports. CO2 is heavier than air, so if a pipeline ruptures, it can displace oxygen and potentially cause breathing difficulties, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, headaches and impaired thinking.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: A school district has approved a $5,000 incentive to help recruit teachers. Natchez-Adams School District will pay some teachers in areas of “critical need” a $5,000 sign-on bonus to come work for them following a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees. The bonus is specific to English, mathematics and science teachers and will be issued “based on funding availability,” Deputy Superintendent Zandra McDonald Green said, The Natchez Democrat reports. It would be in addition to a historic teacher pay raise that legislators passed at the state level. The district’s biggest area of need is math teachers in sixth through 12th grade, Superintendent Fred Butcher said. With 16 vacancies for certified teachers, “we’re in better shape than we were this time last year,” he said. However, the Mississippi Department of Education has said the district would lose its accreditation if no changes to its staffing were made, said Cassandra Tennessee, the district’s assistant supervisor of human resources. One reason the district had been cited is that school accreditation guidelines were relaxed during the pandemic, and teachers were moved around to accommodate classroom changes to keep students safe. Consequentially, some teachers are now teaching multiple classes outside their areas of certification, Butcher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Workers at Daniel Boone Regional Library in central Missouri have voted to form a union, library officials said in a statement Monday. The new union will be the only active public library union in the state. The results showed 101 employees in favor of unionizing with 55 opposed, for 65% approval, according to the Missouri State Board of Mediation. Daniel Boone Regional Library has branches in Columbia, Fulton, Ashland and Holts Summit. Employees covered by the new DBRLWorkersUnited union will be represented by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. Union supporters cited concerns about pay and benefits, safety and health policies, and communication with administrators as reasons they began the union effort. The next step is contract negotiations between the library and the union. No date has been set to begin that process. Margaret Conroy, executive director of the Daniel Boone Regional Library, said in the release that the library’s employees job satisfaction has always been important to administrators. “We are looking forward to learning more about their specific concerns through the bargaining process,” the release said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A hospital is using virtual reality to aid in neurological rehabilitation. Every patient at the Rehabilitation Hospital of Montana is expected to complete three hours of demanding therapy a day. To spice up the grueling repetitions, RHOM partnered with tech companies Penumbra and BIONIK Labs to integrate virtual reality and artificial intelligence to patient care, The Billings Gazette reports. RHOM is now the first and only facility in Montana to utilize this technology. “(Rehab) is probably the last frontier for medical robotics,” said Loren Wass, chief commercial officer with BIONIK Labs. The company produces the InMotion ARM, which uses robotics, AI and machine learning to help patients work on upper extremity rehabilitation when they have a neurological disorder such as a stroke, Wass said. The patient is seated in front of a monitor, and their forearm is strapped into the device. Guided by games on the screen, the patient grips a handle and moves their arm forward and back, challenging them to get in more reps. The AI and ML allows the device to collect data and adapt to the patient’s needs. The machine produces progress reports, makes treatment recommendations and can follow protocol driven treatments. In a conventional therapy session, the patient completes about 30 to 60 movements in an hour, while BIONIK’s InMotion ARM devices achieve 600 to 1,000 movements in the same amount of time.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A couple hundred people grabbed their pool noodles and headed to a local park again over the weekend to battle over the right to the name “Josh.” The event started as an online joke when Josh Swain, from Tucson, Arizona, sent out a tweet challenging anyone who shared his name to fight over it. After it took on a life of its own, Swain turned it into a real event last year at the random coordinates he included in his original note, which happened to be in Lincoln, Nebraska. “The enthusiasm from everybody here was just incredible,” Swain told the Lincoln Journal Star. Several of the competitors this year donned costumes, including masks, animal suits and football helmets, before heading out to Bowling Lake Park. But that wasn’t enough to dethrone 5-year-old Josh Vinson Jr., who defended his 2021 title as the No. 1 Josh. Saturday’s event raised nearly $21,000 for Children’s Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, and the owners of the Josh Cellars wine label pledged to match that amount with a donation of their own. The hospital said it plans to share some of the donations with the Joshua Collinsworth Memorial Foundation that promotes water safety with its Josh the Otter mascot, who attended Saturday’s battle. Swain said he’d like to make the Josh Fight an annual event, though he’s not sure if he’ll be able to keep it up.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: One of the more than 70 high schools in the Clark County School District has several examples of the kind of physical security that officials want to see districtwide as they assess safety in the wake of a string of high-profile acts of campus violence. Chris Batterman, a coordinator in the district’s office of emergency management, pointed them out on a recent walk-through with the Las Vegas Sun at Mohave High School, a campus in North Las Vegas campus home to more than 2,500 students. All visitors, such as parents picking up their kids early, are funneled through the theater entrance, which has a separate exterior door outside of the school’s main gate. There’s also a panoramic-view window, made into one-way glass by a graphic wrap, from the administrative office overlooking the quad. The courtyard is spacious, with well-trimmed landscaping – bushes aren’t full enough to hide people – and the outdoor stairwells are airy, all to reduce blind spots and allow easy flow of foot traffic. Notably, it’s the theater entrance, a few paces east of Mojave’s main gate leading to the front office – a socially distanced holdover from pandemic protocols – that makes it harder for just anybody to come onto campus, especially if they have dubious intentions. The main gate cannot be opened from the outside. Single points of entry are among many target-hardening methods school officials are reviewing and will potentially boost into the summer and beyond.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has vetoed a bill that would have barred schools from implementing face mask mandates. The bill vetoed Friday would have prohibited school boards or other public education agencies from adopting policies requiring students or members of the public to wear face coverings. “Just because we may not like a local decision does not mean we should remove their authority,” Sununu said in his veto message. “One of the state’s foremost responsibilities is to know the limits of its power.” Though Sununu also noted that the state prides itself on promoting local control in education, schools have not had free rein when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. When state public health officials stopped recommending mask-wearing in most indoor public spaces in February, Sununu said any schools that try to maintain mask mandates would run afoul of state laws requiring that each student be provided equitable access to education. Also in February, the state enacted new rules prohibiting schools from shifting to fully remote or hybrid instruction due to COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMoorestown: More than half a billion dollars in federal and state funds will go to nearly 30 water systems in the state, serving about 6 million residents, or about two-thirds of New Jersey’s population, officials said Friday. The combined federal and state funding of $588 million in low-interest loans will cover an array of projects. In Newark, the state’s biggest city, some $25 million will go toward lead service line replacement. In suburban Philadelphia’s Moorestown at the North Church Street Water Treatment Plant, where officials unveiled the funding Friday, about $20 million will cover new filters to remove radium and other toxins from water. And in rural Clinton, a water system is getting almost $3 million as part of a water main extension project. The announcement is the latest orchestrated this year by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s and President Joe Biden’s administrations to retool and repair crumbling infrastructure. Vice President Kamala Harris made a stop in Newark in February to highlight the city’s efforts at removing lead pipes. The funding includes $221 million from the Environmental Protection Agency under a 2014 law known as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. The remainder comes from a mix of state funding and from the sale of bonds from the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, a state authority that finances road, water and other projects.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The governor has presented a long-awaited plan that would set goals for academic proficiency as the state struggles to resolve a lawsuit by frustrated parents who won a court ruling saying New Mexico is failing to provide an adequate education for the vast majority of its students. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s proposal released this month is meant to satisfy that 2018 court ruling and ongoing litigation to ensure adequate resources to equip students as they pursue a career or college education. New Mexico is on a long list of states where parents have turned to the court system to address frustrations with the state budget process and the quality of classroom education. The public and advocacy groups have until June 17 to comment. The plan is expected to drive immediate reforms by the state Public Education Department, as well as discussion and budget priorities in the Legislature next year. However, critics say it lacks specifics, including detailed funding plans and timelines. Native American education advocates and tribal leaders put forward their own plan in 2019. Called the “Tribal Remedy Framework,” it cites sections of the lawsuit, makes specific recommendations and suggests a specific amount of funding to carry them out.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city has agreed to pay $7 million to a man who spent 23 years behind bars for a murder he didn’t commit, Comptroller Brad Lander said Monday. Grant Williams was exonerated last July in the 1996 shooting of Shdell Lewis outside a Staten Island public housing complex. Williams, who is in his 50s, had been paroled in 2019. After being cleared last year, he filed a notice of claim, a first step toward suing the city. The comptroller’s office has the authority to settle such claims without court action and occasionally does so, including in the 2014 police chokehold death of Eric Garner. “While no amount of money can bring those years back for Mr. Williams or his family, I am pleased that we were able to move quickly to a fair and early resolution of this claim,” Lander, a Democrat, said in a statement. The case against Williams had rested largely on the testimony of a couple of eyewitnesses. One was a police officer who chased the gunman and initially gave a description that didn’t match Williams. Prosecutors at his trial also sought to suggest a connection between Williams and a baseball cap the shooter dropped at the scene, though it was never tested for DNA that could have pointed to its wearer. It was emblazoned with the logo of Wu-Tang Clan; Williams had worked at the multiplatinum-selling rap group’s Staten Island studio. No physical, forensic or digital evidence tied Williams to the crime, and some witnesses testified he wasn’t the gunman.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans in the state Senate are strongly considering legislation that would expand Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of additional low-income adults. Such legislation would mark a key step in an extraordinary turnabout by GOP members in the chamber set against expansion for a decade. A draft bill yet to be formally filed also would include several other medical, health care coverage and insurance reforms, according to a summary of the bill obtained by the Associated Press. Many of these proposals, including expansion, have been discussed in a House-Senate health care study committee that’s met several times since February. “Senate Republicans continue to have discussions about how to address the rising costs of health care and how to increase access in the state,” Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Senate leader Phil Berger, said Monday. Horsch confirmed the summary’s authenticity but could not say if and when legislation would be filed during the General Assembly’s annual work session, which began last week and likely will end around July 1. The measure’s showpiece would be Medicaid expansion, which Republicans were cool to or outright against for several years after the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act authorized the coverage for people earning too much money for traditional Medicaid coverage. North Carolina is one of a dozen states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A panel that regulates the state’s energy industry voted Monday to extend the deadline for proposals to build a natural gas pipeline from western North Dakota’s oil patch to the eastern part of the state. The three-member, all-Republican North Dakota Industrial Commission headed by Gov. Doug Burgum moved the deadline for proposals to Aug. 15 after no applications were received by the deadline this month. The Legislature in November set aside $150 million in federal coronavirus aid to help construct such a trans-state pipeline for natural gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. The idea, pushed by Burgum, was to help cut down on the wasteful flaring at well sites and pipe it to communities in the gas-poor eastern part of the state, hoping to spur industrial development. Despite the promised subsidies, no applications were submitted for the pipeline. WBI Energy, a subsidiary of Bismarck-based MDU Resources Group, said the project is not viable due to regulatory uncertainty, limited in-state demand and rising construction, labor and land-acquisition costs. MDU resources is North Dakota’s only Fortune 500 company. WBI Energy owns and operates more than 3,700 miles of transmission and storage pipelines in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city could soon add anti-discrimination protections for “gender expression” and for women who breastfeed in public. The city’s anti-discrimination law already has protections for transgender people. But under the proposed changes, the law specifically forbids discrimination based on “gender expression,” which is defined in the bill as how a person expresses themselves through “one’s behavior or appearance, that may or may not be those traditionally associated with the individual’s assigned sex at birth.” Businesses, employers and landlords would be among those subject to the new rules. Councilmembers Reggie Harris and Victoria Parks, both Democrats, are proposing the tweaks to the law. The City Council could vote on the measures as soon as Wednesday. “Fundamentally we are a rule-abiding society,” Harris said. “It really does make a difference when there are laws on the books that shape people and business’ behavior. So it is important the anti-discrimination code be up to date.” Harris said changes would bring city law in line with proposed federal and state equality acts, which would protect LGBTQ people against discrimination in employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, government-funded programs and jury service.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Less than one-third of the state’s voters want a ban on all abortions, and only Republicans are deeply divided on the question, according to a poll taken before the Legislature approved bills this year aimed at shutting down most abortions. The poll, taken by Amber Integrated of 500 registered Oklahoma voters in December, shows 31% would support a total ban on abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade; 55% of the Oklahoma voters surveyed did not want a total ban, and another 14% were unsure. Only 14% of Democratic voters and 12% of independents said they would favor a total ban on abortion if the 1973 ruling is tossed. On the Republican side, 48% of those voters surveyed said they would support a total ban, while 40% would not. Only 29% of women and 33% of men surveyed favored a total ban on abortion. “This shows that most voters cannot simply be placed into a ‘pro-life’ or ‘pro-choice’ dichotomy,” said pollster Jackson Lisle, a partner in Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City. “Voters have a wide range of beliefs that lie between a 100% ban on abortion and allowing abortion up until the point of birth.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A permit system that will limit how people visit the most popular waterfall hikes in the state goes into effect this week, part of an effort to combat skyrocketing crowds and parking congestion around Oregon’s most beautiful places. The latest system requires visitors to obtain a “timed use permit” to drive into the Columbia Gorge’s waterfall corridor on the historic highway between Bridal Veil (via exit 28 from Interstate 5) and Ainsworth State Park (exit 35). The permits, which can be purchased at Recreation.gov two weeks in advance of a visit, are required between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. May 24 to Sept. 5. They’ll be required to reach popular spots such as Multnomah Falls, Horsetail Falls and Oneonta Trail. The permits, now on sale, provide a one-hour window for people to enter through blockades set up on both sides of the Columbia River Gorge Historic Highway. “Everybody knows how big a problem traffic congestion is in this part of the Gorge, and this is a pilot program to see how well it works,” Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Don Hamilton said. “At the end of the summer, we’ll look at whether this is an effective tool for the long term. We know something has to be done, and this is what we’re starting with.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNorristown: The state’s former top law enforcement officer, who served jail time for leaking secret investigative files and lying about it, admitted Monday that she violated her probation when she was arrested for drunken driving in March. Kathleen Kane, the first woman and first Democrat to be elected attorney general in Pennsylvania, was sentenced to two months to a year of jail on the probation violation but was given credit for time already served and scheduled to be paroled directly to a residential treatment center for alcohol use. Kane appeared before the same judge who sentenced her in the original leak case. “I was not anticipating seeing you again, and I was hopeful we would not see you again in Montgomery County, but that’s been your choice, not mine,” Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy told Kane in court. Kane took the stand briefly and answered a series of routine questions. She did not comment outside court. Once a rising star in Pennsylvania politics, Kane resigned as attorney general after being convicted in 2016 of perjury, obstruction and other counts for leaking grand jury material to embarrass a rival prosecutor. She served eight months of a 10- to 23-month sentence before being released in 2019.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The $5.3 billion sale of Narragansett Electric to PPL Corporation is moving ahead again after a Rhode Island Superior Court judge lifted a stay that had put the transaction on hold. Judge Brian Stern lifted the stay after Attorney General Peter Neronha and PPL notified the court Monday morning that they had reached a settlement to resolve an appeal lodged by Neronha’s office. The terms of the settlement had not yet been filed with the court, and Stern still has to approve the agreement. But a favorable decision is expected, allowing the case to be dismissed. Under the settlement, which was announced by PPL, the company will provide $50 million in bill credits to gas and electric customers in Rhode Island, seek approval from state regulators to forgive $43 million in bill arrearages for low-income customers, forgo recovery of the costs of transitioning Narragansett Electric to new ownership, and write off another $20 million in assets. Among other measures, the company agreed not to seek any base rate increases for at least three years after the transaction closes. PPL said it expects to close the acquisition this week.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nParris Island: Rising seas are encroaching on one of America’s most storied military installations, where thousands of recruits are molded into Marines each year amid the salt marshes of South Carolina’s Lowcountry region. Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island is particularly vulnerable to flooding, coastal erosion and other impacts of climate change, a Defense Department-funded “resiliency review” noted last month. Some scientists project that by 2099, three-quarters of the island could be underwater during high tides each day. Military authorities say they’re confident they can keep the second-oldest Marine Corps base intact, for now, through small-scale changes to existing infrastructure projects. Maj. Marc Blair, Parris Island’s environmental director, described this strategy as “the art of the small,” a phrase he attributed to the base’s commanding general, Brig. Gen. Julie Nethercot. In practice, it means such things as raising a culvert that needs to be repaired anyway, limiting development in low-lying areas and adding floodproofing measures to firing range upgrades. Others advocate much larger and more expensive solutions, such as building huge seawalls around the base, or moving Marine Corps training away from the coast altogether. Salt marsh makes up more than half of the base’s 8,000 acres, and the depot’s highest point, by the fire station, is just 13 feet above sea level. It is linked to the mainland by a single road that’s already susceptible to flooding.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Four ad agencies, all from outside the state, have been selected to collaborate on promoting its tourism industry. Karsh Hagan, Love Communications, Lou Hammond Group and Two by Four were picked after only one South Dakota agency bid for the partnership. The four out-of-state companies were selected because of what the Department of Tourism sees as new and fresh ideas to give South Dakota tourism a broader appeal, said state tourism spokeswoman Katlyn Svendsen. “When it came down to it, these folks inspired us, and they really encouraged us to think differently about our state and how consumers are looking at it, and that’s what’s important to us because we’re advertising to millions of people across the country and internationally,” Svendsen said. Robert Sharp, with Rapid City-based marketing group Sharp & Associates, told KOTA-TV it’s baffling that the state can’t find marketing talent in its own borders to promote what South Dakota has to offer. Svendsen said the new campaigns in recent years have been able to better spread the word. “Where we have gone in the last few years, we’ve taken our brand nationally, we’ve been able to place our first national TV spot in the last few years, and we’ve really continued to elevate our brand and be on the rise,” she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: A private Christian university is considering strictly limiting the free speech rights of its students when it comes to sexuality and gender, from how they behave to what they wear and what they can say on campus or even online, according to published reports. If approved, the policy presented to faculty and staff at Lee University this month would not allow students to identify as anything other than their biological sex. They also would be forbidden from questioning these restrictions or any other university policy, according to a leaked draft. The proposal has sparked criticism from some former students, including the Affirming Alum Collective, a group of alumni from the Cleveland university, who posted on Facebook that they were “deeply saddened and frustrated by the new anti-LGBTQIA+ policies” under consideration. A university spokesperson, Kendra Mann, released a statement to WTVC-TV and the Chattanooga Times Free Press saying the policy has been in the works for years and is in line with long-standing theological beliefs. “No member of the Lee University community may publicly identify or behave as a gender that does not correspond to his or her biological sex,” the draft policy says.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Seven years after being charged with felony crimes, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has managed to avoid standing trial. The twists and turns of how the Republican – who is on the cusp of winning the GOP nomination for a third term Tuesday – has yet to have his day in court after being indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015 has little comparison in American politics. And along the way, it has upended what it means to be a compromised officeholder in Texas. Four different judges have overseen his case at some point. Where a trial would happen – if it ever does – has pingponged from Dallas to Houston to Dallas again. All the while, other clouds have gathered over Paxton: The FBI is investigating him over separate accusations of corruption, and the State Bar of Texas is weighing possible reprimands over his attempts to baselessly overturn the 2020 election. Once, nearly a year passed with no movement in the case at all. “I mean, this one is crazy,” said Andrew Wheat, a leader of the watchdog Texans for Public Justice. His group in 2014 filed a complaint with prosecutors over Paxton’s failure to register as a securities adviser, one of the criminal charges the Republican is battling. Paxton, who faces five to 99 years in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty. His attorneys point out that Paxton invoked his right to a speedy trial and blame the holdup on special prosecutors, who have spent years in a protracted battle over how much they’re getting paid and where the case should be tried.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Pride of Southern Utah has new leadership and new plans for southwestern Utah’s LGBTQ+ community, starting in June. The previous leaders of POSU, Katie Perkins and Lisa Wucherpfenning, stepped down and handed the role of executive director over to Micah Barrick. Barrick’s wife, Morgan, will take on the events coordinator position. However, leadership isn’t all that’s changed for the organization. Traditionally, POSU holds most of its events in September, when it has cooled down from the hottest days of summer, but doesn’t have many activities the rest of the year. Under Barrick, POSU is planning on holding monthly events throughout the year and growing the LGBTQ+ community. “We’re back in full swing,” Barrick said. “And we, you know, want to make people feel safe. St. George is growing; there’s a lot more queer people moving to town. So we want to create just more events, more visibility for them create safe spaces for them to come out and enjoy the beauty of St. George.” To welcome the leadership, POSU hosted a meet-and-greet event Sunday near Encircle, which is partnered with POSU. “I’m committed to creating more safe, inclusive events, fun events, family-friendly events for the community, just because there’s such a need for it,” Morgan Barrick said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A refugee resettlement organization has proposed bringing more than 300 refugees to the city in the next three years. Amila Merdzanovic, the Vermont director of the U.S. Committee on Refugees and Immigrants, wrote in an email to the city’s Board of Aldermen last week that the organization has proposed to federal officials to resettle 75 people in Rutland in fiscal year 2023, 100 in fiscal year 2024 and 150 in fiscal year 2025, the Rutland Herald reports. The city is now home to 13 people who fled from Afghanistan following the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from there last year. Two Syrian families arrived in 2017. “They are settling in well, all are working at local manufacturing companies, learning English, and connecting with community members,” Merdzanovic wrote. “Many Rutlanders have given them a warm welcome and are helping them get settled in the community.” Gov. Phil Scott has been a strong proponent of refugee resettlement. He’s also issued a call inviting the federal government to settle Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion in the state.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Dozens of graves at a city-owned cemetery are threatened by eroding shorelines on the Elizabeth River. A city review of the 44-acre site at Riverside Memorial Park found the shoreline surrounding the cemetery has been damaged by decades of dredging, nearby marine industrial activity and wind-driven waves that have undercut the riverbanks. At least 10 headstones are only feet away from steep slopes leading down to the river, The Virginian-Pilot reports. The city is seeking $1.9 million from the Virginia Community Flood Preparedness Fund to repair 1,500 feet of shoreline. But the money in that fund comes from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, from which Gov. Glenn Youngkin wants to withdraw. A city official said it’s unclear if that funding source would be available if Virginia withdraws from the regional initiative.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Eastern Washington University and No-Li Brewhouse will create the school’s first professional certificate program for the craft beer industry. The 15-credit program begins in the fall. No-Li Brewhouse owners John and Cindy Bryant donated $10,000 to help launch the certificate program. “It’s going to provide living wage jobs and great career opportunities,” John Bryant told The Spokesman-Review. Chris Cindric, a senior lecturer for EWU’s Department of Wellness & Movement Sciences, said the idea for a craft beer certificate program was sparked after he invited Bryant to speak at one of his classes. More than 64 breweries are located within 100 miles of Spokane, and demand is increasing for jobs in the craft beer industry, Cindric said. As breweries expand, they are looking to hire employees in production, service, distribution, human resources, event management, marketing and more, Cindric said. The state of Washington has more than 437 craft breweries, and the industry generated more than $2 billion in economic impact in 2019, according to the Brewers Association, a Boulder, Colorado-based craft beer industry trade group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A celebration of the state’s mountain culture and ethnic heritage will return to its original, full-weekend format for the first time in three years. The 45nd annual Vandalia Gathering is set for Friday through Sunday on the state Capitol grounds in Charleston. The free event that includes traditional arts, music, dance and food was canceled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and was limited last year. The festival kicks off Friday evening with an awards ceremony for quilt and wall hangings, followed by the presentation of the Vandalia Award, the state’s highest folk-life honor, along with a concert. Another concert is set for Saturday evening. Exhibitors will demonstrate their crafts and sell handmade items, including art, jewelry, pottery and candles. Several competitions are on tap Saturday and Sunday, including banjo, fiddle, dulcimer, mandolin and guitar. The festival wraps up Sunday with a Liars Contest in the Culture Center theater.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos was booed and jeered at Republicans’ state convention Saturday, and more than a third of those gathered voted to oust him. Vos remains at the center of the fight within the Wisconsin Republican Party over the false claims of voter fraud successfully deployed by ex-President Donald Trump to build doubt over his legitimate election loss in 2020. But on Saturday, Vos withstood a second attempt in as many years to call for his removal – a punishment GOP activists want to level for his refusal to rescind the state’s 10 Electoral College votes cast for President Joe Biden. About 36% of convention delegates voted to approve a resolution calling for Vos to resign or be removed from his position as speaker. Forty percent supported a resolution to decertify the 2020 election, which has been deemed by legal scholars and constitutional attorneys to be impossible even as Trump continues to say otherwise. The convention resolutions are symbolic votes with no practical impact. The vote to oust Vos came hours after he had enraged much of the convention audience by declaring again that the 2020 election was over.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A state board has turned back a proposal to name a butte after Jackson Pollock, the famed artist born in the city, Wyofile.com reports. A Michigan-based painter who’d rendered the promontory’s likeness in a series of works discovered it had no formal name and suggested “Mount Jackson Pollock,” but the Wyoming Board of Geographic Names took back its endorsement of the proposal upon learning the butte was on private property, according to the news outlet. And the public response to the idea had been mixed in Park County, given that Pollock’s family moved away from Cody when he was just a baby.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/13/mlk-robot-unemployment-python-bowl-news-around-states/40990839/", "title": "MLK, robot unemployment: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Jefferson County is preserving what’s left of the lockup where officials say Martin Luther King Jr. served his final time behind bars just months before his assassination. County commissioners unanimously approved a resolution Thursday to memorialize and preserve an area on the seventh floor of the county courthouse that used to be a jail. Much of the floor is now used for storage and mechanical equipment. Sheriff Mark Pettway said the civil rights leader was held on the floor in 1967, when he served three days for contempt after losing an appeal on his conviction for demonstrating without a permit years earlier. A small area including two pale-green cells, an isolation chamber, a shower and mechanical equipment are all that remain from the old jail. The county doesn’t know whether King was held in that exact section or another section that has since been removed.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A judge ruled Friday that an effort to recall Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy may proceed, a decision that is expected to be appealed. The decision by Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth in Anchorage followed arguments in the case Friday and came two months after Gail Fenumiai, director of the state Division of Elections, rejected a bid to advance the recall effort. Fenumiai said her decision was based on an opinion from Attorney General Kevin Clarkson that found the reasons listed for recall were “factually and legally deficient.” The Recall Dunleavy group has argued that Clarkson’s analysis was overreaching and that the recall effort should have been allowed to move to a second, signature-gathering phase. Among its claims, the group said Dunleavy violated the law by not appointing a judge within a required time frame, misused state funds for partisan online ads and mailers, and improperly used his veto authority to “attack the judiciary.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Tonto National Forest officials say workers plan to begin installing 4 miles of steel fencing along and near the lower Salt River east of metro Phoenix to prevent wild horses from crossing the Bush Highway and to keep livestock from mingling with the horse herd. Forest officials say the fence work starting Monday is the second phase of a project that saw workers complete installation Friday of 10 miles of barbed wire fencing. That work began in November. Forest Service and state Department of Agriculture officials said previous fences didn’t prevent horses from getting onto the highway, resulting in the deaths of 20 or more horses annually. The Forest Service said the project includes installing 35 gates at designated trails and historically used access points.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Friday said he won’t stay his order reinstating a police officer fired for fatally shooting a black motorist. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox denied the city of Little Rock’s request to stay his order regarding Officer Charles Starks, who was fired over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February. Starks and another officer were attempting a motor vehicle stop at the time. Police commanders fired Starks in May, saying he violated department policy. Fox had previously upheld a city commission’s ruling that Starks violated policy prohibiting officers from voluntarily placing themselves in front of an oncoming vehicle “where deadly force is the probable outcome.” But the judge said a 30-day suspension and reduction to an entry-level officer salary are more appropriate sanctions, and he ordered the city to comply by Jan. 16.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: It was a bad week for robots in the Bay Area. A Silicon Valley company that used robots to make its pizzas closed last week, and three coffee shops in downtown San Francisco that used robots as baristas also shuttered. Zume Pizza said it is cutting 172 jobs in Mountain View and eliminating another 80 at its facility in San Francisco. The Mountain View startup, which first began delivering pizzas in 2016, said it intends to focus on its food packaging and delivery systems, the Mercury News in San Jose reports. In San Francisco, Cafe X closed three of its coffee shops in the financial district. The startup’s founder, Henry Hu, said the downtown cafes helped develop the newest machine being used at shops at San Francisco International Airport and Mineta San Jose International Airport, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Northern Colorado commuters will have to say goodbye, at least for now, to Equinox, the giant sculpture of three horses galloping along a ribbon of railroad tracks at the intersection of Interstate 25 and U.S. Highway 34. The five-story-tall sculpture, put in place in 2014, will be taken down in the next couple of weeks, according to the city. The interchange is being redesigned as part of an interstate-widening project. The sculpture will be placed in storage “until a new location can be selected,” according to a city news release. Equinox was created by three Loveland residents – figurative sculptor Jack Kreutzer, structural engineer and artist Doug Rutledge, and artist and philanthropist Doug Erion – and was inspired by the art of Arapaho and Cheyenne Plains Indians. Loveland says it’s the biggest public art project in city history. It cost $225,000.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An agreement reached Friday in a long-running school desegregation case in the capital city will put the district on a path to ending 30 years of litigation, state officials said. The settlement includes new measures to reach diversity goals and allows for judicial oversight to end once the effort is shown to produce opportunities in diverse school settings for all Hartford families. The Sheff v. O’Neill case began in 1989 with a lawsuit challenging racial and economic segregation and inequalities between Hartford schools and suburban schools against then-Gov. William O’Neill. The plaintiffs were black, Latino and white families from Hartford. The case was named after Milo Sheff, one of the main plaintiffs, and his mother, Elizabeth Horton Sheff. In 1996, the state Supreme Court ruled the extreme racial isolation of Hartford students violated the state Constitution.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Seaside Jewish Community celebrated a milestone 23 years in the making this month, the Delaware State News reports. The groundbreaking group began meeting in 1997 when strangers responded to an advertisement in the Cape Gazette newspaper requesting fellowship for a Passover Seder feast to celebrate the beginning of the holiday with fellow Jewish community members. Nearly 100 members responded. By 2006, Seaside Jewish Community had grown to 200 members, prompting them to purchase their current facility after renting it for several years. Fourteen years later, the community had another need based on growth – expansion. They are now about 600 members strong and need more space so their community can continue to thrive. The need for an expansion was demonstrated as community members who attended the Jan. 5 groundbreaking had to sit in an overflow room where the ceremony was streamed live online because the sanctuary was full.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A group in D.C. is extending the fight to decriminalize drugs beyond cannabis to magic mushrooms, WUSA-TV reports. Spokesperson Melissa Lavasani says she suffered with postpartum depression and found relief when she gave the psychedelic substance a try after listening to a Joe Rogan podcast on which mycologist Paul Stamets discussed the benefits and uses of psilocybin mushrooms. She says it made all the difference for her, but the fear didn’t leave her – she was, after all, still using an illegal Schedule I substance. In an effort to alleviate those fears and help others struggling with similar situations, she joined the group Decriminalize Nature DC to bring the fight to politics. The group has submitted a ballot initiative to the D.C. Board of Elections to decide whether it can move forward. A hearing will be held Feb. 12.\n\nFlorida\n\nSunrise: Miami’s upcoming Super Bowl will mean death for dozens of invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades – and wildlife officials say that’s a good thing. The game’s organizing committee is working with the state to promote the Python Bowl, a 10-day contest that began Friday that will give out all-terrain vehicles and cash to the hunters who kill the most and biggest of these non-native snakes. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations. Kristen Sommers, a wildlife impact manager for the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, says officials understand the number of pythons caught during the contest won’t even make a dent in the population, which might exceed 100,000. But the goal is to raise the public’s awareness of the problem.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: A project to repair erosion to the state’s largest public beach is underway east of Savannah. Crews have been pumping sand onto the beach at Tybee Island since early December. Tybee Island City Manager Shawn Gillen told WTOC-TV work is about a week behind schedule, but crews should be done pumping new sand onto the beach around Jan. 20. The state and federal governments are spending $13.8 million to renourish Tybee Island’s beach. The project has been in the works since hurricanes Mathew and Irma pushed damaging storm surge onto the Georgia coast in 2016 and 2017. The repair work includes building a new stretch of dune to help protect beachfront structures from future surge, as well as rebuilding several crossover walkways onto the beach that suffered storm damage.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Air National Guard will start selecting candidates in April for one of four space control squadrons in the country in the Air National Guard, military officials said. The state Air Guard would select 88 military members for the 293rd Space Control Squad based at the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Operations by the new squadron are classified, but its main objective is to protect and defend the nation’s satellite communication systems, Hawaii Air Guard commander Brig. Gen. Ryan Okahara says. The announcement comes after President Donald Trump signed the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act in December funding the military and creating the Space Force, the first new armed service since 1947.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A Clean Water Act lawsuit filed by the Nez Perce Tribe that seeks to force a Canadian gold mining company to acquire permits for pollution discharged from its central Idaho facility will be allowed to continue, a federal judge decided. Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Boise forwarded the lawsuit first filed by the tribe in August against Midas Gold Corp. and its subsidiary, Midas Gold Idaho, The Lewiston Tribune reports. “Midas Gold’s motion to stay the Tribe’s litigation was simply a delay tactic,” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee chairman Shannon F. Wheeler said. The company is discharging water polluted with arsenic, cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals into streams of the Salmon River, home to several species of fish protected by the Endangered Species Act, Nez Perce Tribal leaders say. The streams also run through traditional territory where tribal members fish, tribe officials say.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: DNA tests to determine if a coyote captured on the city’s North Side is the same animal that attacked a 6-year-old boy will take weeks to complete, a city animal control official said Friday. Kelley Gandurski, executive director of Chicago Animal Care and Control, says the coyote will eventually be relocated outside the city. The agency’s Jenny Schlueter says another coyote was spotted in the same area Thursday night but eluded capture. Animal control officers have continued to search for coyotes in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and downtown. Experts say the majority of cases in which people suspect coyotes turn out to have been attacks by dogs, but Chicago officials remain confident the animal that attacked the boy Wednesday was a coyote. If so, it would be the first confirmed coyote attack on a human in Illinois, according to a wildlife biologist with the Urban Coyote Research Project.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Whitley: A northern Indiana dam that was the scene of a deadly 2017 kayaking accident has been demolished, making the region’s Eel River safer for recreation and removing a barrier to migrating fish. A crew that began demolishing the Collamer Dam on Wednesday finished removing the last of the concrete structure Thursday, said Jerry Sweeten, a retired Manchester University biology professor. The dam’s removal means the Eel River now includes about 95 miles of free-flowing open waterway that will promote both safer recreation and the river’s ecological health, Sweeten said. “This is a remarkable thing, to open up this much of the river,” he told The Journal Gazette. There’s now no barrier to migrating fish, including small-mouth bass and several species of suckers, including the great red horse sucker, which is an endangered species in Indiana, Sweeten said. The river has 52 fish species, 43 of which migrate upstream, he said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State Supreme Court Acting Chief Justice David Wiggins announced Friday that he’s retiring. Wiggins, 69, said he will retire March 13. He was appointed to the court by Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack in 2003. He was named acting chief justice in November after the unexpected death of Chief Justice Mark Cady, who had named Wiggins as his replacement if he were to be unable to act. Wiggins’ departure will give Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds an opportunity to replace one of the two remaining Democratic appointees on the seven-member court. She just received the names of three nominees Thursday to fill Cady’s vacant seat. Wiggins could have served until 2023, when he turns 72, the mandatory retirement age for state judges in Iowa. His current term is to expire in December.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The state’s farmers have seeded an estimated 6.9 million acres into winter wheat, the National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Friday. The state’s winter wheat acreage is equal to the area planted a year earlier, the agency said. Winter wheat is planted in the fall for harvest the following year. Kansas is the nation’s biggest producer. Separately, the agency also reported that about 394 million bushels of wheat are now stored in the state, down 13% from the amount in storage at this time a year ago.\n\nKentucky\n\nCovington: A homeless shelter in northern Kentucky is moving to a bigger facility and will offer more services, officials said. The Northern Kentucky Emergency Shelter in Covington will move to a building on West 13th Street later this year that includes space for a medical clinic, lockers and laundry services. The building can house up to 55 more people in need, says Kim Webb, executive director of the Emergency Shelter of Northern Kentucky. The shelter worked with Kenton County officials and St. Elizabeth Healthcare, which bought the building, to provide services for the homeless in the region. More than 1,500 people experienced homelessness in Boone, Kenton and Cambell counties between July 2018 and June 2019, according to a report from the Northern Kentucky Homelessness Working Group.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Southern University at New Orleans will suspend all of its athletics programs at the end of the academic year, trying to save money and dig itself out of years of financial problems. The Southern University Board of Supervisors approved the move Friday without objection, at the request of SUNO Interim Chancellor James Ammons. “This is one of the most difficult decisions I’ve made as an administrator,” Ammons said. He said while he understands the importance of athletics programs to attracting students and drawing alumni support, the campus must focus on protecting its academic programs rather than continuing to steer money to sports. The historically black public university is on probation by its accrediting agency amid continuing financial woes that have stretched over years as enrollment has fallen.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: A sign welcoming people crossing the bridge into this coastal town has been stolen, police said. In a Facebook post Friday, police said the “Welcome to Kennebunkport” sign posted off the side of the Lanigan Bridge is missing, though it was unclear when it was removed. The bridge is a popular spot for visitors and tourists to take photos, often with the sign in the background, CentralMaine.com reports. The sign, which shows some of town’s skyline, is made of copper and aluminum, but police don’t think it was stolen for scrap. “I believe it’s a trophy sitting in somebody’s living room,” Kennebunkport Police Deputy Chief Kurt Moses told WGME-TV, “and we just want to get the word out that we would like our sign back.” It must have taken some effort to dismantle the sign, as it was secured with several bolts on a railing over the river, the chief said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: This coastal community has playfully invited Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan to vacation there after the couple said they would step back from royal duties. The city tweeted Wednesday that the couple is “welcome to come for a visit any time!” and that “our castles may not be as grand as those back home,” but it’s “a great place for any family looking to take a break from it all.” City officials weren’t available to comment on whether the couple responded to the offer. Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan say they intend to become “financially independent” and to “balance” their time between the U.K. and North America.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is warning international students that federal immigration officials may visit their work sites to verify that their employment is directly related to their studies. School officials sent a memo to faculty Thursday saying the Department of Homeland Security has been making site visits to employers of foreign students in science, technology, engineering and math fields. The school is notifying students separately and telling them what to expect from the visits. MIT spokeswoman Kimberly Allen said the memo was not prompted by any visit to the institute. Immigration officials announced last year that they would begin workplace visits for some students in the federal Optional Practical Training program, which allows those with student visas to take temporary jobs related to their studies. Students in STEM fields can get their visas extended by two years, while others can get one-year extensions.\n\nMichigan\n\nMadison Heights: An industrial site in suburban Detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal Superfund cleanup program, state officials said Friday. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said an evaluation of the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site will be completed this spring. It will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The chrome plating company in Madison Heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minneapolis VA Health Care Center has been cited for failures in connection with the 2018 suicide of a veteran in its care. It’s the second time in 16 months that a federal watchdog has cited the medical center after a suicide. In a report last week, the VA Office of Inspector General found the Minnesota veteran said he wanted to die after he was admitted in spring 2018. A nurse also overheard him telling someone on the telephone that he would die at the hospital. Hours after that call, he attempted suicide and couldn’t be revived. The inspector general found that staff members failed to share the man’s suicidal thoughts with others on the treatment team, which might have prevented his death, the Star Tribune reports. His death came weeks after another veteran killed himself in the center’s parking lot, less than 24 hours after he was discharged from the mental health unit.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant is leaving office Tuesday after serving his limit of two terms. The Republican says he believes the state’s economy is stronger, vulnerable children are better protected, and students are showing stronger academic performance. He also says a recent outburst of violence in Mississippi prisons is not something he would have wanted as part of his legacy. Five inmates were killed, an undisclosed number were injured, and facilities at the State Penitentiary at Parchman were so damaged that the state set an emergency contract to move 375 inmates to a private prison. Bryant’s predecessor, fellow GOP Gov. Haley Barbour, pardoned nearly 200 people as he finished his second term in 2012. People protesting prison conditions last week called on Bryant to release some nonviolent inmates to ease prison crowding, but the onetime deputy sheriff says he will not issue any pardons or commute any sentences and does not think of inmates as victims.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Getting legal representation will take longer for hundreds of criminal defendants in the state’s largest county now that its judicial circuit has instituted a waiting list that supporters say is the only way to reduce the massive caseloads its overworked public defenders have been handling. St. Louis County’s waiting list went into effect Jan. 2 following an order by the county’s presiding judge, Gloria Reno. Her review last fall found that public defenders – lawyers who are assigned to defendants who can’t afford private attorneys – were juggling far more cases than they could logically handle. The list was requested by the St. Louis County public defender office and had the support of Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, who in a November court filing called it “the least-bad alternative available.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: NorthWestern Energy has donated $15,000 to efforts to memorialize Judy Martz, who served as the state’s first female governor and lieutenant governor. The donation for a statue was announced last week by Lisa Perry, NorthWestern Energy’s community relations manager for the Billings division, at the Montana Chamber of Commerce’s 20th annual Business Days at the Capitol luncheon. Martz, 74, died in Butte in Oct. 30, 2017, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. In 2019, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 275, by Sen. Al Olszewski, R-Kalispell. It gives a committee five years to raise funds to put a museum-quality statue or bust in honor of the Republican governor on the Capitol grounds. The committee must raise funds, and the statue design must get approval from the Capitol Grounds Advisory Committee and the Montana Historical Society.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Requests for early ballots can be submitted starting this week, the Nebraska Secretary of State’s office reports. The office said in a news release that the first day to submit applications for an early ballot at county offices is Monday. Counties receiving early voting requests will keep a list of the requests, Secretary of State Bob Evnen said. Those requests will be among the first ballots mailed staring April 6, he said. Nebraska’s primary election this year is May 12. Some counties maintain a permanent early voting list, which allows counties to reach out to voters who have indicated an ongoing preference to vote by mail. Each voter on the list will receive a postcard, which the voter can return indicating he or she would like to receive a ballot by mail.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Two human skulls and two human jawbones were discovered in archival storage boxes by a volunteer, prompting an investigation, Clark County Museum officials say. The 50-year-old museum grew from a collection of items from the Las Vegas Valley’s first female mortician, Anna Roberts Parks, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. This was the first time human remains were found in Parks’ collection, museum registrar Cynthia Sanford says. “She had lots of animal bones and things along those lines, but we’ve never found human remains before,” Sanford says. “She was a mortician, so it seems like that would be kind of a weird line to cross.” A volunteer was going through archival boxes Dec. 5 when the four bones were found, Sanford says. The bones were brought to the Clark County coroner’s office for investigation, officials say.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: Organizers of annual hand-crafted ice castle sculptures in the state opened the popular tourist attraction over the weekend as planned, despite warmer weather. The frozen attraction is located in six places across North America, including in North Woodstock. The castles include LED-lit sculptures, frozen thrones, ice-carved tunnels, slides and fountains. The winter wonderland is built from scratch when the cold conditions allow the ice to sprout from the barren ground. Warming weather is always a threat for the Ice Castles. In years past, some locations occasionally have had to cut their seasons short due to warmer winters. The attraction, which moved last year from neighboring Lincoln, draws tens of thousands of visitors each season.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Hundreds of protesters turned out Saturday as part of an effort to save one of Liberty State Park’s waterfront vistas from a billionaire developer bent on expanding a prestigious golf club into the natural preserve. Chants of “Whose park? Our park” reverberated along the edge of the state park overlooking the Statue of Liberty as demonstrators gathered to fight a proposed three-hole expansion of the exclusive Liberty National Golf Club at Caven Point – a protected peninsula of the adjacent state park in Jersey City – and back a bill before the Legislature that would ban further development in the area. The peninsula is a prime habitat for migrating birds and has marshland and a sandy beach, where fish, crabs, seahorses and other marine life are found in local waters.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A nonpartisan group says targeted mailings that encourage voter registration are going out to 1 in 8 state residents. The nonprofit, Washington-based Voter Participation Center says it will attempt to reach more than 248,000 people in New Mexico by mail in January as part of a new national campaign to reach populations that are statistically underrepresented in elections. The effort seeks to narrow the gap between those eligible to vote and those who are registered to vote – a gap that is especially pronounced among Latinos, says center founder and president Page Gardner. New Mexico has the highest percentage of Latino residents of any state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, estimated at well above 40% of the population. Young adults and single, unmarried women are another focus of the drive intended to increase overall voting.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city will install 100 new security cameras in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in an effort to prevent anti-Semitic attacks, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday. Fear has gripped the city’s Orthodox Jewish community since the the fatal Dec. 10 attack at a kosher grocery store across the Hudson River in Jersey City and the Dec. 29 stabbings at a Hanukkah celebration in suburban Monsey. The new cameras will be installed in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Crown Heights and Borough Park, where Hasidic Jewish residents have reported attacks ranging from someone pulling off a wig or hat to more violent assaults. “An attack on the Jewish community is an attack on all New Yorkers,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. Police officials say anti-Semitic crimes in New York City jumped 21% in 2019 compared with 2018.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The FBI is asking for the public’s help in catching a so-called bad wig bandit who’s been robbing banks in the state. The FBI said in a statement Thursday that the suspect wore a different wig during each heist in the Charlotte area. One wig was blonde. Another was black. The third was red. The FBI says he robbed a BB&T in Huntersville on Dec. 13. He then robbed two banks Jan. 7. The first was a New Horizon Bank in Belmont. The second was a Wells Fargo in Gastonia.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man who allegedly told a neighbor he had a bomb and indicated he would harm anyone who tried to enter his condominium died after he was shot by tactical officers in an exchange of gunfire, police said. Authorities identified the man Friday as Cody Carnes, 30, of Bismarck. Officers responded to the residence after getting a call from a neighbor about 10 p.m. Thursday. The neighbor reported noisy sawing and hammering coming from Carnes’ residence and said Carnes stated that he had a bomb. Two other calls were made earlier in the evening, including one from a caller who said Carnes stated he had weapons and would use them if anyone tried to enter his home. Another call came from a delivery employee who said Carnes displayed a handgun and said he had several more firearms. West Dakota SWAT officers tried to get the man to surrender, but he refused.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: There’s limited evidence that expanding the electronic monitoring of inmates in the state would reduce the rates at which ex-offenders commit new crimes or that it would enhance public safety, according to a new report. In addition, creating a system that would allow real-time monitoring of inmates in the hopes of placing them near crimes would still do nothing to prevent such crimes from happening, though it could help aid investigators and parole officers, according to the report released last week. Such a system is known as “crime scene correlation technology.” “The daily operations required for such a system are exceedingly complex and would require careful planning and consistent oversight,” according to the report, which was given to a state task force looking at all aspects of supervising inmates upon release. “Additionally, the costs associated with developing and operating such an initiative would be substantial and recurring.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A woman has pleaded guilty to spray-painting racist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic graffiti on Democratic Party offices and other properties in central Oklahoma in 2019. Allison Christine Johnson, 46, of Norman, pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony charge of malicious injury to property, three misdemeanor counts of malicious injury to property, and one misdemeanor count of malicious intimidation or harassment as part of a plea deal. “My actions do not reflect how I really feel,” Johnson told District Judge Michael Tupperman. “It was out of character.” In exchange for her plea, the charges will be dismissed if Johnson completes a mental health program. The graffiti included racial slurs and swatiskas outside the state Democratic Party headquarters in Oklahoma City and a Chickasaw Nation office. Similar graffiti was found at the Cleveland County Democratic Party headquarters and an elementary school in Norman.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Federal authorities suggested the environmental impact of a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal and pipeline in southern Oregon would be minimal, saying the contentious project wouldn’t jeopardize protected species or adversely change their critical habitat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said its review shows that the effects of the proposed Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas terminal and a 230-mile feeder pipeline along Coos Bay would be short-term or on a small scale, dispersed broadly across 250 miles. The biological study done by NOAA scientists reviewed 17 species listed under the Endangered Species Act and their critical habitats, including whales, sea turtles, salmon and other fish species. In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s staff in its final environmental analysis concluded that the contentious project would likely have an adverse affect on wildlife, including 18 federally listed or proposed threatened and endangered species.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Manchester Township: Shiloh Water Authority has started the process to remove fluoride from the township’s water supply. Shiloh is one of the last water companies in York County to add fluoride. According to a database by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the others are Hanover Municipal Water Works, Red Lion Municipal Authority and the West Manheim branch of the York Water Company. Adams County is one of 19 counties in Pennsylvania that does not have a supplier that adds fluoride or purchases fluoridated water. Franklin has three authorities, and Lebanon has two that add fluoride to their community’s water. Chairman James Bentzel says Shiloh started to add fluoride to the water in the mid-1960s. In the past few years, some of its customers requested that the company stop.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A fund has been created to accept donations to support public education in the state. Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green announced Friday that the nonprofit Rhode Island Foundation established the Fund for Rhode Island Public Education to accept donations from individuals, corporations and foundations interested in improving public education statewide. The Rhode Island Foundation will manage and distribute the money according to the education department’s priorities and the donor’s intent. Donors could invest professional learning opportunities for educators, advanced coursework for students and upgrades to school facilities, for example, the department said. The fund launched with a $20,000 commitment from the Rhode Island Commodores, a nonprofit that promotes economic development.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nEastover: Officials at McEntire Joint National Guard Base are warning neighbors that nighttime training scheduled for the next several days may create a lot of noise. The training will run Monday through Thursday at the air base east of Columbia. The South Carolina Air National Guard’s 169th Fighter Wing is hosting jets from the 4th Fighter Wing stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina for the exercise, 169th Fighter Wing commander Col. Akshai Gandhi said. The base in Richland County has a large airfield and provides realistic training for a number of military units, Gandhi said in a statement. Base officials will do everything they can to minimize noise from the nighttime training and appreciate the understanding of their neighbors, Gandhi said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge has ruled that a new state law that requires ballot petition circulators to register and be included in a directory is unconstitutional. The organization SD Voice, a grassroots ballot question committee, filed the lawsuit in federal court. There was a one-day trial in Aberdeen last month. The law required petition circulators to apply with the secretary of state for an identification number, provide personal information and be included in a directory. Attorneys for the state say the law is aimed at preventing fraud. In a written ruling Thursday, Judge Charles Kornmann declared the measure a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new pilot program starts this month with the goal of helping youth in Memphis and Shelby County lead healthier lives. The Craigmont High School Healthy Habits Program is a new curriculum designed to educate ninth graders participating in the school’s Lifetime Wellness classes about the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. The comprehensive program will present a three-component approach that details the 8-5-2-1-0 (8 hours or more of sleep, 5 fruits and vegetables, 2 hours or less of screen time, 1 hour or more of physical activity, and 0 sugary drinks every day) recipe that incorporates proper nutrition and adequate exercise into daily activities. Students in the program will also participate in FitnessGram, an evidence-based fitness evaluation program.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Shriners Hospital for Children in the Texas Medical Center will close in 2021 to consolidate area care at its larger Galveston hospital. The decision, made last fall, was driven by a desire to build one premier hospital, according to the Houston Chronicle. It was not based on financial concerns. Though the closure will end Shriners’ 100-year presence in Houston, it will mean all four specialty care departments – acute burns, orthopedic conditions, spinal injuries, and cleft lip and palate abnormalities – will be provided in Galveston. “This will make more efficient use of resources and enable us to provide our patients who need more than one type of care to receive it all in one place,” said Mel Bower, director of marketing at the Shriners national offices in Tampa. “It makes more strategic sense.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Rare salt formations have been documented for the first time on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, and they could yield insights about salt structures found on Mars before they disappear for good. They’re showing up now in part because water levels at the largest natural lake west of the Mississippi have been lowered by drought and water diversion, exposing more shoreline. That means there are more places where water can bubble up to the surface from warm, sulfate-rich springs. When it hits the cold air, a mineral called Glauber’s salt, or mirabilite, separates out. The tiny crystals have built up over the past several months, eventually creating flat terraces stacked atop one another like the travertine rimstone and dam terraces at Yellowstone’s Mammoth Hot Springs. From above, though, the cascading terraces are like an enormous piece of lace laid over the sandy earth. There are now four mounds at the Great Salt Lake beach, growing up to 3 feet tall.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The governor has reaffirmed the state’s commitment to accepting refugees from across the world and says he would like to return the number of people arriving in the state to the levels before President Donald Trump took office. In a letter to the president and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said the state has welcomed almost 8,000 refugees since 1989, and before Trump took office, it was accepting about 325 to 350 a year. In fiscal 2019, Vermont took in 115 refugees, said Amila Merdzanovic, of the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. “Vermont’s refugee communities have made countless contributions to our state,” said Scott’s letter to the president. “Refugees help ensure a healthy sized and diverse student population. They help employers fill open positions, contributing to the community and local economy, and pay federal, state and local taxes.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers voted Friday to ban firearms at the state Capitol, the first in what’s expected to be many contentious gun votes in coming weeks. Newly empowered Democrats who made up a majority of a special rules committee voted to ban guns at the Capitol and a legislative office building despite bitter protests from Republicans, saying the move was needed to protect public safety. “Our focus here is to keep everybody safe,” said House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn. “These are policies and rules that should have passed a long, long time ago.” Public officials have expressed concerns about planned Jan. 20 rallies that are set to draw huge crowds of pro-gun and gun-control advocates. Gun advocates from around Virginia and even out of state have pledged to turn out in force to highlight their resistance to proposed gun-control measures.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Wolf advocates seeking to halt the state Department Fish and Wildlife from shooting wolves to protect livestock have suffered another legal setback. The Capital Press reports King County Superior Court Judge John McHale on Friday dismissed claims that Fish and Wildlife’s lethal-control policy violates the State Environmental Policy Act. McHale’s ruling mirrored one in November by a Thurston County judge presiding over a similar lawsuit. Fish and Wildlife wolf policy lead Donny Martorello said that the department prefers to develop wolf policy outside courtrooms and that this decision lets it continue to do that. Jonathon Bashford, an attorney for the wolf advocates who brought the lawsuit, said they are reviewing the ruling and exploring their options.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The governor says a technology company has agreed to open a research facility in the state to look into using coal to make carbon-based products. Gov. Jim Justice gave additional details about the agreement with Ramaco Carbon on Thursday after mentioning the research center in his State of the State speech. “We absolutely need to continue doing all we can to harness the power of coal in every way possible, and having this facility to test new ways to convert this dynamic resource is a great opportunity for all,” the Republican governor said. Ramaco Carbon has received more than $5 million in federal grants to support its research, Justice said in a news release. One of the projects the company is working on revolves around using coal as a precursor to manufacture carbon fiber for the automotive industry.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: High winds, towering waves and flooding have caused millions of dollars in damage to Port Milwaukee on Lake Michigan, the port’s director said Sunday. Wild weather Saturday forced the port to prohibit public access to Jones Island and caused flooding on all major roadways at the port. Winds gusted up to 50 mph, and waves reached 6 to 8 feet high. Port Director Adam Schlicht called it “an unprecedented event at Port Milwaukee” and said the port’s international docks, which are closed for the season, sustained “significant damage.” Floodwaters were receding Sunday, he said. The inner harbor is expected to reopen early Monday. The wind and water stripped off dock wall material and pushed it inland, and frozen floodwaters covered railroad tracks in a foot of ice, Schlicht said. Water levels on the Great Lakes have been at or near all-time highs for much of the past year, the City of Milwaukee said.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An annual elk hunt in Grand Teton National Park doesn’t draw in and concentrate large numbers of grizzly bears, scientists have concluded. The November to December hunt probably takes place too late in the year for grizzly bears to seek out animal remains that hunters leave behind, according to researchers with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Many grizzly bears have denned up for winter hibernation by the time a significant number of elk remains have accumulated, study team leader Frank van Manen wrote recently in the academic journal Ursus. The park holds the hunt to control elk numbers. Most national parks don’t allow hunting, but the law establishing Grand Teton decades ago provides for the hunt.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/midterm-elections-gop-us-house-races/index.html", "title": "Midterm elections 2022: How to tell if Republicans are heading for a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe conditions are ripe for Republicans to win the US House of Representatives. So while Senate control is still up for grabs, the discussion on the House side has shifted to just how large a possible new GOP majority could be.\n\nRepublicans only need a net gain of five seats to win the chamber. They can get there just by picking up Democratic-held seats that former President Donald Trump won in 2020, plus others that shifted closer toward the GOP in redistricting.\n\nThey can pick up even more seats by winning in suburban areas that deserted the GOP during Trump’s presidency. Many of this year’s toss-up races are playing out in the suburbs, offering a key test of whether well-educated and more affluent voters who left the Republican Party in 2018 will come back now that Trump is out of the White House.\n\nThe backdrop to these individual races is a national environment that would appear to be a boon to the GOP. Even after the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade injected a heavy dose of uncertainty into the political landscape this summer, the economy and inflation remain the most pressing concerns for voters, a dynamic that plays into Republican attacks on the party in power. Republicans also have history on their side, since a new president’s party often loses seats in the midterms – especially a president with approval ratings like Joe Biden’s.\n\nAll of those tailwinds are easier for the GOP to take advantage of in House races. Although these contests take place in 435 individual districts, they tend to be more nationalized affairs since candidates have less defined brands than senators.\n\nIn part because of those national conditions, Republicans are also targeting some districts that Biden would have won by double digits under the new lines. But that’s also a reflection of the gains they made in 2020; the GOP needs to reach even deeper into Biden territory to find Democratic-held seats they can go after. Underscoring Democrats’ defensive posture, 9 of the 10 House races seeing the most ad spending in the final week feature vulnerable incumbent Democrats.\n\nDemocratic retirements opened new opportunities across the map, including in places such as Rhode Island, giving House Republicans another viable district to try to regain a foothold in New England after being wiped out in 2018. Those open seats are harder for Democrats to defend because they generally require outside groups to spend more than they would have had to with an incumbent in the race raising money.\n\nNationally, redistricting benefited House Republicans overall, though things turned out better for Democrats than expected – just not everywhere. In fact, Republicans have chances to flip all the races they’d need to win the House in two blue states alone – Oregon and New York – thanks to a combination of new maps and open seats.\n\nTo win the House majority, however, Republicans need to hold most of their own seats. That requires defending seats Democrats are targeting, including those that became bluer in redistricting.\n\nHere are some key House races to keep an eye on that could determine whether Republicans win the majority – and, assuming they do, the kinds of races that may signal just how much of a “red wave” is cresting over Washington. Race ratings come from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. This list is by no means exhaustive and may be updated as we get closer to Election Day.\n\nThe freebie districts\n\nThese are seats that the GOP should be winning easily because they shifted so much toward Republicans in redistricting that they’re barely competitive. In some of them, the Democratic incumbent either retired or is running in a different district.\n\nTennessee’s 5th District (Likely Republican)\n\nTennessee Rep. Jim Cooper, a 16-term member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, decided against running for reelection after state Republicans redrew his Nashville-area district into one that clearly favors the GOP. The previous version had voted for Biden by nearly 24 points, but Trump would have won the new version by 11 points.\n\nFlorida’s 7th District (Likely Republican)\n\nDemocrats are losing another moderate Blue Dog member in Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a member of the January 6 committee who’s not running for reelection. It’s harder for Democrats to defend this seat, north of Orlando, without Murphy, a strong incumbent with a compelling personal story as the first Vietnamese American woman to serve in Congress. And it’s even harder in a district that got more Republican, with the new version shifting about 15 points toward Trump.\n\nGeorgia’s 6th District (Likely Republican)\n\nThis suburban Atlanta seat was also redrawn by Republicans to be significantly redder – so much so that Rep. Lucy McBath opted to take on a fellow Democratic incumbent – and won the primary – in the neighboring 7th District, leaving this seat open. Trump would have won the new 6th District by 15 points.\n\nTexas’ 38th District (Solid Republican)\n\nThe GOP redraw of Texas’ congressional map significantly reduced the number of competitive districts, and Republicans have a prime pickup opportunity in this new Houston-area seat that Trump would have won by 18 points. Republican Wesley Hunt – a favorite GOP recruit who lost a bid for a different seat to Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher in 2020 – is heavily favored in the new district. Hunt’s victory could increase the number of Black Republicans in the House.\n\nThe nearly surrendered districts\n\nThese are the kinds of districts that either shifted away from Democrats in redistricting or that they just don’t have enough money to defend – perhaps because they’re open seats or because outside groups need the money elsewhere. This list isn’t exhaustive, but Republican should be able to pick up some of these seats – and if they’re not, they may not be in for as good as a night as they’d hoped.\n\nArizona’s 2nd District (Lean Republican)\n\nRepublicans feel good about this largely rural district in northeastern Arizona because it got much tougher for three-term Rep. Tom O’Halleran. (Trump would have won it by 8 points, while Biden won O’Halleran’s current seat by about 2 points.) The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made a late investment in the race in October.\n\nWisconsin’s 3rd District (Lean Republican)\n\nThis is an open seat Republicans are favored to pick up. Democratic Rep. Ron Kind won reelection in 2020 while Trump was carrying the district by about 5 points, making Kind one of the relatively few House lawmakers to represent a district won by the presidential nominee of the opposing party. That already made the seat a top GOP target, but then Kind announced last summer that he wasn’t running for reelection. Republican Derrick Van Orden, whom Kind narrowly defeated in 2020, is running again. Van Orden attended the “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, but has said he never entered the Capitol.\n\nTexas’ 15th District (Lean Republican)\n\nThis is one of three Rio Grande Valley districts at play this year that will test whether Republicans can deepen their inroads with Hispanic voters in South Texas. It’s an open seat because Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez is running for a different, more favorable seat after redistricting made the 15th District more competitive for Republicans. And national Democrats have already directed spending to other races, suggesting Republican Monica De La Cruz, whom Gonzalez narrowly defeated in 2020, has the edge against progressive Democrat Michelle Vallejo in a redrawn seat that Trump would have carried by 3 points.\n\nMichigan’s 10th District (Lean Republican)\n\nMichigan lost a seat in reapportionment. Rep. Andy Levin’s decision to unsuccessfully take on a fellow Democratic incumbent in a neighboring seat left Democrats without an incumbent running in the 10th District in suburban Detroit. Trump would have won the new 10th District, which is rooted in Macomb County, by just 1 point. Republican John James – who lost two recent bids for US Senate in the Wolverine State – is a strong fundraiser and well positioned to win this race.\n\nThe better-than-last-time battlegrounds\n\nThese are battleground districts that voted narrowly for Trump or Biden and are expected to see close races. But these seats may be more favorable to Republicans because of how they were redrawn or because of the specific candidate matchups. Democrats flipped many of these seats in the 2018 blue wave, making the districts natural GOP targets in a more favorable national environment. Again, this list isn’t exhaustive, but these are the kinds of districts Republicans should be winning if they’re having a decently good night.\n\nIowa’s 3rd District (Tilt Republican)\n\nThis Des Moines-area seat shifted ever so slightly toward Trump in redistricting. It typifies a middle-of-the-road district where the tension between Democratic messaging on abortion and Republican messaging on inflation is at a head. Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne is running for a third term against Republican state Sen. Zach Nunn, an Air Force veteran. Nunn is one of the rare Republicans to mention abortion on the airwaves, trying to flip the Democrats’ narrative about whose position is extreme.\n\nVirginia’s 2nd District (Tilt Republican)\n\nThis is another suburban seat Democrats flipped in 2018. Two years later, Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria won a rematch against former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor. But this time, she has a new opponent in Jen Kiggans, a fellow Navy veteran who cuts a remarkably similar profile in this military-heavy district anchored in Virginia Beach. The district got slightly better for Republicans in redistricting – Biden carried the previous version by 5 points and would have won by 2 points under the new lines.\n\nNew Jersey’s 7th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nAnother member of the class of 2018, Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, is running in more challenging terrain that now includes more of the rural northwestern part of the state, in addition to the well-educated and affluent New York City suburbs that helped him flip the seat in the Trump era. (The district is also home to Trump’s Bedminster golf club.) The new district would have backed Biden by 4 points, a drop from his 10-point victory margin under the previous lines. Malinowski faces a rematch with former state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., whom he barely beat in 2020 and whose father was a popular governor.\n\nPennsylvania’s 7th District (Toss-up)\n\nAnother House rematch got tougher for Democrats when this eastern Pennsylvania district shifted from one that had backed Biden by 5 points to one that would have backed him by half a point. Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, another incumbent first elected in 2018, is up against Republican Lisa Scheller, whom she narrowly defeated in 2020.\n\nThe knife’s edge battlegrounds\n\nThese are Democratic-held seats – many of them in suburban areas – that could go either way, but if Republicans are winning these kinds of seats, not all of which are listed here, they’ll be having a very good night. (Of course, Republicans have battlegrounds they have to defend too. Skip to the end for more on those.)\n\nWashington’s 8th District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kim Schrier – the only female physician in the House – is running for a third term against Republican Matt Larkin. The redrawn district, which includes areas just outside Seattle and Tacoma, would have voted for Biden by 7 points. In a sign of Democrats’ defensive posture on crime and policing this year, Schrier has been trying to stress her independence and tout her ties to law enforcement in her paid advertising, while painting her opponent as “dangerous” for his views on abortion. Larkin has argued that the Democrat “can’t be trusted to keep us safe” and that she votes with Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOregon’s 5th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nThis is an open seat because Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, a moderate Blue Dog member who was Biden’s first congressional endorsee of the cycle, lost his primary earlier this year to progressive challenger Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Republican Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the former mayor of Happy Valley, is trying to flip the redrawn district in the Portland and Bend suburbs, which Biden would have won by 8 points. Republicans are going after the Democrat for her previous political work in California, while she’s hitting back with an ad featuring the former Bend chief of police refuting attacks that she supports defunding the police. Regardless of how this race goes, it’ll be a chance for women to grow their ranks in the House.\n\nOregon’s 6th District (Toss-up)\n\nState Democrats drew this new seat south of Portland, which Biden would have won by 13 points, as an easy pickup for their party. But Republican Mike Erickson – who lost a 2008 challenge to Schrader – is leaning into classic GOP attack lines trying to tie his Democratic opponent, state Rep. Andrea Salinas, to high inflation and spending in Washington, DC. Republicans are also running a misleading ad campaign accusing Salinas of voting to defund the police. (As a CNN fact check notes, none of the three bills the ad cites actually defunded the police.) Democratic ads highlight that Salinas is the daughter of a police officer.\n\nNevada’s 3rd District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nThis district, located south and west of Las Vegas, will test the resonance of the GOP’s economic message, even in a seat that got more Democratic in redistricting. (Biden would have carried the redrawn 3rd District by about 7 points compared with less than half a point under the old lines.) Republican April Becker, who ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in 2020, is talking about Washington spending and inflation as she tries to unseat Democratic Rep. Susie Lee. The two-term congresswoman is trying to brand Becker as “way too extreme” – pointing to everything from abortion to the Republican’s actions around the 2020 election (Becker alleged there was voter fraud in her 2020 loss and sought a new election). Becker says she’s against a national abortion ban, but that isn’t stopping Democrats from attacking her as someone supported by those who want a ban.\n\nColorado’s 8th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nColorado added this seat north of Denver, which Biden would have won by less than 5 points, following reapportionment after the 2020 census. Democratic groups spent a relatively small amount trying to elevate a more conservative Republican in the primary, but state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer emerged as the nominee against Democratic state Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician. Both sides are attacking each other over their records in the state legislature. This race, which has shifted from a “Toss-up” toward Republicans in the final stretch, will be a test of the appeal of Republicans in the suburbs and among some Hispanic voters. And whichever way this new seat goes, it’s a chance to elect another woman to the House.\n\nThe tougher battlegrounds\n\nThese are among some of the strongest battle-tested Democratic incumbents, many with significant resources. If Republicans are winning these seats, they’re having a very good night.\n\nMaine’s 2nd District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nRep. Jared Golden, one of the few Democrats to represent a district Trump carried twice, is about to see whether a Democrat with his own brand can buck the national environment. A Marine veteran first elected in 2018, Golden has voted against many of his party’s priorities in Washington, DC, with the recent health care, climate and tax package being a notable exception. But he’s up against a known commodity and strong fundraiser in former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whose 2018 defeat eliminated the last Republican in the House from New England. But as in that race four years ago, ranked-choice voting makes the race difficult to predict.\n\nAlaska’s At-Large District (Lean Democratic)\n\nRanked-choice voting will also likely be in play in Alaska’s At-Large District, which had been in GOP hands for nearly 50 years before Democrats flipped it in a special election this summer with a focus on abortion rights. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola became the first Alaska Native in Congress, but she’ll face former Gov. Sarah Palin, among others, again in November. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who’s up for reelection this year, has said she plans to rank Peltola first on her ballot.\n\nPennsylvania’s 8th District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Matt Cartwright is another incumbent used to running in Trump territory, although the redrawn version of his northeastern Pennsylvania district would have voted for the former President by a slightly smaller margin (3 points) in 2020 – compared with 5 points under the previous lines. The five-term congressman faces a rematch against Republican Jim Bognet, whom he narrowly defeated two years ago in a district that includes Biden’s hometown of Scranton. Cartwright’s ads speak to his challenge – appealing to Trump voters in a national environment that favors Republicans. One spot features a Biden voter and Trump voter explaining that their support for the congressman is the only thing they can agree on.\n\nVirginia’s 7th District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer, is one of many members of the class of 2018 – particularly those with national security backgrounds – who are top GOP targets this cycle. And though her district became bluer in redistricting, she’s tried to distance herself from national Democrats. (She is running ads touting the endorsement of a former GOP congressman and a Republican police officer, for example.) She may also benefit from running against Republican Yesli Vega, who’s been painted as too conservative for this district, which now extends to some of the suburbs around Washington, DC. Still, the national environment is keeping this one close, and the race is among those attracting the most ad spending – more than $26 million since Labor Day.\n\nMichigan’s 7th District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nAnother high-profile member of that group of national security Democrats is Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who flipped a GOP-held Michigan district in 2018 and went on to win reelection in 2020 while Trump was narrowly carrying her seat. Slotkin is running this year in a district that split just about evenly in the 2020 presidential contest. The race has drawn more than $30 million in ad spending just since Labor Day, according to AdImpact data. Republicans should normally be able to ride the national tailwinds in such a district, but Slotkin is known to be a hardworking incumbent with a massive war chest. She entered October with nearly $4 million compared with $115,000 for Republican challenger Tom Barrett, who blames Biden and Slotkin for higher fuel costs. Sporting a “Dad” T-shirt in one recent spot, the state senator talks about how expensive it is to fuel up his family’s minivan. Slotkin is touting Democrats’ efforts to allow Medicare to negotiate certain drug costs, tying it to her own experience of watching her mom struggle with costs when she had cancer. Slotkin received an endorsement Thursday from Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who said she will also campaign with the Democrat.\n\nMichigan’s 8th District (Lean Democratic)\n\nFive-term Rep. Dan Kildee – a well-known name in the state after he succeeded his uncle in Congress – isn’t used to having competitive races. He won reelection in 2020 by nearly 13 points. But his redrawn district would have backed Biden by just 2 points, and that has made him a top GOP target. Kildee is up against Republican Paul Junge, who lost to Slotkin in the previous version of the 8th District in 2020. The National Republican Congressional Committee launched an ad that attempted to tie the incumbent to the Biden White House’s initial insistence that inflation was “transitory.” Junge has also claimed that Kildee is backed by groups who want to defund the police, but as a CNN fact check noted, he’s explicitly rejected that idea. Kildee is using a sheriff on camera to defend his record.\n\nMinnesota’s 2nd District (Toss-up)\n\nMinnesota is an especially potent place for police messaging after George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis led to protests and an unsuccessful 2021 ballot initiative to overhaul policing in the city. But Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, who flipped this district south of the Twin Cities in 2018, has responded to the GOP attacks with an ad featuring a sheriff who says the Democrat stood up to her own party and opposed that ballot measure. While GOP nominee Tyler Kistner has tried to attack the incumbent on inflation and crime, Craig has a significant financial advantage that could help her overcome a national environment unfavorable to Democrats.\n\nNew Hampshire’s 1st District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nNational Republicans seemed to think they would have had a better shot with 2020 nominee Matt Mowers taking on Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas again, but Mowers lost the September primary to Karoline Leavitt, a fellow former Trump administration official. Leavitt has more fully embraced Trump and his false rhetoric about a stolen election, which could alienate some of the voters Republicans would normally need to win in New Hampshire. (Biden would have won the district by about 6 points.) If she wins, Leavitt could become one of the first members of Generation Z – those born after 1996 – elected to Congress.\n\nTexas’ 28th District (Lean Democratic)\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar – the lone House Democrat who votes against abortion rights – is trying to hold on to a Rio Grande Valley district where Republicans are looking to make inroads with Latino voters. After fending off the same progressive primary challenger for the second cycle in a row, Cuellar now faces Republican Cassy Garcia in a district that would have backed Biden by 7 points. Republicans have tried to make Cuellar out to be a creature of Washington – with one ad even suggesting he’s living like a “king” – while also pointing to an FBI search of his home as part of an investigation in which the Democrat has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNew York’s 17th District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the party’s House campaign arm, is locked in a tight race with Republican state Assemblyman Mike Lawler. Biden would have won this redrawn Lower Hudson Valley district by roughly 10 points, so victory for Lawler and Republicans, who have spent big on the campaign, would suggest more Democratic losses to come on election night. The same goes for the state’s 3rd and 4th Districts on Long Island. The seats opened up when Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice opted to retire and Rep. Tom Suozzi launched an unsuccessful primary challenge to Gov. Kathy Hochul. Democrats Robert Zimmerman (in the 3rd District) and Laura Gillen (in the 4th District) have been hit hard by their Republican opponents on crime and inflation. If they fall, many Democratic strategists say, the party’s House majority is almost sure to follow.\n\nBracing for a GOP landslide\n\nThese are the kinds of seats where Republican victories would suggest they’re having a really good night and building a very significant majority in the House. Inside Elections moved its ratings for five of these six races to be less safe for Democrats in the final week before the election.\n\nIndiana’s 1st District (Lean Democratic)\n\nThis northwestern Indiana district has been trending toward Republicans – and they’re targeting it this year with a strong recruit in Iraq War veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green, who could diversity the ranks of the House GOP. She had outraised Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan by the end of September and began October with more money in the bank. Biden would have won this traditionally Democratic district by 8 points, but even if it doesn’t flip, the margin here on election night could say a lot about how rough a night Democrats could be in for.\n\nRhode Island’s 2nd District (Toss-up) and Connecticut’s 5th District (Toss-up)\n\nBesides Maine’s 2nd District, Republicans’ best opportunities to win back seats in New England are in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Democratic Rep. Jim Langevin’s retirement created an open western Rhode Island seat that Biden would have won by 14 points. (For comparison, he would have won the state’s neighboring 1st District by 29 points.) Republicans have a strong recruit in the 2nd District in former Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, who didn’t have a primary and is well known in the area. Democrat Seth Magaziner, the state treasurer, emerged handily from the mid-September primary but has had a shorter runway to pivot to the general election. Connecticut’s 5th District, by contrast, is not an open seat, so it may be a slightly harder one for Republicans to peel off. Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes, who was first elected in 2018, faces Republican former state Sen. George Logan. But both races have shifted from favoring Democrats to toss-ups in the final weeks.\n\nCalifornia’s 47th and 49th districts (Tilt Democratic)\n\nA cluster of races out West could also signal that Republicans are having a huge night. They’re targeting Democratic Reps. Mike Levin in California’s 49th’s District and Katie Porter in California’s 47th, both of which Biden would have carried by 11 points. Both seats moved away from Democrats in the final stretch, with Inside Elections shifting their rating from “Lean Democratic” to “Tilt” – the narrowest degree of Democratic favorability.\n\nOregon’s 4th District (Tilt Democratic)\n\nDemocratic Rep. Peter DeFazio is leaving behind an open seat, which Republican Alek Skarlatos, whom DeFazio beat by about 5 points in 2020, is running for again. But the seat got more Democratic in redistricting this year and would have backed Biden by nearly 13 points. Still, Inside Elections also moved this away from Democrats slightly in the final days of the campaign.\n\nRepublicans on defense\n\nIt’s not all offensive targets for the House GOP. They also need to defend their own seats, and each one they lose is one they’d have to gain elsewhere to advance toward the majority. These are just a few examples of the districts they’re defending.\n\nOhio’s 1st District (Toss-up)\n\nDemocrats have targeted Republican Rep. Steve Chabot for years. But this year, the district lines are much more favorable for them – Biden would have carried the redrawn version of this Cincinnati-area district by about 9 points, whereas Trump narrowly carried the previous version. Democrats are attacking Chabot over his opposition to abortion rights, while the congressman is leaning into economic messaging about inflation, arguing that voters “can’t afford” his Democratic opponent, Greg Landsman. Republicans have also tried to tie Landsman, a member of the Cincinnati City Council, to the movement to defund the police. (Landsman has his own ad with uniformed officers disputing that attack.)\n\nCalifornia’s 22nd District (Toss-up)\n\nRep. David Valadao is one of only two of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last year who is on the ballot this fall. The other lawmakers either called it quits or were defeated in their primaries. In a rare move for the former President, Trump did not endorse against the congressman, but Valadao still drew a challenge from his right in the June top-two primary. He advanced to the general election with Democratic Assemblymember Rudy Salas but faces a tough race in a district Biden would have carried by 13 points.\n\nCalifornia’s 27th District (Tilt Republican)\n\nGOP Rep. Mike Garcia is in another rematch with Democrat Christy Smith after defeating her in a 2020 special election and the regular general election later that year. He benefits from a favorable national environment this year, even in a Los Angeles-area district that Biden would have won by about 12 points.\n\nNebraska’s 2nd District (Toss-up)\n\nThis suburban Omaha seat has been a perennial target for Democrats after Republican Don Bacon flipped it in 2016 as Trump was narrowly carrying it. But Biden won it four years later by 7 points (and would have carried the redrawn version by a similar 6-point margin). Now the three-term congressman is up against state Sen. Tony Vargas in a race that will test the GOP’s post-Trump strength in the suburbs.\n\nTexas’ 34th District (Toss-up)\n\nRepublicans are on defense in this Rio Grande Valley seat after Mayra Flores won the special election in June to fill a vacancy in the old version of the seat. That made her the first Mexican-born woman elected to Congress. But Flores now faces Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez in a redrawn district that got much more Democratic in redistricting. (Biden won the previous version of the district by about 4 points but would have carried it by about 16 points under the new lines.)\n\nMichigan’s 3rd District (Lean Democratic)\n\nRepublican chances here got steeper for two reasons. One, the district became more Democratic in redistricting, and two, GOP Rep. Peter Meijer, who voted for Trump’s impeachment, lost his primary after Democrats meddled in the race. That strategy could backfire, though, if Republican nominee John Gibbs, an election denier, pulls off a win.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/26/medal-push-prince-fbi-bus-driver-livestreaming-news-around-states/119083930/", "title": "Medal push for Prince, FBI bus driver: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A man being booked into jail wound up at a hospital rather than behind bars after a scan revealed a shotgun shell in his abdomen. Prisoners entering the Morgan County Jail routinely undergo a body scan when being admitted, and a recent image showed what appeared to be a shell from a .410-gauge shotgun that had been swallowed inside a person, spokesperson Mike Swafford said Thursday. “He was never booked in,” Swafford said. “When our medical staff saw that, they said, ‘He has to go to the hospital.’ ” The man, who had been arrested by another law enforcement agency in the county, was later released on his own recognizance, Swafford said, and it was not clear what happened to the shell. Authorities did not release the person’s name or the reason for the arrest. The Morgan County Sheriff’s Department posted an image of the scan on its social media account to let people know about the screening process at the jail, Swafford said. While baggies or other containers holding drugs are sometimes uncovered inside prisoners, he said, finding ammunition was unusual. “We don’t see a shotgun shell very often,” he said. “We speculate it had drugs in it, but we don’t really know.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials at museums across the state have condemned repeated acts of antisemitic vandalism this year targeting the Alaska Jewish Museum in Anchorage. During instances in May and September, someone placed swastika stickers on the building or carved the symbol associated with the Nazis into the museum door, the Juneau Empire reports. “Alaskan museums are appalled by the attacks, and they are eager to show support for the Alaska Jewish Museum and the Alaska Jewish Campus as they seek to address these crimes and ensure the safety of their facilities and community,” Dixie Clough, director of statewide museum association Museums Alaska, said in a statement. The September acts of vandalism came as the Anchorage Assembly held public hearings about instituting a mask mandate for 60 days as COVID-19 cases spiked. Many opponents packed the Assembly chamber to protest, including some wearing yellow Star of David stickers, similar to the patches Holocaust victims wore, to compare the mandate to what Jews faced under the Nazi regime in Germany. Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson, who opposes all COVID-19 mandates, initially defended the use of the stars but apologized the next day, saying that “I understand that we should not trivialize or compare what happened during the Holocaust to a mask mandate.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A new organization calling itself a nonpartisan school board association is headed by GOP activists, including the first vice chair and treasurer of the Republican Party of Arizona, as well as the daughter of the chairwoman. The Arizona Coalition of School Board Members was launched Oct. 12 as an alternative to the Arizona School Boards Association, with the goal of fostering “a public education environment in Arizona that prioritizes freedom in education, parental rights and educational excellence,” the Arizona Capitol Times reports. “For too long, school board members in Arizona have been left without a choice,” the coalition’s announcement video said. Currently, every school district in the state is a member of ASBA, which dates back more than 70 years and provides advocacy, legal resources and training for member districts. But some parents and conservative groups have voiced opposition to ASBA in recent years over the organization’s positions on issues like Empowerment Scholarship Accounts and, more recently, “critical race theory” and the handling of COVID-19. For instance, ASBA is currently a plaintiff in a case before the Arizona Supreme Court challenging Arizona’s mask mandate ban and other Republican policies tucked into this year’s budget reconciliation bills.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday said the endorsement required for a casino license must come from elected local officials in office at the time of the application, a key victory for the Cherokee Nation’s efforts to build a casino in the state. Justices upheld an Arkansas law and state Racing Commission rule on the requirement, reversing a lower court’s decision that they were unconstitutional. Voters in 2018 approved an amendment requiring the state to allow four casinos. Since then, casinos have opened at racetracks in Hot Springs, West Memphis and Pine Bluff. One of the applicants for the casino, Mississippi-based Gulfside Casino Partnership, submitted its application in 2019 with a letter of support from Pope County’s former judge. Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation Businesses submitted an application with the county’s current judge. “Today’s ruling is exciting and greatly appreciated,” former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, legal counsel for Cherokee Nation Businesses, said in a statement. “I know CNB is ready to put an end to litigation and start building. We anticipate CNB’s license will be issued as soon as the mandate is effective, and we will work quickly to bring final resolution to any remaining lawsuits.” Gulfside, however, said the legal fight over the license was not yet over.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: In the wake of California wildfires, upward of 10,000 trees weakened by fires, drought, disease or age must be removed – work that will keep a nearby highway closed to visitors who seek the world’s two largest sequoia trees. The hazard trees could potentially fall onto people and cars on the section of State Route 180 known as Generals Highway, or they could create barriers for emergency and fire response, the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said Friday. The highway is closed due to the KNP Complex blaze, which was 60% contained after burning 138 square miles of forest, and will remain blocked off to visitors after the fire is out while saw crews cut down trees and trim branches. The road connects Giant Forest – home to the General Sherman Tree, considered the world’s largest by volume – and Grant Grove, home to the General Grant Tree, the second-largest tree in the world. The trees along the highway include sequoias, pine and conifer trees, said fire spokeswoman Kimberly Caschalk. The KNP Complex has been burning since Sept. 9, and forest officials said earlier this month that it may have killed hundreds of giant sequoias, but the full extent of the damage has not been determined. Firefighters took extraordinary measures to protect the most notable trees. Forest staff unwrapped the base of General Sherman on Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A private ranch with ponds, springs and rare wetland plants will be part of a new state park, Sweetwater Lake. Joined by state and federal parks officials Wednesday, Gov. Jared Polis announced the 488-acre ranch near Sweetwater Lake, in a mountainous northwestern county that borders Utah, will also become part of the White River National Forest. The ranch land near the Flat Tops mountain range was acquired in the federal park service’s Land and Water Conservation Fund purchase Aug. 31. The area was among the federal program’s top-priority purchases to increase public recreation and protect the area’s wildlife, cultural and scenic values, the governor’s office said in a statement. In an effort to increase the area’s public recreation, a new boat launch will be available next June. The state also plans to consult with the public and develop a long-term plan to expand and manage recreational activities while preserving the undeveloped nature of the property, Polis said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has submitted a request for a major disaster declaration to the Biden administration, seeking federal funds to help the state recover from damage caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The Sept. 1 storm dumped as much as 8 inches of rain on parts of Connecticut, resulting in heavy flooding and an estimated $7.2 million in damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure, Lamont said. It also resulted in the death of State Police Sgt. Brian Mohl, whose vehicle was swept away in floodwaters. Lamont’s request would allow homeowners in Fairfield and New London counties, as well residents of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribal Nation, to receive federal reimbursements for the costs of uninsured damage to their housing and personal property. According to Lamont’s request, just 8% of damaged homes in New London County and 23% in Fairfield County had flood insurance. The proposed declaration also would allow municipalities in Fairfield and Middlesex counties to receive up to 75% federal reimbursement of the costs of uninsured damage to roads and other infrastructure, as well as costs for emergency response. The governor’s office said public assistance damage assessments in Litchfield, New Haven and New London counties had not yet been completed.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal lawsuit has been filed against a police officer seen on social media repeatedly slamming a man’s head during an arrest last month inside a convenience store. In addition to using “excessive force,” the lawsuit filed in Wilmington’s U.S. District Court claims Patrolman Samuel Waters used a racial slur when arresting 44-year-old Dwayne Brown, who is Black. Waters is white. “Such racial statements are reflective of his state of mind and discriminatory intent in this incident,” says the lawsuit, filed by the Jacobs & Crumplar Law Firm. The Wilmington Police Department, which placed Waters on administrative duty as video of the Sept. 21 incident went viral, could not be immediately reached for comment Monday. The agency has said its Office of Professional Standards immediately launched an investigation into what the video captured. Wilmington Police Department has not released the officer’s name but said he has been on the force for three years. The lawsuit, which only names Waters as a defendant, claims Brown’s constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable seizures guaranteed to him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated. Earlier this month, civil rights activists called for Waters’ firing and arrest.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In an effort to relieve some of the frustration caused by Metro’s rail service reduction, Capital Bikeshare is offering free 30-day memberships to D.C. residents, WUSA-TV reports. Residents can go on the Capital Bikeshare or Lyft Mobile apps and, under the “Ride Plans” section, select “Pricing” to choose a 30-day membership for $0. Users need a valid credit card and phone number to register. Riders will be able to take unlimited free, 45-minute rides on the red classic Capital Bikeshare bikes with no unlocking or travel fee. Longer rides will cost $0.05 per minute for a pedal bike and $0.10 per minute on e-bike rides. “The service disruptions at Metro are deeply troubling for D.C. and the region,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “D.C. is open, and we need a fully functioning transit system to get workers, students and visitors across the city. We have been intentional, over the past several years, about making Capital Bikeshare more accessible and convenient for D.C. residents, and now we are proud to be able to offer this free one-month membership to every Washingtonian who might need it.” Capital Bikeshare has more than 5,000 bikes available at over 650 stations in the region. That includes a 20-bicycle pilot of new adaptive bikes for people with disabilities.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The names of three police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a knife-wielding man won’t be released because they’ve invoked their right to remain anonymous under a 2018 amendment to the state’s constitution. The West Palm Beach officers were trying to take Allan Lorenzo Robb, 33, into custody early Oct. 17 when he showed the knife. One of the officers fatally shot Robb after “less lethal” weapons used by two other officers were ineffective, officials said. The police department cited Marsy’s Law as the reason to keep the officers’ names private. The voter-approved Marsy’s Law allows crime victims or their families to request their names be withheld from public documents. A state appeals court ruled in April that the amendment could be used to shield the identities of law enforcement officers involved in use-of-force incidents. Since the ruling, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, the Boynton Beach Police Department and the Boca Raton Police Department have cited the amendement in such cases. The three officers have been placed on administrative leave while the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigate the shooting.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDublin: Federal prosecutors say more than $57,000 in pandemic relief funding was spent on one Pokemon card. Court records show a Dublin man is charged with lying on an application for an economic relief loan about the number of people his business employed and the company’s gross revenue. He faces one count of wire fraud. According to the court filing, he received $85,000 in August 2020 and used the money to buy a Pokemon card for $57,789. The Telegraph reports defense lawyers issued a statement declining to talk about the case. Rare Pokemon cards can sell for thousands of dollars. Collectors have been bidding up prices for trading cards, video games and other mementos. Dublin, a city of about 16,000 people, is located about 130 miles southeast of Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: More than half of first responders who applied for exemptions from the city’s vaccine mandate cited religion as their reason for not getting inoculated against COVID-19. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports 57% of all exemption requests among first responders pointed to faith. The city requires all government employees to be vaccinated unless an exemption is granted. Exemptions include religion or medical conditions, and only those who qualify may use regular coronavirus testing to bypass the vaccine requirements. City officials said those applying for medical exemptions must provide a letter from a doctor, and religious exemption applications must include a written statement as to why their religion would prevent vaccination. A federal judge dismissed a complaint last week that sought to stop state and county employee vaccination rules. The court said there are options for testing and exemptions, and the workers are therefore not being forced to take the vaccine, as the lawsuit alleged. The 12 first responders who filed the lawsuit claimed they were being forced to take an “experimental” vaccine. The Honolulu Police Department had the most exemption requests, with over 300 applications. City officials said about 90% of all employees were fully vaccinated as of Oct. 8.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: Students at state colleges and universities will be able to opt out of some fees under a plan approved by the Idaho State Board of Education on Thursday. The new fee structure allowing students to opt out of fees for activities, clubs and on-campus organizations goes into effect in the 2022-23 school year, the Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports. Students who decide to opt out of those fees will receive a refund from their school. Student fees – particularly the ones that go to support extracurricular activities, clubs and cultural events – have long been a source of debate in Idaho as lawmakers and administrators struggle to keep the state’s higher education institutions affordable and robust. Officials spent the spring and summer evaluating which student fees could be optional and how all the fees should be labeled. The new plan breaks the fees into four categories. The student enrollment, engagement and success category goes partly toward scholarships, and the institutional operations, services and support category helps fund maintenance. The student health and wellness category of fees helps cover the cost of fitness centers and counseling. The last category – student government fees – pays for student government and helps subsidize student clubs, organizations and activities. A portion of the latter is now optional.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A North Carolina man who moved to Chicago was one of the victims of John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted of killing 33 young men and boys in the 1970s, authorities said Monday. Francis Wayne Alexander would have been 21 or 22 when Gacy killed him sometime between early 1976 and early 1977, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said at a news conference in announcing the identification of Alexander’s remains. In a statement, Alexander’s sister, Carolyn Sanders, thanked the sheriff’s office for giving the family some level of “closure.” “It is hard, even 45 years later, to know the fate of our beloved Wayne,” Sanders wrote. “He was killed at the hands of a vile and evil man.” Alexander’s remains were among 26 sets police found in the crawl space under Gacy’s home just outside the city. Three victims, meanwhile, were found buried on Gacy’s property, and four others whom Gacy admitted killing were found in waterways south of Chicago. In 2011, Dart’s office exhumed the remains of eight victims who had been buried without police knowing who they were. Dart called on anyone who had a male relative disappear in the Chicago area in the 1970s to submit DNA. Alexander is at least the third identified from that batch. The effort also has helped police solve at least 11 cold cases of unrelated homicides and helped families find loved ones who had gone missing but were alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nStinesville: The town is offering to sell a set of vacant downtown buildings for $1 in hopes of finding new life for its tie to southern Indiana’s once-thriving limestone industry. The cluster of four one-story limestone buildings was built in the Monroe County town of Stinesville between 1886 and 1894. The Indiana Landmarks historic preservation group is working with the 200-person town about 10 miles northwest of Bloomington and has suggested the buildings could become an events venue, a restaurant, or a workspace for artisans or craftspeople, WRTV reports. The landmarks group described Stinesville as a boom town in the 1890s with nearly 1,000 residents as stone workers and carvers arrived for jobs at nearby limestone quarries. “The buildings embody the rich history of the local limestone industry and subsequent growth in the town in the late nineteenth century,” the preservation group said. Indiana Landmarks is accepting development proposals through Nov. 15. The town and Indiana Landmarks will then review the submissions based on “experience, qualifications, financial responsibility, capacity to undertake the project, and the appropriateness of the rehabilitation plan.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two decisions handed down Friday by the state Supreme Court promise to limit prosecutors’ ability to file amended charges close to trial, but a dissent warns that prosecutors may be forced to overcharge defendants to avoid having to refile cases from scratch. Under Iowa court rules, prosecutors have 45 days after someone is arrested to file a formal indictment or trial information specifying the charges against them. After that date, prosecutors can ask the court for permission to amend the charges, but not if the amendment would charge a “wholly new and different offense” or otherwise infringe on the defendant’s rights. In two cases decided Friday, James Vandermark and Jameesha Allen both argued a district court had wrongly allowed prosecutors to upgrade their charges at the last minute. The high court split 4-3 in favor of the defendants. In both cases, a court approved the amended charge over objections by the defense, finding the new charges were “substantially similar” to their original charges. Both trial courts were mistaken, Justice Christopher McDonald wrote, as the new charges each involved different elements to be proved and a substantially greater potential sentence. In his dissents, Justice Edward Mansfield wrote that the majority disregarded a number of precedents but agreed the law is “somewhat murky.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Law enforcement agencies across the state have received hundreds of complaints of bias over the past 10 years, but records available to the public show only two alleging racial bias resulted in consequences for officers, an Associated Press examination of the data shows. Advocates for racial equality question how that could be the case and suggest that law enforcement investigating complaints against other officers and a lack of transparency are problems. “We have the police policing the police,” said Sheila Officer, chairwoman of citizens group Racial Profiling Advisory Board of Wichita. She said independent citizen panels should conduct investigations of complaints. Law enforcement agencies and groups interviewed by the AP would not comment on the low overall rates at which bias complaints have been sustained but said that in their own departments, complaints are thoroughly investigated by officers independent of those accused. Kansas defines biased policing as an officer’s “unreasonable” use of a person’s race, ethnicity, national origin, gender or religion when enforcing laws. Lawmakers in 2011 required agencies to submit to the attorney general’s office annual reports outlining how many complaints they’d received and what they did about them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Repeated waves of COVID-19 cases, long hours and chronic staff shortages are taking a severe toll on the state’s nurses, with many citing stress, burnout and distress over encounters with hostile patients and family members. Further, as the pandemic drags on, nurses once viewed as health care heroes have found themselves confronted by some critics who claim COVID-19 isn’t real or are angry about measures such as vaccines and mask-wearing. “Now nurses have to change out of their scrubs to go to the grocery store,” said Delanor Manson, CEO of the Kentucky Nurses Association, which on Friday released a survey of nurses statewide about the state of their profession. Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to place immense demands on nurses, who account for about 53% of the state’s health care workforce, she said. A chronic shortage of nurses in Kentucky – also a national problem – has left nurses working long shifts in understaffed facilities, leaving them stressed, exhausted and burned out, found the survey from the nurses’ group. About 25% said they expect to leave their jobs within the next three months, which officials said would further worsen the shortage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A critically endangered Sumatran orangutan at the city’s zoo is pregnant with twins. “We are very excited about this pregnancy,” Bob MacLean, senior veterinarian at the Audubon Zoo, said in a news release Thursday. “Twinning is extremely rare in orangutans – there is only about a 1% chance of this happening.” The births in December or January will be the first for Menari, 12, but the third and fourth sired by Jambi, a male orangutan brought to New Orleans in late 2018 from a zoo in Germany. It may be six years or more before the group’s next babies. Sumatran orangutans wean their offspring at about 7 years old and have the longest period between births of any mammals – 8.2 to 9.3 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The great apes with long red hair have been decimated by hunting as well as the destruction of the forests and peat swamps where they spend nearly all their time up in trees. About 13,500 are believed to exist in sustainable wild populations, and “overall numbers continue to decline dramatically,” according to the IUCN.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Motorists traveling through the state will pay more in tolls starting next month, as Maine looks to make up for revenue lost during the pandemic. The state faces a $60 million financial shortfall caused by less traffic during the pandemic, The Sun Journal reports. The Maine Turnpike Authority is increasing toll prices for the first time in nine years. About half of the nation’s toll roads increased their fees during the pandemic, said Peter Mills, the authority’s executive director. The authority estimates that about 71% of the higher tolls will be paid by people and companies from other states. The increase is estimated to generate more than $17 million annually. The changes take effect Nov. 1. Among them, the toll for passenger cars going through the new toll booths in York, Maine, will be $4 instead of $3. That change alone is expected to generate more than $14 million of the revenue. The authority had planned to increase tolls in 2028.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan on Monday urged all eligible residents to get COVID-19 booster shots, especially those with health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, and the governor said the state will begin vaccinating children as soon as the federal government approves. Nearly 1.4 million Maryland residents are now eligible to receive a booster, Hogan said. People who received their second dose of a Pfizer or Moderna shot six months ago who are 65 and older, 18 and older with underlying conditions, or 18 and older and work in high-risk settings are eligible. People who are 18 and older who received a Johnson & Johnson shot two months ago also are eligible. “We have a robust network of vaccination providers, including pharmacies, primary care providers, mobile clinics, local health departments and community health centers, and we have both the supply and the capacity to provide a booster shot to anyone who needs one,” Hogan said. To help residents determine their eligibility for a booster, state health officials have launched a new portal on covidvax.maryland.gov where residents can enter their information and learn next steps. The state has administered about 280,000 booster shots so far.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is joining other communities across the U.S. with large numbers of university students in planning to challenge the results of the once-a-decade head count, saying the 2020 census undercounted students as well as jail inmates and foreign-born residents. Mayor Kim Janey said in a letter to the U.S. Census Bureau this month that officials believe about 5,000 college students were missed in the city that is home to Boston University, Northeastern University, Suffolk University and the University of Massachusetts Boston. The city made its estimate based on records Boston schools are required to give to the city with addresses for students living off campus. The 2020 census began just as the pandemic took hold and as students were told to leave campuses. The results put Boston’s population at 675,647 people. The county’s corrections department estimates 500 jail inmates were missed, and city officials believe neighborhoods with large numbers of foreign-born residents were undercounted as well, the mayor said. “Issues such as language barriers and government mistrust, particularly with a possibility of a citizenship question, may have resulted in an undercount of these traditionally difficult populations to count,” Janey said.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Joseph: A county health officer frustrated with the “politicization of public health” in the COVID-19 era is quitting her job. Courtney Davis has been the interim health officer in Berrien County since July, when she was promoted from deputy. Communications manager Gillian Conrad is also resigning, The Herald-Palladium reports. Davis ordered masks in local schools to reduce the spread of COVID-19, though the order was dropped Sept. 29 when the health department believed its state funding would be in jeopardy. Davis said at the time that it was “appalling” that money was tied to mask policies. Davis said it’s been an honor to work for the department for nearly five years. “However, with the politicization of public health during the pandemic, I can no longer effectively do my job and serve the community with its health and safety always at the forefront,” she said. Davis’ last day is Nov. 3. In stepping down, Conrad said the pandemic had taken a “significant toll” on her mental and physical health. County Administrator Brian Dissette said there has been only one applicant for the job of permanent health officer, a role in which Davis was serving on an interim basis. He said he informed the state health department about the vacancies to try to add more “horsepower” to the search.\n\nMinnesota\n\nChanhassen: The state’s congressional delegation on Monday introduced a resolution to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to pop superstar Prince, citing his “indelible mark on Minnesota and American culture.” The medal is one of the nation’s highest civilian honors, and past recipients include George Washington, the Wright Brothers, Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, the Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Dalai Lama. “The world is a whole lot cooler because Prince was in it – he touched our hearts, opened our minds, and made us want to dance,” U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. “With this legislation, we honor his memory and contributions as a composer, performer, and music innovator. Purple reigns in Minnesota today and every day because of him.” Prince, whose many hits include “Little Red Corvette,” “Let’s Go Crazy” and “When Doves Cry,” died April 21, 2016, of an accidental fentanyl overdose at age 57 at his Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen. The resolution is led by Klobuchar and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., with the state’s full delegation co-sponsoring. “Prince is a Minnesota icon,” Omar said in a statement. “He showed that it was OK to be a short, Black kid from Minneapolis and still change the world. He not only changed the arc of music history; he put Minneapolis on the map.”\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: Local leaders honored a homecoming queen who gave her crown to a friend whose mother had just died of cancer. Forrest County Sheriff Charlie Sims presented Nyla Covington a citizenship award, and the county Board of Supervisors voted to pay her community college tuition and declared Oct. 18 to be Nyla Covington Day. “I think her act really gave people hope there are still good folks in the world,” Sims said. Covington, 18, was crowned homecoming queen Sept. 24 at Forrest County Agricultural High School. During a ceremony on the football field, Covington immediately walked over to senior homecoming maid Brittany Walters and placed the crown on her head. Walters’ mother, A.J. Walters, an administrative assistant at the school, died the day of homecoming but had made her daughter and husband promise Brittany would take part in festivities that night. Covington told WDAM-TV that Walters started to back away as she extended the crown to her. “I was like, ‘No, come here, get it. You’re your mom’s queen,’ ” she said. “I wanted her to know that, and then I hugged her.” Walters said she felt her mother’s presence through act of kindness. “I can see my mom through Nyla,” Walters said. “They have the same exact caring, giving spirit, and it’s really fulfilling.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state’s largest utility has set up a data center at the site of one of its coal-fired power plants that it is using to mine the internet for bitcoins. Ameren Corp. officials say the data center could also help stabilize demand for electricity that could help it avoid ramping production down and back up again, which is inefficient. Ameren officials told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch they believe the utility is one of the first regulated U.S. utilities mining cryptocurrencies. The company has already collected more than 20 bitcoins, valued, as of Friday, at more than $60,000 apiece. But critics question the $1 million project because they say it serves to artificially heighten demand for energy from coal, and the utility could put the resources to better use elsewhere such as by pursuing technology like battery storage or electric vehicle charging stations. “This really increases demand on the system and, therefore, demand for coal energy,” said local Sierra Club official Andy Knott, part of the group’s Beyond Coal Campaign. “I think what they’re trying to do is avoid having to ramp down their generators.” Officials with the utility say they envisioned the high-powered computers as a flexible and controlled way to help manage the electrical load.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Democratic leaders in the Legislature are asking for an investigation into whether the state’s attorney general abused his power by sending a Montana Highway Patrol trooper to a hospital over a complaint from the family of a COVID-19 patient. St. Peter’s Health said three public officials threatened to use their positions to force doctors and nurses to treat the patient with ivermectin, a drug used for parasites that is not federally approved for the respiratory disease, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Attorney General Austin Knudsen’s office acknowledged getting involved but has said it was to investigate a report that the woman’s family was not allowed to contact her and that legal documents were not being delivered. The hospital’s statement said otherwise. State Senate Minority Leader Jill Cohenour and House Minority Leader Kim Abbott wrote to Senate President Mark Blasdel and House Speaker Wylie Galt on Thursday and asked them to appoint a special counsel to investigate Knudsen’s actions and those of any other public officials who involved themselves in the complaint against the hospital. The patrol’s involvement raised jurisdictional issues. Helena police are usually called for security issues at the hospital.\n\nNebraska\n\nBeatrice: Homestead National Historical Park rangers and volunteers have helped harvest seeds in the region’s tallgrass prairie to be used to restore disturbed areas of the prairie and increase species diversity. “We are always working on the oldest restored tall grass prairie in the National Parks Service, and this particular year we had to do some work along one of our trails, which did disturb the area, so we need to reseed it with our native plants,” said Jessica Korgie, a park guide at Homestead. The Beatrice Daily Sun reports that in order to restore the prairie, those in attendance walked through the trails near Homestead’s Education Center and collected flower and grass seeds that were ready to be harvested. They also wore tape around their waists and knees, which Korgie said was an experiment to see how seeds are propagated in the prairie. “If you think about the animals that are traveling through the tallgrasses, you have tall animals like deer, and you have small animals like the thirteen-lined ground squirrel,” Korgie said. “So we’re going to put tape up high and tape down low to see what kind of seeds we’re collecting at those heights, and let’s determine what kind of animals might be helping to redistribute this seed to other areas.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The school board for the metro area plans to consider whether to terminate Superintendent Jesus Jara’s employment contract this week. An agenda posted Friday for the Clark County School District trustees includes discussion and possible action Thursday on “termination of convenience” of Jara’s contract. Three board members requested the agenda item on Jara’s contract, which the board last May voted 4-3 to extend. It wasn’t immediately clear why the three trustees wanted to discuss Jara’s contract. He has faced criticism over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the decision to operate with 100% distance learning for about a year beginning in March 2020, as well as the school reopening process, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Regarding the board’s intention to consider his contract, Jara said Friday that he intends to focus on working for students and educators until he’s directed otherwise. The board also is scheduled to consider removing Linda Cavazos as its president. Jara has been superintendent since 2018, and his annual salary is $320,000.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFranconia: A fish ladder for trout breeding is being planned at the lake on the site where the Old Man of the Mountain once stood. The project is organized by a fund dedicated to helping to preserve a memorial to the Old Man of the Mountain. The massive, naturally formed granite profile attracted tourists to Franconia Notch for about 200 years before it crumbled in 2003. The memorial project was completed last year. The idea for a fish ladder to restore the natural trout breeding at the lake was first discussed years ago, when the Franconia Notch Parkway along Interstate 93 was built. “It’s a fish ladder leading from Profile Lake through all of the new development we did relating to wetlands and up to what is known as the old breeding pond,” Brian Fowler, president of the Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund, told the Caledonian-Record. “Profile Lake’s regional trout breeding area was this pond area, opposite of I-93. … The construction of the interstate cut off this natural breeding cycle.” Since the highway was built, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department has stocked the lake with trout. The legacy fund is partnering with the department, Trout Unlimited and the state parks division.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Thanks to technological advances over the past decade, people in dire circumstances such as an active-shooter situation can text 911 and get a link back from emergency dispatchers in Bergen and Passaic counties to give authorities permission to see a streaming video recorded by their cellphone camera. “They can watch in real time what’s happening,” said Officer Jonathan Klos, commander of the Passaic County sheriff’s communications division. “And the officers can prepare themselves, which makes everyone a little bit safer – now they know what they’re walking into.” The cellphone video streaming technology, named 911eye, was originally developed in the United Kingdom by Capita, a digital services business that helps first responders. The program allows authorities to do recon of a given area through the caller’s phone camera. “When the dispatcher can see live what’s going on, you’re going to get the right resources quicker,” said Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the former chief of the Bergen County Police Department. “This compresses the timeline, and responding officers have a heads-up about what’s going on.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are drafting a plan to ease restrictions against retired police officers coming back to work, in an effort to add law enforcement officers across the state in the midst of a labor shortage. At a legislative committee hearing last week, retired police officer and state Rep. Bill Rehm outlined a proposal for changes to retirement provisions for police that would incentivize a return to work. He said officers might continue to draw pension benefits while working and contributing to the pension fund, or they could delay retirement benefits for a bigger payout later. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is calling for the deployment of 1,000 additional police officers across New Mexico amid public frustration with crime. She said she will ask lawmakers for $100 million to underwrite the initiative. New Mexico amended rules at the Public Employees Retirement Association in 2010 to halt so-called double-dipping in response to concerns about fairness and the long-term solvency of the public pension fund for state and local government employees. Opponents of retired police rehiring plans say it can hurt morale by limiting career advancement opportunities for ambitious younger officers and threaten efforts to modernize law enforcement agencies.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Workers facing layoffs now have a right to ask their employers instead to trim all workers’ hours and have unemployment insurance help offset the losses for everyone, under a law that Gov. Kathy Hochul signed Saturday. The measure is meant to increase awareness of what is known as the “shared work program.” It already exists in New York but hasn’t been very widely utilized, though there has been an uptick during the coronavirus pandemic. Newsday reported in March that nearly 2,700 employers statewide newly enrolled in the program during the pandemic’s first year. The new legislation says workers can petition employers to launch shared work instead of laying people off or rehiring only some of the workforce after a prior layoff. The employer has to respond to the request but doesn’t have to grant it. The law, which took effect immediately, also prohibits retaliating against workers who ask for the arrangement. Proponents say shared work programs help employees keep their jobs, help businesses keep people they’ve trained and make particular sense now. “We need to make sure our recovery efforts focus on supporting workers,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: An abandoned vessel that ran aground on a beach more than a year ago will finally be removed. WRAL-TV reports the removal process is starting just in time for Halloween. Initially, most of the former scallop boat was visible along the shoreline. But it has been slowly sinking into sand along the beach south of Cape Hatteras National Seashore’s Oregon Inlet Campground. Now, more than half of it is buried. The haunting 72-foot-long shipwreck became a popular lure for tourists after it ran aground in March 2020. The crew was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. The National Park Service has been warning people to stay away, saying exploring the vessel is dangerous because of unstable sand shifting beneath it. Also, while the wrecked vessel is visible during low tide, it becomes completely surrounded by the ocean during high tide. Officials must remove the vessel before it disappears beneath the sand. The removal project is expected to cost about $295,000. It was expected to begin Monday and take roughly a month to complete.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew Town: A college on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation is offering an incentive for students to get COVID-19 vaccines. Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College in New Town announced that students who can verify they are fully vaccinated will receive $500. The shots must be completed by Nov. 4. “We are seeing a resurgence in the number of positive (coronavirus) cases in the Fort Berthold area and across the state of North Dakota and determined it was time to act,” said Twyla Baker, NHSC’s president. “The financial incentive rewards those who have prioritized their health and the health of others. It is also meant to motivate those who have not yet been vaccinated to act.” The Three Affiliated Tribes college offers in-demand certificate programs and associate degrees as well as three bachelor’s degrees.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: For the first time in its history, the state recorded more deaths than births last year – a development experts say was expedited by COVID-19. Roughly 143,661 Ohioans died last year, while 129,313 were born, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health. So far in 2021, the state has logged 107,462 deaths and 100,781 births. In the 112 years since statewide record-keeping began in 1909, data compiled by the Columbus Dispatch along with the Ohio History Connection shows deaths never previously surpassed births despite countless wars, economic downturns and disease. Ohio’s birthrate has been declining for years, while the number of deaths across the state has risen, meaning the two metrics were likely to swap places at some point. But data shows the pandemic rapidly hastened the switch. The coronavirus killed an estimated 13,927 Ohioans in 2020 alone, according to the state health department. That means the pandemic may account for 97% of the 14,348-person difference in births and deaths in 2020. In 2021, COVID-19 killed more than 9,400 Ohioans, more than the 6,681 difference in births and deaths so far this year. Deaths exceeded births in a record 25 states last year, according to research from the University of New Hampshire. In 2019, just five states saw more deaths than births.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Republican state senator is drawing criticism for referring to Asian Americans as “yellow families” during a legislative committee meeting on racial inequity. Sen. Dave Rader, of Tulsa, made the comment Wednesday to Oklahoma Policy Institute analyst Damion Shade following Shade’s comments during an interim study on racial inequality in economics and the criminal justice system. “It wasn’t until well into your presentation did you go to yellow families; you left yellow families out for quite a while,” Rader said. “You mean Asian Americans?” Shade replied. “You use black term, white term, brown term, so I was just gonna jump in there with you,” Rader said, before asking questions about Black families. The word “yellow” is considered a derogatory term in reference to East Asians. In the late 1800s, Chinese Americans were deemed the “yellow peril,” despite living in the United States for years. Rader said in a statement to KFOR that he has worked to remove barriers to success for all types of people. “I’ve spent my entire life as a football coach and educator, fostering opportunities for individuals of every race and background,” he said. Oklahoma Democratic Party Chair Alicia Andrews said it’s frustrating Rader would make such a comment during a study on racial inequality.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A glass recycling plant has consented to either shut down or install pollution control technology, according to an agreement announced between the plant’s operators and the state. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality gave Owens-Brockway, a glass recycling facility in northeast Portland, two options after it reached an agreement with the company to resolve the fine of more than $1 million it issued in June. The glass plant was cited for multiple, ongoing air quality violations of particulate matter emissions as well as permitted opacity. “The best thing Owens-Brockway could do to come into compliance and protect the community is to install pollution controls,” DEQ’s Northwest Region Administrator Nina DeConcini said in a statement. “And if the facility decides to install pollution controls, this agreement requires they demonstrate that the controls achieve a 95% reduction in particulate matter emissions.” Under the agreement, Owens-Brockway must either submit a permit application to install pollution controls by June 30, 2022, or shut down. If the company decides to install pollution control technology, it would have to do so within 18 months of DEQ approval of the application.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers for the area’s transit system have voted to authorize a strike next month if an agreement isn’t reached on a new contract. The Transport Workers Union Local 234 said a voice vote at a Sunday morning meeting in south Philadelphia approved a motion to allow union leaders to call a strike if an agreement with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is not reached in a week. The union represents about 5,000 bus drivers, cashiers, mechanics, and other workers providing service for buses, trolleys, the subway and elevated train lines. The current contract expires early Nov. 1, a day before the general election. “Our members are essential workers who have risked their lives and put their own families at risk during this pandemic,” union president Willie Brown told The Philadelphia Inquirer. He said the union was asking SEPTA to address “issues related to health and safety and modest economic improvements.” SEPTA said talks have been productive, and it hopes to avoid disruptions with agreement on a “fair and financially responsible” pact. The agency said it is still losing about $1 million a day in revenues due to ridership declines, with more people working at home during the pandemic and ridership not expected to return to February 2020 levels.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Ninety percent of adults in the state are now at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Dan McKee said Monday. The Democrat said Rhode Island is also now one of the top states in terms of the percentage of its population that is fully vaccinated. Overall, more than 77% of residents have received one vaccine dose, and more than 70% are considered fully inoculated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Rhode Island might be small, but we are mighty – especially when it comes to getting shots in arms,” McKee said in a statement. “Thank you to each and every Rhode Islander who stepped up to get vaccinated. It is because of you that we are leading the nation in vaccinations and economic recovery.” The governor said COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots continue to be available at sites across the state, including community centers, local businesses and schools, and more information can be found at C19vaccineRI.org. The state is averaging about 227 new cases of COVID-19 a day, down from about 264 a day two weeks ago. The state has reported 2,872 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic started.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s social services agency says it is now paying more money to providers in a program that subsidizes child care for low-income families. The Department of Social Services announced Wednesday that the agency has set up a new reimbursement rate structure for the SC Voucher program. The rates are now set based on the actual age of a child in the program, as opposed to what age group the child is in. That rate increase means families in the program will save money by covering fewer tuition expenses, the agency said in a news release. The new reimbursement structure also puts more money in the pockets of child care providers who may have struggled financially during the pandemic. A top-rated child care provider in the program might now receive $296 a week for full-time care of a child under 1 year old, whereas the previous rate structure would have allowed for a maximum of $205 weekly for any child up to 2 years old. The voucher program pays for more than 11,000 children to attend child care programs each month, according to the agency website. Parents must have an income below 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Computer science students from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology have built a new dating app, Lafdr, that matches people based on their taste in memes. After testing a prototype, the app for iOS and Android launched last month. Morgan Vagts and Debbie Liknes, who both graduated from Mines in May, channeled their frustration with existing dating apps by creating their own, the Rapid City Journal reports. Lafdr’s algorithm, built by Liknes, connects like-minded users through the memes they enjoy on the app. “Memes are a great conversation starter,” Vagts said. “It keeps the conversation light and lets people be themselves. … If you can laugh at a meme together, you know you have something in common.” Vagts said Lafdr is designed to help people find friendship or romantic connections, or users can simply browse the memes on Lafdr. Vagts and Liknes spent two years developing the app, which is geared toward college-age students but could potentially appeal to ages 18 to 35. “We were just sitting in Debbie’s living room, talking about the perils of online dating, and she joked about the idea of a meme-based app. And I thought, ‘Yes. That’s brilliant, let’s do it,’ and it evolved from there,” Vagts said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s top medical licensing officials are pushing the state government to crack down on doctors and nurses who spread damaging misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, calling for aggressive probes with the potential to suspend professional licenses and end careers. The Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners and the Board of Nursing instructed the Department of Health to pursue investigations of medical professionals who made disprovable claims to patients or on social media. Board members told investigators to prioritize cases involving the most obvious falsehoods or outrageous lies – that vaccines are poisonous, cause infertility, contain microchips or can magnetize the body. Investigators should focus less on subjective statements, even if they cause harm and worsen vaccine hesitancy, board members said, because the state lacks the authority and manpower to discipline those who merely discourage vaccination. “I don’t know that we can police opinion, even though it’s wrong and even though it’s causing – obviously causing – major problems in this state,” said Dr. Debbie Christiansen, a member of the Board of Medical Examiners. “But we can tell people they cannot say things that are absolutely false.”\n\nTexas\n\nKerrville: A driver lost control during a drag racing event on an airport runway and slammed into a crowd of spectators, killing two children and injuring eight other people, authorities said. A 6-year-old boy and an 8-year-old boy were killed in the crash Saturday afternoon at an event called “Airport Race Wars 2” at the Kerrville-Kerr County Airport, police said in a news release. The organized event was attended by thousands and involved drivers speeding down a runway as they competed for cash. The driver “lost control and left the runway, crashing into parked vehicles and striking spectators who were observing the races,” Kerrville police said. The injured victims were taken to various hospitals, including a 46-year-old woman who was listed in critical condition. The majority of the other injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, although the condition of a 26-year-old man was unknown, authorities said. A 4-year-old boy and a 3-month-old girl were taken to a hospital for precautionary evaluations. The Kerrville Convention and Visitors Bureau’s website promoted the event as an “action packed, family-friendly day” in which fans could watch the “fastest drag cars compete for over $8000 in total prizes.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The top prosecutor in the state’s most populous county says he will no longer offer plea deals to defendants accused of gun-related crimes, in an effort to combat gun violence. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said Wednesday that he was putting people “on notice” that his office will “throw the book at you.” He cited the recently released 2020 Crime in Utah Report, which showed an increase in homicides from 2019 to 2020. Two-thirds of those homicides involved firearms, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The change means that gun offenders will have to plead guilty to more serious crimes or go to trial, likely resulting in longer sentences behind bars. There would be exception if “evidentiary issues, legal or ethical prohibitions” prevent a conviction, Gill said. Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown and Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera said they hope the new policy will send a message to prospective criminals and will help halt the “revolving door” of individuals who are repeat offenders.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Residents are being asked for their input on how to spend about $46.9 million to clean up water pollution in the state. The Vermont Clean Water Board is seeking feedback in an online questionnaire on the funding levels and the board’s proposed prioritization of funding, the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation said. “The $46.9 million available in the 2023 clean water budget is an all-time high in funds available to improve Vermont’s water quality, in part thanks to additional leveraging of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds,” Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore said in a statement. “This is an exciting milestone and underscores the importance of public input to inform funding priorities.” The funding helps municipalities, farmers and others create projects that reduce pollution washing into waterways, ranging from farmers planting cover crops to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health to municipalities stabilizing roadside erosion, the department said. Water quality projects also help to protect Vermonters from damaging flooding, the agency said. The board’s draft budget is available online. Input can be sent through the questionnaire to the Clean Water Board through Nov. 19. The board will make final recommendations in December.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Mike Mason, once one of the nation’s highest-ranking FBI officials, now drives students to school in a yellow bus each morning and afternoon. It wasn’t the career turn he’d imagined for himself. Mason was once the executive assistant director of the bureau, responsible for overseeing all criminal investigations, among other duties. But in his retirement, he felt a pull to help when there was a shortage of school bus drivers. “Probably half of the FBI’s operational resources fell under me,” said Mason, 63, who lives in Midlothian, Virginia. Since late April, he has been working for Chesterfield County Public Schools as a bus driver. While the work differs drastically from his previous profession, “I feel the same sense of duty,” he said. Each morning about 5:30 a.m., Mason carefully inspects his 24-foot-long bus – examining the interior and exterior – to ensure it’s safe for students to ride. “I get it ready to roll,” he said. “This is not hyperbole: I’m smiling every day I start that bus up.” He collects nine students ages 10 to 18 and drops them off at the Faison Center in Richmond, which offers educational programs for autistic children. Mason grew up in Chicago, was raised by a single dad who was a truck driver for the board of education. “That’s part of what makes me smile every morning as I crank this bus up,” he said. “It’s the connection to my father.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Tens of thousands of people were without power Monday after a strong Pacific storm system downed trees and power lines the day before. Most of those still without electricity were in the Seattle area, where utilities reported about 60,000 customers out. Two people died after a tree collapsed onto their car near Issaquah on Sunday. The Seattle Times reports they were traveling in a white sedan on a densely forested roadway when the tree came down across the car. “It’s a freak accident,” said Sgt. Tim Meyer, a spokesperson for the King County Sheriff’s Office. “Just a moment or two’s difference could have drastically changed how this ended.” About a dozen schools in the greater Seattle area were closed Monday or were on a delayed start due to power outages or other issues from the storm. On Sunday, wind gusts topping 60 mph also downed trees on Interstate 90 east of Seattle and cut power to more than 150,000 customers in the metro area and around Puget Sound.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival held a rally at the state Capitol on Sunday to pressure U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin to support President Joe Biden’s package of social services and climate change strategies, according to a news release. Ahead of the rally, members of the campaign gathered the stories of residents they said would be abandoned by Manchin if he continued to insist on cuts to the package. Rally co-chair the Rev. William J. Barber II, in the release, called the West Virginia Democrat “the new Senator No.” “No to paying home health workers a living wage. No to free community college. No to dental and vision help for senior citizens. No to a $15/hour minimum wage. No to fully protected voting rights,” Barber said, adding that Manchin “still has a chance to say yes.” Also on Sunday, the campaign published full-page and digital ads in four West Virginia newspapers.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans plan to launch another investigation of how the 2020 election was administered in the state, GOP leaders announced Monday. Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, Senate President Chris Kapenga and Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dan Feyen said in a news release that Republican leaders will authorize the Senate’s elections committee to conduct the probe in the wake of findings legislative auditors released Friday. Auditors didn’t find any widespread fraud in the state but did identify inconsistent administration of election law based on surveys of ballots sampled from across Wisconsin. Auditors made 30 recommendations for the Wisconsin Elections Commission to consider and 18 possible legal changes for the Legislature. The GOP leaders’ news release said they would assess “the full impact of WEC’s deficiencies.” The release did not say when the Senate committee would begin the probe, how extensive it might be or whether the committee will be empowered to subpoena records. Elections Commission spokesman John Smalley said he hadn’t seen the release and had no immediate comment. A recount and court rulings have shown Democrat Joe Biden won Wisconsin, but former President Donald Trump and his followers have refused to accept defeat.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Dozens of U.S. fellow Marines joined hundreds of Wyoming residents over the weekend to bid a final farewell at a memorial for Rylee McCollum, one of 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing as they guarded a gate at a chaotic Kabul, Afghanistan, airport during the final U.S. evacuation from that country. Many of the Marines were members of the 20-year-old McCollum’s unit serving in Afghanistan when he was killed Aug. 26. McCollum, a Marine lance corporal, grew up, went to school and enlisted for the Corps in the mountain valley area known as Jackson Hole, home to the town of Jackson. He was honored during Saturday’s Jackson service attended by more than 400 people. “We knew his potential. I knew he had the mindset,” said Staff Sgt. Luis Diaz, who recruited McCollum into the Corps. “I knew he had the spirit to accomplish anything he wanted.” McCollum was a dedicated Marine, enthusiastic and funny, said Cpl. Wyatt Wilson. When something had to be done, Wilson told the Jackson gathering, “I always grabbed Rylee because I knew it would be done right the first time,” the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Gov. Mark Gordon, who attended with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, said Americans “should rejoice that heroes like Rylee are born.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/20/three-mile-island-closes-meltdown-changed-nuclear-energy-america/2352254001/", "title": "Three Mile Island closes: meltdown changed nuclear energy in ...", "text": "MIDDLETOWN, PA – Even 40 years later, John Garver vividly remembers the metallic taste of the nation's worst commercial nuclear disaster.\n\nAn acrid odor permeated Harrisburg as he walked out of a restaurant in Pennsylvania's capital city the morning of March 28, 1979.\n\n\"We had this smell in the air, wondering what it was,\" recalled Garver, 80, now a retired salesman. \"Well it didn't take us long to find out ... that the accident started.\"\n\nSome 14 miles away, the \"accident\" was unfolding in Unit 2 at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant, triggering panic, confusion and, within days, an evacuation order.\n\nThe partial meltdown sparked national protests, prompted increased safety standards for the nuclear power industry, and largely stymied the industry's momentum for decades until recent alarm over climate change has made some begin to embrace expanding carbon-free nuclear power.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nAt noon on Friday, the remaining reactor (Unit 1) generated its last kilowatt of energy and closed, a victim not of the anti-nuclear movement but rather of simple economics. Even though the plant is licensed to operate until 2034, Exelon Generation ceased operations after the state of Pennsylvania earlier this year refused to throw the company a financial lifeline that would have kept it open.\n\nThe plant's four cooling towers will remain part of the landscape for now, foreboding concrete tombstones that seem out of place in the bucolic Susquehanna Valley of central Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile it may not produce power, Three Mile Island (TMI) will continue to generate memories, said local historian Erik Fasick.\n\n“It shouldn't be forgotten,\" he said, the towers looming over his shoulder as he stood outside the plant's grounds along Route 441. \"It's the most important event that’s occurred in this area since the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.”\n\nNuclear energy comeback\n\nThe closure of Three Mile Island comes as nuclear power is getting a second look thanks to the devastating impact of climate change.\n\nNuclear is the largest single supplier of carbon-free energy in the nation, providing about 20% of U.S. energy. With environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers calling for ambitious deadlines to wean the country off fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases, advocates say nuclear power is emerging as a necessary ingredient of any response plan.\n\nChilling memories:'It scared the hell out of people': Remembering Three Mile Island accident, 40 years later\n\nSome Democratic presidential candidates have touted the benefits of \"next-generation\" nuclear power – or at least said it's worthy of consideration – as they push for alternatives to coal, oil and gas.\n\n\"Right now, nuclear is more than 50% of our non-carbon causing energy,\" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told a CNN town hall on climate change earlier this month. \"So people who think we can get there without nuclear being part of the blend just aren't looking at the facts.\"\n\nBut economic factors, mainly from the production of cheap natural gas and increasingly affordable renewable sources, are slowly driving nuclear power out of business. In addition, diminished demand has hurt profitability, as have rising costs to operate them, analysts say.\n\nGo to the infographic:How America’s worst nuclear accident unfolded\n\nTMI's shuttering means there will be 97 commercial reactors at 59 plants scattered across 30 states.\n\nOnly one new nuclear power plant has come online in the United States since 2010: The Watts Bar Unit 2 in Tennessee, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Two more reactors are under construction in Georgia, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).\n\nDivided Democrats:Nuclear power finds odd bedfellow in 2020 Dems as voters look for climate change solutions\n\nBut six reactors at five plants have been mothballed since 2013, and several others are slated to close in the next few years if they do not receive new financial support, according to a report last year from the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nA number of plants that were already in the pipeline prior to TMI's accident received licenses to operate after 1979. But plans for 39 others were canceled in the wake of the catastrophe, according to NRC documents, though factors such as high interest rates also contributed to the slowdown in new plants.\n\n\"Public confidence in nuclear energy, particularly in (the) USA, declined sharply following the Three Mile Island accident,\" according to the World Nuclear Association, a pro-industry group. \"It was a major cause of the decline in nuclear construction through the 1980s and 1990s.\"\n\nEric Epstein, a Harrisburg resident who chairs the Three Mile Island Alert organization that has long called for the shutdown of the facility, agreed that the accident set the industry back decades.\n\n\"If there is a good thing that happened because of TMI, it’s that it has ignited a fierce debate on the viability of nuclear power being safe, reliable, economical,\" he said.\n\nThe accident\n\nConstruction of the plant along the Susquehanna River near Middletown began in 1968 with the first reactor going on line six years later. Unit 2 came on line in December 1978, less than three months before its accident. Both were operated at the time by Metropolitan Edison. (Exelon, the current owner, didn't take over TMI until 2000).\n\nAt around 4 a.m. on Wednesday March 28, 1979, a mechanical or electrical failure prevented two pumps from sending water to steam generators, which cool the nuclear reactor with circulating water. A chain of events, punctuated by a stuck valve at the top of the pressurizer that was not detected, led confused operators to take steps that exposed the core leading to a partial meltdown.\n\nA chemical reaction formed a bubble of hydrogen gas inside the reactor. Operators reduce the bubble’s size through periodic venting to the atmosphere through April 1. The plant entered a “cold shutdown” on April 27.\n\nOver the next several days, there were conflicting messages about the severity of the crisis and how much radiation had been released.\n\nNuclear comeback?:Nuclear power finds odd bedfellow in 2020 Dems as voters look for climate change solutions\n\nGeiger counters to detect and measure ionizing radiation became commonplace. Children and pregnant women were encouraged to evacuate the area, first within a five-mile radius of TMI, then within 20 miles. An estimated 140,000 residents left as well, hoping to outrun the radiation threat. President Jimmy Carter and wife Rosalynn visited Middletown the Sunday after the accident in a bid to calm anxious residents and a worried nation.\n\nFueling those fears was the release 12 days earlier of \"The China Syndrome,\" a Hollywood thriller starring Jane Fonda about an accident at a nuclear power plant that was eerily similar to the scenario that unfolded at Three Mile Island, named because it sits three miles downriver from the center of Middletown.\n\nIn the movie, Fonda who plays a TV reporter is told that an explosion at the fictional plant located in Southern California “could render an area the size of the state of Pennsylvania permanently uninhabitable.\"\n\n\"I knew that line was coming ... Everybody knew it was coming,\" recalled Fasick, who as a seven-year-old accompanied his parents to watch the movie at a local theater a week after the accident. \"When it was said, there was still that audible gasp. You could hear it.\"\n\nThe shuttered power plant became a popular stop for \"dark tourism,\" the name given to infamous sites associated with death or tragedy that draw the morbidly curious.\n\nUnit 2, a structure built to withstand an airplane crash, never reopened thanks to the malfunction of a tiny valve. Unit 1 returned to service in October 1985 under new management (GPU Nuclear Corporation) following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to block the restarting.\n\nThe accident forced drastic changes in nuclear power plant operations and safety measures. More stringent training procedures were adopted. Plants were upgraded to be more secure. Communication protocols between plant operators and area governments improved. More comprehensive warning and preparation regimens were adopted. Evacuation plans grew more sophisticated.\n\nThere has been no major problem at a U.S. nuclear plant since Three Mile Island.\n\n'I'm not going to leave'\n\nFounded in 1755 about 50 miles north of Baltimore, Middletown is a central Pennsylvania hamlet steeped in history.\n\nWilliam Penn chose the site for a settlement in 1690. George Washington visited in 1774. A tunnel recently unearthed under an abandoned house is believed to be a stop on the underground railroad used to ferry slaves from the South to free states.\n\nAs time passed, many of the Scots and Irish who helped settle the area moved on, giving way to a wave of German immigrants who planted roots in the rolling hills and fertile farmland during the 19th Century.\n\nAll of that history is now overshadowed by the \"accident.\"\n\nMany left the area as the warnings about the danger grew louder. Most returned after a few days when radiation levels were deemed not as harmful as first feared.\n\nNumerous studies conducted over the years to determine whether radiation from the accident elevated cancer rates have been inconclusive.\n\nFasick, the historian who was a first-grader in nearby Lemoyne when it happened, believes the character of the area's residents contributed to their refusal to relocate.\n\n“I remember my parents talking about it. My father said we’re not going anywhere. I think it was the sentiment of a lot of people. Most of the people I knew and went to school with, no one left,\" he said. \"I think it’s the Pennsylvania Dutch mentality of stubbornness. 'This is where I'm from and I'm not going to leave.'\"\n\nMore:'It's our future that's at stake': US students plan to skip school Friday to fight climate 'emergency'\n\nEpstein, the anti-nuclear activist, was attending college in California at the time and had no plans to return to Harrisburg where his family ran a furniture store. Then Three Mile Island happened and he grew \"parochial and defensive\" upon hearing the countless insults hurled at his beloved community.\n\n“I got tired of the (Saturday Night Live) skits,\" he said. \"I grew up being proud of where I was from because we were known for three things: Hershey chocolate, the Amish in Lancaster, and Gettysburg. We were within an hour of losing all of that. We were a place you wanted to come. All of a sudden we were a place you wanted to avoid. Its’s what I came back to fight for.”\n\nThe challenge of nuclear waste\n\nThree Mile Island is closing but it will be decades before it's dismantled.\n\nThe first step to decommissioning the site involves transferring fuel to dry cask storage, made of stainless steel and concrete, for secure containment. That should happen around 2022, according to a timeline provided by Exelon.\n\nThe disassembling of the plant's largest components, such as the cooling towers, are not expected to happen until 2074. Four years after that, all radioactive material will be safely stored or removed from station.\n\nEpstein calls the on-site storage of waste “a toxic problem without a forwarding address.” It's an issue bedeviling the nuclear power industry.\n\nSpent nuclear fuel is now being stored in pools or in concrete and dry casks at every operating reactor site around the country, as well as the sites of permanently shut down reactors, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. All those sites have, and will continue to have, adequate storage for their spent fuel, an agency spokesman said.\n\nIn 1987, Congress selected Nevada's Yucca Mountain, a remote section of the Mojave Desert that sits about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, to become the nation’s permanent repository for nuclear waste generated by utility power plants and the military.\n\nThe Energy Department began pursuing a license for the facility in 2008. But the Obama administration abandoned the project three years later amid intense opposition from residents and political leaders in Nevada, including Harry Reid, who at the time was the Senate’s top Democrat.\n\nWith Reid gone, Congress keeps trying to revive the Yucca proposal.\n\nThe House last year voted overwhelmingly to direct the Department of Energy to resume the licensing process for a nuclear waste facility at Yucca. But the plan has stalled, prompting alternatives that would be more carrot than stick, such as a proposal to pay every Nevada resident an annual fee to take it.\n\nEmbracing an identity\n\nAbout 515 workers now work at the plant, down from a peak of more than 700 over the past two decades. The workforce will gradually drop to about 50 by 2022.\n\nThe loss of hundreds of jobs adds to the complicated relationship the surrounding area has with Three Mile Island.\n\nIt's been an economic engine even as it carried the stigma of what its detractors call the \"incident\" implying that the partial meltdown was a human-caused accident that should have been avoided.\n\n\"When (Metropolitan Edison) told us they were going to build a plant, they met with us and told us all the good things ... 'You have nothing to worry about,'\" said Garver, the Middletown retiree as he stood on a dock at the Tri-County Boat Club about a quarter mile from the plant's entrance. \"They probably were right if they woulda ran it right.”\n\nGarver, like many others in town, is glad the facility is shutting down but he also knows friends whose families have TMI workers facing a job loss or having to relocate to another Exelon plant in the state.\n\nThe closing remains a sensitive topic for many in Middletown even as some in the community embrace its connection to Three Mile Island.\n\nThe Nuclear Bean, a coffee shop, sells TMI-themed merchandise alongside gourmet teas. A new playground being planned for Hoffer Park will include locally themed features, including replicas of TMI's cooling towers. The local library has become a repository of Three Mile Island documents and records, a collection that drew visits from Japanese media following the 2011 earthquake that severely damaged Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant.\n\nAside from the jobs TMI provides, Exelon officials say the company has been a solid corporate citizen by contributing $6 million to local charitable and other non-profit organizations as well as the 40,000 hours its employees have logged volunteering in the community.\n\nJohn Ziats, 66, a retired state purchasing officer who volunteers at the Middletown Public Library, said contributions from Exelon have helped keep the doors open and the shelves stocked. With TMI closing, he worries how the library will make up for the loss of those corporate donations.\n\n'People didn't even want to be around us'\n\nZiats was 26 when the accident happened. He remembers the same metallic taste Garver experienced and thought he was coming down with an illness until he learned of the partial meltdown.\n\nAt the urging of his cousins in Connecticut, he evacuated to New England. The traffic got worse the closer he got to New York as if everyone was fleeing Pennsylvania, he recalled. His sister saw people carrying birds and other animals, presumably to detect radiation that humans could not taste or smell. The lack of credible information only added to the overall anxiety.\n\nWhen Ziats arrived in Connecticut and went to local drug store, he realized how much the accident had jarred the nation.\n\n\"People didn’t even want to be around us. (They) would step back because they were just fearful that we had some sort of contamination or something. So you kind of lived with that for a while,\" Ziats recalled as he sat in the library. \"At the time, people were just so panicked.\"\n\nHe returned home a few days later when it looked safe. But his angst persisted and he attended an anti-nuclear protest near Harrisburg that featured Fonda.\n\nBut over time, Ziat's attitude changed.\n\nHe began to see carbon-free nuclear energy as an answer to the fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. He saw how TMI has played an important – and accident-free –role in his community over the past 40 years. And, following the discovery of a malignant tumor behind his left eye a few years ago, he saw how radiation treatments saved his life.\n\n\"How can you really be against the nuclear industry when they've done so many positive things for people,\" he said.\n\nGarver, on the other hand, said he's relieved to see the plant close.\n\n\"You don't have to worry about it anymore. You don’t have to worry about sirens going off. You don’t have to worry about anything,\" he said, as the Susquehanna River lapped against the boat dock, the imposing towers looming behind him.\n\nGarver said he never thought about leaving the area when the accident happened or when the remaining reactor started up again in 1985.\n\n“This is my home,\" he said. \"This is where I was born and this is where I’m going to die.\"\n\nThen he added with a laugh: “Hopefully not from nuclear power. And I think I’m going to make it now.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/31/pumpkin-surgeons-wild-exhibit-white-house-groundskeeper-news-around-states/50888775/", "title": "Pumpkin surgeons, 'Wild' exhibit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the steamship owner responsible for illegally bringing 110 African captives to America aboard the last U.S. slave ship have ended generations of public silence, calling his actions more than 160 years ago “evil and unforgivable.” In a statement released to NBC News, members of Timothy Meaher’s family – which is still prominent around Mobile – said what Meaher did on the eve of the Civil War “had consequences that have impacted generations of people.” “Our family has been silent for too long on this matter. However, we are hopeful that we – the current generation of the Meaher family – can start a new chapter,” said the statement, which came amid the release of “Descendant,” a new documentary about the people who were brought to the United States aboard the slave ship Clotilda and their families. The film was acquired by Netflix and Higher Ground, the production company of Barack and Michelle Obama. The Meaher family has started meeting with leaders of the community in and around Africatown, the community begun by the Africans in north Mobile after they were released from slavery in 1865, the statement said. Clotilda Descendants Association President Jeremy Ellis said the organization had been in contact with the Meaher family by email, and members hope for face-to-face talks.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Alaskans want results, not “partisan political rhetoric,” as she faced Donald Trump-backed Republican rival Kelly Tshibaka in a televised debate Thursday. Tshibaka questioned the value of Murkowski’s seniority and said it’s time for a change. Murkowski “cannot accomplish in the next six years what she hasn’t been able to accomplish in the last 21 years,” Tshibaka said. Murkowski, who has held the seat since late 2002 and is the most senior member of Alaska’s congressional delegation, said the race is about “who can best deliver for Alaska.” She pointed to and defended her record. The debate, held less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 ranked-choice election, also included Democrat Pat Chesbro, who has significantly trailed Murkowski and Tshibaka in fundraising. The other candidate on the ballot, Republican Buzz Kelley, who finished fourth in the August primary, last month suspended his campaign and endorsed Tshibaka. Trump, who came to Alaska in July for a rally with Tshibaka and Sarah Palin, whose U.S. House run he’s endorsed, participated in a tele-rally for Tshibaka last week. He called Murkowski “one of the worst senators even imaginable,” criticizing her for voting for the “insane impeachment” and for opposing Brett Kavanaugh’s U.S. Supreme Court nomination.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge refused Friday to bar a group from monitoring outdoor ballot boxes in Maricopa County – where watchers have shown up armed and in ballistic vests – saying to do so could violate the monitors’ constitutional rights. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi said the case remained open, and the Arizona Alliance for Retired Americans could try again to make its argument against a group calling itself Clean Elections USA. A second plaintiff, Voto Latino, was removed from the case. Liburdi concluded that “while this case certainly presents serious questions, the Court cannot craft an injunction without violating the First Amendment.” The judge is a Trump appointee and a member of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization. Local and federal law enforcement have been alarmed by reports of people, some masked and armed, watching 24-hour ballot boxes in Maricopa County and rural Yavapai County as midterm elections near. Some voters have complained of voter intimidation after people watching the boxes took photos and videos and followed voters. “Plaintiffs have not provided the Court with any evidence that Defendants’ conduct constitutes a true threat,” the judge wrote. “On this record, Defendants have not made any statements threatening to commit acts of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Students from Northside High School have made bed frames for children in need. The city’s school district, Rotary Club of Fort Smith, the Community Rescue Mission, and the Sleep in Heavenly Peace organization joined forces on the hand-crafted bed construction project. According to SHP, 3% of children ages 3-17 nationwide do not have a bed in which to sleep. On Friday, 25 students from Northside’s construction class put their knowledge and skills to work in an effort to build beds for needy children. The SHP organization will deliver 30 new beds, along with mattresses and bedding, to area homes. “This project gives our students a chance to serve their community while enhancing their skill set,” Fort Smith Public Schools Superintendent Terry Morawski said. Fort Smith Rotary Club volunteer member Ken Colley said his group was “very excited” to lend a hand. “No kid should sleep on the floor in our town,” Colley said. “Studies have shown that if a child has a good night’s sleep, they will be much more apt to stay alert in the classroom and be able to focus and remember what they learn.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A man who spent more than 38 years behind bars for a 1983 murder and two attempted murders has been released from prison after long-untested DNA evidence pointed to a different person, the Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday. The conviction of Maurice Hastings, 69, and a life sentence were vacated during an Oct. 20 court hearing at the request of prosecutors and his lawyers from the Los Angeles Innocence Project at California State University, Los Angeles. “I prayed for many years that this day would come,” Hastings said at a news conference Friday. “I am not pointing fingers. I am not standing up here a bitter man, but I just want to enjoy my life now while I have it.” “What has happened to Mr. Hastings is a terrible injustice,” District Attorney George Gascón said in a statement. “The justice system is not perfect, and when we learn of new evidence which causes us to lose confidence in a conviction, it is our obligation to act swiftly.” The victim in the case, Roberta Wydermyer, was sexually assaulted and killed by a single gunshot to the head, authorities said. Her body was found in the trunk of her vehicle in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. A suspect identified through DNA testing last year had died in prison in 2020, according to state officials.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and businesses in suburban Denver last winter caused more than $2 billion in losses, making it by far the costliest in Colorado history, the state insurance commissioner said. Commissioner Michael Conway provided the updated estimate this month during a meeting with residents who lost homes to the so-called Marshall Fire in Boulder County and other Colorado wildfires in recent years, The Denver Post reports. The Boulder County fire broke out unusually late in December following months of drought and is blamed for at least one death. Official estimates released days after the fire put the losses at more than $500 million. Experts say the winter grassland fire that blew up along Colorado’s Front Range was rare, but similar events will be more common in the coming years as climate change warms the planet, sucking the moisture out of plants, and as suburbs grow in fire-prone areas. Conway said additional insurance claims and assessments of the scope of rebuilding from the wildfire prompted the new estimate. “We’re estimating now it will be $2 billion in claims if not more,” he told residents. Investigators have yet to determine what caused the Dec. 30 fire, which was fed by winds up to 100 mph and raced from the Rocky Mountain foothills eastward through unincorporated Boulder County and into the cities of Superior and Louisville.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As part of his campaign to win over blue state voters, the Republican candidate for governor, Bob Stefanowski, is trying to capitalize on any lingering resentment over safety precautions taken at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, the businessman pledged never to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for schoolchildren, joining Republicans who made similar promises after a national panel advised the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to add the shots to lists of recommended vaccinations for kids and adults. Stefanowski has complained that the state’s old mask mandate in schools, which ended in most districts in late February after campuses were allowed to reopen for in-person learning with masks in August 2020, lasted too long. In his proposed “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” he said families shouldn’t be “forced by the government to vaccinate or mask their children without any recourse to object.” “It’s up to the person. They should have the choice,” Stefanowski said. Stefanowski’s opposition to mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for “public or private employees or anyone else” is in line with other Republicans who have campaigned this election season on promises to protect individual liberty in public health.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden returned to his home state to cast his ballot for the midterm election Saturday afternoon. He was joined by his 18-year-old granddaughter Natalie, a first-time voter. The two arrived at the Shipyard Shops polling location on the Wilmington Riverfront at 4:15 p.m., a few hours after the president watched Natalie Biden’s field hockey game at St. Andrew’s in Middletown. The two of them walked through the doors of the polling place hand in hand after greeting a constituent leaving the building. Secret Service and local police officers were posted outside as the Bidens voted, drawing the attention of others who had come to vote early. They took photos and posted on social media, surprised to see the president there. When the Bidens emerged from the voting booths, White House staff said Joe and Natalie Biden placed “I Voted” stickers on each others’ shirts. The president then gave his granddaughter a kiss on the cheek. Joe and Natalie Biden join the more than 17,800 Delawareans who had voted either by mail or in person as of Friday afternoon, according to the Delaware Department of Elections. A department spokesperson said the official count would be updated Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief White House groundskeeper as of this month has spent 50 years serving the families – and many of their pets – who have called the mansion home. Dale Haney’s chief responsibility in his post that has spanned 10 presidencies is to care for the vast lawns, colorful flower gardens, hundreds of trees, thousands of shrubs and burgeoning vegetable garden on 18 acres of property surrounding the White House. He also picks out the official White House Christmas tree every year. To honor Haney, President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, surprised Haney last Monday by planting an elm tree on the south grounds. Biden said visitors in future years are “going to be looking at this tree and asking, ‘Who’s Dale?’ ” Haney, 70, joked that he “might still be here.” But Haney is perhaps better known to many at the White House, from staff to Secret Service officers, as the keeper of the president’s pets. “He’s like the whisperer,” said Anita McBride, who was a young aide in the correspondence office in Ronald Reagan’s administration when she first met Haney. These days, Haney is often seen walking Commander, Biden’s German shepherd. Haney started at the White House in 1972 and said he originally planned to work there for just two years.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: An evacuation order has abruptly forced out residents of a 14-story oceanfront building on the same avenue where a condominium collapse killed nearly 100 people last year. The city posted an unsafe structure notice Thursday evening at the Port Royale condominium, Miami Beach spokesperson Melissa Berthier said in an email. A structural engineering report prompted the evacuation of the 164-unit structure, which is in the process of undergoing a required recertification. An engineer discovered that a main support beam identified for repair 10 months ago had shifted, and a crack in the beam had expanded, and other structural supports may need repair as well, the report said. One resident, renovation contractor Marash Markaj, who lived in the building for more than six years, said the damage extends beyond a single support beam. “I’ve seen the issues for many years,” Markaj told the Associated Press. He said he tried to report the issues – including cracks in a column and water standing in the garage area for weeks at a time – to the building management and to the city’s building department. “I was never able to get a response,” he said, adding that he was feeling “unsafe” living in the building and with the way the building’s maintenance was handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man and his family “have faced threats of violence and live in fear” since the movie “2000 Mules” falsely accused him of ballot fraud during the 2020 election, according to a federal lawsuit. The widely debunked film includes surveillance video showing Mark Andrews, his face blurred, depositing five ballots in a drop box in downtown Lawrenceville, a suburb northeast of Atlanta. A voiceover by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza says: “What you are seeing is a crime. These are fraudulent votes.” In fact, a state investigation found, Andrews was dropping off ballots for himself, his wife and their three adult children, who all live at the same address. That is legal in Georgia, and a state investigator said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Andrews. D’Souza’s film uses research from the Texas-based nonprofit True the Vote and suggests that ballot “mules” aligned with Democrats were paid to illegally collect and deliver ballots in Georgia and four other closely watched states. An Associated Press analysis found that it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. State and federal officials have repeatedly confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election that could have changed the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former U.S. defense contractor in Hawaii accused with his wife of living for decades under stolen identities of dead babies will get a new attorney, a federal judge ruled Thursday. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. The couple have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Assistant Federal Defender Max Mizono filed a motion this month asking to withdraw as Primrose’s attorney, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. During a telephone hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rom Trader granted the request after a private conversation with Mizono and Primrose. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic Russian KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said. Attorneys for the couple have said they are not Russian spies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says it will not reconsider the clemency case of a terminally ill man who is facing execution for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors near McCall. The high court made the decision Friday in Gerald Ross Pizzuto Jr.’s case. The decision means the state remains free to seek a death warrant for Pizzuto. Once issued, the warrant would set his execution by lethal injection in the next 30 days. Deborah A. Czuba, the head of the Federal Defender Services of Idaho’s capital case unit, said in a statement that the Idaho Supreme Court decision was disappointing. “There is still time for Gov. Brad Little to accept the recommendation of his parole commissioners and let Mr. Pizzuto die a natural death in prison,” Czuba said. “If not, our hope is that the State will have enough grace to wait at least until after the Thanksgiving and Christmas season before making Department of Correction employees participate in a needless and traumatizing execution during the holidays.” Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row and was originally scheduled to be put to death in June 2021. He asked for clemency last year because he has terminal bladder cancer, heart disease, diabetes and decreased intellectual function.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A mountain lion that roamed residential neighborhoods in the state capital was sedated Friday and taken to a sanctuary that houses big cats, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources said. The young male cat was tranquilized by staff with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services branch and sent to the Exotic Feline Rescue Center in Center Point, Indiana, the state agency said. IDNR wildlife experts, Illinois Conservation Police, the USDA and the Springfield Police Department determined the animal had entered areas of the city where he would be a threat to people or property. The animal, which was fitted last year with a GPS collar by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, had wandered to Illinois from Nebraska. It arrived in Springfield on Wednesday, and IDNR warned residents not to disturb it while the agency tracked its movements. The DNR asked people to leave the mountain lion alone because the animals are a protected species in Illinois, and it’s illegal to kill them unless they pose an imminent threat to person or property. Its appearance in Springfield marks the second time in recent weeks a mountain lion has been detected in Illinois. The DNR said a mountain lion was struck and killed Oct. 16 by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County.\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A fifth grade teacher in northwestern Indiana charged with felony intimidation after authorities say she told a student she had a “kill list” of students and staff has agreed to stay away from the school. Angelica Carrasquillo, 25, of Griffith, signed a no-contact order Friday without objection when she appeared wearing a green jail uniform in Lake Superior Court, The Times of Northwest Indiana reports. Judge Kathleen Lang affirmed Carrasquillo’s not guilty plea to one felony count of intimidation. Carrasquillo was being held with a bond set at $20,000 surety or $2,000 cash. Court documents say Carrasquillo communicated “a threat to commit murder” on Oct. 12. Once officials at the school where she was employed, St. Stanislaus in East Chicago, learned of the threat, they immediately confronted her and escorted her from the building, the Diocese of Gary said in a message to parents. When Carrasquillo was asked why she wanted to kill herself and others, she reportedly told school officials: “I’m having trouble with my mental health, and sometimes the kids do not listen in the classroom. I also have trauma caused when I went to high school.” But Carrasquillo also allegedly told school officials that “she was only joking about it all.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge should allow a law passed in 2018 that bans most abortions to take effect, three years after the measure was ruled unconstitutional, lawyers for Gov. Kim Reynolds argued Friday. Chris Schandevel, a lawyer for the Republican governor, said Judge Celene Gogerty should set aside a 2019 permanent injunction that prevented Iowa from enforcing a law that would block abortions once cardiac activity can be detected. That is usually around six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they’re pregnant. Schandevel said the injunction rests entirely on an Iowa Supreme Court 2018 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion under the state constitution and cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 and 1973 that established abortion rights nationally. All three cases were overruled this year by more conservative courts, and given that, Reynolds’ lawyers argued the judge should reverse the injunction and let the 2018 law take effect. Rita Bettis Austen, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, countered that there is no precedent or legal support in Iowa for a judge to reverse a final judgment entered three years ago. The judge said she would issue a ruling soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Voters are being asked to reduce the authority of the governor and other state officials and give legislators a bigger say in how the state regulates businesses, protects the environment and preserves residents’ health. A proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the Nov. 8 ballot would make it easier for the Republican-controlled Legislature to overturn regulations written by state agencies and boards – those under the control of the governor but also others in the executive branch of state government. At issue are rules as varied as which shots are required for children attending school and how often hotels must clean guest rooms. Business groups and advocates of smaller government view the measure as reining in unelected bureaucrats. But in the fall campaign’s final weeks, abortion rights advocates have begun warning that it is another attempted power grab by far-right legislators. The November vote comes three months after voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to eliminate state constitutional protections for abortion and give lawmakers authority to more tightly regulate or ban the procedure. Those who oppose the regulation amendment have repurposed the “vote no” yard signs from the abortion vote for their fall campaign.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools has received the largest gift in its history, according to the district, with plans to invest the funds in some of the city’s most disadvantaged schools. A total of $20 million was put forward by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott for Louisville’s public school district, officials said at a press conference Thursday. The money will go toward “direct financial support for JCPS,” district officials said in a release. JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said the gift came following an interview with a consulting firm that represents several unnamed philanthropists. Three months later, he said, Scott’s team called to tell him about the planned donation to JCPS. “We also promised this community that we would fund the schools in an appropriate way so that the families in this community would have equity in selection,” Pollio said at the event at the Academy @ Shawnee in Louisville’s West End. “You can’t go to a high-poverty school across America and see something like this.” Pollio said the $20 million influx in cash will help address growing inequity in supplemental funding – cash that schools receive through parent-teacher associations, athletic events, booster clubs and alumni associations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Roads: Authorities are looking for a stolen sign marking a centuries-old tree that inspired author Ernest Gaines. The Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office said the historical marker identifying the “Miss Jane Pittman Oak” was stolen recently, and the parish government is offering a $500 reward for information leading to its recovery or the thief’s arrest, news outlets report. The tree itself, believed to be about 400 years old, served as partial inspiration for “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” which gained widespread notice for the internationally acclaimed, award-winning author. The book describes a first-person narrative of a fictional 110-year-old woman born into slavery. Historians have said Gaines regularly walked past the oak tree, which sits along Louisiana Highway 16 in Lakeland, a village in the parish, on his way to the grocery store. In 2008, state officials considered cutting down the oak because its low-hanging branches posed a potential threat to passing cars. But the state ultimately relented amid pushback from Gaines and other activists, opting instead to trim the branches. Tips leading to an arrest or recovery of the marker should be directed to the sheriff’s office at 225-694-3737. Gaines, who died in 2019 at age 86, will be depicted on a stamp next year, the U.S. Postal Service announced last week.\n\nMaine\n\nHallowell: The Maine Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a pair of energy projects that would generate enough wind power for up to 900,000 homes along with construction of a new transmission corridor to get the electricity to the regional power grid. The PUC was required by law to choose the projects to boost transmission capacity and renewable energy in Aroostook County. It chose LS Power Base for a 345-kilovolt transmission project and Longroad Energy’s King Pine for a wind generation project, but it didn’t rule on how how much of the cost would be borne by Maine ratepayers. Together, the net cost of the projects is $1.8 billion over a 30-year period, but they would benefit the state, officials said. An influx of energy into the regional grid would “place downward pressure on electricity prices, benefitting consumers in Maine and throughout New England,” said PUC Chair Philip L. Bartlett II. It’s a similar to the proposed 145-mile transmission line that would be a conduit for 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid, but it would serve a different purpose. State voters rebuked the New England Clean Energy Connect last November, and work was halted pending the outcome of a lawsuit.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Two legislators have called for an independent review of the state Department of Natural Resources’ handling of repeated complaints against the former manager at Gunpowder Falls State Park. A Baltimore County grand jury indicted former longtime manager Michael Browning last Monday on charges that include rape and assault. The Baltimore Sun reports that state Sen. Sarah Elfreth and Del. Eric Luedtke called for the review in a letter to Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, Maryland’s secretary of natural resources. “The behavior and lack of accountability described is inexcusable and requires prompt action by the Department to address the issues raised and ensure that a similar situation never happens again,” the letter says. Baltimore County Police arrested Browning, 71, in September and charged him with sexually assaulting a former park employee. According to charging documents, the woman told police she met Browning as a teenager while attending a youth club his wife ran before working with Browning at the park. Police wrote in charging documents that the two had a yearslong consensual relationship. The woman told police that she tried to end the relationship and that Browning raped her 10 to 15 times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Police and school officials are trying to figure out how a 7-year-old child managed to bring a loaded gun to school. Police responded to UP Academy Holland in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood about 3:30 p.m. Thursday for a report of a student with a firearm, police said in a statement on the department’s website. Responding officers confiscated the weapon. No injuries were reported. “I’m speechless. I don’t have the words. This is truly devastating,” Boston Public Schools Superintendent Mary Skipper said in a statement. “We have to ask ourselves how a very young student becomes in possession of and gains access to a firearm.” Mayor Michelle Wu pledged to hold the person who allowed the child access to the gun accountable. “No child should be near a weapon, much less directly endangered at such a young age,” she said. No additional information was released. “The Boston Police Department is focused on the proliferation of guns in our city and keeping access to them away from the youngest among us needs to be a priority for everyone,” Police Commissioner Michael Cox said. The school has about 770 students from kindergarten through fifth grade, according to its website. Police are still investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nWyandotte:There’s nothing sweet about bringing home a cockroach, so trick-or-treating is off limits in a suburban Detroit neighborhood. Officials in Wyandotte said a cockroach infestation has been confirmed at a vacant home after a tip from a trash hauler. The pests have been moving to other homes. Sidewalks will be closed Monday night on a portion of 20th Street. City engineer Greg Mayhew said a Halloween ban will prevent “further roach migration.” Officials don’t want the bugs hitching a ride on costumes. The city is trying to exterminate the roaches, but “it will take some time,” Mayhew said. Walking the street could help kill the cockroaches, but their eggs still could spread and survive, City Council member Todd Hanna said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Election officials held a public demonstration of voting machines Friday as part of an effort to maintain public trust and transparency in election systems that have drawn coordinated attacks from ex-President Donald Trump and others. Minneapolis Director of Elections and Voter Services Katie Smith showed election judges from around the city how to test the voting equipment: Turn on the tabulator machine, feed the pre-marked set of test ballots into the machine, print off the results, and make sure the results exactly match the ballots. More than two dozen people tested the tabulator machines and assistive voting devices – which help voters zoom in, print and read their ballots with Braille, if needed – at the demonstration at the city’s election and voter services building. Smith said the public accuracy test, which is required under state law, is important because it lets members of the public see their votes are going to be correctly and accurately counted on election night. Around the country, some voters have expressed skepticism about election systems since Trump and others have falsely claimed that widespread voter fraud led to President Joe Biden being elected. After nearly two years, no evidence has shown that voting machines were manipulated to steal the 2020 election or that there was any widespread fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nMound Bayou: The tiny, all-Black town of Mound Bayou became a safe haven for Emmett Till’s mother as she traveled to Mississippi to testify in the murder trial of two white men who lynched her son in 1955. Hundreds of people – a good portion of Mound Bayou’s 1,500 residents – turned out Thursday evening to watch the movie “Till.” The feature film went into wide release across the U.S. over the weekend after being in limited release since Oct. 14. “This place, this city, is very sacred to the story of Emmett Till,” one of the filmmakers, Keith Beauchamp, told the mostly Black audience in the gymnasium/auditorium of Mound Bayou’s John F. Kennedy High School. The screening happened days after a bronze statue of Till was unveiled about 50 miles away in Greenwood. Beauchamp is one of the producers and writers of “Till,” which largely focuses on Mamie Till-Mobley’s reaction to the loss of her only child and her evolution into a civil rights leader. Mound Bayou was founded by formerly enslaved people in the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta in 1887 as a freestanding community where Black people could thrive amid the hostility of the Jim Crow era.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed testing inside a school closed amid concerns of radioactive contamination, and sampling of soil outside the school has begun, Corps officials said Friday. A suburban St. Louis school board voted last week to close Jana Elementary School in Florissant after testing by a private firm found levels of radioactive isotope lead-210 that were 22 times the expected level on the kindergarten playground. It also found high levels of polonium, radium and other material inside the school, which sits along Coldwater Creek, contaminated decades ago with Manhattan Project atomic waste. The Corps said in a news release that radiation detection instruments were used to scan surfaces inside the school. Sampling of soil outside the school is expected to go on for another two weeks, the Corps said. The agency plans to sample at least 45 spots, with depths ranging from 15 to 28 feet below the surface. Preliminary test results are expected in November. The approximate 400 students at Jana Elementary are taking virtual classes for the next month, then will be reassigned to other schools. Coldwater Creek was contaminated in the 1940s and 1950s when waste from atomic bomb material manufactured in St. Louis got into the waterway near Lambert Airport, where the waste was stored. The result was an environmental nightmare that resulted in a Superfund declaration in 1989.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two conservation groups have filed a lawsuit against the state and its wildlife management agency, alleging it illegally set hunting and trapping policies and quotas intended to reduce the gray wolf population by making it easier to kill the predators. WildEarth Guardians and Project Coyote filed the lawsuit Thursday in District Court in Helena asking for the new laws and resulting increased quotas to be overturned. Montana’s Republican-controlled Legislature in 2021 passed bills that allowed the state to reduce the wolf population, authorize additional hunting methods, allow extended hunting seasons, allow an individual to kill up to 20 wolves, and allow private parties to offer bounties for hunting or trapping wolves. The conservation groups allege management decisions are being made based on a wolf plan that was created in 2002 and was amended to use a new wolf population model without following state rulemaking procedures and without public participation. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Greg Lemon said Friday. Montana officials authorized the killing of 450 wolves during the winter of 2021-22 but ended up shutting down hunting near Yellowstone National Park after 23 wolves from the park were killed, all but five in Montana.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Dueling lawsuits have been dropped by a former candidate for governor and a fellow Republican state lawmaker who accused him of groping her at a political function several years ago. Charles W. Herbster, who lost his bid in May to become the GOP nominee for governor despite an early endorsement from ex-President Donald Trump, sued state Sen. Julie Slama for defamation after she told the Nebraska Examiner that, in 2019, Herbster reached under her skirt and groped her at the Douglas County Republican Party event when she was 22. Slama was one of eight women who accused Herbster of unwanted groping, but Slama was the only one to go on the record with her name. Herbster denied the allegations and painted them as a politically motivated attack. Slama quickly countersued, accusing Herbster of sexual battery. The competing lawsuits had largely stalled in the months since being filed, with both sides seeking delays. Online court records show that both sides on Wednesday submitted motions to dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled. On Thursday, the judge granted the motion. Neither the motion nor the judge’s order addressed why the parties sought to dismiss their respective lawsuits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A rural county roiled by voting machine conspiracy theories stopped its unprecedented effort Friday to hand-count ballots cast in advance of Election Day. But Nye County officials vowed to reshape their plan and seek another go-ahead from the Nevada Supreme Court, after justices ruled late Thursday that counting methods used last week violated rules they set to prevent the county from allowing early disclosure of election results. “Yesterday’s Supreme Court order requires us to make some changes to our hand count process,” Nye County officials said in a statement issued Friday that promised to “resume as soon as our plan is in compliance with the court’s order and approved by the secretary of state.” Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada said they stood ready to challenge any effort to restart the hand tallies this week and don’t believe there’s any hand-counting scenario that would pass legal muster. The civil rights advocacy group accused Nye County officials of failing to prevent public release of early results before polls close to in-person voting Nov. 8. It argued that reading candidates’ names aloud from ballots within hearing distance of public observers violated the court rule.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Democratic U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and Republican challenger Robert Burns frequently took jabs and interrupted one another over COVID-19 funding, drug addiction treatment and abortion rights during their first debate Friday for New Hampshire’s 2nd Congressional District seat. Burns said many companies are suffering now because of reckless government spending. “My opponent here talks about the need for the federal government to help build businesses ... I built my business without the help of the federal government,” said Burns, who runs a quality control and pharmaceutical safety company in Bedford. “That’s not true when you consider the Paycheck Protection loan that you took,” Kuster said. Burns responded: “That was 10 years later.” Kuster expressed her support for suboxone medication to treat opioid addiction, saying it is helping her own brother. Burns said statistics have shown that isn’t true and accused her campaign of being funded by its manufacturers. Burns, who says he is pro-life and supported the overturn of Roe v. Wade, was asked to clarify his proposal to form “panels” that would require a second and third opinion when a woman, in his words, is “being forced to have an abortion.” Burns said “probably misspoke a little bit” in his use of the word “panel” and said he was referring to the mental health of the mother.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Borough: A “significant” piece of historic artwork depicting George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth may be sold by the Monmouth County Historical Association for millions of dollars, drawing opposition from historians who claim the MCHA museum would lose a valuable piece of history. Titled “Washington Rallying the Troops at Monmouth,” the painting by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze, a legendary German artist, dates to 1857. It recreates Washington’s involvement in the historic battle that occurred in June 1778. “I think it would be pathetically tragic to sell one of the key pieces of the association’s major collection,” said Joe Hammond, a former curator of the MCHA museum and one-time director of the association. “It is a regional collection of national significance, and the painting of Washington rallying the troops at Monmouth is one of the most significant.” But with a price tag that could reach tens of millions of dollars, MCHA officials contend it is worth investigating a potential sale. The new interest is likely the result of a recent multimillion-dollar sale of another Washington painting by Leutze. His famed “Washington Crossing the Delaware” piece fetched more than $45 million in May, according to Christie’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The FBI confirmed Friday that it is investigating a report from a Santa Fe-based environmental advocacy group that it received mail containing antisemitic imagery and a suspicious powdery substance inside. FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said in an email that the substance was tested and determined not to be harmful. Further details were not being released in order to protect the integrity the investigation, he said. Conservation Voters New Mexico Executive Director Demis Foster said the group received an envelope Wednesday in the mail that included a brown, powdery substance inside along with a torn-up political flier that the group distributed in support of a Democratic state House representative who is running for reelection. The mail included a reference to the Nazi Party, a swastika and other antisemitic symbols, Foster said. She said first responders including police evacuated the building, and an employee who opened the mail was released unharmed from a hospital after undergoing observation. Foster said she and her employees are working remotely as a precaution, while continuing their advocacy for environmental causes and endorsed political candidates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, who fought poverty and racism and skillfully navigated New York’s power structure as pastor of Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, died Friday at age 73, the church announced. “The Butts Family and entire Abyssinian Baptist Church membership solicit your prayers for us in our bereavement,” the church said on its website. No cause of death was given. Butts began serving as a youth minister at Abyssinian in 1972 and was senior pastor there for more than 30 years. He also served as president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury, on Long Island, from 1999 to 2020. His post at Abyssinian gave Butts one of the most prominent pulpits in the U.S. The church traces its roots to 1808 when a group of Black worshippers who refused to accept segregation at the First Baptist Church of New York City left to form their own congregation. The church’s current home on 138th Street in Harlem is a massive Tudor and Gothic revival structure dedicated in 1923 and designated a city landmark in 1993. Earlier pastors at Abyssinian included Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and his son Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The two North Carolina Supreme Court seats up for election in November have taken on extra significance as the outcome could flip the court’s partisan makeup during a period of political polarization. Registered Democrats hold a 4-3 advantage on the court, but Republicans would retake the majority for the first time since 2016 should they win at least one race. The seats carry eight-year terms, so barring unplanned retirements, Republicans would be assured of keeping the upper hand for at least 41/ 2 years if successful. Outside groups are spending big to influence the races. In the two largest television markets alone, two super PACs have committed spending roughly $3 million on ads, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In keeping with nonjudicial elections this year, ads have focused on crime and abortion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state auditor said Thursday that an examination of North Dakota’s electoral systems conducted in response to voter concerns found that they are “incredibly secure.” Auditor Josh Gallion said he undertook the review in response to concerns nationally that false claims of election fraud and conspiracies are threats to democracy. “We looked at any potential weaknesses in the election system of our state that could be exploited by someone with nefarious intent,” Gallion said. “The determination after extensive review from our contractor was that our election systems are incredibly secure across our state.” The review found six vulnerabilities to the state’s election system but all were labeled “low risk,” Gallion said. The report identified the vulnerabilities as the the ability for a voter to cast multiple ballots, identity theft of deceased voters, stuffing or discarding valid absentee ballots, equipment tampering, and absentee ballot fraud. Gallion said his office received many inquiries from residents and others about North Dakota’s election security following the 2020 election, fueled by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. One inquiry came from MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who has echoed lies that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The first major retrospective of artist Maurice Sendak’s work since his 2012 death – and the largest and most complete to date – opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. Most people today know Sendak as the creator of children’s book classics such as “Where the Wild Things Are” and “In the Night Kitchen.” A new exhibition of his work looks at that reputation and a less well-known side of his immense output: his work as a designer for opera, theater, film, and television. “We wanted people to understand that Maurice was actually a serious artist,” said Lynn Caponera, executive director of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Though most knew him as an illustrator and picture book artist, “they didn’t see beyond the fact that he did a lot more than that,” she said. “Wild Things are Happening” opened this month at the Columbus Museum of Art and runs through March 5, 2023. It’s the first major retrospective of Sendak’s work since his 2012 death and the largest and most complete to date. The exhibit takes its name from a 1990s advertising campaign Sendak did for Bell Atlantic that featured Wild Things characters promoting “a fast, dependable Internet service.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nBroken Arrow: The deaths of eight family members – including six children found in a burning Oklahoma home – are being investigated as a murder-suicide, authorities said Friday. Police are trying to determine whether both adults were involved in the killings. The children, who ranged in age from 1 to 13, were the victims, Broken Arrow Police Chief Brandon Berryhill said during a news conference. He did not provide their identities, ages or explain their relationships to one another except to say they were family members believed to be living in the home. Police said both adults who live in the home were considered “primary suspects” because they were found dead in the front of the home while the children were all found in a bedroom, where the fire was contained. A police spokesman declined to say whether authorities believe the two adults were both responsible for the killings or whether it could be just one of them. “It’s because investigators are still trying to piece together what happened with eight people dead,” police spokesman Ethan Hutchins said in an email to the Associated Press. Hutchins also said police would not be able to identify the dead adults until the medical examiner’s office has completed its work.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration compiled extensive intelligence dossiers on people who were arrested, even for minor offenses, during Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon. Initial drafts of the dossiers even included friends of the subjects as well as their interests, but those were later removed and replaced with a note that they would be made available upon request, according to an internal review by the Department of Homeland Security. The dossiers, known by agents as baseball cards, were previously normally compiled on non-U.S. citizens or only on Americans with “a demonstrated terrorism nexus,” according to the 76-page report. It was previously released last year but contains new revelations based on extensive redactions that were removed by the Biden administration. Ben Wizner, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s free speech, privacy and technology project, said the report indicates leaders of the Department of Homeland Security wanted to inflate the risk caused by protesters in Portland. The city became an epicenter of sometimes violent demonstrations in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. But many protesters, including women belonging to a “Wall of Moms” ad hoc group and military veterans, were peaceful.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Authorities say they have recovered a gun believed to have been thrown off a bridge by a suspect after a shooting that injured six people, one critically, outside a church where a funeral was being held. Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said a river rescue team working off the McKees Rocks Bridge on Sunday morning was able to locate a firearm matching the description of the firearm used in Friday’s shooting outside Destiny of Faith Church. Officials said the weapon found had a bullet in the chamber and had been reported stolen in Shaler Township. Nineteen-year-old Shawn Davis of McKees Rocks and a 16-year-old Pittsburgh youth are both charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons counts in the noontime gunfire Friday outside the church where a funeral was being held for a man killed in a shooting earlier this month. The service was being livestreamed, and the video showed several people screaming and ducking for cover. It wasn’t clear if any shots went into the church. One person was taken to a hospital in critical condition while four other shooting victims were listed as stable. A sixth person injured trying to escape was also treated.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Backed by Brown University, Vartan Gregorian Elementary School has opened a hands-on, interactive classroom meant to help students explore science, technology, engineering, art and math in a fresh new space. Three groups of fourth and fifth graders were assigned a challenge Friday to figure out a way to raise a tiny flag using three machines and six chain reactions – without electricity. After a couple of false starts, fifth grader Noelle Ingle’s team propelled a tiny ball down a ramp, which struck a series of matchbox cars, which raised a card-size version of the Brown University flag. The room erupted in cheers. The Rube Goldberg machine was the first experiment in Gregorian’s new STEAM lab. Brown University spent approximately $200,000 renovating the dingy third grade classroom, installing new windows, floors and a sink and buying new furniture, including ricochet stools that allow students to wiggle while seated. The university also purchased whiteboards, a smart television and a microscope with up to 1,200x magnification. The shelves are already filled with robot and model car kits, magnetic play tiles and Legos. Brown has had a decades­long partnership with the elementary school, named after Vartan Gregorian, Brown’s larger-than-life president, who served from 1989 to 1997 and died April 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials are scheduled to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would restrict children from accessing public library books and electronic materials that are “promoting sexuality.” Local news outlets report the proposed Greenville County Council measure would direct trustees of the Greenville County Library System to order books and electronic materials removed from the county’s 12 libraries. The resolution also orders the library trustees to report “how such books ever found their way into the children’s sections of our public libraries” and to say how they will prevent them returning. As is true nationwide, controversies over materials dealing with LGBTQ and racial themes have been roiling South Carolina schools and public libraries for a year, particularly in the heavily Republican Upstate region. A large number of opponents spoke against restricting books during a Greenville County Council meeting in September, saying it targets books with LGBTQ themes. “These materials are not innately sexualized, they are not innately about sex, they are just about who we are and those should continue to exist,” Tyler Prescott of the Upstate LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce told councilors then. Republican Councilor Joe Dill, who is sponsoring the resolution, said in September that the county needs to also consider other people who are offended.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two critically endangered red wolves have arrived at the Great Plains Zoo from facilities in Texas and Washington. There are fewer than two dozen red wolves living in the wild, the zoo said in a press release, making them the most endangered canid species in the world. The wolves’ placement at zoo is part of a species survival plan, which aims to breed pairs with the greatest possible genetic diversity. “With only around 20 individuals remaining in the wild, the survival of the red wolf species is contingent the concerted help of accredited zoos and conservation partners with species survival breeding and reintroduction plans,” CEO Becky Dewitz said in a statement. “Weare grateful and dedicated to helping save the red wolf from extinction.” The male and female wolves are still getting used to each other and their new habitat, so the path by their enclosure will be blocked for ZooBoo, which takes place this Friday through Sunday. The zoo asks patrons respect the barricades as the wolves adjust.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Historical Commission is taking applications for awards to honor people or groups that work to study and preserve the state’s heritage. The commission said Thursday that its Certificates of Merit are presented each May, during National Preservation Month. The deadline for submissions is Dec. 31. Patrick McIntyre, State Historic Preservation Officer and executive director of the commission, said the awards program “highlights people and organizations for the work they do in the areas of publication, commemoration, and education regarding our state’s unique history and heritage.” “For 47 years our awards program has offered an opportunity to give thanks and recognition to those working to champion and revitalize Tennessee’s historic places,” McIntyre said. Applications can be found on the commission’s website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state police chief said Thursday that his department “did not fail” Uvalde during the hesitant law enforcement response to the Robb Elementary School shooting, as a Republican congressman joined angry parents of some of the 19 children killed in the May attack in calling for him to resign. Col. Steve McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, acknowledged mistakes by officers while several Uvalde families confronted him in Austin over multiple outrages: why police waited more than 70 minutes before entering the fourth-grade classroom and killing the gunman, false and shifting accounts given by authorities, and records that remain withheld more than five months later. But McCraw defended his agency, and during a meeting of the state’s Public Safety Commission, made the case that failures uncovered to date did not warrant his removal while saying he was not shirking from accountability. Uvalde families bristled and asked how DPS could not have failed, given that troopers were among the first on the scene. “I can tell you this right now, DPS as an institution, right now, did not fail the community,” McCraw said. “Plain and simple.” Significantly, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales said for the first time after the meeting that McCraw should also lose his job, becoming the first major figure in the GOP to call for a change at the top of Texas’ state police force.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Jordan: U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens and Democratic challenger Darlene McDonald agreed on none of the issues addressed Friday in their only debate before the midterm elections, with each largely echoing their party’s talking points on inflation, abortion and infrastructure spending. In an untelevised debate in the basement of a suburban real estate office with an audience of only campaign staff and half a dozen reporters, the Utah Republican blamed Democrats and President Joe Biden for fentanyl being imported across the U.S.-Mexico border, racial division and inflation. Owens accused Democrats of pushing critical race theory – an academic framework that connects the country’s history, including the legacy of slavery, to contemporary racism – and said that it’s destroying the country’s social fabric. “One thing that the Biden administration has accomplished is that they’ve given us a common purpose again,” Owens, one of two Black Republicans in the U.S. House, added. “We now share in what’s called misery, as a people.” McDonald, who is also Black, countered that Owens was spreading falsehoods to drum up fear – about both the nature of protests against police brutality and the idea that critical race theory was being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A man charged with the 1989 stabbing deaths of his in-laws in the town of Danby after modern DNA techniques linked him to the crime pleaded not guilty Friday during a court hearing. The arraignment of Michael Louise in Vermont Superior Court in Rutland came two days after he was returned to Vermont from New York to answer charges in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73. He had been scheduled for arraignment Thursday but the hearing was delayed 24 hours. Louise entered the pleas and then was ordered held without bail, said Vermont State Police spokesperson Adam Silverman, who monitored the hearing remotely. Louise, 79, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later after the couple was found dead in their Danby home in September 1989. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, but there was not enough to charge him, police said in an affidavit filed in the case. Louise told conflicting stories about whether he had traveled to Vermont from his home in Liverpool, New York, on Sept. 13, 1989, the day the Peacocks were believed to have been killed. Their bodies were discovered Sept. 17 after neighbors went to check on the couple.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The U.S. Coast Guard, a crew of scientists and others launched an air and sea mission to rescue 13 people, including a child, from a fishing vessel just moments before it sank in darkness early Friday in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia, authorities said. The 115-foot Tremont fishing vessel collided with the 1000-foot Panamanian-flagged container vessel MSC Rita, about 60 miles from shore, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The Tremont sent out a mayday call that it was taking on water and sinking with 13 people aboard that was received by watchstanders with Coast Guard Sector Virginia, officials said. That call was also heard by Atlantis, a 274-foot ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts, at about 1:45 a.m., WHOI said in an email to The Associated Press. The captain of the Atlantis contacted the Coast Guard and motored 8 miles west to the fishing vessel. The Coast Guard launched an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew from its air station in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the Coast Guard said. It also dispatched a motor lifeboat crew from its station in Chincoteague, on Virginia’s Eastern Shore, and diverted the Coast Guard Cutter Rollin Fritch to assist.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: The city’s dress code ordinance saying bikini baristas must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment last week came after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reports. Everett is about 30 miles north of Seattle. U.S. District Court in Seattle found Everett’s dress code ordinance violated the Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington state constitutions. The Court found that the ordinance was, at least in part, shaped by a gender-based discriminatory purpose, according to a 19-page ruling signed by U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men,” including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis. Bikini baristas were “clearly” a target of the ordinance, the court also ruled, adding that the profession is comprised of a workforce that is almost entirely women.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Local chefs and surgeons put their carving skills to the test for the Huntington Children’s Museum Pumpkin Carving Contest at The Market’s outdoor patio in downtown Huntington. Jessica McCormick, of Huntington, brought her two children, 10-year-old Iris and 4-year-old Oscar, to the event on Tuesday, which also featured the Marshall Nutrition Program, a dance floor with a fog machine, and other contests and events for kids. “They loved this event last year, and they love checking out the carved pumpkins, too,” said McCormick, who is the vice president of the museum’s board of directors. “We have been waiting for a children’s museum in Huntington since Iris was a baby. I hope everyone will get involved and donate to such a great cause.” Drew Hetzer, of Backyard Pizza and Raw Bar and The Peddler, was one of the local dining legends competing in the contest that also included Jonathan Patterson of Le Bistro and Jordan Hagy of La Famiglia. “I’m sticking with a pizza theme, but with a Halloween twist on it,” Hetzer said. Participating surgeons included doctors Ashleigh Clickett, Courtney Crain, Michael Gentile, Farzad Amiri and Ben Moosavi. “I will attempt carving a breastfeeding mother with a baby,” said Clickett, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist at Valley Health. “Cutting a pumpkin is a lot different than human skin, so it will be much different. I just want to have fun with it and help a great cause at the same time.” Votes for the best pumpkin can be made with donations to Huntington Children’s Museum online at givebutter.com/hcmpumpkin.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court is refusing to block a lower court’s ruling prohibiting voters who already submitted an absentee ballot from voiding it and voting again, a rarely used practice known as ballot spoiling. The 2nd District Court of Appeals decided Thursday against hearing an appeal of a Waukesha County circuit court judge’s ruling this month in favor of a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. That ruling required the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission to rescind its guidance that allowed the spoiling of ballots that had already been cast. Voters who obtained an absentee ballot, but have not yet voted and want to obtain a new one, can still do that. The elections commission held an emergency meeting Friday, less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, and unanimously voted to rescind the guidance issued in August detailing how an already cast ballot could be spoiled. Very few voters have actually spoiled their absentee ballots after voting in recent elections, data provided by the elections commission to the Associated Press shows. In the August primary, just 3,519 people cast a new ballot after spoiling their original one, less than 0.3% of all votes cast, the data shows.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Three wolves shot and killed in the state are drawing attention across the border. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials believe the animals may have belonged to their state’s closely watched North Park wolf pack. The North Park pack, which often crosses into Wyoming where hunting wolves is legal, gained notoriety last year after birthing Colorado’s first known litter of pups in 80 years. Travis Duncan, spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, said in an email that the agency cannot yet confirm whether the slain wolves were in the North Park pack but will continue to monitor the animals “if and when they are next seen in the area.” Duncan added that at least two wolves were seen Friday in northern Colorado. In Colorado, killing a wolf can bring a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. But once all four paws are across the border into Wyoming, wolves are in the state’s “predator zone” where anyone can legally hunt the animals without a license. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The difference in state laws could impede Colorado’s planned reintroduction of wolves that was narrowly approved by voters in a controversial 2019 ballot initiative. The introduction is planned for 2023 on the sparsely populated Western Slope.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}]}

City A.M. said \"they had official party status removed, and were effectively supplanted by Canada's Reform party, which became the broad home of right-wing voters.\"\n\nThe latest polls and odds\n\nFor the first time since the beginning of the election campaign there has been a \"clear shift in the poll averages shown on the BBC poll tracker\", wrote BBC senior political analyst Peter Barnes.\n\nAs of 10 June, the BBC's poll tracker had Labour retaining its \"commanding\" lead on 44%, with the Tories 21 points behind on 23%. Reform was up slightly on 14%, just ahead of the Lib Dems on 10%, while the Greens were on 6% and the SNP on 3%.\n\nThe decision by Nigel Farage to take over as leader of Reform UK and announce that he would stand as a candidate in Clacton \"has clearly had a positive impact on the party's performance in the polls\", said Politico, with those taken entirely in June ranging from 11% to 17%.\n\n\"Reform's move upwards has come at the expense of the Conservatives who are now at their lowest level on the poll tracker since October 2022.\"\n\nBased on this national vote share, a YouGov/MRP poll for Sky News last week forecast Labour is on course for a bigger majority than its 1997 landslide. Its central prediction is that Labour will win 422 seats with the Tories on 140, giving it the biggest majority for any government since 1935.\n\nThis is just the latest MRP to predict a Tory wipeout, and carries more weight than traditional polls because it produces constituency-level predictions, \"allowing MPs and candidates to open a spreadsheet and view their percentage chances in black and white\", said The Guardian.\n\nWhat is more, Conservatives are bracing themselves for the party's chances to be further harmed by Sunak's early departure from D-Day celebrations, which drew condemnation from across the political spectrum over the weekend.\n\nIn a sign of what is to come, The New Statesman's Britain Predicts model, last updated on 8 June, predicted Labour could end up with 456 MPs, with the Tories on just 86. Were the Conservatives to drop below triple figures many would see it as an extinction-level event which the party would struggle to recover from.\n\nBookmakers overwhelmingly favour Labour too. Betfair has shortened its odds on Keir Starmer being the next prime minister from 1/80 to 1/100 over the past week, while a Sunak victory is priced at 16/1 with Unibet and others, according to Oddschecker.\n\nWhat policies are popular… and which are not?\n\nWith the major parties launching their manifestos this week, attention turns from personalities to policies.\n\nYouGov polling on public attitudes to the proposals that parties have announced so far show that while Britons tend to back both Labour and Conservative pledges not to increase National Insurance, VAT or income tax, they are more divided on other areas.\n\nThe Conservatives' Triple lock plus pensions pledge has proved popular with the British public, with three-quarters (73%) backing the plan to raise the amount pensioners can receive before having to pay income tax in line with the annual increase in the state pension.\n\nThe party's much-discussed national service pledge enjoys less support, with around half (52%) opposed to the proposal that 18-year-olds serve a year in the armed forces, or commit to one weekend of volunteering per month for a year, compared to 39% who support it.\n\nLabour's manifesto is expected to flesh out the six key policies unveiled by Starmer in May. These include promises on the economy, energy, crime, education, the NHS and immigration.\n\nYouGov found plans to introduce VAT on private schools is welcomed by 61% of Britons, and supported by those who voted Conservative in 2019 by 49% to 36%.\n\nLabour's flagship policy of creating a publicly owned renewable energy provider is backed by three-quarters (74%) of voters. However, the plan to lower the voting age to 16 is opposed by 59% of voters, with 79% of over-65s against reducing the voting age.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/961251/keir-starmers-transformation-of-the-labour-party", "title": "Keir Starmer's transformation of the Labour Party | The Week", "text": "In 2019 the Labour Party faced its worst electoral defeat in over 80 years – now the party could be looking at victory in the next general election.\n\nWhen Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecution, was elected leader in 2020, the Labour Party stood at a crossroads after enduring four consecutive election defeats.\n\nPromising to unite the party and bring about a much-needed transformation in its fortunes, Starmer “basically said he would be Jeremy Corbyn in a suit without the IRA stuff or Palestine obsession”, one former party aide told the Financial Times (FT).\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

His team have made it his business to know the politics of local Labour branches and selection for the first 100 Labour target seats “has been more tightly controlled than at any previous point in the party’s history”, said Balls.\n\nThe Labour leader has purged candidates suspected of holding radical left views and assembled a list of centrist or “ideological” candidates to run for the next general election. Most notably, the left-wing mayor of North of Tyne, Jamie Driscoll, was last week blocked from standing for re-election, in a move linked to his appearance on stage with film director Ken Loach, who was expelled from the party in 2021.\n\nBanning Driscoll from re-election shows that Labour is “acting like a narrow clique with no respect for the party’s pluralist traditions”, said Jon Trickett, MP for Hemsworth, writing for Tribune. Not only are the reasons for doing so “spurious”, argued Trickett, but “a Blackfriars-based clique determining who can or cannot stand for the party in the North is a profound mistake” and will do little to win back key communities in the north of England.\n\nMany of the new faces waiting to take the place of those purged “look almost like a Blairite and Brownite restoration”, said The Spectator’s Balls, citing Douglas Alexander, a former New Labour minister, and Emma Reynolds, a Blair-era special adviser. Plus as the moderates return, the “money is close behind them”, she said. “Bankrolling the Starmerarmy are many Blairites from the past: Waheed Alli as Labour’s head of election fundraising, with Lords Sainsbury and Levy back in the fold.”\n\nRevamped policy agenda\n\nStarmer has made radical policy changes since first running for the leadership. Initially making 10 pledges that largely aligned with the Corbynite agenda – still available on Keir Starmer’s website – these included pledges to abolish tuition fees, keep public services in public hands, a higher income tax for the top 5%, and a commitment to “unite our party.” But Starmer has since distanced himself from many of these promises.\n\nThe Labour leader has since said the party is “likely to move on from that commitment” on tuition fees. And on privatised utilities, he has been quoted as saying the way to move forward is “going to lie in regulating the market, changing the market, rather than simply taking things into public ownership”. Of course, when it comes to policy decisions, “Starmer’s audience has changed: a Corbyn-era party membership during the campaign, and the wider electorate now”, said Archie Bland of The Guardian’s First Edition newsletter. But it has led many both inside and outside the party “to question whether he ever meant what he originally said”.\n\nLabour’s Starmer-led policy trajectory has shown similarities to some of the popular policies championed by Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party, said Patrick Maguire for The Times Red Box. In 2020, Johnson was promising “to do better: to reform our system of government, to renew our infrastructure; to spread opportunity more widely and fairly and to create the conditions for a dynamic recovery that’s led not by the state but by free enterprise”, and had announced plans for a £12 billion “green industrial revolution”, powered by provincial industry.\n\nAnd all of this, “give or take the emphasis on the role of the state, we have since heard from Starmer and Reeves”, said Maguire. Indeed, Starmer’s confidants seem to “embrace” the comparison, with one telling Maguire: “Which party’s manifesto will look most like the 2016 Vote Leave and 2019 Tory offer? It’s ours.”\n\nYet a Labour victory is still far from assured, said Yasmeen Serhan for Time. Few Britons “appear to know who he is or what he stands for”, while he is “dogged by perceptions that he is wooden, distant, and even a bit boring”. Overall, he is yet to convince British voters that “Labour has what it takes to bring Britain back from the brink”.\n\nKing in the north\n\nBut Starmer’s fortunes have been significantly boosted by recent developments on the political scene, said Stephen Bush in the FT.\n\nThe departure of Boris Johnson and his allies from parliament, as well as the crisis facing the Scottish National Party – following the arrest and the subsequent release without charge of former leader Nicola Sturgeon – is ultimately “good news” for Labour.\n\nThe absence of Johnson allows more attention to be focused on the “crises engulfing both Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, and creates two eminently winnable by-elections for his party”. Meanwhile, the challenges faced by the SNP make it easier for Labour to achieve a parliamentary majority “both numerically and politically”. “The big picture of all this is simple, I think: Keir Starmer is going to become prime minister,” said Bush.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "Jamie Timson", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954099/is-labours-lead-over-tories-a-blip", "title": "Is Labour's lead over the Tories a blip - or a sign of things to come ...", "text": "After 149 consecutive poll leads, the Conservatives have fallen behind Labour for the first time since January following a week of manifesto-busting pledges on taxes and pensions.\n\nThe latest polling by YouGov found that Labour has pulled two points ahead of the Tories as “support for the Conservatives slumped to its lowest level since the general election on the back of Boris Johnson’s tax rise”, The Independent said.\n\nThe prime minister has stood by the National Insurance hike – which was passed in the Commons yesterday by 319 votes to 248 – while Culture Minister Oliver Dowden told Times Radio that while poll results “come and go”, Johnson will be rewarded for making “difficult decisions in the national interest”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But it would appear to have also cost him in terms of his popularity with voters.\n\nThe latest YouGov polling results, carried out for The Times, show “support for the Conservatives had fallen to its lowest level since 2019”, the paper said. It suggested that “the policy has, at least for now, undermined the Conservatives’ reputation as a party of low taxation without giving them the credit for increased investment in the NHS and social care”.\n\nThe poll also found that “six in ten voters did not think Johnson or his party cared about keeping taxes low compared with about two in ten who thought he did care”, while “less than a third of voters thought Johnson and the Conservatives cared about improving the NHS compared with more than half who do not”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn what the Daily Mail described as a “more optimistic sign for the Tories”, Labour “only managed to soak up one extra point” after the week of manifesto-breaking policy announcements.\n\nAnd cabinet minister Dowden sought to “shrug off the setback”. “I’m afraid I’ve seen polls up and down, come and go,” he told Times Radio. “The real test is general elections and, in my experience, voters reward political parties, they reward governments that are willing to take difficult decisions in the national interest.\n\n“I’m absolutely confident that in the distant future, when there is a general election, people will weigh up what this government has achieved,” he added.\n\n“They’ll look at the strong growth, they’ll look at the jobs that have been created, they’ll look at our handling of this unprecedented crisis and they’ll say that the prime minister and the government handled it well and have got the right plans for the future.”\n\nAnthony Wells, YouGov’s director of political research, also suggested that “we should be cautious of leaping to too many conclusions from a single poll”. However, he also added that “it looks as if the government may have sacrificed their reputation for low taxes amongst Tory voters without actually getting much credit for helping the NHS”.\n\nThe poll results will also “alarm Conservative MPs before the party conference next month”, The Times added, especially those who “spoke out against the plan”, for example ex-chancellor Philip Hammond and former leader Iain Duncan Smith.\n\nBut it will come as a welcome boost to Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has faced criticism from his own side of the political divide for “failing to set out an alternative plan for social care reform”, reported the Daily Mail.\n\nRed rise?\n\n“Letting the government come unstuck on one of its flagship policies is a good enough strategy three years from an election,” said the i’s policy editor, Jane Merrick. “But there are already calls from inside his party and beyond for [Starmer] to showcase some policies of Labour’s own.”\n\nAnd Starmer might do well to learn from the experience of his rival party’s former leader, David Cameron.\n\n“Four years before the 2010 election, David Cameron began a policy overhaul”, which included big policies such as an inheritance tax cut. It may have “infuriated Tory traditionalists” but it “got the Conservatives noticed”, she added.\n\nWhat this poll definitely does not show is “Starmer’s Labour seizing the day”, wrote Red Box editor Patrick Maguire in The Times, who accused the party of producing not a “murmur of original thinking” as events unfolded in Westminster. However, Starmer’s team seem “pretty sanguine”.\n\n“We’re far from victory but the poll shows that the social care scam wasn’t the brilliant wheeze No 10 were spinning earlier this week,” one Starmer insider told Maguire.\n\n“And our decision to focus attention on their plan, expose it, and not get spooked in to making a big announcement of our own in response – despite some flak – was the right one.”\n\nHowever, even among the Starmer faithful, those who back him are “getting weary of his reticence to make bold policy commitments or offer up a vision of how he wants to lead the Labour party”, said Sky News’ political editor, Beth Rigby.\n\nHis usual offering of “saying he’s not Jeremy Corbyn” is “growing old 18 months in”, she added, and a lot will be riding on his conference speech when he needs to set out what the future looks like under his Labour Party.\n\n“But after a difficult six months,” Rigby added, “a lot is riding on a good performance.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Jamie Timson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960993/does-labour-now-have-the-upper-hand-on-immigration", "title": "Does Labour now have the upper hand on immigration? | The Week", "text": "Net migration to the UK reached a record high last year, opening the Conservative Party up to criticism that it has broken its 2019 manifesto pledge to “take back control” of borders and reduce numbers of migrants.\n\nThe highly anticipated data released by the Office for National Statistics today showed that net migration reached 606,000 last year, up from 504,000 in the year to June 2022.\n\nThis means immigration to the UK is at more than double the level it was in 2019, and nearly treble pre-Brexit levels. “Brexit was meant to resolve the issue,” said Politico. “Yet more than three years after Britain left the EU, the numbers are only going higher.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The Labour leader said he would scrap the current rule that allows employers in sectors suffering from work shortages to hire foreign workers for as little as 80% of the going industry rate.\n\n“I think Labour have the upper hand on this,” Nigel Farage said in The Telegraph’s “Planet Normal” podcast yesterday. The Labour leader’s “feigned sincerity” at reducing net migration “could just be more believable” at the next general election than the Conservatives, the former UKIP leader said.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\nThe ONS data revealed that 1.2 million people moved to the UK in 2022 and 557,000 emigrated, which means “immigration added a city roughly the size of Glasgow to the UK’s population last year”, said The Times.\n\nAlthough figures are lower than the 700,000 to 1 million the Centre for Policy Studies and Home Office modelling had forecast, they are “expected to pile further pressure on Sunak”, the paper said.\n\nLabour’s pledge has “stolen a march on the Government”, said The Telegraph. It “mirrors a more dramatic proposal” by Home Secretary Suella Braverman this year, to raise the salary thresholds for foreign skilled workers, which is “understood to have been blocked by No 10 and the Treasury amid fears it could undermine economic growth”.\n\n“It is unfair and is a built-in incentive for employers to recruit from overseas in shortage occupations,” wrote Stephen Kinnock, the party’s shadow minister for immigration, in an article for the same paper, “rather than addressing the causes of the shortages in the first place.”\n\nEvery Conservative prime minister from David Cameron onwards has made their own “failed pledge” to cut net migration to below 100,000 a year, said Politico.\n\nRising immigration feeds into a sense of “betrayal” among Brexiteer voters, Rachel Wolf, a co-author of the 2019 Conservative manifesto, told Politico. “A huge part” of what people voted for in the 2016 referendum was about “taking back control of immigration”.\n\n“I can see an unexpected political configuration taking shape,” said David Goodhart in The New Statesman, which could “swing the next election decisively in Keir Starmer’s direction: Could Labour become the party of immigration reduction?”\n\nMost voters believe that net migration is “alarmingly high”, the former editor of Prospect magazine said, and should be reduced.\n\n“Yet few people strongly oppose any of the elements that make up the visa-controlled inflow: the humanitarian route for Ukrainians and Hong Kongers, the post-Covid bounce in student numbers, and the health and social care workers who account for half of the work visas.”\n\nSome of this will inevitably decrease in the coming months, which if Labour wins would allow the party to “claim some of the credit for the fall in numbers (however disingenuously)”.\n\n“What is the real difference between the two main parties on immigration?” asked Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of The Spectator. “Not much,” she said. “Both parties are struggling to convince voters that they have the will and ability to control migration.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nOn Tuesday, the government announced a crackdown on international students, which would bar them from bringing families to the UK with them or switching to work visas before finishing their studies. It is the “biggest ever single measure” to tackle legal migration, Sunak told the House of Commons.\n\nBut the Home Office figures, which show there was a record high number of work and study visas in the first three months of this year, “suggest that net migration has not yet peaked”, said The Times.\n\nOther Home Office data suggests “there will still be 1.1 million visas being granted by the time of the election in 2024”, said The Telegraph.\n\nRobert Jenrick, the immigration minister, told MPs on Wednesday that there may be “more that needs to be done” to reduce net migration before the next election.\n\n“Broader demographic shifts are also starting to change the immigration conversation,” said Politico. “The types of voters who tend to view immigration more positively” – university graduates, migrants and younger people – “are increasing as a share of the population.”\n\nSo the Labour Party should avoid “alienating its liberal base too much”, said Goodhart in The New Statesman.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Joel Mathis", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954270/a-look-back-at-the-2019-conservative-manifesto", "title": "Manifesto review: are the Conservatives really 'Getting on with the ...", "text": "Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party Conference speech offered a vintage display of his humour and wordplay, but was notably light in policy.

Pushing through Brexit would “restore confidence and certainty to businesses and families” and usher a “pent-up tidal wave of investment into our country”, promised the party.\n\nIndeed, by 1 January 2021, Johnson was celebrating the UK’s first full day of freedom from the EU as an “amazing moment for this country”, reported the Daily Express, superimposing a Union Jack with the word “Freedom” on it on to the white cliffs of Dover on its front page.\n\nBut for others, such as The Guardian, the UK ended the EU era “in crisis” and “without fanfare”. “With the majority of England subject to tough restrictions, and hospitals warning of a calamitous winter coronavirus crisis in the weeks ahead, the chimes of Big Ben sounded across near empty streets at 11pm,” said the newspaper on New Year’s Day.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nTax freeze\n\nThe Tories promised not to raise the rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT. “This is a tax guarantee that will protect the incomes of hard-working families across the next Parliament,” stated the party’s manifesto.\n\nBut by September this year, Johnson had announced a £12bn-a-year “tax raid” to address the funding crisis in health and social care, reported the Evening Standard. Johnson told MPs that breaking a manifesto commitment was not something he did “lightly” but that the new NI levy was “the reasonable and the fair approach”. The prime minister added that “Covid was in no one’s manifesto”. On the same day, the government announced that the triple lock on the state pension would be temporarily suspended next year – another broken manifesto promise.\n\nFunding public services and levelling up\n\nDespite the pandemic, an analysis of progress on Tory pledges by the Institute for Government (IfG) in May this year told a “surprising story”. It found that out of 287 commitments in the manifesto, 212 had been completed or had made varying levels of progress.\n\nThis included promises to increase funding for NHS England by 3.1% between 2019/20 and 2023/24 and to recruit 20,000 police officers. A pledge to create 50 million extra GP appointments per year fell by the wayside, however, with 36.6 million fewer GP appointments between March 2020 and February 2021. IfG warned that even after lockdown restrictions, “the target will be hard to meet without a large increase in primary care workforce”.\n\nThe 2019 manifesto promised “an agenda for levelling up every part of the UK” and to that end the government has announced spending on transport infrastructure, economic development and housing projects. Last month, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government became the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities as part of what it has described as an “ambitious” plan to drive the levelling-up agenda.\n\n‘Fixing’ immigration\n\n“The vote to leave the EU was, among other things, a vote to take back control of our borders,” stated the 2019 manifesto. The Tories promised to introduce a “firmer and fairer Australian-style points-based immigration system” giving the UK “real control over who is coming in and out”, attracting people based on skills and contribution.\n\nWhile not exactly the same as Australia’s, a UK points-based system was implemented in January 2021. In his speech yesterday, Johnson stuck to his word on controlling immigration, despite criticism in recent weeks that it has led to a severe labour shortage. “We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity, all of it enabled and assisted by uncontrolled immigration,” said the prime minister. Instead, he said he wanted to “invest in people, in skills and in the equipment, the facilities, the machinery they need to do their jobs”.\n\nReaching net zero by 2050\n\nThe Conservatives pledged to “lead the global fight against climate change by delivering on our world-leading target of Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050” and to use the UK’s position of hosting Cop26 in Glasgow “to ask our global partners to match our ambition”.\n\nWith the Cop26 summit now fast approaching, green issues are making their way up Johnson’s agenda. A 2021 progress report from government advisers on the Climate Change Committee, published in June, said ministers deserved credit for the “historic climate promises” they have made in the past year, but warned that they had been “too slow to follow these with delivery”. The committee urged the government to make the most of Cop26 to move forward. “Act quickly – be bold and decisive. Your moment has arrived,” it said.\n\nGlobal Britain\n\nThe “Global Britain” slogan was yet to be coined when the 2019 manifesto was published, but the document did include a chapter with the less catchier title “We Will Strengthen Britain In The World”. The Tories promised an “outward-looking country” that champions security, law and human rights, including pledges to “proudly maintain our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI [gross national income] on development” and to increase free trade agreements, starting with the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n\n“Less than one year later, and in the throes of a global pandemic, the Conservative government said it would be slashing the aid budget to 0.5 per cent of GNI – cutting spending from around £14bn in 2020 to £10bn in 2021,” reported the Financial Times. The reduction was “met with shock” from the aid sector, which had perceived the UK as a reliable development partner, with some saying “they are beginning to doubt the UK’s international strategy”, said the paper.\n\nOn trade, the BBC last month reported that the UK had so far signed agreements with the EU and 69 countries, the majority of which were “rollover” deals. They also included new pacts with Japan and Australia. However, a New Zealand deal is yet to materialise and hopes of a US agreement – the “big prize” promised by Johnson – were dashed on the PM’s recent trip to America, wrote Andrew Grice in The Independent. “Barack Obama’s pre-referendum intervention, which infuriated Johnson at the time, has come true: the UK is at the back of the queue.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2021/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954310/what-does-reform-uk-stand-for", "title": "Reform UK: what are their policies? | The Week", "text": "Reform UK has moved to within two points of the Conservatives in pre-election polling, after a whirlwind week in which Nigel Farage made a surprise U-turn and announced he was returning to lead the party and stand in Clacton.\n\nThough his return \"coincided with the usual chaos in the Tory campaign, you could see the boost in its poll ratings, attracting most of its support from 'traditional' Conservative voters\", wrote The Independent's Sean O'Grady.\n\nThe party now poses a major threat to Rishi Sunak as, unlike its predecessor, the Brexit Party, it \"remains steadfast against stepping aside for the Tories,\" said The Telegraph – \"even if this were to result in a Labour government\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

March marked a new milestone when Lee Anderson, formerly the Conservative member for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, announced his defection and became Reform's first sitting MP.\n\nFarage has attributed the party's revived political fortunes to its ability to offer an alternative to a Westminster elite who \"speak an entirely different language to those who live in the real world\", said The Telegraph.\n\nWhat are its main policies?\n\nReform UK has a populist agenda aimed at attracting voters from both the left and right who are frustrated with the two main parties and feel strongly about issues such as immigration and the costs of net zero.\n\nIn a column published in The Telegraph to announce the party's relaunch in 2020, Farage and former party leader Richard Tice vowed to take on \"powerful vested interests\", including \"badly run, wasteful quangos\", the BBC, the House of Lords and the Home Office.\n\nWhile its full election manifesto is not expected for a couple of weeks, a draft outline titled Our Contract with You has a summary of Reform's pledges so far.\n\nReform's £15 billion healthcare plan would aim to cut waiting lists to zero in the space of two years. NHS patients not able to see a GP within three days, a consultant within three weeks, or have an operation within nine weeks would be offered a voucher for fully funded private treatment. The party also says it would exempt two million front-line healthcare and social care workers from the basic rate of income tax for three years.\n\nThe tax burden has become \"one of Reform's key attack lines\" in the wake of tax rises under the Conservatives, reported The Telegraph. In a bid to bring it down, Reform would raise the income tax threshold from £12,571 to £20,000, exempting six million people from having to pay income tax, while raising the higher 40p rate threshold to £70,000. These policies, along with plans to scrap VAT on energy bills, cut fuel duty and corporation tax, would be paid for by a £50 billion a year reduction in government spending – working out at around £5 in every £100.\n\nOn energy, the party wants to scrap net zero plans and instead increase drilling for gas and oil. Other policies include a plan to nationalise a 50% share of key utility companies such as energy and water and introduce sweeping reforms to the planning system with a focus on coastal regeneration.\n\nIt would use its first 100 days in power to clamp down on \"woke ideology\" in schools and universities, which would face fines for allowing \"political bias or cancel culture\". In contrast to Labour which plans to impose VAT on private schools, Reform would offer independent schools a 20% tax relief.\n\nOther proposals include withdrawing benefits for jobseekers after four months of unemployment or the rejection of two job offers, and the recruitment of 40,000 new police officers over five years.\n\nBut it is Reform's hard line on immigration that has won it the most support among disgruntled former Tory voters. It has called for \"net zero\" immigration, including a \"one in, one out\" migration quota. It wants the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights so it can use offshore processing centres for illegal immigrants and prevent them from claiming asylum.\n\nWill it impact the election?\n\nOver the past year, the proportion of Brits who intend to vote for Reform UK in the next general election has leapt from 5% to 12%, according to Politico's Poll of Polls.\n\nThe return of Farage has further turbocharged the party's fortunes and exposure, with polls suggesting Reform is nearly level with the Conservatives nationally. While the UK's first-past-the-post electoral system means this is unlikely to translate into more than a handful of MPs, the presence of Reform on the ballot paper could spell disaster for the Tories, splitting the right-wing vote and boosting Labour's overall majority.\n\nAt the same time, attention among senior Tories is already turning to what will happen after the election and the threat by Farage \"to stage a reverse takeover of the Conservatives\", which has \"not gone unnoticed by Tory high command\", said i news.\n\nThe former Ukip MEP has \"made no bones about his desire to see the Conservatives 'destroyed' and for him to pick up the pieces to shape the remnants of whatever is left in his own image\".", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harriet Marsden", "Justin Klawans", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/10/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960884/pros-and-cons-of-coalition-governments", "title": "Pros and cons of coalition governments | The Week", "text": "Westminster is abuzz with talk of coalition governments again after recent local election results suggested Labour could fall short of an overall majority at the general election next year.\n\nKeir Starmer refused to rule out a coalition with the Lib Dems but has said he would not go into partnership with the SNP.\n\nA survey by YouGov for Times Radio found that while a Labour majority was the preferred election outcome for most voters, many were also open to a coalition.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Pro: tempers extreme views\n\nCoalitions on the continent are often lauded for being “broad churches” that temper extreme views and deliver compromise. Analysing the “Grand Coalition” of left and right that governed Germany in the 2010s, DW said it was “a good instrument for turning political consensus into reality”.\n\nIn the UK, between 2010 and 2015 the Lib Dems repeatedly attempted to portray their role in the Coalition government as a mediating force on the Conservatives. The Lib Dems’ Danny Alexander, who was chief secretary to the Treasury during the coalition years, claimed his party “anchored economic policy in the centre ground and have constantly had to keep the Tories reined in”.\n\n2. Con: waters down pledges\n\nA party’s manifesto forms the cornerstone of its time in government, but a major problem with coalitions is that pledges presented in the run-up to election day are rendered unrealistic in the horse-trading that follows.\n\nIn a country like the UK, which is used to long periods of majority single-party rule, there is a perception that weak and indecisive coalition governments lead to the worst-of-both-worlds and put a block on big legislative progress. There is an argument to be made that neither the trade union reforms of Margaret Thatcher nor Tony Blair’s raft of improvements to public services could have been carried through as part of a coalition.\n\nThings can also work the other way. In 2015, David Cameron pledged to hold an in-out referendum on the UK’s EU membership, reportedly believing he would fail to secure a majority and could ditch the manifesto commitment as part of a new coalition deal with the Lib Dems. Needless to say things turned out very differently.\n\n3. Pro: better than minority\n\nThe closest the UK has got to a minority government in the last 50 years was from 2017-19 when Theresa May was forced into a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) after her decision to call a snap election backfired disastrously. What followed was two years of political stasis and stagnation that came to be defined by the “Brexit forever wars”, dominated by endless parliamentary manoeuvring that saw legislation repeatedly fail to pass.\n\nThe experience appears to have resonated with the public, with 46% of respondents in the recent Times Radio YouGov poll saying hung parliaments were bad because they led to weak government, compared to just 27% who thought they were good because they forced parties to work together. In the event of a hung parliament, 42% of voters said that parties should form a coalition in order to provide stable government.\n\n4. Con: dangers for smaller parties\n\n“The Lib Dems’ demise will become a cautionary tale,” predicted FT Adviser after the party was all but wiped out in the 2015 election, slumping from over 20% of the vote share in 2010 to just 8% and losing all but 11 of its MPs. “The smaller party was ruthlessly punished for ‘propping up’ the Tories.”\n\nAs is often the case with smaller parties in coalitions, the Lib Dems were scapegoated for unpopular policies – such as the introduction of university tuition fees – while the Tories took credit for positives such as reviving the economy. It has taken nearly a decade for the party to begin to repair the damage to its reputation and it still remains way off its pre-coalition standing.\n\n5. Pro: greater representation\n\n“There are a lot of reasons to think coalitions are good,” said Professor Nic Cheeseman in South Africa’s Mail and Guardian in 2019. “They bring more parties into power which, in ethnically and racially divided societies, often means that they give a wider range of communities a taste of government. In a dominant-party system like South Africa, where the ANC has consistently won a large majority of the vote, this can bring into government parties that would otherwise be permanently locked out of power.”\n\nIn his book “Coalitional Presidentialism in Comparative Perspective”, Cheeseman conducted hundreds of interviews with MPs across nine countries with experience of coalition government. In every country bar one, a majority of MPs agreed that coalitions had “permitted the representation of diverse social interests” and “enhanced the quality of public policies”. Coalitions can also open up a wider talent pool of politicians and experts to serve in government.\n\nIn the UK, coalitions or other power-sharing arrangements already happen at a local level, where there are currently 91 district councils outside London with “no overall control” (almost one-third of local authorities), up from 75 before the most recent local elections. “This has not created instability,” said New Camden Journal. “The bins still get emptied and decisions are made, just usually with support from councillors outside of the largest political group”.\n\n6. Con: held hostage by smaller parties\n\nAt the 2015 general election the Conservatives under Cameron successfully deployed fears of a “coalition of chaos” in which Labour would be beholden to the Lib Dems and the SNP. The campaign claimed then-Labour leader Ed Miliband would be forced to call another Scottish independence referendum in exchange for backing from the SNP. While this ultimately failed to happen after the Tories won a surprise majority, something similar happened during May’s time in office, when the DUP often wielded disproportionate influence on government policy by threatening to pull its support entirely to win concessions.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Rebekah Evans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954049/will-breaking-national-insurance-pledge-define-boris-johnson-premiership", "title": "Will breaking his National Insurance pledge 'define' Boris Johnson's ...", "text": "Boris Johnson is facing a growing Conservative backlash as he prepares to announce a manifesto-breaking plan to increase National Insurance payments to fund social care.\n\nMPs and party grandees have warned the prime minister that U-turning on his 2019 pledge not to increase the rate of National Insurance contributions (NICs) “will alienate his voters and fuel fringe parties”, the Daily Mail said.

I think it would cause the government – the Conservative Party – significant damage.”\n\nHammond is “among a number of senior Conservatives who oppose the planned rise to fund an overhaul of social care”, The Guardian said, “including former prime minister John Major, the former lord chancellor David Gauke and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith”.\n\nDuncan Smith said that the policy, “key details of which are still unclear”, was a “sham” that “will not fix the problems with social care”, reported the Daily Mail, while serving Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi this morning told Sky News that he was also not “comfortable” with breaking manifesto promises.\n\nAnother former Tory leader, William Hague, said that while “it must be accepted that social care requires a great deal more money”, he is “on the very reluctant end of the argument about funding social care through a tax rise seen as breaking an election promise”.\n\nWriting in The Times, Hague continued that “the cabinet should be having the most searching discussion of how that can be funded without a tax rise”, adding: “It is possible that No. 10 will have underestimated the difficulty of selling this new policy.”\n\nAdmitting that Johnson is “an election-winning marvel with an extraordinary instinct for what he can get away with”, Hague said that a tax rise could see his government “defined” by a “broken promise”.\n\nPolitical misstep?\n\nDowning Street has so far “succeeded in keeping much of the policy detail secret”, said Politico’s Alex Wickham, noting that this was pulled off “largely by locking the Cabinet out of discussions and then presenting them with a fait accompli hours before the formal announcement today”.\n\n“In part because they think it will make it harder for Tory rebels to oppose the looming tax rise”, he added, No. 10 has “combined its social care policy with its plan for fixing the giant NHS backlog caused by the pandemic”, providing it with an additional “big sell”.\n\nIn other words, Johnson is attempting to “link the NHS backlog and social care as the two main crises facing the health system”, Wickham said, allowing him to “argue that there is no way to deal with both without a huge tax hike”.\n\nSome MPs, including ex-chancellor Hammond, have signalled that they plan to vote against the measure, while Keir Starmer yesterday told the Daily Mirror that it does not have Labour’s backing as it “simply hits low earners, it hits young people and it hits businesses”.\n\nJohnson is attempting to sell the policy as a plan to “end the scandal of pensioners having to sell their homes to fund care in later life”, the Daily Mail said, but is taking fire over suggestions that it will be “disproportionately loaded on to younger and lower-paid workers”, The Guardian added.\n\nTreasury sources yesterday told The Times that the prime minister has returned from recess in “invincible mode”. As he attempts to reset his premiership, today will serve as the first big test of that optimism.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Harriet Marsden", "Jamie Timson", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/09/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/958788/the-pros-and-cons-of-the-house-of-lords", "title": "The pros and cons of the House of Lords | The Week", "text": "The long-running debate over Britain’s unelected upper chamber was reignited this month as Labour announced plans to abolish the House of Lords if the party wins the next general election.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News earlier this month, Keir Starmer said he hoped to abolish the Lords in his first term as prime minister, replacing it instead with an elected upper chamber.\n\nThe proposal forms part of Labour’s plans for a “New Britain” as outlined in a report commissioned by the Labour Party and headed by former prime minister Gordon Brown.

Pro: peers bring experience\n\nAmid calls for the House of Lords to become an elected chamber in 2014, Peter Oborne argued that it actually worked remarkably well, throwing out what he called “populist measures introduced by governments determined to bolster their right-wing credentials”.\n\nWriting for The Telegraph at the time, he said an elected House of Lords would never have the will or the courage to stand up against public opinion, and would deprive the public of the judgement of “very valuable” peers, such as retired generals, trade union leaders, academics and judges.\n\n2. Con: undemocratic and no diversity\n\nThe UK has the world’s second largest decision-making body after China’s National People’s Congress. Campaigners such as the Electoral Reform Society argue that it is undemocratic that unelected peers should hold such sway in British politics.\n\nAll the main parties have pledged to cut the number of peers, and many politicians agree that hereditary peers should be phased out. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband previously proposed a wholly elected senate, with roughly proportionate numbers from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions, instead of MP-style constituencies.\n\nDuring the coalition years, the Lib Dems put forward proposals to halve the number of members and ensure that at least 80% of peers were elected, but the plans were abandoned after an agreement with Tory opponents failed to be reached.\n\n3. Pro: constitutional check\n\nThe House of Lords has proved it is “willing to defeat ministers even on flagship and other significant pieces of legislation” in recent years, said Sonali Campion and Sean Kippin in The UK’s Changing Democracy: The 2018 Democratic Audit.\n\nIn turn, this has led to “somewhat greater checks and balances constitutionally and a little more scrutiny in the policy-making process”, they argued.\n\n4. Con: accusations of cronyism\n\nThe current system makes it very hard to get rid of politicians from the Cabinet. In 2019, Downing Street announced that Nicky Morgan, who didn’t contest her seat in the general election and was therefore no longer an MP, was to be made a Conservative peer in order to remain a member of Johnson’s top team. And Zac Goldsmith, who lost his Richmond seat the same year, also entered the House of Lords so that he could continue to attend Cabinet as environment minister.\n\nIn 2022, Johnson’s nomination of Evgeny Lebedev for a peerage was also questioned, with Labour urging the government to release the advice given to the prime minister by security services before the Russian businessman’s elevation to the Lords.\n\n5. Pro: improves legislation\n\nMembers meet in Westminster and are expected to scrutinise bills approved by the House of Commons. While they cannot normally prevent laws from being passed, they can delay bills and add amendments that are then sent back for consideration in the Commons.\n\n6. Con: stipend concerns\n\nPeers are not paid a salary but can claim a flat daily allowance of £162, or £323 if they attend a sitting. They can also choose not to make a claim.\n\nOne notorious anecdote reported in 2017 told of a peer who “left the taxi running” outside the chamber while he dashed in to claim his £300, according to The Telegraph.\n\nLady D’Souza, who stepped down as speaker of the upper chamber in 2016, told BBC documentary Meet the Lords that many of her colleagues did nothing to justify their stipend.\n\n“There is a core of peers who work incredibly hard, who do that work, and there are, sad to say, many, many, many peers who contribute absolutely nothing but who claim the full allowance.” Members who already receive a ministerial or office holders’ salary cannot claim the flat rate.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "Scott Hocker", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Jamie Timson", "Arion Mcnicoll"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956087/where-do-the-political-parties-stand-on-trans-rights", "title": "Where the UK's political parties stand on trans rights | The Week", "text": "The leader of the Labour Party is urging ministers to overhaul gender recognition laws to introduce greater “respect and dignity” for transgender people.\n\nBut while Keir Starmer told The Times that “trans women are women” and that a more “respectful” debate on transgender issues was needed, members of his own shadow cabinet have taken a more ambivalent stance.\n\nStarmer spoke out after shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told Times Radio that she did not “want to go down the rabbit hole of defining what a woman is”. And Anneliese Dodds, Labour’s minister for women and equalities, told BBC Radio 4’s Women’s Hour that the definition depended on the “context”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

So just where does each of the UK’s main parties stand on trans rights?\n\nLabour\n\nLabour’s 2019 manifesto pledged to uphold transgender rights and to push for reforms to the Gender Recognition Act “to introduce self-declaration for transgender people”.\n\nBut critics claimed “the manifesto appeared to send two contradictory messages on trans issues”, by also pledging to protect “single-sex spaces” in accord with the Equality Act 2010, the i news site reported. Anti-trans pressure groups suggested that the party was “giving tacit support to those who wish to deny transgender women access to women’s spaces”, the site said.\n\nHowever, Starmer’s spokesperson insisted during last autumn’s Labour conference that the women-only spaces law “rightly assumes the inclusion of trans women, except in specific circumstances”, The Independent reported. The Labour leader was said to remain wedded to the policy, and there was “no reason to expect” that his stance was “going to change”.\n\nDeputy leader Angela Rayner also reaffirmed Labour’s support for gender recognition law reforms during the conference, in Brighton in September. “Women’s rights are not in conflict with trans rights,” Raynor told an LGBTQ+ panel event.\n\nConservatives\n\nTheresa May pledged during her reign as prime minister to introduce reforms to the Gender Recognition Act that would have enabled people to officially change gender without medical checks. But the party’s 2017 manifesto made no mention of the issue, and Boris Johnson ditched May’s pledge after taking over at No. 10.\n\nPink News reported last year that Johnson and then equalities minister Liz Truss did consider reforming the act. But Truss “changed her mind” following “input” from NHS England’s national advisor for LGBTQ+ health, the news site said. Instead, Truss cut the cost of legally changing gender from £140 to £5 and moved the application process online in a bid to streamline the system.\n\nMixed messaging has emerged from within Tory ranks, however. At the Conservative conference in Manchester last October, Carrie Johnson urged party members to fight for the rights of transgender people. “Whether you are LGBT+ or an ally like me, we are all committed to equality and acceptance for everyone, whoever you are and whomever you love,” she told a fringe event.\n\nBut just weeks later, her husband praised the work of the LGB Alliance, which has been accused of transphobia. The PM’s championing of a conference organised by the charity marked a “significant intervention in the debate over trans rights”, said The Times.\n\nLiberal Democrats\n\nThe Lib Dems formally passed a motion at the party’s autumn 2020 conference acknowledging members’ belief that “trans women are women, trans men are men and non-binary identities are non-binary”. A statement subsequently published on the party’s website during Trans Visibility Week affirmed that “these sentences are not contentious in our party”.\n\nThe commitment came after a Lib Dem activist was banned from holding party office for ten years following complaints about a T-shirt reading “Woman: Adult, Human, Female” that she wore to a meeting in 2018. Natalie Bird has since launched legal action against the Lib Dems for discrimination under the Equality Act.\n\nAsked whether Bird’s case represented a retreat from liberalism, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show last year that “we absolutely believe in free speech, but we also believe that we need to protect human rights and we need to believe in equality”.\n\nReiterating the party’s official stance, Davey said that “a trans woman is a woman and a trans man is a man – and that is the issue that we’re fighting on. We believe trans rights are human rights.”\n\nSNP\n\nTrans rights has been a subject of fierce debate within the SNP since leader Nicola Sturgeon first outlined plans to reform gender recognition back in 2016. The party website states that “we remain firmly committed to improving the lives of trans and non-binary people”.\n\nOn 3 March this year, the party unveiled the Gender Recognition Reform Bill – a set of proposals intended to speed up the process for getting a gender recognition certificate (GRC). Outlining the bill, Shona Robison, the devolved Scottish government’s social justice secretary, said trans people were “among the most stigmatised in our society”.\n\nCritics have suggested that the reforms are incompatible with equalities law. On the SNP website, the party insisted that “we will ensure that these changes do not affect the rights or protections that women currently have under the Equality Act”.\n\nGreens\n\nThe Green Party’s 2019 manifesto made commitments to increase NHS funding for “trans healthcare” and “gender identity clinics”, and to remove the “spousal veto” so that married trans people can acquire a gender recognition certificate without permission from their partner.\n\nThe Greens also promised to update the Gender Recognition Act “to allow trans youth and non-binary people to get legal recognition through self-declaration”.\n\nThe party website states that “the Green Party recognises that trans men are men, trans women are women, and that non-binary identities exist and are valid”. Under the party’s plans, the only requirement for individuals to change their legally recognised gender would be “a statutory declaration”.\n\nYet while the Greens’ official policy is clear, the issue has caused internal divisions.\n\nSiân Berry resigned as Green leader in England and Wales last July, citing conflict between party members over trans rights. A vocal supporter of trans equality, Berry said that a “failure of leadership” on her part had resulted in “mixed messages” being sent.\n\n““There is now an inconsistency between the sincere promise to fight for trans rights and inclusion in my work and the message sent by the party’s choice of frontbench representatives,” she said in her resignation letter, after reportedly clashing with colleagues.\n\n“This inconsistency has left me in a very difficult position. I can no longer make the claim that the party speaks unequivocally, with one voice, on this issue.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Irenie Forshaw", "The Week Uk", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}]}

The city’s Deputy Mayor, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said four of the injured were admitted to the hospital as search and rescue operations continue.\n\nBondarenko also said a kindergarten was hit in the missile strike but no one was injured, and video from Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs showed a large missile funnel in the backyard of the kindergarten.\n\nThose injured in the residential block included a 7-year-old girl, he said. Her mother, a 35-year-old woman named Katerina, was rescued from the rubble and put into an ambulance. She is a citizen of Russia, but had lived in Kyiv for a long time.\n\nA CNN team on the ground spoke to the injured girl’s grandmother, Natalia Nikitina, who found out about the attack online and rushed to the apartment block, where she cried as she watched teams trying to rescue her daughter-in-law.\n\n“There is nothing worse than losing loved ones. Why do we deserve this?” she said. A huge plume of smoke continued to billow from the building two hours after the strike, while nearly every window was blown out on the top floor, and the ground was covered in debris and twisted metal.\n\nUkrainian air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said “strategic bombers” were used to hit the capital, with “four to six missiles” launched. He added that on Saturday, Russia had used Tu22M3 long-range bombers from the airspace of Belarus for the first time in a Ukrainian air strike.\n\nThe mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram there had been several explosions in the city’s Shevchenkivskyi district, and that search and rescue operations were launched after a fire broke out when a residential building was hit by a rocket.\n\nSmoke rises after a Russian airstrikes in the Shevchenkivskiy district of Kyiv on June 26, 2022.

Rescuers are continuing their work,” he said.\n\nSpeaking to CNN onsite, Klitschko said Russia’s war on Ukraine was “senseless” and thousands of civilians had died, and added, “We have to do everything to stop this war.”\n\nThe Ukrainian State Emergency Service said the fire was caused by “enemy shelling” and was over an area of 300 square meters, in “a 9-storey residential building with partial destruction of the 7th, 9th and 9th floors.”\n\nThe same neighborhood was hit by a missile strike in early May, and was also targeted in March.\n\nVadym Denysenko, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, said on Ukrainian television that there are “a number of military infrastructure facilities located in the Shevchenkivskyi district of the Ukrainian capital. This is the reason why the Russians are shelling this district.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden called Sunday’s attack “more of [Russian] barbarism.” He declined to respond when asked whether the strikes were a deliberate provocation during the G7 summit.\n\nRussian offensive continues in eastern Ukraine\n\nAfter the key city of Severodonetsk was confirmed by Ukraine to be “completely under Russian occupation” on Saturday, the country’s eastern Luhansk region is now almost entirely under Russian control. However, Ukrainian forces continue to defend the neighboring city of Lysychansk, which is coming under growing Russian artillery and rocket attacks.\n\nOn Sunday, the head of the neighboring Donetsk region’s military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Russian forces were gathering for fresh assaults in the region, nearly half of which is under Ukrainian control.\n\n“We are now witnessing the accumulation of manpower, heavy armored vehicles and artillery in the direction of Sloviansk,” Kyrylenko said on Ukrainian television.\n\n“The enemy is using its well-known tactics, trying to move closer to our line of defense in order to fire artillery at the cities. Enemy artillery is already reaching certain parts of Sloviansk. This is another confirmation that people should evacuate.”\n\nThroughout the offensive in the east, Russian forces have used intense artillery and rocket bombardment ahead of trying to take ground.

Since then, the superpower has been a regular topic of debate among the remaining countries in the forum. Downing Street’s long-awaited Global Britain in a Competitive Age white paper, published in March, described Russia as “the most acute threat to our security” in the Euro-Atlantic region.\n\nUnderlining that message following a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken yesterday, Raab said that “like-minded countries” were uniting against authoritarian states and that the UK was “getting the G7 to come together with a rapid rebuttal mechanism” to counter Russian misinformation.\n\nThe foreign secretary also warned Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his “brinkmanship sabre-rattling on the border of Ukraine, the cyberattacks and misinformation and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, that was not just a human rights abuse but a use of chemical weapons on Russian soil”.\n\nChina\n\nBeijing is expected to be another key talking point, although as The Guardian notes, Western countries are “struggling to find the balance between confronting China and wanting China to open up its booming markets”.\n\nThe UK government’s Global Britain white paper promised an expansion of influence in the Indo-Pacific region as part of efforts to compete with the growing threat posed by China. Australia, India, South Korea and South Africa have also been invited to this week’s G7 summit, as the UK tries to “deepen ties” with the region, says the BBC.\n\nGlobal response to Covid\n\nFormer UK prime minister Gordon Brown yesterday urged the G7 economies to use their wealth to fund a global Covid vaccination push. Speaking at a briefing by the World Health Organization (WHO), he warned: “By our failure to extend vaccination more rapidly to every country, we are choosing who lives and who dies.”\n\nRaab has promised that the G7 will “be taking action to ensure fair access to vaccines around the world”. Meanwhile, Johnson is due to hold a virtual meeting with Narendra Modi, the PM of India, where coronavirus cases have soared past 20 million. Johnson has announced new trade deals with the country worth £1bn, including investments in its biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industry.\n\nFrench Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian is greeted by Dominic Raab (Image credit: Ben Stansall/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nClimate finance\n\nIn his forward for March’s Global Britain review, Johnson said the government “would make tackling climate change and biodiversity loss its number one international priority”.\n\nLondon-based think-tank Chatham House notes that the UK’s position as both G7 host and COP26 host later in the year provides a “unique opportunity to create synergies between the forums” and “increase the chances of an ambitious outcome at the COP in Glasgow”.\n\nTargets for climate finance will “top the agenda” at today’s talks in London, which are “the first attended in person by G7 foreign ministers for two years”, reports Reuters.\n\nFamine and education\n\nRaab has said that “setting global girls’ education targets” and “developing new measures to prevent famine” will also be high on the G7’s list of talking points this week. This prioritisation is in keeping with the government’s pledge in the Global Britain review to be “a force for good in the world”.\n\nHowever, critics have accused Westminster of already rescinding the promise by cutting the foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% in order to help cover the financial impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe Guardian says ministers will use the G7 summit to “collectively agree to help women in developing countries with a $15bn (£10.8bn) two-year package of support”. However, as the paper also notes, UK aid spending on girls’ education has been set at £400m for 2021 - £272m less than the average annual spend since 2016.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "The Best Columns", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/06/29/boris-johnson-ukraine-vladimir-putin-woman/7764976001/", "title": "Boris Johnson: There'd be no war if Vladimir Putin 'was a woman'", "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin wouldn't have started the war in Ukraine if he were a woman, citing \"toxic masculinity\" as a driving force for launching Russia's invasion.\n\n\"If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn't, but if he were, I really don't think he would've embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has,\" Johnson told German media outlets Tuesday after the G7 summit in southern Germany. \"If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it’s what he is doing in Ukraine.\"\n\nJohnson's comments come as Western leaders gathered at the three-day G7 summit in Schloss Elmau, Germany. Allied countries have continued to increase the economic and political costs to Putin and his regime.\n\n'A kick in the gut':Finland's, Sweden's drive to join NATO a defeat for Putin, a win for the West\n\nJohnson noted in the interview: \"Of course people want the war to end,\" but \"there's no deal available. Putin isn't making an offer of peace.\"\n\nThe U.K.'s defense spending is projected to reach 2.3% of its annual income as part of a military support for Ukraine, according to BBC. Johnson was to call on other countries at a NATO summit in Madrid to ramp up defense spending and amplify the U.K.'s strong military presence in Estonia.\n\nLast week, Johnson urged Americans to continue supporting Ukraine. \"If we let Putin get away with it and just annex, conquer sizable parts of a free, independent, sovereign country, which is what he is poised to do, if not the whole thing, then the consequences for the world are absolutely catastrophic,\" he told CNN.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/27/wimbledon-florida-abortion-law-g-7-summit-5-things-know-monday/7703113001/", "title": "Wimbledon, Florida abortion law, G-7 summit: 5 things to know ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBiden meets with G-7 leaders in Germany\n\nPresident Joe Biden is in Germany for the annual Group of Seven summit, an annual economic meeting between leaders from the U.S., France, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan.

World leaders are also expected to discuss capping the price of oil and gas imports to help fight inflation and further cut into Putin's financial resources. In 2014, G-7 nations banished Russia from their gathering over its first invasion of eastern Ukraine. Now, with Putin's army pummeling the country, world leaders are rushing to stop him.

The providers are asking a judge in Tallahassee to stop the new law passed by a GOP-controlled Florida Legislature from taking effect on Friday, arguing that an amendment in the Florida constitution guarantees a broad right to privacy, which includes the right to abortion. It comes after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that had provided constitutional protections for women seeking abortions for almost 50 years. The new Florida law prohibits abortions beyond 15 weeks except to save the pregnant woman's life or prevent physical harm, as well as in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality. A violator of the third-degree felony could face up to five years in prison, and physicians and other medical professionals who violate the law could lose their licenses and face administrative fines of $10,000 for each violation. Under current law, Florida had allowed abortions up to 24 weeks.\n\nUS basketball star Brittney Griner due in Russian court\n\nMore than four months after she was arrested at a Russian airport for cannabis possession, American basketball star Brittney Griner is to appear in court Monday for a preliminary hearing ahead of her trial. The Phoenix Mercury star could face 10 years in prison if convicted on charges of large-scale transportation of drugs. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and seven-time WNBA All-Star, was detained at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on Feb. 17 after authorities there said a search of her bag revealed vape cartridges containing cannabis oil. Her arrest came less than a week before Russia sent troops into Ukraine. The State Department in May designated her as wrongfully detained. Fewer than 1% of defendants in Russian criminal cases are acquitted, and unlike in the U.S., acquittals can be overturned. The trial date has not been announced, but is expected soon; Griner was recently ordered to remain in pretrial detention until July 2.\n\nState Department will fix 'mistake,' reschedule phone call between detained Brittney Griner, wife\n\nreschedule phone call between detained Brittney Griner, wife Two Americans captured by Russian forces could face the death penalty.

The crash occurred at around 1 p.m. Sunday in Brentwood, about an hour’s drive southeast of San Francisco, the California Highway Patrol said. Three people died at the scene. Two adults and a child were taken to hospitals but there was no immediate word on their conditions, KRON-TV reported. The victims were inside the four-door sedan when it was struck.

Discussions leading up to the start of the championship have mostly been about who's playing, and who isn't. Serena Williams is returning to play singles with a wild card invitation after a year away, while No. 1 ranked Naomi Osaka pulled out of the tournament entirely due to an Achilles injury. The No. 1 ranked male player, Daniil Medvedev, was barred from playing, along with every other player from Russia and Belarus, as part of sanctions on Russia for the war in Ukraine.

But the other seven members — Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and the USA — bailed to protest Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 and its alleged involvement in a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies providing troops, arms or funds to support the separatists, who have been fighting Ukrainian troops.\n\nThis year's host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, told her parliament recently that Moscow's return to the summit is \"unimaginable\" unless Russia were to \"recognize the basic values of international law and act accordingly.\"\n\nThe German government reiterated that view this week. It said at a briefing in Washington that until Russia takes meaningful steps to implement a cease-fire and peace plan, suspension from the annual summit will almost certainly remain.\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Thursday that his government's military is preparing for more attacks by Russian-backed separatists. Five Ukrainian soldiers were killed in clashes Wednesday. Moscow blamed Kiev for the spike in tensions.\n\nSeparately, the European Union indicated Wednesday that it will extend its broad set of Ukraine-related economic sanctions against Russia in the next few weeks, TheWall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe EU's potential move suggests the United States also would keep its sanctions in place, said Lawrence Ward, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney, a law firm that specializes in U.S. national security law and cross-border trade compliance.\n\nCaroline Atkinson, the White House's deputy national security adviser for international economics, said Thursday that the sanctions were working and had put Russia's \"economy on a completely different (downward) trajectory.\"\n\nRussia has largely kept quiet about efforts by world powers to sideline its public diplomacy on the world stage.\n\n\"Russia has come to terms with its exclusion from this elite club,\" said James Nixey, an expert on Russia at Chatham House, the London-based think tank. \"It was a slap in the face at the time, but when you get slapped it stings and then fades.\"\n\nThat has not stopped Russia from attempting to strike back at the West in other ways.\n\nIn late May, the Kremlin banned 89 European Union officials from entering the country, giving little apparent justification. Around the same time, Russia's parliament passed legislation to crack down on the presence of foreign organizations.\n\nNixey questioned whether including Russia as part of the larger G-8 group would necessarily be a constructive one.\n\n\"Russia's voice is often not helpful,\" he said. \"It acts as a spoiler, and it's not acting positively in international affairs wherever you look right now — not just in Ukraine, but in Syria and the Middle East more broadly.\"\n\nThe meeting — the group's 41st — is a get-together for key international players to discuss economic, security and foreign policy issues. Topping this years agenda beyond the Ukraine conflict: the Islamic State's advances in Iraq and Syria, Greece's debt crisis and the nearly concluded talks with Iran on a nuclear deal.\n\nThere will also be discussions about how to protect the world's marine life, trade, growing public health fears over antibiotic resistance, climate change and development in Africa.\n\nPutin's office did not return a request for comment on whether Russia is suffering from being excluded from the meeting.\n\nEkaterina Zabrovskaya, editor of Russia Direct, a Moscow-based website for opinion and analysis of Russian policy, said it's not a good sign for Ukraine that Russia was expelled from the G-8 because it means there are fewer opportunities for both sides to explain their positions and find some common ground.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen Russian President Vladimir Putin dials into the virtual BRICS summit hosted by Beijing on Thursday, it will be his first time attending a forum with the heads of major economies since launching an invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nFor Putin, this could offer a welcome picture: his face beamed onscreen alongside other leaders whose countries make up this acronymous grouping: China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa – a signal that Russia, though battered by sanctions and remonstrations for the invasion, is not alone.\n\nIt’s a message that may resonate even more clearly as China and Russia, weeks before the invasion, declared their own relationship to have “no limits,” and as each of the BRICS leaders have avoided condemning Russia outright, even as they hold varying levels of interest in not being seen to endorse its actions – and run foul of Western friends.\n\nBelow the surface, Putin’s invasion is likely to throw another complication into BRICS, a more than a decade-old grouping of major emerging economies, which already suffers from mistrust between members and mismatched ideologies.\n\nBut the decision by the group to press ahead with its 14th annual summit does reflect a view held by BRICS countries on the global order and, by extension, the situation in Ukraine, that departs from that of the West, experts say.\n\n“We’re talking about some very major economies whose leadership is willing to be seen with Putin, even if it is only on a virtual platform,” said Sushant Singh, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research (CPR) in New Delhi.\n\n“The fact that Putin is welcome, he’s not a pariah, he’s not being pushed out – and this is a normal engagement, which has taken place every year and it’s still taking place – that is a big plus for Putin,” he said.\n\nWhile the countries may argue that engaging Russia is better than not, the optics only become sharper in contrast. The BRICS summit is followed days later by the meeting of a bloc of the world’s leading advanced economies, the Group of Seven, which have been united in their voice against Russian aggression, and kicked Moscow out of their bloc following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nUnlike the G7, BRICS is expected to tread carefully when it comes to Ukraine at Thursday’s summit, likely speaking in favor of peaceful resolution, even as its members may carefully call for Western countries to examine the impact of their sanctions on the global economy, observers say.\n\nBeijing – this year’s host and by far the most economically powerful of the five nations, which together make up around a quarter of worldwide GDP – appears set to focus on its own agenda: promoting its new global development and security initiatives and pushing back on what it sees as “bloc”-building by the United States.\n\nBRICS countries should “strengthen political mutual trust and security cooperation,” coordinate on major international and regional issues, accommodate each other’s core interests, and “oppose hegemonism and power politics,” Xi said in a speech to BRICS foreign ministers last month, where he called on the group to ​​promote development in this “period of turbulence and transformation.”\n\nSome of the crises of this period, like food insecurity and a rising debt crisis in the developing world, are those that the group – established in 2009 as a means to “serve common interests of emerging market economies and developing countries” – was ostensibly formed to address.\n\nSince its inception, BRICS, which added South Africa in 2011, has been united in calling for more representation of major emerging economies on the world’s stage – and against what it views as a disproportionate dominance of the Western powers. That has meant pushing for reforms at the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and, on occasion, making a veiled jab at NATO actions.\n\nIt’s also seen the countries discussing issues like how to settle trade in their own currencies – outside the US dollar system – an issue that could now take more relevance for BRICS following Western sanctions on Russia, according to Shahar Hameiri, a professor and political economist at the University of Queensland in Australia.\n\nThose penalties have cut off Russia’s central bank from most US dollar transactions, sanctioned banks and removed major institutions from international banking systems. That’s left countries that continue to do business with Russia scrambling for ways to avoid violating sanctions. Both India and China remain heavy buyers of Russian fuel.\n\n“There’s not going to be any full-throated embrace of Russia (at this summit), there’s no doubt about it, and I’m sure there’s gonna be plenty of awkwardness there … but behind the awkwardness (de-dollarization) is one area where these governments do have a shared interest,” Hameiri said.\n\n“Any kind of meaningful steps away from (a US dollar-denominated system) are potentially significant.”\n\nCross-purposes\n\nDespite some common interests, the BRICS group has long been plagued by questions of cohesion, given outsized differences in its members’ political and economic systems, and their divergent geopolitical interests.\n\nIn addition, the complexities of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may tone down any major outcomes of this week’s summit, even as – with the exception of Brazil – the BRICS nations other than Russia abstained from voting in a United Nations General Assembly resolution supported by 141 countries that called on Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine.\n\nChina, for its part, has accused NATO of provoking Russia to attack Ukraine, while similar rhetoric has circulated in public debate in India. In South Africa, Ramaphosa earlier this year told lawmakers the war could have been avoided if NATO had “heeded warnings” over considering Ukraine’s membership of its bloc.\n\nAnd although Brazil voted to condemn Russia’s aggression against Ukraine at the UN, its leader Bolsonaro has hedged – saying days earlier the country would remain “neutral.”\n\nUnder normal circumstances, China would take the usual steps – touting BRICS as “a kind of soft alternative to the G7” and seeking to “portray BRICS as a leader for the developing world … against the club of wealthy capitalist democracies,” according to Sino-Russia relations analyst Alexander Gabuev. This would include members endorsing each others’ key projects, he added.\n\n“Now it’s just harder to do because of Putin in the room,” said Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a banquet dinner during the BRICS Summit in Xiamen, Fujian province in September 2017.

Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nMeanwhile, a longstanding source of internal friction within BRICS remains unresolved: tensions between India and China, which in 2020 spiraled into a violent border clash.\n\nOn the one hand, BRICS has been a “way of ensuring some form of engagement with China” for India, according to CPR’s Singh. And this remains critical, as New Delhi is wary of provoking Beijing, especially as it has partnered with the United States, Japan and Australia on their Quad security grouping and is increasingly viewed by the US as part of its strategy to counter China, he said.\n\nBut these ties also make India more reticent to back major outcomes from a BRICS summit.\n\n“I would be surprised if any substantive initiative is announced, because India would then be sending a message to the Quad and to its Western partners that it is willing to work very closely with China and Russia,” he said. “That would make India’s position very complicated.”\n\nAnother question is how other nations in the bloc will view a drive, long under discussion and expected to be spearheaded by China at Thursday’s summit, to expand the bloc to include more developing countries.\n\nIn a meeting with his BRICS counterparts last month, China’s foreign minister Wang Yi called for the group to start a member country “expansion process.”\n\nSuch an enlargement could play into perceptions from some parts that the West has shown a double standard in how it upholds international norms, according to Carnegie Endowments’s Gabuev, who says this has fueled an argument that the developing world, instead, should formulate those norms.\n\n“Bringing more countries on board is something that gives it more legitimacy, but again, whether that will go beyond symbolism for now, I’m not so sure,” he said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/17/china/china-europe-relations-ukraine-russia-intl-mic-hnk/index.html", "title": "China once saw Europe as a counter to US power.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen Chinese leader Xi Jinping made his first state visit to Europe in 2014, he set out to herald a new era of cooperation in a multi-country tour, which the European Parliament President at the time called “a welcome signal of the importance that the new Chinese leader attaches to a strengthened EU-China partnership.”\n\nEight years later, the optimism of that period has cratered, with the relationship between China and the European Union reaching what analysts call a clear low point of recent decades.\n\nEuropean concern about China’s global ambitions and its human rights record, US-China tensions, tit-for-tat sanctions and, now, Russia’s war in Ukraine – the impact of which on China-EU ties Beijing appears to have either underestimated or dismissed – have all brought relations to a nadir.\n\nThat was underlined last month during two summits featuring European leaders. Both the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies and NATO significantly hardened their lines on China, in a signal that views in Europe have fallen more in line with Washington’s.\n\nThe shift is the culmination of a series of steps in which Beijing may have at times underestimated the extent to which it was pushing Europe away, but also appeared prepared to pay that price.\n\nBut it is a significant blow for Beijing’s ideal vision: a Europe with robust China ties that provides a counterbalance to American power and posture.\n\n“China and the EU should act as two major forces upholding world peace, and offset uncertainties in the international landscape,” Xi told EU leaders at a summit in April, urging them to reject “rival-bloc mentality.”\n\nBut those words appeared to fall flat with the European side, which focused instead on pressing China to help broker peace in Ukraine. “The dialogue was everything but a dialogue. In any case, it was a dialogue of the deaf,” EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said afterward.\n\nDownward spiral\n\nBeijing had carefully crafted its relationships in Europe in recent decades – creating a dedicated annual summit with Central and Eastern European countries and seeking inroads for its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which won support from one G7 member when Italy signed on in 2019.\n\nUS concerns about the risks of collaboration with China resonated in Europe. And European nations were themselves watching Xi’s China grow increasingly assertive in its foreign policy, from the combative tone of its “wolf warrior” diplomats to the establishment of a naval base in Africa, rising aggressiveness in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, and the targeting of companies or countries that ran foul of its line on hot-button issues.\n\nAllegations of major human rights violations in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang, and its dismantling of civil society in Hong Kong also played a role in shifting European perceptions, analysts say. Chinese officials have called allegations that it held more than a million Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang “fabrications,” and slammed discussion of these issues as “interference” in its internal affairs.\n\nThe EU declared China a “systemic rival” in 2019 and ties have continued to fray since.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping attends the opening of the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands during his first state visit to Europe. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n“China now demands the rest of the world pay it due respect and recognize the positions China takes, without paying much regard to what the others may think,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London.\n\nThis approach made Western democracies “abandon the decades-long policy of helping China to modernize and rise with a hope that greater economic integration will encourage China to become a responsible stake holder in world affairs,” Tsang said.\n\nEconomic edge\n\nChina was the third largest export market for European goods and the largest source of products entering Europe last year, but frictions have taken their toll on the economic relationship between the EU and Beijing.\n\nEarlier this year, a dispute between China and Lithuania pushed the EU to level a case at the WTO. It accused Beijing of “discriminatory trade practices against Lithuania” in retaliation for what Beijing views as a violation by the Baltic state of its “One China” principle, by which it claims self-ruled Taiwan as its sovereign territory.\n\nThe greatest financial casualty was the long-awaited trade deal between the EU and China, which stalled last year after being caught in the crossfire of a sanctions exchange. Beijing slapped penalties on EU lawmakers and bodies, European think tanks and independent scholars after the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials for alleged abuses in Xinjiang.\n\nBut the damage was greater than just the deal.\n\n“This overreaction (from Beijing) was not a wise move,” said Ingrid d’Hooghe, a senior research associate at the Netherlands-based think tank Clingendael, pointing to the harmful effect on public opinion.\n\n“China’s strategy toward Europe was falling apart and it apparently didn’t understand that all these actions – the over-reactive sanctions, coercive diplomacy – in the end worked against China’s diplomatic goals … and also pushed Europe closer to the United States,” she said.\n\nWhile these actions may have pushed a shift in European thinking with clear economic consequences, they added up for Beijing’s Foreign Ministry, according to Henry Gao, a professor at Singapore Management University’s Yong Pung How School of Law.\n\n“For them, the cold relationship is a necessary price and it is more important to make political points,” he said.\n\nBlind spot?\n\nIt is China’s most recent calculations over how to respond to Russia’s war in Ukraine that may end up the most costly when it comes to European ties.\n\nAs European countries and the US united in support of Ukraine, China refused to condemn the war – instead bolstering its relationship with Russia and joining the Kremlin in finger-pointing at the US and NATO.\n\nThere were leading policy analysts in China who understood the negative consequences China’s position would have on its European ties, according to Li Mingjiang, an associate professor and Provost’s Chair in International Relations at Nanyang Technological University’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. But that assessment may have been “underestimated” by decision makers, Li said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Brazil in 2019. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images\n\nCalculations about the geopolitical importance of ties with Russia, and also the close bond between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin also likely came to bear, he added.\n\n“It’s a really huge dilemma for China … and they couldn’t afford any major negative consequences on the China-Russia strategic partnership. That imperative really prevailed,” Li said.\n\nThere has been acknowledgment of China’s myopia among mainland scholars,\n\nChen Dingding, founding director of the Intellisia Institute think tank in Guangzhou, wrote in a coauthored article in The Diplomat, that the risks of the war in Ukraine are “not fully understood in China,” where officials and academics had failed to acknowledge the “shock” that death and destruction in Ukraine would bring Europeans.\n\n“The geographic as well as emotional proximity of the war will fundamentally change European sentiments toward common security, economic dependencies, and national sovereignty for years to come,” Chen and his international group of coauthors wrote.\n\nHowever, strong voices within many countries do continue to advocate a balanced approach to China, according to d’Hooghe. The future may bring not a decoupling, she said, but rather a recalibration within Europe of how to collaborate with China while keeping an eye on security and balance.\n\n“But right now – and this is also true with the European relationship with Russia – normative considerations seem to weigh heavier than economic interests,” she said.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/25/president-donald-trump-trade-war-china-regrets-g-7-summit/2107246001/", "title": "President Donald Trump signals regret over trade war with China", "text": "BIARRITZ, France — President Donald Trump signaled Sunday that he may be having regrets over his trade war with China, but the White House backtracked a few hours later and said he had been misunderstood.\n\nAt a breakfast meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Trump said “yeah” when a reporter asked if he was having second thoughts about how the trade conflict with China has escalated.\n\n“I have second thoughts about everything,” he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham later issued a statement seeking to clarify Trump's comments and suggesting the only thing he regrets is not placing higher tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n“This morning in the (meeting) with the UK, the president was asked if he had ‘any second thought on escalating the trade war with China,'\" Grisham said in a statement. \"His answer has been greatly misinterpreted.

Each time, he indicated that he did.\n\nTrump’s remarks, on the second day of the annual G-7 gathering of leaders of the world’s most industrialized countries, came just days after he ramped up the trade conflict by raising tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nTrump said Friday he would raise from 25% to 30% U.S. tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products and would increase from 10% to 15% new tariffs on a remaining $300 billion in goods — some of which are set to take effect next month. The announcement came shortly after China said it would levy its own tariffs on U.S. imports, prompting a market sell-off.\n\nThough Trump’s remarks on Sunday hinted at regrets, he said the escalating trade war with China is necessary because of what he considers Beijing’s unfair trade practices.\n\n“What (China) has done is outrageous,” he said.\n\nTrump said he has “no plans right now” to follow through on his threat to use a national security law to declare an emergency and force U.S. companies to leave China. But he insisted he has the authority to do so.\n\n“If I want, I could declare a national emergency,\" he said. But, “actually, we’re getting along very well with China right now. ...

Apple will make widgets more functional, and include customized lock screens similar to the iPhone. Users can also add lock screen widgets. Live Activities such as food orders or travel plans will appear on iPads, too. Apple will also bring the Health app to iPad for the first time.\n\nDropping the Hey in 'Hey, Siri'\n\nA small change, but you soon can drop the \"Hey\" when waking up Siri. Users can simply say Siri. Other new features expected with iOS 17: offline maps, improvements to People albums, and a new Pets album within Photos.\n\nThe iPhone will have a Standby mode\n\nNew to the iPhone later this year is Standby, which turns the smartphone into a smart display when it's locked. It can show info like photos, time and date, or other notifications. If you want to use it as a traditional alarm clock, it will automatically dim to low light.\n\nJournal app to debut on iPhones this year\n\nThe iPhone will get a new Apple app, called Journal. Users can chronicle key moments in their life with a combination of writing and photos. Your phone will also remind you near the end of your day if you want to start writing.\n\nYour keyboard will become smarter\n\nAutocorrect gets a ducking update (see what I did there). Sentence level corrections can fix more types of mistakes. The keyboard will allow you to quickly revert to your original word if autocorrects tries to fix it when you don't want it. Predictive text will improve, too, gets Federighi.\n\nNameDrop quickly exchanges contact info\n\nSimilar to AirDrop, NameDrop allows people to quickly share contact information. Their info will appear on your phone, and you can select how you want to save details like phone number.\n\nStickers on Messages get more love\n\nStickers will get a major update with iOS 17. Users can access Stickers more easily to add to messages. They can also cut out elements from photos and create unique stickers users can customize. Emojis will be available as Stickers, too.\n\nLive Voicemail transcribes on the fly\n\nOne cool feature coming soon to iPhones: Live Voicemail. When a person calls currently, the Phone app will transcribe the message after it's recorded. With Live Voicemail, it will transcribe as the person is leaving the message, so you can see it in real time.\n\nUpdates are coming to Messages, too, including location sharing within a thread, check-ins to alert friends or family when you are safe, and transcribed audio clips shared in texts.\n\nIt's official: iOS 17 is confirmed\n\nApple's Craig Federighi appears to introduce the world to iOS 17. It starts with phone calls (remember it's still a phone). You can create special visual identities for contacts and lock screen style posters that pop up whenever someone calls. \"They're going to stand out in a whole new way,\" said Federighi.\n\nUpdates to Mac Studio\n\nTernus shifts to the Mac Studio, the company's supercharged desktop computer. Consumers can now buy a version with the M2 Max chip, which basically means it's going to operate super fast. Apple introduces a new chip, M2 Ultra, which doubles the performance of Macs running M2 chips, Apple said. It's clearly aimed at higher level production work such as video editing or audio engineering. Definitely don't buy this just for email or playing Wordle. Apple unveiled yet another Mac desktop, the Mac Pro with M2 Ultra.\n\nAll the big performance on the desktops come at a price. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999, while the Mac Pro starts at $6,999. A budget buster for sure.\n\nApple announces 15-inch MacBook Air at $1,299\n\nWe start WWDC with fresh hardware. John Ternus, Apple's senior VP for hardware engineering on Macs, joins to introduce a version of MacBook Air with a 15-inch screen. It's available in four finishes, MagSafe charging, and 1080p camera for video calls. The laptop has six speakers, and supports Apple's in-house M2 processing chip. The revamped laptop also boasts 18 hours of battery life. It starts at $1,299, and is available next week. Also, the 13-inch model will see a discount down to $1,099.\n\nLet Apple WWDC begin\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook kicks off the conference in front of giant rainbow arches right outside Apple Park. Cook notes this year marks the 15th anniversary of the App Store. Cook also said the company is committed to helping developers with the tools to help them do their best work.\n\nWhat time does WWDC start?\n\nThe conference begins with a keynote address starting at 1 p.m. ET.\n\nHow to watch WWDC keynote?\n\nThe keynote is available to watch through Apple's website, or on the Apple TV app. In previous years, Apple has also streamed its keynote on YouTube.\n\nWhat are Apple's plans with AI?\n\nApple is one of the few tech companies that has remained quiet on artificial intelligence, as services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard start to infiltrate the space.\n\nThat should change Monday, said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Apple is expected to discuss its plans and strategy for AI during the keynote.\n\n\"We expect Apple to head down the path to have its own AI driven solution that will be integrated within the Apple ecosystem and enable consumers to further tap into their iOS data, video, music, applications, and Apple devices through next generation AI capabilities,\" Ives said.\n\nWhen will we see iPhone 15?\n\nThe announcement of a new iOS brings us closer to a new iPhone. So when will we see iPhone 15 (granted they stay with the naming convention)?\n\nDon't expect an announcement Monday. Apple saves it for its big iPhone event in September. Typically the new iPhone launches in September, roughly two weeks after its signature fall event. Last year, Apple held its iPhone event September 7, then launched iPhone 14 on September 16.\n\nCan Apple's mixed reality headset break through?\n\nThe journey of the VR headset has felt like a rollercoaster ride. There was the initial buzz when the first headsets made their debuts. But the devices didn't take off like smartphones due to factors such as pricing and the fact that many headsets were tethered to a PC or other device to function.\n\nFacebook parent Meta has seen some success with its Quest line of VR headsets by making them more affordable and allowing them to operate independently.\n\nExpect Apple's rumored headset to remain a niche product for a while, said Forrester analyst Thomas Husson. The more important priority is creating an ecosystem capable of creating unique AR and VR experiences.\n\n\"Let’s not forget the iPhone and Apple Watch experiences were not built overnight but took a couple of years to scale,\" Husson said.\n\nWhat to expect from iOS 17\n\nAmong the rumored features is a new smart display that functions similarly a smart home device with screen like Amazon's Echo Show. When the iPhone is placed in landscape mode (horizontally), it will show specific notifications when the screen is locked, reports Bloomberg. The update will also add a journaling app to update friends and take notes, said the report.\n\nMore on Apple's mixed reality headset\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out its headset combining augmented and virtual realities during the keynote. The device will be named either Reality Pro or XR Pro, said the report, and cost around $3,000.\n\nThe headset will support VR as well as offer a pass-through mode to add AR elements, said the report. The device is meant for tasks such as communication, watching videos or playing games, the report said.\n\nWhat to expect at WWDC\n\nThe main purpose of the conference is to introduce developers to new versions of software for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. Prepare to see not just iOS 17, but fresh versions of iPadOS, watchOS and macOS.\n\nAlthough Apple typically reserves many of its big hardware announcements for its iPhone event in September, this year could be different. Monday could mark the debut of Apple's long-rumored mixed reality headset.\n\nWhat devices will be compatible with iOS 17?\n\nThe next iOS isn't just for new iPhone owners. Like previous releases, iOS 17 will be available on multiple iPhone models released over the past couple years. Support for iOS 16 stretches all the way back to the iPhone 8, released in 2017. However, if you are still hanging on to an iPhone 8, it's possible it gets cut out from this year's release.\n\nWhen will iOS 17 come out?\n\nThe keynote is typically when Apple not only unveils the next iOS but details on its launch. The arrival of iOS 17 is timed to the launch of the next iPhone, so the next update will likely debut in September a couple days before the new smartphone is available in stores.\n\nLast year, Apple released iOS 16 on September 12, four days before the launch of iPhone 14.\n\nWhat does WWDC stand for?\n\nThe annual Worldwide Developers Conference is a week-long gathering of developers of applications for Apple products including the iPhone, Mac, and iPad to connect with fellow developers and discover new tools for creating apps. The conference is free for all developers.\n\nThe conference had previously been hosted at a convention center in San Francisco before the COVID-19 pandemic transformed it to a virtual experience in 2020. This year, Apple will host a special in-person experience Monday at its Apple Park headquarters.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/960836/five-good-news-stories-about-ai", "title": "Eight good news stories about AI | The Week", "text": "The rapid spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) programmes is sparking doomsday predictions ranging from mass lay-offs to the end of humankind.\n\nAccording to the latest Artificial Intelligence Index from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, public scepticism about the potential benefits of AI is highest in Western countries such as the UK, Germany, France and US, the home of Silicon Valley. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of people from the world’s two most populus nations, China and India, felt that the positives of AI outweighed the drawback.\n\nLike any major technological advancement, the impact of AI will be mixed. But \"whether you like it or not, AI is here and here to stay\", said Forbes. \"With responsible development and use, AI can vastly improve our world.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The 1859 \"Carrington Event\", named after Richard Carrington, the British astronomer who documented it, disrupted the planet's communications systems, causing pylons to spark and giving electric shocks to telegraph operators.\n\nToday, a solar storm of a similar scale would be potentially \"catastrophic\", said The Telegraph . \"Such is the modern world's reliance on vulnerable electrical power and communications systems, a direct hit would [have] economic and social consequences comparable to those of the recent pandemic\".\n\nUsing AI to make predictions about solar storms is \"extremely important\", said Science Alert . The \"combined speed of prediction with the ability to apply those predictions to an entire globe makes Dagger a considerable step forward\".\n\nImproving education\n\nProminent tech companies, executives and billionaires have been hailing AI chatbots as \"education game-changers\", said The New York Times . The tools, they say, will \"revolutionise, and automatically personalise, student learning\".\n\nAccording to Forbes , AI teaching offers numerous advantages, including the ability to act like an \"infinitely patient grandmother, never rushing or giving up and going on to the next thing\". It could also improve retention, by personalising learning to make sure information is going in.\n\nDespite this, the release of AI tools like ChatGPT, created an \"initial panic from the education sector [which] was understandable\", said MIT Technology Review . Several leading universities in the UK, including Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge, warned students against using ChatGPT to cheat.\n\nBut after the concern died down, the outlook has gradually become \"a lot less bleak\". Universities have embraced the fact that advanced chatbots \"could be used as powerful classroom aids that make lessons more interactive, teach students media literacy, generate personalised lesson plans, save teachers time on admin, and more\".\n\nConsequently, MIT said, it looks likely that \"ChatGPT is going to change education, not destroy it.\"\n\nMind-reading for health gains\n\n\"One of AI’s biggest potential benefits is to help people stay healthy so they don’t need a doctor, or at least not as often,\" said PWC. AI is already being used to detect diseases earlier and with \"more accuracy\". For example, AI software can interpret mammograms and translate patient data into diagnostic information to determine breast cancer risk \"30 times faster\" than human doctors, \"with 99% accuracy, reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies\".\n\nUS researchers are also developing an AI-decoder that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text, \"a breakthrough that allows a person’s thoughts to be read non-invasively for the first time\", reported The Guardian’s science correspondent Hannah Devlin. The advance, outlined in a paper in Nature Neuroscience, raises the prospect of new ways to restore speech in patients struggling to communicate due to a stroke or motor neurone disease.\n\nAnalysing climate data\n\nAI \"as a tool is uniquely positioned to help manage\" the \"complex issues\" surrounding climate change and its impact on environmental, social and economic systems worldwide, said Boston Consulting Group. AI programmes can \"gather, complete and interpret large, complex datasets on emissions\" and more, and \"help identify the most at-risk regions\".\n\nMore specifically, AI can be used in hazard forecasting for long-term events such as sea-level rises, and for immediate, extreme events such as hurricanes. For example, the World Economic Forum reported that an application by San Francisco-based company Pano AI scans video feeds from mountaintop cameras to \"detect wildfires, alert homeowners and assist fire crews in controlling the fires\".\n\nDetecting infant blindness\n\nA recent AI-led breakthrough could pave the way to more effectively detect a leading cause of blindness in children. In a study published in The Lancet Digital Health, an international team of scientists and clinicians revealed how they had developed a deep learning model to identify which at-risk infants have retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The condition occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina of premature babies, and can lead to blindness if left untreated.\n\n\"Symptoms of ROP cannot be seen by the naked eye, meaning the only way to identify the condition is by monitoring infants at risk with eye exams,\" said University College London, which co-led the study. But an AI tool that was trained using thousands of images of the eyes of newborns \"was found to be as effective as senior pediatric ophthalmologists in discriminating normal retinal images from those with ROP”.\n\nDecoding animal language\n\nAI and machine learning has long helped analyse and translate human language, but now researchers are making major steps in decoding how animals communicate, which experts say could significantly advance ecological research and conservation efforts. For instance, in 2021, researchers used audio recordings to identify a new species of blue whales in the Indian Ocean. \"Each blue whale population has a distinct vocal signature, which can be used to distinguish and monitor different ‘acoustic populations’ or ‘acoustic groups’,\" the international team explained in an article in Nature.\n\nCalifornia-based non-profit Earth Species Project (ESP) is also using AI to identify patterns in large data sets of visual, oral and physical animal communications. CEO and co-founder Katie Zacarian told the World Economic Forum earlier this year that with the progress being made, \"we are moving rapidly toward a world in which two-way communication with another species is likely\".\n\nHelping with grief\n\nAI-powered technology is also being used to \"develop chatbot avatars of people’s deceased relatives, preserving their memories and helping with grief\", reported Euronews.\n\nIn 2021, an article in the San Francisco Chronicle detailing how a freelance writer trained an AI chatbot to impersonate his dead fiance received widespread attention. Less than two years later, as advanced AI programmes such as ChatGPT emerge, \"grief tech\" is a rapidly expanding field.\n\nCalifornia-based company HereAfter AI invites users to upload audio, images and videos of late loved ones to an app to create a \"life story avatar\" that chats on demand in the voice of the deceased. Another California start-up, StoryFile, \"records footage and audio prior to a person’s death and then makes it interactive through the power of conversational AI and a holographic avatar\", said Euronews.\n\nLucy Selman, associate professor in palliative and end-of-life care at Bristol University, told the Financial Times that tackling grief in such ways \"won’t be for everyone\". Research was needed into the ethics of such AI-powered tech and whether it might be harmful in delaying or prolonging grief, she said, but it is an “interesting advance\".\n\nProtecting rivers\n\nProponents of AI say it has a multiplicity of positive uses; and now wildlife experts have identified a new one. They say the kind of facial recognition technology that is used at airports could be adapted to prevent invasive fish from colonising British rivers. There is growing concern that pink salmon are establishing breeding colonies in UK rivers, threatening native Atlantic salmon and potentially disrupting fragile ecosystems, reported The Telegraph. Norwegian experts have had similar concerns – and have developed AI river gates to keep the fish out. The software has been trained to recognise the distinct features of the invaders. If the AI concludes that the fish coming up the river are Atlantic salmon, the gates open. If it decides they are pink salmon (which have distinctive humped backs), the gates stay closed and the fish are diverted to a holding tank and taken back out to sea.\n\nIntroduced into Russian rivers in the 1950s, pink salmon were rarely observed in British rivers until 2015, but 200 have been seen since then, and last year, their smolts (young salmon) were found in two Scottish rivers for the first time. In Norway, numbers reached 100,000 in 2021, and they are likely to hit a million this year.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Devika Rao", "Theunis Bates"], "publish_date": "2023/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/tech/apple-wwdc-2022/index.html", "title": "Apple WWDC 2022: Revamped lock screen and big changes to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nApple kicked off its annual developer conference by unveiling its next-generation mobile software, iOS 16, with new features that will let users personalize their iPhone lock screens, change how they text friends through iMessage and deepen how its smartphones integrate with cars.\n\nThese and other updates, which were unveiled at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, show how Apple continues to push to ensure its devices – the iPhone in particular – remain central to our daily lives and the many products we interact with. But while these updates will likely appeal to many Apple device users, the event was also notable for what was not announced: a new product.\n\nIn recent days, some industry watchers had held out hope that Apple could offer an early look at a platform thought to be called RealityOS. The system, according to rumors, could power a mixed reality headset – a wearable device that’s said to be capable of both VR and AR – which Apple has been rumored to be working on for years.\n\nInstead, the focus was on a number of functional, if not sexy, product updates: more multi-tasking features on Mac software, the introduction of Apple’s Weather app on iPad and the unveiling of the company’s next-generation M2 chip.\n\n“While some may be disappointed at the lack of radical new hardware in areas such as AR, Apple’s investment in silicon will play a defining role in future product categories, such as a head-worn device, where power and performance must be finely balanced,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight.\n\nHere’s a closer look at some of the updates coming to Apple’s most important products. The updates are expected to be available to users in the fall.\n\nRevamping iMessage, the lock screen and notifications\n\nApple is breathing new life into some iOS tools that haven’t been updated in years.\n\nPerhaps the buzziest changes are coming to iMessage, including the ability to edit or unsend messages and to mark messages as unread. The company said these options are among the most requested features from users.\n\niOS 16 new lock screen Apple\n\nApple also teased several new options to better customize the lock screen and improve the notifications experience. iPhone users will be able to add widgets on the lock screen to get information at a glance, such as upcoming calendar events and the weather, and track “live” activities, including an Uber ride’s progress or updates on a sports game. And the software will offer more personalized wallpapers for the lock screen and the ability to shuffle options throughout the day.\n\nExpanded CarPlay options\n\nApple’s updates extended to its broader ecosystem of products and services, from payments and passwords to cars.\n\nThe newest version of CarPlay will be packed with customized widgets controlled by the iPhone and capable of running across all of a car’s screens, from the center screen to the instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. As with Apple’s other updates announced Monday, there will also be more support for widgets and more personalization options, including various gauge cluster designs.\n\nNew payment and health features\n\nApple said iOS users in the US will be able to spread payments over 8 weeks on Apple Pay, similar to a “buy now, pay later” service, tapping into a growing payment method for consumers.\n\nThe company also continues to bet on health features. The Apple Watch will soon support new custom workouts features, including heart rate zones and data on a runner’s stride. In addition, enhanced sleep tracking will monitor when a user goes in and out of light and deep sleep. A new medications app will let users track, manage and understand the medications people take and notifies users when to take them.\n\nApple also unveiled a tool called Passkeys, which is intended to replace passwords by using Touch ID or Face ID to authenticate across apps and devices.\n\nNew MacBooks and the M2 chip\n\nWhile the event focused on software, Apple did make some hardware announcements.\n\nApple introduced a thinner, lighter and faster MacBook Air designed around its new M2 in-house processor. The 13.6-inch MacBook Air is 25% brighter than before, supports MagSafe charging and features an enhanced front-facing camera with twice the resolution of the previous model. With an 8-core CPU, Apple said the M2 chip promises 18% greater performance than its M1 chip.\n\nNew MacBook Air Apple\n\nThe processor also comes with a 10-core GPU – double that of the M1 – along with 25% better graphics performance. The M2 is also coming to a new 13-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nThe MacBook Air starts at $1,099 and the MacBook Pro starts at $1,299.\n\nApple also teased its latest Mac software, called OS Ventura, which offers a handful of multi-tasking features, such as the ability to share Safari tabs with friends and family, hand off FaceTime calls to other devices, and use an iPhone as a webcam with a new product called Continuity Camera.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2024/05/01/sams-club-stores-ai-checks-receipts/73524210007/", "title": "AI tech that gets Sam's Club customers out the door faster will be in ...", "text": "Sam's Club has begun rolling out artificial intelligence-powered technology at select locations that confirms members' purchases as they exit the stores.\n\nThe new verification technology, which replaces physical receipt checks, has so far been deployed at 120 Sam's Club locations across the United States. The Walmart-owned bulk retailer said in a Tuesday press release that more than half of the customers have used the option at stores where the technology is available, which has helped members leave clubs 23% faster.\n\nFirst unveiled in January at the Consumer Electronics Show, the AI technology is slated to be implemented at all of Sam's Club's nearly 600 stores by the end of the year.\n\nThe retailer is far from the only company with designs on integrating artificial intelligence capabilities into its shopping experiences. But Sam's Club claimed Tuesday that the rollout \"represents the largest-scale implementation of member-facing AI-powered technology in the retail industry.\"\n\n\"I’m incredibly proud of the innovation and dedication of our team to deploy this member experience technology,\" Todd Garner, Sam's Club chief product officer, said in a statement.\n\nWalmart to close health centers:See full list of locations\n\nHow Sam's Club's AI tech works\n\nThe AI technology is a new way for Sam's Club to confirm its members have paid for the items in their shopping cart without requiring them to wait in a line for an employee to manually check their receipts.\n\n\"Members continue to say they want a faster and more convenient shopping experience and consistently rated the wait times at the exit – especially during busy periods – as a pain point in the shopping experience,\" Sam's Club said.\n\nThe new feature also blends with Sam's Club Scan and Go app, which allows shoppers to ring up and pay for their own orders as they fill their carts. After shoppers complete their checkout at a register or with the app, they can exit through blue gateways armed with cameras and scanners that take an inventory of the products in their carts and compare them to their orders.\n\nThe technology also frees up exit greeters once tasked with checking receipts to complete other tasks and help customers in other ways, Sam's Club said.\n\nHow other stores are using artificial intelligence\n\nThere are a few other retailers who have scan-and-go apps, where customers scan their items as they shop and then pay in the app.\n\nAmazon has also been working to expand its \"Just Walk Out\" technology at its stores and third-party retailers like airports and sports stadiums. The technology, which debuted in 2018, uses artificial intelligence, cameras and some sensors to enable shoppers to grab what they want and leave without stopping at a cash register.\n\nThe Just Walk Out feature allows customers to walk into a store using Amazon One, a credit or debit card, or a mobile wallet app to shop for items and leave. Cameras and sensors on shelves work with artificial intelligence to see what customers take or put back in order to automatically charge them for their purchases.\n\nWhile Amazon said it is ditching the technology at grocery stores like Whole Foods, it's still in use at Amazon's 140 third-party stores with plans to double this year.\n\nContributing: Betty Lin-Fisher\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm said the Austin facility, which has continued to scale its footprint and manufacturing output since 2021, is a \"reflection of Tesla as a whole.\"\n\nMapping Musklandia:A guide to Elon Musk-related activity in the Austin area\n\nFollowing the meeting, Musk also sat down for an interview with CNBC which delved into a number of topics, including artificial intelligence, Twitter's new CEO, Tesla, work from home, and Musk's tweeting habits.\n\nAhead of the shareholders meeting there was some speculation from industry analysts that the meeting could highlight succession steps for the company, but Musk clarified during a question-and-answer session that he has no plans on stepping down as CEO anytime soon.\n\nHere’s what else Musk and the company discussed during the annual shareholders meeting:\n\nFamiliar face becomes newest board member\n\nTesla's former Chief Technology Officer, JB Straubel, who left Tesla in 2019, will be returning to the electric carmaker's board, and now is CEO of Redwood Materials, which recycles lithium-ion batteries and produces battery materials. The addition was met with cheers during the meeting, and comes as some investors, including during the shareholders meeting, call for the board to reign Musk in.\n\nElon Musk claims company will conduct third party audit regarding child labor\n\nActivist investors, The New York chapter of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, called on Tesla to conduct a third-party audit detailing the company's efforts to eradicate child and forced labor and its supply chain, particularly in relation to cobalt, which is an ingredient used in the production of batteries. The proposal was rejected by shareholders and Tesla officially recommended voting against the nuns' proposal, but Musk took to stage and said the company would do a third party audit.\n\n\"Even for the small amount of cobalt that we do use, we will make sure ... that no child labor is being exploited,” Musk said.\n\nMore:Texas EV owners face a new tax. Find out why, and how much it will cost drivers here\n\nTesla to dive into traditional advertising\n\nMusk agreed that Tesla, which has prided itself on word-of-mouth advertising, would consider doing traditional advertising, in answer to a question from a shareholder during a question-and-answer session. The CEO gave little detail into what that would look like but said \"we’ll try a little advertising and see how it goes.\"\n\nDuring the interview with CNBC Musk claimed he would still need to figure out what that advertising looks like because it was something he agreed to on stage, and hadn’t given much thought to prior, but did say advertising should be \"as close to content as you can,\" as well as informative and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nMore:EV industry supplier could get a $362 million loan to help build its Georgetown facility\n\nWhat's the latest with the Cybertruck?\n\nCompany executives, including Musk, once again said the long-awaited Cybertruck, which is expected to be produced in Austin, is on track to roll out this year, a timeline that has been pushed back before.\n\nMusk also teased, but gave little detail, on two potential future products he said Tesla has in its pipeline, and said they would have their own launch dates later on. As the CEO spoke, a slide showing a vehicle's outline appeared on the screen. Musk said the products would be \"head and shoulders above anything else\" in the industry as far as manufacturing techniques and design.\n\nMusk continues to bet on AI robot 'Optimus'\n\nMusk once again spoke about Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, which Musk has predicted will be the key to Tesla's long-term plans. The product, which has yet to launch, was revealed last year during the company's AI day, when the company showed a robot that could barely walk. On Tuesday, the company shared a video that shows the robots picking up items, walking, training on human movements, and recognizing objects.\n\nThe artificial intelligence-based product is not yet out yet, and is being built off the same software as Tesla’s controversial 'Full Self Driving' vehicle software, which industry experts and the company do not yet consider fully autonomous.\n\nElon Musk predicts a challenging economy this year\n\nMusk has repeatedly warned of an uncertain economy in recent years, and Tuesday was no exception. The CEO, who is one of the richest men in the world, predicted it would be a challenging 12 months for the economy, but said Tesla would emerge on the other side in a strong place.\n\n\"Tesla is not immune to the global economic environment,\" Musk said. \"I expect things to be, at a macroeconomic level, difficult for at least the next 12 months.

The iPhone maker has finally jumped into two of the hottest tech trends of the last two years — augmented reality and voice-activated speakers, with a promise to dominate these markets pioneered by its rivals.\n\nTwo years after Amazon introduced its sleeper hit Echo device, and a year after Google Home, Apple now has the voice-activated HomePod, a high-end music speaker priced at $349 that will be powered by Siri. That often maligned but widely used artificial intelligence assistant is also getting an upgrade, though for HomePod, Siri's main task is clear: play music.\n\nApple also unveiled a new augmented reality developer kit that would help Apple app developers integrate this technology that overlays digital images on the physical world, made popular by Pokemon Go. Facebook and Google have been showcasing such distorted reality tech at their own demos, with plans to revolutionize commerce and communication. Apple's entrance into augmented reality on iPhone could jump-start the industry that's mostly been a playground for games.\n\nThe availability of AR technology on hundreds of millions of Apple's mobile devices has the potential to help make iOS \"the largest AR platform in the world overnight,\" CEO Tim Cook said.\n\nMore:\n\nApple has been playing catch-up on a variety of cutting-edge tech fronts, allowing competitors to take the lead on the next big computing platforms, all driven by artificial intelligence.\n\nIn the case of both HomePod and ARKit, Apple is banking on fans of the brand potentially abandoning rival products in favor of whatever its in-house developers and independent developers create for the space.\n\n\"Today's (Worldwide Developers Conference) announcements show that Apple is building the infrastructure for a whole new decade of engagement with AI (artificial intelligence at its core,\" Raj Aggarwal, co-founder and CEO of Localytics, who worked with Steve Jobs on the launch of the original iPhone.\n\n\"The last 10 years since the introduction of the first iPhone were focused on the mobile revolution, but the mobile innovation has now hit its plateau,\" he says. \"AI really unlocks the power of what mobile offers. Now brands can take that data, make sense of it and interact with their users in real-time in a truly individualized way.\"\n\nThere were few wow moments, though, extending a trend in recent years of incremental refinements that keep loyalists happy but which fail to carve out huge new markets, like the first iPhones or iPods did.\n\nAmong the offerings: The ability to pay friends with Apple Pay. An iPad with a larger, sharper screen. How about an industrial strength iMac for $5,000?\n\n\"What was in there for developers?\" asked Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation Research. \"It's more WWDC — the D is for Demo. Or product demo.\"\n\nWall Street reacted with indifference: Apple shares were down 1%, to $153.93, in trading Monday.\n\nMainly, WWDC 2017 was just over two hours of jargon-filled tech-speak aimed not at consumers but rather developers, who are the lifeblood of any large technology company. These conferences, which include Google I/O and Facebook F8, are recruiting tools for companies to build hardware and software based on their computing platforms and products.\n\nThe biggest pitch was left for the very last, when CEO Tim Cook announced the 7-inch, $349 HomePod, which ships in December.\n\nHomePod seems in many ways like an echo of existing products on the market, in everything from form to price. But where Amazon and Google are peddling a robotic home assistant, Apple leaned on its music roots with its pitch.\n\nPhil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, announced HomePod by taking a shot at the quality of the speakers in competitors' products. Apple purchased Beats Electronics a few years ago, and is hoping to pull fans of Beats headphones and wireless speakers over to HomePod.\n\nBeyond using Siri as \"a great musicologist,\" Schiller said HomePod users could ask Siri — which now has a more natural sounding voice and can translate up to five languages — about the weather, news and sports, as well as dictate a text message and activate appliances that use Apple's HomeKit technology.\n\nApple finally made good on months of talk about the coming age of augmented reality with its new AR Kit, part of iOS 11 that is available now for developers and scheduled as a free software update for iPhone and iPad this fall.\n\nThe developer toolkit leverages iOS devices' built-in cameras, processors and motion sensors to overlay digital images onto the physical world. A demo of a steaming coffee cup next to a lamp on a table drew hoots and hollers from the developer audience, although the first vestiges of the technology are likely to emerge in gaming environments.\n\nAs for when an iPhone will be able to deliver an augmented reality experience, the only hint at timing from WWDC was when a representative from director Peter Jackson's Wingnut AR studios showcased an AR gaming demo that he said would arrive later in the year.\n\nSome of the more meat-and-potatoes news zeroed in on making iPad, iMac and iPhone a bit easier to use. For example:\n\n— A new iMac Pro is menacing in sleek black with a 27-inch screen and technology that makes it the company's \"most powerful Mac ever\" and will be available in December for $4,999.\n\n— A new version of Apple Pay now allows person-to-person payments.\n\n— A do not disturb option for the iPhone eliminates distracted driving by making the screen go black and sending notifications that you're behind the wheel.\n\n— The smaller iPad Pro bumps up around an inch in diameter to 10.5-inches and the iPad lineup gets features such as searchable handwritten text, an effort to goose slowing sales.\n\n— Toy Story heroes Buzz, Woody and Jessie join Mickey and Minnie Mouse as Apple Watch faces.\n\nExperts anticipate that Apple will pull the covers off a significantly revamped iPhone at its annual event in September, likely named not the 8 but the X, or 10, in a nod to the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's debut in 2007.\n\nThe main iPhone updates announced at WWDC were a single-screen Control Panel, a new feature that disables the phone while driving, and a redesigned App Store that makes navigating the site easier on a phone.\n\nMachine learning was a repeated buzzword throughout the keynote. The Apple Watch now leverages its data-crunching power to automatically populate its screen with the day's most pressing events, while Photos features improved facial-recognition capability to create Memories of recently photographed events.\n\nApple also took the opportunity to trumpet its ubiquity to the 5,300 developers who attended WWDC from 75 countries (the event moved from its 15-year home in San Francisco to accommodate the larger crowd).\n\nCook noted that Apple has 16 million registered developers, up 3 million in 2016 alone, and has paid out $70 billion to developers since the store opened in 2008.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz and Tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/06/08/amazon-youtube-and-apple-new-moves-safer-faster-and-less-annoying/1386487001/", "title": "Apple's iOS13: making life less annoying with software updates.", "text": "Faster, safer, less annoying.\n\nThree things happened this week that could affect your digital lives.\n\nLet's break them down.\n\nSafer: YouTube, the no. 2 most visited website and app said it would get serious about cleaning up its platform of bigoted videos, something critics have been asking for years, meaning that parents could potentially get a little more comfortable about having their kids watching YouTube. (There's still a lot to worry about on YouTube. More on that in a minute.)\n\nFaster: Amazon wants to get products to your home not in two days, not in one day, but instantly. Or within 30 minutes. The e-tailer introduced its latest drone, which can fly vertically, and is being targeted to ship out small items like toothpaste and other household goods within the next year. Whether the Federal Aviation Administration will open up the skies to Jeff Bezos and company, however, is an open question.\n\nLess annoying: Apple unveiled its latest operating system upgrade, bringing 200 new tweaks to how you'll be using the iPhone. And if you had to sum up the highlights, the key ones are about making our experience with the device less, well, bothersome.\n\nThe ones we really like:\n\n—Send robocalls directly to voicemail. A new setting in iOS 13, which will be available to the public in September, will allow only phone numbers that are recognized (via your Contacts, Mail, and Messages) to ring the phone. All other calls will be sent to voicemail, and you'll only know about it if the caller has left a voicemail, which, as robocall haters know, rarely, if ever happens.\n\n—Share on AirPods. Painpoint: you're on an airplane with your significant other, and loving the movie on your laptop, which you're listening to via the AirPod bluetooth earbud. Solution: a new \"share\" tab which will allow you to share the media with others.\n\n—Find photos. We take zillions of photos every year, and most of us have a really hard time locating the ones from anything that happened several months ago. Where are they? In Favorites? In an album? What's the name of that album anyway? So it seems likely that iPhone shutterbugs will appreciate the new layout of the Photos app, which mixes videos in with photos, for a more pleasing look. You'll be able to sort them by day, month and year. Additionally, Apple says it will use machine learning to weed out the duplicates, photos of receipts and parking lot signs, to make for a more pleasing display.\n\nFinally, this one really doesn't affect many of us for more than nostalgia reasons, but Apple is finally looking to make that iTunes desktop software more manageable.\n\nThe \"death of iTunes\" got lots of attention, since Apple announced that it was splitting up the program into three areas, Music, Podcasts and TV/Movies.\n\nThe reality is, yes, iTunes had become really annoying, slow and overly bloated by trying to do too many things. But it's desktop software in a mobile world, and most of us don't plug our phones into the computer anymore to sync content, we don't throw CDs into the CD tray to rip them, because there are few CD trays on computers anymore. We don't check our downloaded music libraries, because most of you prefer to stream and get access to either pre-arranged radio like Pandora, or pay for unlimited music listening from the likes of Spotify, Amazon and Apple Music.\n\nAnd this is huge. For the first time, we have a way better reason to plug the iPhone. In iOS13, it will show up as a storage device, like a USB flash drive, so we'll be able to move files back and forth from the computer to phone, without the pain-point of having to e-mail files back and forth. (I'm dreaming of videos shot on my camera and edited on my laptop that can finally go to Instagram, without all the hassles of year past.)\n\nThank you Apple!\n\nAs for YouTube, the network receives over 500 hours of new content every minute and while it tries to keep a lid on things parents wouldn't want their kids watching, all those submitted videos are frankly more than machine learning, artificial intelligence and some human oversight can handle.\n\nThis week, YouTube said it would be more diligent about getting them down, with a new stated policy prohibiting videos \"alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status.\"\n\nThe expected fallout happened quickly, as videos that looked to expose hate speech by organizations like the Southern Law Poverty Center and One People's Project had their videos taken down. YouTube said they could appeal the decisions.\n\nYouTube still has lots of problems. A video called \"Who owns the Media,\" is ripe with anti-Jewish slurs in the comments, a video by Joyner Lucas features the rapper spouting the \"N\" word repeatedly, and any search for students and school uniforms attracts the types of videos and racy comments that wouldn't be welcome in a family newspaper.\n\nSo, a great move by YouTube, but parents, don't let your young kids near it without active supervision.\n\nAnd finally, Amazon. At it's re:MARS conference in Las Vegas this week, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the world's richest man, was asked for tips on how to start a successful business.\n\n“The most important thing is to be customer obsessed,” he said. “Figure out how to absolutely delight them.”\n\nA drone delivering toothpaste at noon, after receiving an order at 11:30? That sounds rather delightful. But will it get old after we try it a few times?\n\nThis week's Talking Tech podcasts\n\nFacebook's Birthday Nag\n\nThe best new features of iOS13\n\nMeet Apple's youngest app developer, 10-year-old Ayush\n\nUsing the iPhone as a TV remote\n\nRoad trip tech lessons\n\nThat's a wrap for this week's Talking Tech news highlights.

It's a tool that makes short videos from prompts written by users.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company announced the news on Thursday and showed videos created by the new text-to-video generator on their website.\n\n\"We’re teaching AI to understand and simulate the physical world in motion with the goal of training models that help people solve problems that require real-world interaction,\" states OpenAI's website.\n\nFootage of California during the gold rush, tiny pandas running around a petri dish and a gnome creating patterns in the zen garden of his snow globe enclosure are just some of the examples of what Sora, OpenAI's video creation tool, can make.\n\n\"We’re sharing our research progress early to start working with and getting feedback from people outside of OpenAI and to give the public a sense of what AI capabilities are on the horizon,\" states OpenAI on its website.\n\nIn an announcement tweeted by Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, he said a limited number of people will be able to use the new program right now. It's not publicly available just yet.\n\n\"We are starting red-teaming and offering access to a limited number of creators,\" said Altman in the post.\n\nAI:Find out who's calling, use AI and more with 15 smart tech tips\n\nYouTube star puts Sora, new OpenAI tool, to the test\n\nYouTube's biggest star, Jimmy Donaldson, AKA, MrBeast, replied to Altman's post the two engaged in some playful banter about the new tool.\n\nTo that, Altman said he'd make the YouTuber a video. He just needed to give Altman a prompt.\n\nDonaldson asked for a video of a \"monkey playing chess in a park,\" and Altman delivered.\n\nHow do I use Sora?\n\nAccording to the announcement posted to OpenAI's website, Sora is going to be similar to OpenAI's text-to-image generator. Users just need to type out a prompt, and the program will give them a video of what they requested.\n\nHowever, it can only be accessed by red teamers who will assess \"critical areas for harms or risks\" for the company and \"a number of visual artists, designers, and filmmakers to gain feedback on how to advance the model to be most helpful for creative professionals.\"\n\nIt isn't available to the public, and there is no word on when the layman will be able to use it.\n\nWhat can Sora do?\n\nThe program uses its \"deep understanding of language\" to interpret prompts and then create videos with \"complex scenes\" that are up to a minute long, with multiple characters and camera shots, as well as specific types of motion and accurate details.\n\nThe examples OpenAI gives range from animated a monster and kangaroo to realistic videos of people, like a woman walking down a street in Tokyo or a cinematic movie trailer of a spaceman on a salt desert.\n\nEmbedded content: https://cdn.openai.com/sora/videos/monster-with-melting-candle.mp4\n\n\"Animated scene features a close-up of a short fluffy monster kneeling beside a melting red candle,\" in the first sentence of the prompt that created the 3D video above.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, the videos displayed on its announcement page were all created by Sora.\n\nChallenges that Sora faces\n\nOpenAI states the program may struggle with the following:\n\nAccurately simulating the physics of a complex scene\n\nUnderstanding instances of cause and effect. An example it gives is someone might bite into a cookie, but the cookie doesn't have a bite mark after.\n\nConfusing spatial details of a prompt, like mixing up left and right.\n\nPrecise descriptions of events over time.\n\nEmbedded content: https://cdn.openai.com/sora/videos/grandma-birthday.mp4\n\nOne of the examples of what can go wrong is a video of a grandma blowing candles out on her birthday. But as she blows them out, the candles don't extinguish.\n\nPrompt given for the video:\n\nA grandmother with neatly combed grey hair stands behind a colorful birthday cake with numerous candles at a wood dining room table, expression is one of pure joy and happiness, with a happy glow in her eye. She leans forward and blows out the candles with a gentle puff, the cake has pink frosting and sprinkles and the candles cease to flicker, the grandmother wears a light blue blouse adorned with floral patterns, several happy friends and family sitting at the table can be seen celebrating, out of focus. The scene is beautifully captured, cinematic, showing a 3/4 view of the grandmother and the dining room. Warm color tones and soft lighting enhance the mood.\n\nWhat's wrong with it? Well, according to OpenAI, \"simulating complex interactions between objects and multiple characters is often challenging for the model, sometimes resulting in humorous generations.\"\n\nEthical and societal implications of AI\n\nFolks have been bringing up the ethics behind AI since the program became popular. Situations involving high-ranking officials, like when AI mimicked the president in phone calls and encouraged people not to vote, have already happened.\n\nBut OpenAI says they're working on taking safety steps before Sora becomes available to the public.\n\n“We are working with red teamers — domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias — who will be adversarially testing the model,” the company said in its statement. “We’re also building tools to help detect misleading content, such as a detection classifier that can tell when a video was generated by Sora.”\n\nIt says it's creating new techniques while also making sure existing safety precautions that already apply to its other program, DALL·E 3, are applicable to Sora.\n\nFor example, \"our text classifier will check and reject text input prompts that are in violation of our usage policies, like those that request extreme violence, sexual content, hateful imagery, celebrity likeness or the IP of others,\" states the company. \"We’ve also developed robust image classifiers that are used to review the frames of every video generated to help ensure that it adheres to our usage policies, before it’s shown to the user.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/tech/airbnb-spring-keynote-event/index.html", "title": "Airbnb unveils new way to book longer stays ahead of summer ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAirbnb on Wednesday announced new ways to search for and book homes on the platform in response to the rise of remote work and the number of customers choosing longer stays.\n\nThe new features include the ability to more easily divide trips between two homes when options for longer stays are limited and a search tool that surfaces properties via specific categories, such as whether the house offers “creative spaces,” a chef’s kitchen or a pool. The features were unveiled at a company keynote event ahead of the all-important summer travel season.\n\n“The way people travel has changed forever,” Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s cofounder and CEO, said in a statement ahead of the event. Chesky touted the new features as “the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade.”\n\nThe updates come as Airbnb recently reported business was booming again after being clobbered by the pandemic’s hit to the travel industry. In its most recent earnings report, Airbnb posted quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion, up 70% from the same period last year.\n\nThe company said nearly half of the nights booked on Airbnb in the last three months were for trips of a week or longer. Chesky suggested the new Split Stays feature, which allows customers to book back-to-back stays at multiple home in the same area, is intended to meet this shift in demand.\n\nWith this option, which will automatically appear in search results, Airbnb users will typically see around 40% more listings when hunting for longer stays, the company says.\n\nAirbnb’s new way to search, dubbed Airbnb Categories, lets users look for places to stay using 56 categories based on a home’s style – including options for tiny homes and yurts – as well as location and proximity to a travel activity. Chesky said this new way to search comes after people have become “more flexible about where they live and work,” a trend that Airbnb has also embraced by allowing its employees to “live and work anywhere.”\n\nThe company also announced bolstered travel protections for guests, which will be included for free with every booking. Dubbed AirCover, the protections offer users similar accommodations or refunds if their booking was canceled, if they can’t check into a home, or if the listing wasn’t as advertised. Moreover, the company said customers will get access to a 24-hour safety line if they ever feel unsafe during their stay.\n\nWednesday’s updates come after the company previously announced “strict anti-party measures” ahead of the summer holidays, marking its latest attempt to crack down on people seeking to use its platform to host unauthorized ragers. Chesky first announced the company’s ban on “party houses” in 2019, after five people were shot and killed at a Halloween party at an Airbnb rental house in Orinda, California.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}]}

The instructions include some basic warnings, including not to speak to anybody about the case or do any independent research.\n\nIt also included some basic instructions about taking notes, the case's flow and jurors' role evaluating the evidence. Afterward, she excused the jurors with instructions to return to begin again at 9 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nOpening statements by the parties are expected then. Prosecutors said their first witness will be an FBI agent responsible for investigating the case.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury sworn in for felony gun trial\n\nTwelve jurors and four alternates were sworn in at 4:20 p.m. for Hunter Biden's felony gun case, and opening arguments will begin on Tuesday.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWe have a jury pool, but not quite a jury\n\nThe court has churned its way through dozens of Delawareans and has a pool of 36 potential jurors. Now, both sides will get the opportunity to strike potential jurors without stating a specific reason.\n\nThe government will have six strikes and Hunter Biden's attorneys will have ten. Each side will also each have two strikes for alternate jurors.\n\nThis process should be done rending a jury of 12 and four alternates by the close of business today, meaning opening statements are likely to occur first thing Tuesday.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury selection expected to wrap up on Monday\n\nWhat's the timing for the rest of Hunter Biden's trial in Delaware? Jury selection is expected to finish on Monday, which would tee up opening statements to begin on Tuesday.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCourt takes break\n\nThe court is taking a 45-minute recess before continuing with jury selection.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden also faces tax charges\n\nThe president's son isn't only facing federal firearm charges. He also faces nine tax charges in California in another case, in which he's accused of avoiding paying at least $1.4 million.\n\nHe's charged with three felony and six misdemeanor charges tied to the allegations. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden being charged with?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘You can’t swing a cat without hearing something’\n\nOne potential juror was asked by the judge if he had previously heard about the case.\n\n“I live in Delaware, you can’t swing a cat without hearing something,” he told the judge, though he added that he had only heard about the case on the news but hadn’t researched it.\n\nProsecutors moved to strike the man because he said he had a family member who suffered from addiction and he holds strong feelings about second chances.\n\n“I think after people have been recovering, they need a second chance,” he said. “Everybody needs a second chance.”\n\nHe said he wasn’t sure what time period that second chance should come and that it should be down to the individual. He said this belief would not impair his ability to judge the evidence and he was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nThere's no rule that a president can't pardon a loved one. But if Hunter Biden is convicted on federal charges, it's not likely that his father would use his office to take action.\n\nThe White House last year ruled out President Joe Biden using his presidential authority to pardon his son. The president has given no indication that he planned to pardon Hunter Biden, but that hasn't stopped some critics from suggesting he might.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Joey Garrison\n\nCourt making progress selecting jurors\n\nSo far, the court has worked through more than three dozen potential jurors. Twenty-four have been selected to remain in the jury pool.\n\nThe court will continue to interview potential jurors until it has a pool of 36. After that, the parties will be granted what’s known as \"peremptory strikes\" until the pool is whittled to 16.\n\nThat pool will comprise 12 jurors and four alternates that will stand in if any of the 12 must be dismissed mid-trial.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nDrug addiction a common theme in juror interviews\n\nA common theme in the juror interviews so far: Many people have been touched by addiction among family and loved ones.\n\nMultiple people have told the court that someone close to them have struggled with addiction, some becoming emotional in answering the questions and some reporting that they’ve lost someone close to them to addiction.\n\nThat isn’t an automatic disqualifier as most potential jurors have answered that they could remain impartial in evaluating the evidence.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWill Hunter Biden's daughters be at the trial?\n\nHunter Biden's children were not in attendance at the trial on Monday. Hunter Biden and Melissa Cohen Biden have a 4-year-old son, Beau Biden, and he and his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, have three adult daughters: Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden and Maisy Biden.\n\nLunden Roberts, the mother of Hunter Biden's youngest daughter, is expected to provide testimony in the case. It's not clear if she would bring their 5-year-old daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, to the courthouse.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happened to Hunter Biden’s plea deal?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss secured two indictments for gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement in July that aimed to resolve the investigation.\n\nWeiss, as U.S. attorney in Delaware, had investigated Biden for years. Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhich jurors could be selected?\n\nThe court ruled some jurors were qualified after they answered questions about potential hardship in attending the trial, their political work in the past and family members who have suffered addiction.\n\nOthers were quizzed about their local connections and encounters with the Bidens. One potential juror said they worked at the same college as First Lady Jill Biden for a period. He also supported current Superior Court Judge Farris Wharton’s campaign for Delaware Attorney General against Hunter Biden’s brother, Beau, two decades ago. He said those aspects of his life would not challenge his ability to fairly view the evidence in the case and was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n“I’d listen to any testimony with an open mind,” he answered when quizzed about whether he’d be more apt to believe a police officer’s statement if it were in conflict with another person’s.\n\nAnother potential juror was a bartender at Two Stones Pub in New Castle County and said she served a Biden family member there from time to time, but didn’t know him.

Questions include whether potential jurors know anyone involved in the case, along with general inquiries about their thoughts on politics, law enforcement and issues surrounding addiction.\n\nJurors who answer “yes” to one of the screening questions will be further questioned by the judge. Those interviews are occurring now. Out of the first pool of what was scheduled to be 50 potential jurors, only one did not answer \"yes\" to one of the screening questions, meaning this process will likely take a long time.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nPresident Joe Biden supports Hunter as trial begins\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement Monday supporting his son as Hunter Biden’s federal gun trial begins.\n\n“Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,” Joe Biden said. “Hunter’s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.”\n\nJoe Biden said he wouldn’t comment as president on pending federal cases.

The second version of the form was submitted to investigators in 2021 with additional information attached that said Biden submitted his vehicle registration when he bought the gun, which apparently wasn’t the case, according to court statements.\n\nBiden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, sought to question the gun shop owner about the second form, arguing he apparently filled out the form inaccurately, which is the charge against Biden. But prosecutors argued the second form is “irrelevant” and would confuse jurors.

The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense.

In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n2024:Hunter Biden guilty verdict adds to president's distractions ahead of Trump debate\n\nHunter Biden looks to lawyer, wife after verdict announced\n\nHunter Biden pat Abbe Lowell, his lawyer, on the back after his felony conviction was announced.

She also walked the jury through a series of text messages in the days after Hunter Biden bought the gun on Oct. 12, 2018.\n\nA text the next day said he was behind a baseball stadium in Wilmington “waiting on a dealer named Mookie.”\n\nHallie Biden later texted Hunter Biden, stating that she tried calling him “500 times in the past 24 hours.” He eventually responded: “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nHunter Biden called Hallie Biden ‘stupid’ for trashing gun\n\nHallie Biden told the jury she found the gun in Hunter Biden's car 11 days after he bought it. Rather than risk their kids finding it, she put the gun in a leather case and drove to a grocery store, where she threw it into a trash can.\n\n“I realized it was a stupid idea now, but I was just panicking,” Hallie Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden confronted her when he discovered what she had done.\n\n“It’s hard for me to believe anyone is that stupid,” Hunter Biden said in a text. “Do you want me dead?” he asked in a later text.\n\nRetiree found gun in grocery store trash can\n\nAn 80-year-old retiree, Edward Banner, who scavenged trash containers for aluminum cans, found the gun outside Janssen’s Market in Greenville. A state police lieutenant tracked him down and asked whether he’d found anything unusual.\n\n“I definitely remember finding that,” Banner said.\n\nFBI chemist found cocaine residue on Hunter Biden gun pouch\n\nForensic chemist Jason Brewer testified that he found cocaine in the residue on the leather pouch that held Hunter Biden’s gun. Two spots on the pouch had a “minimal amount” of “off-white powder,” which Brewer pointed out in a picture prosecutors projected onto a screen in Biden’s trial on gun charges.\n\n“Cocaine was identified within the residual white particles I sampled,” he told the jury.\n\nHunter Biden trial followed collapse of plea deal for gun and tax charges\n\nA plea agreement that fell apart last July offered the possibility Biden could avoid jail time for all of the charges. Noreika rejected the deal because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about Biden’s protection from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, a special counsel to continue an independent investigation. Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued unsuccessfully the charges should be dismissed because no new evidence had emerged since the plea agreement.\n\nThe gun indictment charged Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver. He was charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he was charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms. The three charges carried a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nThe tax indictment charges Biden with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors. He allegedly engaged in a scheme in which he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed taxes from 2016 through 2019, and also evaded tax assessment for 2018 when he filed false returns.\n\nThe previous agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, which could have resulted in no jail time, and enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied.\n\nBut Republicans blasted the agreement as a sweetheart deal and Hunter Biden became a lightning rod for criticism of his father.\n\nWhere does Hunter Biden live?\n\nHunter Biden lives in southern California.

Proceedings will continue on Tuesday.\n\n– Esteban Parra\n\nHunter Biden embraces his lawyer\n\nAfter Abbe Lowell finished his closing argument, and as the jury was being leaving for a break, Hunter Biden stood and walked over to Lowell and gave him a long embrace.\n\n– Esteban Parra\n\nJury begins deliberation\n\nAfter hearing the remainder of their instructions and taking an oath, the jury is heading back to the jury room to begin deliberating the case.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJurors receive final instructions\n\nJurors will now receive their final instructions before deliberations begin.\n\nIt is possible a verdict could come today, however the court typically adjourns at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nEvidence against Hunter Biden ‘overwhelming,’ prosecutor argues\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines concluded his rebuttal in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges by arguing the evidence for conviction was “overwhelming.”\n\n\"If this evidence did not establish that Hunter Biden is a crack addict or an unlawful user, then nobody is a crack addict or unlawful user,\" Hines told the jury.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor counters claim of cruelty toward Naomi Biden\n\nAfter the defense said prosecutors were “incredibly cruel” in questioning Hunter Biden’s daughter, Naomi, prosecutor Derek Hines countered by arguing the defense called her as a witness.\n\n\"Who called the defendant's daughter as a witness in this case?\" Hines asked the jury.\n\nHe told the jurors to recollect how uncomfortable she was on the stand and the \"anguish\" present when she testified.\n\n\"You know that she was up there completely uncomfortable,\" Hines said. \"She couldn’t vouch for the defendant’s sobriety through the month of October.\"\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor tells jury that 'choices have consequences'\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines rebutted defense lawyer Abbe Lowell’s assertion that prosecutors were attacking Hunter Biden for his addiction.\n\nHad Biden continued to use drugs but not decided to buy a gun, “we wouldn’t be here,” Hines said. “Choices have consequences and that is why we were here.”\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors begin rebuttal statement before case heads to jury\n\nDerek Hines will deliver the final word for the government. He started by rebutting Lowell's assert to the jury that Hunter's life is in their hands.\n\n\"You don't have his life in your hands. You are asked to make a determination of facts and apply the judge's law. That is it, nothing more, nothing less,\" Hines said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nDefense ends closing statement\n\nThere will be a restroom break, and prosecutors will issue the final statements before the jury begins deliberation.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors ‘cruel’ to Hunter Biden’s daughter: Lowell\n\nProsecutors questioned by Hunter Biden was trying to contact his daughter, Naomi, at 2 a.m. when they were both in New York in October 2018.\n\nProsecutors raised the possibility that Hunter Biden was meeting a dealer and asked Naomi Biden if she used cocaine. But defense lawyer Abbe Lowell said prosecutors made no effort to call the drug dealer as a witness.\n\n“That is reasonable doubt and extraordinarily cruel to his daughter,” Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘Hunter deserves those rights’: Abbe Lowell\n\nHunter Biden’s status as son of the president has cut both ways while he faced criminal charges over a gun and taxes.\n\nHouse Republicans blasted a plea agreement that collapsed last July as a sweetheart deal. But defense lawyer Abbe Lowell has argued Biden is being prosecuted more harshly since then.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines opened the trial by telling the jury: “No one is above the law, doesn’t matter what your name is.”\n\nLowell turned the phrase around in his closing argument.\n\n“He missed the point: it means Hunter deserves those rights and protections,” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden ‘incredibly stupid’ trashing gun: Lowell\n\nHunter Biden told his sister-in-law Hallie Biden to call police to report his missing gun after she threw it in a grocery store trash can in 2018, which defense lawyer Abbe Lowell said he wasn’t a danger to public safety.\n\n“On October 23, Hallie Biden did something incredibly stupid,” Lowell said.\n\nLowell quoted one of Hunter Biden’s texts to remedy the situation.\n\n“He said, ‘go inside and get the police,’” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden’s unfamiliarity with guns shows lack of intent to lie, defense lawyer argues\n\nHunter Biden was “killing time” when he bought a revolver in October 2018, spending 16 minutes buying bullets, a speed loader and a BB gun after store employees ran his background check, according to defense lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\nBiden didn’t know anything about guns or bullets, which employees explained to him, Lowell told jurors.\n\nBiden’s behavior showed that he didn’t go into the store “with the intent” to lie on a federal screening form or that he knew he would be prohibited from owning a gun, Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden was using alcohol at ‘critical time’\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell told jurors that Hunter Biden was using alcohol after his August time in rehab, but \"that is not against the law.\"\n\nBiden is charged with lying on a federal screening form when he bought a gun in October 2018 about not using unlawful drugs. But Lowell said drinking isn’t against the law.\n\n\"Kicking crack cocaine is hard. Kicking alcohol much harder,\" Lowell said. \"Even after rehab, he ended up drinking.\"\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nDefense calls leather gun pouch another prosecutorial trick\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell argued that nobody could say when cocaine residue was put on a leather gun pouch that held Hunter Biden’s revolver when his sister-in-law, Hallie Biden, threw it in a grocery store trash can, where it was retrieved by a scavenger.\n\nA chemist for the prosecution found residue of cocaine on the pouch. But Lowell said the “big piece of evidence” represented “suspicion and conjecture” because nobody could say when the residue was put on the pouch.\n\n“You don’t know when the residue was put there,” Lowell said. “You don’t know by whom. You don’t know where it was at the time.”\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nZoe Kestan’s photos show sobriety, Hunter Biden's lawyers say\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell walked the jury though examples of damning photos of drugs and paraphernalia implicating Hunter Biden’s drug addiction in the months leading up to September 2018.\n\nHe then drew their attention to photos from her visit with him that month, which include “no bongs, no other paraphernalia.”\n\nHe noted she was more than willing to spend Hunter Biden's money, introduce him to drug dealers while he was trying to recover in November 2018, was willing to use drugs with him and spent six hours \"rehearsing\" her testimony with prosecutors ahead of trial.\n\n“Once again, the lack of photos can speak more loudly than what was spoken by her under a grant of immunity,” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden defense accused prosecutors of sleight of hand\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell compared the prosecution’s case against Hunter Biden to a magician’s sleight of hand obscuring what happened in late 2018.\n\nLowell noted that Biden hadn’t written about drug use in his memoir after drug rehab in August 2018 or when he bought the gun in October 2018. But Lowell argued prosecutors sought to “squeeze” evidence from 2016, 2017 and early 2018 into the same time frame as the gun purchase.\n\n“Remember what the texts say about (rehab) to the time he bought the gun: nothing,” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers argue that case is built on speculation\n\nHunter Biden’s defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, told jurors that they needed to find he “knowingly” lied about his drug use to convict him but that “suspicion and conjecture” about his actions aren’t enough to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n“The word knowingly cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,” Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor urges conviction despite ‘sympathy’ over drug usage\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise said evidence in trial against Hunter Biden, which included testimony of unlawful drug use, may “provoke sympathy or disgust” but that he was “not charged with being an addict.”\n\n“Lying to buy that gun is a choice and that is why we are here,” Wise said. “He did that knowing exactly what he was doing is beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘Don’t leave common sense behind’: Prosecutor\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise told jurors that it didn’t make sense for Hunter Biden’s defense to argue that his texts to Hallie Biden about waiting for a dealer and smoking crack were a smokescreen for avoiding her.\n\n“He didn’t have to make up this elaborate story about two drug deals,” Wise said. “You don’t leave your common sense behind when you come into the jury box.”\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\n'Can't use a credit card to buy drugs'\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise emphasized what he described as a pattern of cash withdrawals in which Hunter Biden withdrew some $150,000 between October and November.\n\n“You can’t use a credit card to buy drugs, that goes without saying,” Wise said.\n\nDefense attorneys have sought to say Biden was paying for his drug rehab and other things. Wise rebutted this by showing credit card receipts for rehab services.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor pokes holes in Hunter Biden rehab claim\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise argued that a witness contradicted Hunter Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, opened the trial telling jurors that he went to a rehab program in August 2018 and thus didn’t view himself as a drug user.\n\nWise noted the rehab stay was only about a week and then Biden supposedly lived with a sober coach. But Wise emphasized testimony from Zoe Kestan, a former girlfriend of Biden, who said he was smoking crack and had drug paraphernalia in different parts of the house.\n\n“She said it was all over,” Wise told the jury. “There was no sober companion there.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors emphasize Hunter Biden texts\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell has argued that Hunter Biden was not using drugs when he bought a gun in October 2018, but prosecutors contend his texts tell another story.\n\nProsecutors highlighted how Biden sent to messages in the days after buying the gun, with one saying he was waiting for a dealer and another saying he was smoking crack.\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise noted that a Hallie Biden text the same month he bought the gun said she wanted to help him get sober and her testimony stating that included by drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nTestimony about Hunter Biden’s drug use enough to convict, prosecutor argues\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise told the jury in Hunter Biden’s gun trial that the testimony from his former girlfriend, Zoe Kestan, would be enough to convict him on its own.\n\nKestan testified that Hunter Biden smoked crack in Los Angeles in September 2018, weeks before he bought the gun at issue in the trial.\n\n\"You could convict on those facts alone,\" Wise said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor outlines ‘central issue’ in Hunter Biden trial\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise said the “central issue” in the charges against Hunter Biden was whether he knowingly lied on a federal screening form and to a gun dealer about whether he used unlawful drugs when he bought a revolve in 2018.\n\n“He knew he was using drugs and he knew he was addicted to drugs, that is what the evidence showed,” Wise said.\n\nWise added that maybe if he had not been in rehab or had not used drugs weeks before, he could argued that he didn’t know he was an addict.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nFederal firearm form shows what Hunter Biden signed\n\nThe federal screening form that Hunter Biden filled out when he bought a gun in 2018 asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance?\" Biden replied “no.”\n\n\"This is the statement that the evidence proves is false,\" Wise told the jury.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor says evidence is 'ugly' and 'overwhelming'\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise is now reminding the jury of the charges what the law requires for conviction.\n\n\"The central issue in this case was whether the defendant was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances and whether he knew that fact,\" Wise told the jury.\n\nWise said the evidence proves Hunter Biden fit into both of those categories.\n\n\"It was personal and it was ugly and it was overwhelming,\" Wise said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor appears to refer to first lady, Biden family members\n\nIn an apparent reference to first lady Jill Biden and other Biden family members' presence in the courtroom, Wise pointed to the gallery and referenced people jurors might know from the news, saying they don't matter.\n\n“The only evidence in this case is what came from the witness stand and the physical and documentary evidence that has been admitted by Judge Noreika,” Wise said, beginning his closing arguments.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury gets instructions\n\nAs U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika read instructions to the jury, Hunter Biden and his lawyers read along with their copies.\n\nWhen she got to the instruction that Biden didn’t have to testify, the president’s son looked up and surveyed the jurors. He returned to looking at copies when the judge moved to another topic.\n\n– Esteban Para\n\nClosing statements begin in Hunter Biden's gun trial\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise will deliver closing statements for the government.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHow many children does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts.

She will read the rest of the instructions after a lunch break and closing statements.\n\nThe most recent version of the jury instructions that have been made available to the public can be read below.

Defense attorneys have sought to discredit that message by saying Biden was lying to Hallie Biden, the recipient, because he did not want to see her.\n\n“There are messages where the defendant is referencing 7-Eleven both before and after (purchasing) the gun?” Hines asked Jensen, prompting her to confirm.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:The president's son in his own words: Hunter Biden's candor becomes prosecutor's weapon\n\nProsecutors call FBI agent after defense rests\n\nAfter Hunter Biden’s defense rested in his federal gun trial, prosecutors called FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen to rebut the defense case.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines began asking her questions about text messages Biden sent in October 2018, proximate to when he purchased the gun.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:'I am ashamed': Hallie Biden gives emotional testimony on finding Hunter Biden's gun, using drugs\n\nWhat happened to Hunter Biden’s plea deal?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss secured two indictments for gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement in July that aimed to resolve the investigation.\n\nWeiss, as a Donald Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, had investigated Biden for years. Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who is David Weiss?

Lowell said the question asked “are you” a user or addict, which the lawyer argued he wasn’t at the time.\n\nThe form Biden filled out asked if he was “an unlawful user of a controlled substance or addicted to a controlled substance.” Evidence at trial showed pictures of drugs in April 2018 and texts about using drugs in the days after buying the gun.\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss’s team argued in a Monday filing that “a defendant is not entitled to a judicial narrative of his version of the facts.” Prosecutor Derek Hines said Biden hadn’t presented any evidence that he considered himself not addicted.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika must still decide how to instruct the jury.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Hunter Biden do?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies. In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat kind of gun did Hunter Biden buy?\n\nThe gun Hunter Biden purchased and held onto for 11 days in 2018 is a .38 caliber Cold Cobra, known as a 38 special. The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense. The president's son told Delaware State Police he bought it for target practice in 2018.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nJoe Biden says he wouldn’t pardon his son if he is convicted\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he would not pardon his son Hunter Biden, who is on trial for federal gun charges, according to a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nABC anchor David Muir, interviewing President Biden in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, asked whether he would accept the outcome of his son’s trial.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\nMuir also asked if he would rule out a pardon for his son.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nCourt begins with arguments over final jury instructions\n\nThe parties started court early this morning as prosecutors, the defense and the judge discuss minor changes to the jury's final instructions.\n\nThe instructions will help guide jurors on important legal definitions and their final role deciding a verdict.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:Judge sends jury home early in Hunter Biden trial; daughter Naomi Biden testifies\n\nWho is James Biden?\n\nJames Biden was involved in overseas business deals with Hunter Biden that drew the spotlight of House Republicans investigating whether President Joe Biden benefited.\n\nJoe Biden and the White House have dismissed the accusations as baseless partisan attacks. Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is prosecuting Hunter Biden, secured an indictment against an FBI informant, Alexander Smirov, for allegedly lying about Hunter Biden’s involvement in a Ukrainian energy deal.\n\nBut the foreign intrigue isn’t at stake in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. He is charged with lying about his drug use on a federal screening form when he bought the gun in October 2018. Defense lawyer Abbe Lowell said James Biden paid for some of his nephew’s rehabilitation.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Hunter Biden trial includes a web of family members, spouses and exes: Who's who?\n\nWho was Neilia Biden?\n\nHunter Biden’s felony gun trial has brought together several members of the Biden family, with first lady Jill Biden seated each day directly behind the defense table.\n\nThe president's son refers to Jill Biden as \"my mother\" in his memoir of drug addiction, but the Biden family's public story really begins with the tragedy of Joe Biden's first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden.\n\nNeilia, Hunter's biological mother, was killed in a car crash in 1972 at age 30 with her 13-month-old daughter Naomi Christina, known as \"Amy.\"\n\nHunter Biden, who was just three, and his brother Beau, who was four, survived the crash with serious injuries.

In the hours after the verdict, he did not address it on social media, and people in his orbit issued contrasting messages, indicating they hadn't decided on a strategy for handling the guilty verdict.\n\nTrump and Joe Biden are scheduled to face each other for the first time this year in a presidential debate June 27.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSentencing is normally 120 days after the jury reaches a verdict, Judge Maryellen Noreika told the president's son on Tuesday. If that holds true in Hunter Biden's case, it would mean his family would find out how much time he would serve just days before the election.\n\nThe trial in Delaware laid bare graphic details of Hunter Biden’s yearslong struggle with addiction, at times causing Biden family members visible anguish in the courtroom. First lady Jill Biden, who is Hunter's stepmother, watched much of the testimony along with her daughter Ashley Biden and Hunter Biden’s wife Melissa Cohen Biden. After about three hours of deliberation the jury found Hunter Biden guilty on three counts Tuesday.\n\nThroughout the the proceedings, the White House and Biden's campaign team refused to discuss the historic occurrence of the child of a sitting president facing felony criminal charges for the first time, which they called an internal family matter. Within an hour of the verdict, the president issued a statement that expressed his love for Hunter, saying he is “so proud of the man he is today.”\n\n“So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery,” Joe Biden said.\n\nBut ultimately, the president underscored that he must respect the jury’s decision.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” Joe Biden said in his statement. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nThe president stayed away from the courthouse and avoided discussing the trial in public, but it has long been apparent that he is extremely protective of his youngest, and only surviving, son.\n\nJoe Biden halfway through the trial that if convicted, he would not pardon Hunter Biden.\n\nNonetheless, George W. Bush biographer Bill Minutaglio said the airing of Hunter Biden's dirty laundry has gone beyond what other president's children have been subject to, and that must eat at the president.\n\n\"I'm sure that he deeply, deeply cares for Hunter, and it must drive him crazy. It really must cause him a lot of sleepless nights to weigh the political calculus versus the personal calculus,\" Minutaglio said.\n\nThe family put up a united front in the Wilmington courtroom as it has for the unrelated year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Biden family's business dealings by House Republicans.\n\nWhat are Republicans saying about Hunter Biden?\n\nGOP officials largely avoided discussing the Delaware case, with some saying Republican voters were already up in arms about Trump's 34-count felony conviction and they didn't want to change the topic.\n\nHouse Republicans' impeachment inquiry into the president has largely stalled ahead of the election, though Republican leaders wrote to the Justice Department during the trial recommending Biden’s son Hunter and brother James be charged for making false statements to Congress during the investigation.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., who has been the face of that impeachment effort, called the verdict \"a step toward accountability\" but again urged the Justice Department to do its own investigation of Hunter Biden's overseas business.\n\nDuring the trial, Trump himself was asked to address the proceedings during an appearance on Fox News, but he instead pivoted to talk about addiction and his brother Fred Trump Jr., who died of complications from alcoholism.\n\nThat is noticeably different than how Trump acted in the 2020 contest. The former president repeatedly brought up Hunter Biden's business ties to Ukraine, and mocked his past drug abuse.\n\nThe former president's allies also released multiple reactions after the verdict.\n\nKash Patel, Trump's national security adviser, said in a statement that the verdict \"is a rare example of constitutional justice, one not where individuals receive biased treatment based on their last name\" and \"a fleeting moment of justice for all.\"\n\nHe attempted to contrast Hunter Biden's verdict with Trump's, saying in this situation the jury got to view all the evidence, a complaint Trump made in his case that the judge would not allow some evidence to be admitted.\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued an additional statement on Tuesday saying the Hunter Biden trial, “has been nothing more than a distraction” from the “real crimes” being investigated by Congress.\n\n“Crooked Joe Biden’s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on Nov. 5,\" Leavitt said.\n\nDuring their first presidential debate in 2020, Trump called out Hunter Biden for being administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nThe specter of Hunter Biden's legal troubles will likely rise again ahead of Election Day. He faces a second trial in September in California over his failure to pay taxes for several years.\n\nMore than half of Americans said in a Reuters/Ipsos poll last summer that they believe Hunter Biden received favorable treatment from prosecutors because he is the president's son. That includes 75% of Republicans, 42% of independents and 33% of Democrats, the survey showed.\n\nCongressional Republicans made similar claims Tuesday.\n\n\"Timing is everything. This is the veil of fairness in the Justice System under (the president),\" Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMissouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said on X, \"never forget DOJ tried to avoid this trial & verdict by giving Hunter a sweetheart plea deal. Until the judge exposed them.\" The gun case went to trial after a plea deal fell apart in July 2023 that could have resolved gun and taxes charges without prison time.\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict may also muddy waters for Democrats, who as of late have relished in calling Trump a convicted felon. Other progressive allies, however, may use this moment to undercut Trump and Republican claims that there is a two-tiered legal justice system.\n\nWill Hunter Biden's conviction matter to voters?\n\nWhether any of this will have an impact on the election is up for debate.\n\nRepublican thinkers hold varying opinions on how Hunter Biden’s legal woes could play out on the trail, with some suggesting Trump should take a no holds barred approach.\n\n“This takes the gloves off now that these law cases are part of the political system, and it’s perfectly clear now that they ought to be discussing Hunter Biden’s behavior. I do not think this should be left alone,” Jim Gilmore, a former Virginia governor who served in the Trump administration, told USA TODAY.\n\nPolling has shown the president's son isn't the top of mind for most voters, but other gauges show Joe Biden's son is a vulnerability.\n\nAn October 2023 AP-NORC poll found 68% of U.S. adults think Joe Biden acted either unethically or illegally in his son's business dealings. Just 30% said Joe Biden has done nothing wrong regarding Hunter’s business dealings.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican strategist, said it could be wise for Trump to mostly steer clear of talking about his son on the campaign trail.\n\n\"People already want to fire Biden, and where he's going to win the race is giving them a reason to rehire him and this has nothing to do with that,\" he said.\n\nBut Jennings said Hunter Biden's criminal charges could be used as a Republican jab against Biden when he speaks up for gun control or wealthier Americans paying a higher tax rate.\n\nLiz Mair, a Republican political consultant who worked on former Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid, said the multiple Trump statements on Tuesday underscore that the presumptive GOP nominee’s team hasn’t figured out how to talk about this yet.\n\nShe said Trump won’t be able to resist bringing up Hunter Biden on the trail, but that may not win over pivotal voters.\n\n\"The problem is going to be fundamentally that Trump is on the ballot and Hunter isn’t,\" she argued. \"People really don’t care about Hunter as a criminal the way they care about Trump as a criminal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2024/06/11/hunter-biden-guilty-arizona-republicans-celebrate-verdict-in-trial/74059680007/", "title": "Hunter Biden guilty: Arizona Republicans celebrate verdict in trial", "text": "Arizona's GOP members of Congress and other politicians took to social media Tuesday to applaud a jury's guilty conviction of Hunter Biden on federal gun charges weeks after Republicans dismissed former President Donald Trump's 34 guilty counts.\n\nHunter Biden, President Joe Biden's 54-year-old son, could see up to 25 years in prison for the federal charges, including lying about his drug use on a federal form and possessing a gun after lying to a dealer about his drug use.\n\nThe flurry of social media posts from Republicans continue to emphasize accusations that the justice system targets conservatives and Joe Biden is corrupt. While Arizona Democrats were vocal about Trump's conviction, they had a muted response to Tuesday's verdict.\n\nJoe Biden last week said Republicans' post-Trump-trial accusations that the judicial system is biased are dangerous and irresponsible. He added that no one is above the law. On Tuesday, Joe Biden accepted his son's verdict.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, Trump campaign national press secretary, didn't give much attention to the guilty conviction on Tuesday, writing in a statement that the trial has been a distraction from the \"real crimes of the Biden Crime Family.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden’s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on November 5th, and never again will a Biden sell government access for personal profit,\" Leavitt said in a written statement.\n\nTrump made his first public appearance at a packed rally at Dream City Church in northern Phoenix since being found guilty of 34 felony charges in New York last week. He brushed over his trial and criticized the jury's verdict.\n\n“I just went through a rigged trial in New York, with a highly conflicted — and I mean highly conflicted — judge, where there was no crime. It was made up, fabricated stuff,” Trump said Thursday in Phoenix.\n\nHow Arizona Republicans reacted on social media\n\nAbe Hamadeh, a candidate in Arizona's 8th Congressional District, took to the social-media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, to echo Trump's statement. Trump endorsed Hamadeh in December.\n\n\"As a former prosecutor, it's clear to me that Crooked Joe Biden's criminal family has sold out our country for personal gain from Ukraine, China, and Russia. The American people see right through this sham trial as the justice department turns a blind eye to the blatant corruption of the Biden family,\" Hamadeh wrote on X. \"This sham serves as nothing more than a desperate attempt to distract from Biden's weaponized ‘justice’ department targeting President Trump. We must stand strong, fight back, and ensure Biden's corrupt reign ends this November.\"\n\nOne of Hamadeh's rivals in the July 30 primary, Blake Masters, commented on the guilty charges by writing on X: \"Hunter Biden made millions of dollars as an unregistered foreign agent, but the DOJ doesn’t want you focused on that. So they gave him a smaller firearms charge, just so the Democrats can claim 'nobody is above the law' while covering for the Bidens’ corruption.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., continued to criticize Joe Biden, writing on X that the guilty charge could be accountability for alleged crimes by what he called \"the Biden Crime Family.\"\n\nRetiring U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., who was endorsed last week by Trump in her run for the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, echoed Biggs in a post on X celebrating Hunter Biden's verdict.\n\nState Rep.

The White House and Biden family representatives have issued broad denials of such claims of corruption as being false and without merit.\n\nThe eight-count indictment unsealed Monday charges Luft with offenses related to willfully failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, arms trafficking, Iranian sanctions violations and making false statements to federal agents. He was arrested on Feb. 17 in Cyprus based on U.S. charges but subsequently fled after being released on bail while extradition proceedings were pending and remains a fugitive, the Justice Department said in a news release late Monday announcing his indictment.\n\nDamian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Luft \"engaged in multiple, serious criminal schemes.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"He subverted foreign agent registration laws in the United States to seek to promote Chinese policies by acting through a former high-ranking U.S. Government official; he acted as a broker in deals for dangerous weapons and Iranian oil; and he told multiple lies about his crimes to law enforcement,\" Williams said in the Justice Department statement. \"As the charges unsealed today reflect, our Office will continue to work vigorously with our law enforcement partners to detect and hold accountable those who surreptitiously attempt to perpetrate malign foreign influence campaigns here in the United States.”\n\nClaims of being an anti-Biden whistleblower\n\nA longtime energy security analyst who splits his time between Maryland and Israel, Luft has accused Biden family members of bribery and of having received payments from individuals with ties to Chinese military intelligence or energy firms.\n\nLuft, whose Institute for the Analysis of Global Security focuses on energy security, has denied wrongdoing in tweets in which he also claimed the Justice Department case against him is politically motivated.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, one of several prominent Republicans to tout Luft as a whistleblower witness, also suggested in a July 9 tweet that the Justice Department case against Luft is connected to his alleged interest in exposing Biden family corruption.\n\n\"Is DOJ trying to silence Dr. Gal Luft from publicly exposing Biden family corruption?\" asked Johnson, R-Wis., the top Republican on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \"The American people deserve the truth and Dr. Luft must have the chance to testify before Congress.\"\n\nRep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, also has been heavily touting Luft as a potential breakthrough witness with incriminating evidence of corruption against the Bidens. But so far, Comer hasn't revealed specifics.\n\nIn May, Comer was forced to acknowledge that the House committee had lost track of its whistleblower. And three days before the criminal charges were unsealed, Comer told the conservative Newsmax media outfit that Luft was “a very credible witness on Biden family corruption (who) provided incriminating evidence to six officials from the FBI and the DOJ in a meeting in Brussels in March 2019.”\n\n'Multiple, serious criminal schemes'\n\nAccording to the indictment, Luft conspired with others in an effort to act within the United States to advance China's interests without registering as foreign agents.\n\nAs part of this scheme, in part using his role as co-director of the nonprofit think tank, Luft \"agreed to covertly recruit and pay, on behalf of principals based in China,\" a former high-ranking U.S. government official. Those efforts began in 2016 while the former official was an adviser to Trump and continued after Trump was in the White House, to publicly support pro-China policies without telling the Justice Department about their hidden pro-China agenda, the indictment said.\n\nThe Trump adviser is identified only as Individual-1 in the filing. Luft then suggested he was maneuvering to get the Trump adviser into a good political position to help China. \"We do not want to spill all the beans yet, just enough to let ‘people’ know he (i.e., Individual-1) is in the corridor of power to be,\" Luft allegedly said. He also said \"there can be a supremely unique opportunity for China” given their clandestine roles in helping promote pro-Beijing policies in the U.S.\n\nLuft also acted as a broker or middleman to find both buyers and sellers of certain weapons and other materials, without a license to do so as required under U.S. law, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act. That included working to broker a deal for Chinese companies to sell certain weapons to Libya, including anti-tank launchers, grenade launchers, and mortar rounds, which Luft and his associates referred to in coded language as “toys,” according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that Luft worked to broker deals for certain weapons to be sold to the United Arab Emirates, including aerial bombs and rockets, and for certain weapons to be sold by a Chinese company to Kenya, including unmanned aerial \"strike\" vehicles or drones.\n\nAt one point, during a voluntary interview with U.S. law enforcement in which he was asked questions about his involvement in arms trafficking, Luft \"made multiple false statements, including that he had not sought to engage in or profit from arms deals.\"\n\nJustice Department officials also said Luft conspired with others and attempted to broker deals for Iranian oil, directing an associate to refer to it as “Brazilian” oil in an effort to conceal the activity in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Luft also lied about that, the indictment said, making multiple false statements, \"including that he had tried to prevent oil deals with Iran and had not been present during meetings with the Chinese energy company and Iranians.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/13/joe-biden-donald-trump-hunter-biden-convicted-felon/74068598007/", "title": "Biden tagging Trump a 'convicted felon' muddied by son's conviction", "text": "WASHINGTON ― After Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts in his New York hush-money trial last month, President Joe Biden quickly embraced a new label for his successor and presumptive Republican nominee − \"convicted felon.\"\n\n“For the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,” Biden told supporters at a June 3 fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nYet with Tuesday's conviction of Hunter Biden on three gun charges by a federal court jury in Delaware, the same description now applies to the president's son.\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict − a historic first for a child of a sitting president − could complicate the Biden campaign's efforts to use Trump's conviction for falsifying business records against the former president in the 2024 election.\n\nOfficials on Biden's reelection campaign and congressional Democrats have echoed the president calling Trump a \"convicted felon\" and \"convicted criminal.\" But after Tuesday's conviction of Hunter Biden, branding Trump a criminal might invite heightened scrutiny about Biden's family.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA source close to the Biden campaign said it won't shy away from calling Trump a \"convicted felon\" even after Hunter Biden's conviction, insisting Americans know the difference between verdicts for Trump, who is running for president, and Hunter Biden, a private citizen.\n\nBut Republican strategist Scott Jennings said Hunter Biden's guilty verdict could provide Trump an effective counter during his first of two televised debates with Biden on June 27.\n\n\"Especially if Joe Biden goes in on repeatedly calling Donald Trump a convicted felon, trying to get under his skin,\" Jennings said. \"I think Trump could fire back. It might give Joe Biden some pause on how hard he goes at the debate, because he's going to have to deal with a retort.\"\n\nTrump also faces indictments in three other pending cases, two of which are federal, including his handling of classified documents and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. Outcomes for each, however, might not come until after the November election.\n\nRichard Painter, a law professor at University of Minnesota who was chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said he doesn't believe the Hunter Biden case has any relevance on Biden attacking Trump as a convicted felon.\n\n\"Hunter Biden is not running for president,\" Painter said. \"The real problem is that Donald Trump is running for president, and he has serious legal difficulties, and a lot of them have to do with his conduct in office. That directly goes to whether Donald Trump is capable of being a good president for four years.\"\n\nHunter Biden verdict delivers blow to Republicans' argument of 'weaponized' DOJ\n\nUnlike Trump, who has sought to discredit the U.S. judicial system and decried a \"rigged trial\" after his conviction, President Biden said he will accept the outcome of his son's case, respect the judicial process as Hunter Biden considers an appeal and won't pardon him.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday would not say whether Biden would consider commuting Hunter Biden's upcoming sentence, which will come on a later date.\n\nDemocrats seized on the parties' strikingly different reactions to the two cases.\n\n\"The divide here is stunning, and it's a great reminder that one political party remains committed to the rule of law and the other doesn't − it's that simple,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass, said at a congressional hearing Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans' claim of a \"weaponized Justice Department\" orchestrated by the Biden administration and Democrats was undercut by Hunter Biden's guilty verdict. The case was brought by David Weiss, a Trump-appointed Justice Department special counsel, and was overseen by a Trump-appointed judge. Hunter Biden also faces another federal trial starting Sept. 5 in California for allegedly avoiding taxes.\n\nStill, Trump and Republicans responded to Hunter Biden's guilty verdict by calling his conviction on gun charges \"a distraction\" from bigger crimes, pointing to unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden profited as vice president from his son's overseas business dealings.\n\n\"As usual, the only 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' going on around here is on the other side of the aisle,\" McGovern said. \"People are saying that Biden orchestrated the conviction of his own son in order to justify the criminal charges against Trump. That is how you think when you are in a cult.\"\n\nHe added: \"Here's the bottom line: Republicans just can't wrap their heads around the idea that their presidential candidate, your presumptive nominee, is a convicted felon.\"\n\nJulian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University, said he doesn't believe Hunter Biden's guilty verdict handcuffs the Biden campaign from labeling Trump a convicted felon, particularly given Republicans' continued efforts to delegitimize the legal system.\n\n\"I don't think the fact that Hunter Biden was convicted for this complicates the message,\" Zelizer said. \"In some ways, Democrats are hoping it strengthens how Americans see the Democrats being committed to a legal process that many Republicans are essentially questioning.\"\n\nThe first family has stayed loyal publicly to Hunter Biden amid his legal troubles. First lady Jill Biden sat on the front row of a Delaware federal courtroom throughout his trial. \"As I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a Dad,\" President Biden said in his statement after his son's conviction.\n\nAfter giving remarks before a gun control advocacy group in Washington on Tuesday afternoon, Biden altered his schedule to travel to Wilmington, Delaware, where he embraced Hunter Biden with a hug on an airport tarmac.\n\nBiden left Washington on Air Force One Wednesday for Italy, where he is attending a Group of Seven nations summit. The president has not taken questions from reporters about his son's conviction.\n\nZelizer said the enormous media consumption of Hunter Biden's guns case, along with the upcoming tax evasion trial, poses a challenge for the Biden campaign because it risks drawing attention from its argument against Trump and the former president's own legal woes.\n\nAnd even though Hunter Biden's cases don't involve the president, Zelizer said Trump and Republicans \"will try to muddy the waters\" and argue \"somehow this is evidence that the Biden family and President Biden is corrupt.\"\n\n\"So I do think this is something that can hurt Biden and that he needs to figure out how to overcome it,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Phillip Bailey.

The legal snag keeps the case in the news, giving Joe Biden's opponents more ammunition related to the saga orbiting his son.\n\nHere are the important moments to know about Wednesday's hearing.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nJudge questions Hunter Biden plea agreement\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who presided over Wednesday’s hearing, was skeptical from the start and peppered both sides with critical questions.\n\nShe asked prosecutors if the deal meant Hunter Biden would be immune from prosecution for other crimes, such as investigations related to his work with foreign governments. The judge was told it didn’t.\n\nThat's when Hunter Biden’s lawyer stood to say the agreement with the feds was \"null and void,\" which almost blew up the entire situation.\n\nNoreika, a Trump-appointed judge, later asked prosecutors if there was a precedent for such broad immunity in this kind of deal, and she was told there wasn’t. Then she called for a 10-minute recess, and later expressed frustration at how the agreement tied her hands.\n\n\"You all are telling me, 'Just rubber stamp the agreement, Your Honor,’” Noreika told the lawyers.\n\nWhat's going on with the plea deal now?\n\nThe two tax fraud charges carry a maximum of 12 months in prison each, but prosecutors are expected to recommend probation.\n\nHunter Biden also is charged in connection with the purchase of a handgun in 2018, however. In that case, he is accused of lying on a government form that he was not using drugs when he obtained the firearm.\n\nUnder the agreement, prosecutors are offering not to prosecute him as long as he doesn't own a gun and doesn't use illegal drugs for at least two years.\n\nAfter being grilled by Noreika, who questioned if that was part of the tax plea deal, Biden's attorney and prosecutors agreed that the gun diversion agreement is separate.\n\nThe younger Biden's not guilty plea Wednesday will reverse if his attorneys and the federal prosecutors change their agreement − which is expected to take two weeks − to the judge’s satisfaction.\n\nLast-minute filing by GOP lawmaker\n\nA day before Biden's plea hearing, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, submitted a court filing that claimed a member of Biden's legal team lied to the court.\n\nSmith, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which hosted testimony from two IRS investigators last week, has been one of most outspoken lawmakers about the investigation.\n\nThe GOP lawmaker alleged that Biden \"appears to have benefited from political interference.\" He said that the court should consider what the agents told Congress when considering whether to accept the plea deal.\n\n\"Republicans are united in getting to the truth of this investigation and will follow where the facts lead,\" Smith said in a July 19 tweet.\n\nPolitics:Did Hunter Biden get a sweetheart deal? How these cases play out with other defendants\n\nCalls for sanctions against Hunter Biden's legal team\n\nThat last-minute drama caused another problem for Biden's lawyers, who request the judge remove exhibits in Smith's filing they said had sensitive financial information about their client.\n\nSmith's attorneys rejected that argument, saying the information contained in the exhibits is already available in congressional committee records.\n\nAt some point, an attorney employed by a firm that is part of Biden's legal team called the court in Delaware and made it seem as if she worked with Smith's attorneys when she requested the exhibits be taken down, according court records.\n\n\"It appears that the caller misrepresented her identity and who she worked for in an attempt to improperly convince the clerk's office to remove the amicus materials from the docket,\" the judge's order said.\n\nNo Biden family members attended the hearing\n\nPresident Biden has stood by his son during his legal and personal turmoil, saying he is \"very proud\" of his son following Hunter Biden's plea deal.\n\n\"Hunter Biden is a private citizen, and this was a personal matter,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday.\n\nBut as much as the Biden administration and the president's reelection campaign would like the public to move on, they are fully aware of how many voters feel about this situation.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos survey showed half of Americans believe that Hunter Biden is receiving favorable treatment from prosecutors because he is President Joe Biden's son, including 33% of Democrats and 42% of independents.\n\n“I don’t think that it was a good deal for the American public,\" Rep.

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/11/hunter-biden-prosecution-jury-waste-of-taxpayer-dollars/74064113007/", "title": "Hunter Biden prosecution a 'waste of taxpayer dollars': Juror", "text": "After closing arguments in Hunter Biden’s felony gun trial Monday, 12 Delaware jurors received the case with less than an hour to deliberate before taking a break for the night.\n\nThat afternoon, they took a vote on the first charge against the president's son, according to two jurors interviewed in the parking garage of a local hotel after the verdict.\n\n“Believe it or not, it was six to six,” said a 68-year-old Sussex County juror who wished to be referred to as juror 10.\n\nAfter brief deliberation Tuesday morning, the jury quickly returned their unanimous verdict: Guilty on all three counts, rendering Hunter Biden the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\n“We broke it down and heard other peoples’ opinions,” said another juror, a woman who lives near New Castle who did not want to provide her name. “That is what moved me to guilty on all three.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nShe said the group studied the elements of the crimes and definitions included in the jury instructions and talked for about two hours Tuesday morning before rendering their verdicts.\n\n\"We were not that much divided,\" she said. \"We worked together really well.\"\n\nWhat made the prosecution's case?\n\nHunter Biden, 54, was convicted of lying about his drug addiction on a federal form he filled out in October 2018 to purchase a revolver at a Talleyville, Delaware, gun shop and possessing the gun as a drug user.\n\nTo prove that he was either addicted to or an unlawful user of crack cocaine when he purchased and possessed the gun, prosecutors turned to a parade of Hunter Biden’s exes who testified about his drug use, struggles to get sober and the destruction it wrought upon their relationships.\n\nThe government also spent a week presenting text messages showing drug deals, photos depicting drugs, excerpts from his memoir, and cash-withdrawal receipts that they contend show his active addiction from 2016 through 2019.\n\nJuror 10 said that he felt there was no way Hunter Biden could not see himself as a person addicted to drugs when he bought the gun.\n\n“If you are an addict, you are an addict,” he said. “I know personally from people that I know that were drug addicts and alcoholics, this is something that sticks with you for the rest of your life.”\n\n'I am ashamed': Hallie Biden gives emotional testimony on finding Hunter Biden's gun, using drugs\n\nThe jurors said text messages were particularly damning, specifically identifying two that Hunter sent to Hallie Biden the week he bought the gun. In those messages, he said he was waiting for a dealer and smoking crack.\n\n“It did show that he was trying to do drugs,” the New Castle-area juror said.\n\nAbbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s attorney, centered his defense on building a wall around the early October 2018 period, arguing that Hunter Biden was in a failed period of recovery and thus did not knowingly lie when he filled out the gun form. It was somewhat convincing to the New Castle-area juror, but she felt the jury instructions still warranted conviction.\n\n“There did seem to be a break (in drug use), but when you looked at the (legal) definitions, it was apparent he was an ongoing user and an addict,” the New Castle-area juror said. “It was kind of hard to get by that.”\n\nShe said Lowell did the “best he could” considering the text messages.\n\nTrial coverage:Hunter Biden's ex-wife, former girlfriend detail his drug use, battle with sobriety\n\n“He tried to poke holes in it, but he did the best he could with what he had to work with,” she said.\n\nJuror 10 said evidence that prosecutors said showed Hunter Biden was at a 7-Eleven, presumably to buy drugs, was also persuasive. Lowell argued that his client could have been there to buy coffee.\n\n\"I don’t buy that,\" he said.\n\nHeart-wrenching evidence, even for the jurors\n\nThe evidence, particularly Hunter Biden’s text messages with his then-lovers, was, even in the prosecutors’ own words, “personal” and “ugly.” At times, it seemed aimed as much to embarrass as it was to convict. Lowell told jurors it seemed his client was on trial for his addiction.\n\n“Honestly, it was heart-wrenching,” Juror 10 said.\n\nBut some of the most heart-wrenching aspects were brought about by Hunter Biden's lawyers. Juror 10 said he wished the defense would not have called Naomi Biden, Hunter’s eldest daughter, to testify. She was clearly uncomfortable as prosecutors blistered her with questions about text messages seeking to undercut her testimony about her father's sobriety in October 2018.\n\n“That was probably one of the most saddest parts of all,” he said.\n\nThe New Castle-area juror described Naomi Biden’s testimony as emotional, noting her testimony about how her father’s drug use spiraled after the death of his brother, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden.\n\n“She probably just wants her dad to be like he was before his brother died,” the juror said.\n\nTrial coverage:Hunter Biden's daughter closes out week of trial testimony\n\nShe said the personally cutting evidence showing drug addiction far predating the gun purchase was likely prosecutors just trying to get their point across, but added that she wasn’t a “fan of the prosecution.\"\n\n“In my opinion, this was a waste of taxpayer dollars,” she said.\n\nShe said she “didn’t want to find him guilty” because the evidence showed “he needed help.”\n\nBut in the end, she said she deferred to how the evidence spoke to the relevant criminal law as it was set out to the jury by the judge.\n\n“I understand he lied on the federal form,” she said. “But I just wonder why all of this came about, why couldn’t they just fine him?”\n\nIn hearing the case, she wouldn’t have known that prosecutors had once sought to dismiss the gun crimes before they were ever indicted as part of a plea deal involving tax crimes Hunter Biden is set to face trial for later this year. Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected the deal because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about Biden’s protection from future charges.\n\nAfter the verdicts Tuesday, Noreika told the parties that sentencing typically takes place within 120 days and that she’d be in contact to set a date. Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders rarely receive anything close to the maximum sentence.\n\nBoth jurors said they felt prison isn’t appropriate.\n\n“I don’t think anyone who is a non-violent drug addict should be in prison. Just fine him,” the New Castle-area juror said. “We know he did something wrong. He needs help if he hasn’t gotten it yet.”\n\nDeciding the fate of the president's son\n\nHunter Biden has said he has been sober since 2019. And while the trial dealt with intense issues for the president's son, it also put 12 ordinary Delawareans in the unique position of judging the guilt of the president's son and Delaware's most famous statesman − in an election year no less.\n\n“Oh man, I do not want to be here,” the New Castle-area juror said, recounting when she learned the case was about Hunter Biden during jury selection.\n\nJuror 10 has lived in Delaware for as long as Joe Biden's political career. And as ubiquitous as Biden drama is in the gossip of Delawareans, he said he was shocked by some things he learned at trial.\n\n\"I don’t watch a whole lot of news. I watch Netflix and stuff. Too much stuff on the news you don’t really want to hear,\" he said. \"I didn’t know Hunter Biden's addiction was that bad. I kind of felt sorry for him.\"\n\nTrial coverage:How a General Motors retiree picking trash in Delaware was thrust into Hunter Biden trial\n\nHe also said he was \"shocked\" to hear that Beau Biden's widow, Hallie Biden, had developed a romantic relationship with Hunter Biden after Beau's death and began using drugs as well.\n\n\"That was tough,\" he said.\n\nThe trial was a family affair on both the witness stand and in the courtroom gallery where first lady Jill Biden and other members of the Biden family looked on during most of the proceeding. Juror 10 said he felt sorry for Jill Biden.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure she heard things she's never heard before,\" he said.\n\nThe New Castle-area juror said she noticed the first lady's presence in court.\n\n“I noticed her and her hair,” she said with a smile.\n\nThe juror said she feared the deliberation might take a political tone.\n\n“I was expecting all of us to be at each other’s throats because you know, of who his father is and how the political climate is in this country,” she said.\n\nBut that was not the case, both jurors emphasized.\n\n\"Politics played no part in this whatsoever,\" Juror 10 said. \"We just went by the evidence.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}]}

For the latest news on the weather, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Feb. 6.\n\nSAN DIEGO − The tail end of a powerful atmospheric river storm that knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of California homes and businesses was deluging the state Monday with more heavy rain, mudslides, flooding, and several feet of snow in the mountains.\n\nThe brunt of the storm's fury Monday centered on the Los Angeles area, where 1.4 million people were under a flash flood warning – including the Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills. A local state of emergency was issued for the city of Los Angeles by Mayor Karen Bass on Monday afternoon.\n\nAcross Southern California, the heavy winds that blasted the region Sunday were diminishing, but the National Weather Service warned that an unstable weather pattern could generate waterspouts or small tornadoes.\n\nFlash flooding \"is a much greater threat than any weak tornado that the storm may spawn,\" the weather service said, and dangerous flooding was likely across much of the region from the atmospheric river − the equivalent of a river in the sky that is responsible for extreme rain and snow in the West.\n\nAdditional rainfall totals of 5-8 inches were forecast in some areas, which would bring 48-hour totals as high as 14 inches for some locations, the weather service said. A state of emergency was declared in eight Southern California counties.\n\n\"Life-threatening conditions may evolve extremely fast in some communities,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski warned.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A debris flow caused significant damage to about five homes in Beverly Hills on Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Although no one was trapped, about 10 people have been displaced, the LAFD said.\n\n∎ The Los Angeles Fire Department reported that 1,000 firefighters were responding to 49 mudslides and debris flows, 130 reports of flooding, half a dozen structure fires and other rescues of motorists stranded in vehicles.\n\n∎ Los Angeles recorded more than 4 inches of rain Sunday, breaking the record for the day by more than an inch. It was the most rain in one day in more than 20 years, and surpassed the average for the month of February.\n\n∎ The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro Am golf tournament in Monterey County, which had postponed Sunday's final round to Monday, canceled play Monday and declared Wyndham Clark the winner despite playing only 54 holes of the scheduled 72-hole tournament.\n\n∎ Officials have attributed three deaths to the storm. In Yuba City, 40 miles north of Sacramento, a man was killed when a redwood tree toppled on him in high winds, police said. Two other men were killed by fallen trees Sunday in Carmichael, a suburb of Sacramento, and in Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County.\n\nSan Diego residents advised to remain vigilant\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria issued an evacuation warning for low-lying, flood-prone areas that were battered by heavy rains last week and flooded out two weeks ago. Some areas outside the city saw up to 7 inches of rain in the last two days.\n\n\"I understand the weariness that must come from these repeated warnings,\" Gloria said. \"I recognize that fatigue may be settling in. But I can assure you this decision to issue this warning is not taken lightly. I ask that everyone remain prepared and vigilant.\"\n\nA flood advisory was issued for the entire county coastline and will be in effect until 8 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service. A flood watch for the county will be in effect until Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Gloria's office, nearly 160 households were referred for temporary placement in hotel rooms.\n\nSanta Barbara cancels evacuation orders\n\nEvacuation orders for Santa Barbara County were canceled Monday after the worst of the storm hit the area overnight.\n\nOfficials had made an early recommendation to close schools in preparation for dangerous conditions, according to Camilla Barnwell, director of communications for the Santa Barbara County Education Office. The office said most schools across the county will reopen Tuesday.\n\n\"One or two schools had some debris that needed to be removed,\" Barnwell told USA TODAY. \"The storm just barely lifted yesterday evening so they were out on campuses today assessing the damage... heavy trees coming down, maybe one school (had) some power issues.\"\n\n'Non-stop rain' in Los Angeles as shelters aid city's homeless population\n\nBetween 5 and 10 inches of rain had fallen in the Los Angeles area with more expected, according to the National Weather Service. Dave Bruno, a meteorologist with the weather service in Los Angeles, said Monday was the third wettest two-day period on record in downtown.\n\nShelters were adding beds for the city’s homeless population of nearly 75,000 people.\n\nGeorgia Berkovich, chief communications officer of The Midnight Mission, said there has been \"non-stop rain.\" She added that The Midnight Mission, which is a Los Angeles-based human service organization, has opened its dining room for shelter and provides resources to people, including hot meals and 24-hour restrooms.\n\nAbout 100 people came to The Midnight Mission \"just to get out of the element,\" Berkovich told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Once your clothes are wet it’s over. People are freezing to their core,\" she said. \"So strange in LA we have this great climate but people die of exposure, die on our streets all the time.\"\n\nStorm by the numbers\n\n∎ A rough calculation estimates that 5.6 trillion gallons of water has fallen across California the past two days, according to FOX Weather meteorologist Greg Diamond.\n\n∎ AccuWeather estimates the preliminary total damage and economic loss from the intense storms and record rainfall in California this week will be between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\n∎ The 11.87 inches that fell in 24 hours at UCLA’s weather station was a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event. Technically known as a \"1,000-year recurrence interval event,\" according to meteorologist Jacob Feuerstein, a 1-in-1,000-year rain event is a statistical way of expressing the probability of such a huge rainfall occurring in any given year in a given location, according to NOAA.\n\nMud flows through multimillion-dollar homes\n\nSeveral multimillion dollar houses in the Hollywood Hills were damaged as mud, rocks and debris oozed and rolled through the area Monday. Sixteen people were evacuated, city officials said.\n\n“I can’t believe it,\" Keki Mingus of Studio City, California, said, as water rushed down her road around dawn on Monday. \"It looks like a river that’s been here for years. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\n\nWind, snow hammer Mammoth Mountain\n\nThe storm unleashed howling winds and huge snow totals in the mountains. The National Weather Service recorded a wind gust of 125 mph at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area late Sunday. That same location received a storm total of 39 inches as of Monday morning.\n\nWhere is the storm headed next?\n\nAfter battering California on Monday, the storm's moisture will help fuel heavy snow across the West, and heavy rain in the normally arid Desert Southwest over the next few days, forecasters said. \"Rainfall totals generally between 1-3 inches may lead to some scattered instances of flash flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nFlood watches were in effect throughout portions of southern Arizona and southern Nevada because of the threat of heavy rain and flooding.\n\nClimate change, El Nino conspire to fuel storms\n\nMultiple weather and climate phenomena are conspiring to make these storms particularly damaging. Warm water provides energy to storms, and record-high ocean water temperatures, likely from climate change, are being detected around the world. Additionally, the Pacific Ocean is also seeing the effects of El Nino, where weakening trade winds reduce the upwelling of ocean waters and allow surface waters to bake in the sun and grow warmer still. And California, coming off years of drought and wildfires, is particularly vulnerable to mudslides and flooding.\n\n\"The atmospheric river firehose is aimed at Los Angeles,\" tweeted meteorologist Ryan Maue. \"The onslaught has just begun from this treacherous bomb cyclone.\"\n\n102-mph wind gust recorded in San Francisco Bay area\n\nIn Northern California, the storm swamped streets and toppled trees and power lines across the San Francisco Bay area. A rare hurricane-force wind warning had been posted for the area, and winds exceeded 60 mph with wind gusts recorded as high as 102 mph in Marin County − the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nIn nearby San Jose, first responders went door-to-door warning residents of the flood threat and removing unhoused people from riverbeds. They pulled travelers out of the windows of a car stranded by floodwaters and rescued several people and dogs from an island in the Guadalupe River as it became overwhelmed by high waters.\n\nUnited States Weather Alerts\n\nStorm is second to blast state in days\n\nThe storm slammed California just days after much of the state was soaked with up to 6 inches of rain by the first storm in the \"Pineapple Express,\" so-called because moisture builds up in the tropical Pacific around Hawaii and can roll across the ocean and pound the U.S. and Canada's west coasts with heavy rainfall and snow. The current storm is packing more moisture and overwhelming already-saturated regions.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's office said the state had a record number of emergency assets responding to the \"serious storm with dangerous and potentially life-threatening impacts.\" Those impacts included almost 600,000 homes and businesses without power Monday.\n\nLife-threatening flood threat:Heavy rain and powerful winds clobber California\n\nLandslide hits Hollywood Hills\n\nIn the Hollywood Hills the weather serviced warned Monday of an \"extremely dangerous situation unfolding\" with life threatening landslides and flash flooding. Several families had to evacuate when a mudslide caused a gas leak. A neighborhood in Studio City was forced to evacuate after a slide severely damaged multiple homes. In suburban Tarzana, three homes were swamped by debris flow with firefighters aiding the evacuation of residents.\n\nFlooding and small mudslides were also reported across Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Malibu and Beverly Hills.\n\n“Life-threatening flash flooding is ongoing and will continue into the morning hours of Monday,” the weather service said.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath urged residents near wildfire burn areas of Topanga and Soledad canyons to get out ahead of possible mudslides. The county set up shelters for evacuees.\n\n“If you have not already left, please gather your family, your pets, your medications and leave immediately,” Horvath said at a Sunday briefing.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/01/09/winter-storm-snow-rain-floods-tornado-live-updates/72157053007/", "title": "Winter storm live updates: Tornadoes and snow hits across the U.S.", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of weather news from Tuesday, Jan. 9. For the latest news, follow our live updates on the weather forecast for Wednesday, Jan. 10.\n\nA blockbuster storm with heavy rain and powerful winds sparked tornadoes across the South on Tuesday − ripping roofs off buildings, toppling trees and blowing over RVs − after the system roared across the Midwest with blizzard conditions en route to the Northeast.\n\nAt least four people were killed in areas of the South hit hard by rain, wind and suspected tornadoes, and several people were reported injured in Florida.\n\nAcross the central U.S., the storm shut down major highways as it pummeled the region with whiteout conditions and packed roadways with snow. On Monday and through early Tuesday, Kansas Highway Patrol responded to over 100 vehicle crashes, 19 of which resulted in injuries. In Boise City, Oklahoma, the emergency management department said it responded to calls reporting several stranded motorists and said all roads were closed.\n\nMany schools and government buildings were closed in Florida. Some schools in parts of Virginia and Maryland also planned early dismissals. Airports across the Midwest and Southeast reported a surge of delays and cancellations Tuesday morning.\n\nIn the Southeast, the National Weather Service confirmed at least three tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, where wind gusts as high as 106 mph were reported. A thunderstorm over southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia had winds recorded at speeds of 70 mph and hail the size of baseballs, according to the weather service.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 49 of the state's 67 counties.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northeast was preparing for heavy rainfall just days after the region was hammered over the weekend by a significant snowstorm that dropped up to 22 inches of snow in New England. As the storm moves toward the Northeast later Tuesday and rain begins to fall over snow-covered areas, the potential for flooding will be widespread, especially along low-lying areas, swollen creeks and streams.\n\nThe weather service forecasts 1 to 3 inches of rain for New England by nightfall Tuesday. Much of the coast is under wind and flood advisories as gusts of 50 mph are anticipated.\n\nA flood warning for the nation’s capital was in effect Tuesday evening as river gauges indicated some spots, especially urban areas, were already flooding. Parts of Washington D.C., central Maryland, and northern Virginia could flood Tuesday night, the weather service warned, as up to 2.5 inches of rain had already fallen with another 1.5 inches possible.\n\nThe intensifying storm around the D.C. area stranded multiple vehicles in rising water Tuesday night as Prince George’s County Fire and EMS Department in Maryland said seven people were rescued from their vehicles. No injuries were reported.\n\nNew York City was under a flood watch through Wednesday morning as the weather service warned of “widespread urban and poor drainage flooding.\" Parts of southeast New York, including Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx could get 2 to 3 inches of rain, an advisory said, with potential for flash flooding and localized higher rainfall.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Federal Aviation Administration announced ground stops at the Orlando International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Tuesday afternoon due to the hazardous weather. Over 21,000 flights across the country were delayed Tuesday and about 2,000 were canceled, according to FlightAware.\n\n∎ More than 810,000 utility customers across the nation were without power Tuesday evening, including about 175,000 in North Carolina, 126,000 in Pennsylvania and nearly 80,000 in New York.\n\n∎ The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee, Florida, is planning to send out three tornado survey teams on Wednesday — to examine suspected tornado damage in Walton, Bay. and Jackson counties — and two more on Thursday — to look at Houston County, Alabama, and Calhoun County, Georgia.\n\nRead:2023 was Earth's hottest year, experts say.\n\n4 killed as storms rage across the South\n\nAuthorities said the storm system caused at least four deaths in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina on Tuesday.\n\nOne person was killed and four people were injured in Claremont, North Carolina when a storm went through Catawba County, damaging multiple homes in a mobile home park, Catawba County spokesperson Amy McCauley told USA TODAY. About 30 people were displaced by the storm, she said, and the American Red Cross was assisting with shelter efforts.\n\nMcCauley said the National Weather Service is evaluating whether the storm was a tornado.\n\nPolice in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, say a man died during heavy rain when a tree fell on his car on a state highway in Jonesboro.\n\nOne person in Birmingham, Alabama, died when a tree fell on a vehicle, Birmingham Fire and Rescue Capt. Orlando Reynolds said Tuesday, CNN reported.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman died in Cottonwood, Alabama, after an apparent tornado touched down around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Houston County Coroner Robert Byrd confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nCharlotte Paschal's mobile home was picked up by the storm and \"rolled\" three to four times, Byrd said.\n\nWDHN reported the city was on lockdown after the storm inflicted extensive damage, including to the town hall. Residents were trapped in their homes and had to be rescued earlier Tuesday, the outlet reported.\n\n\"The town of Cottonwood is basically destroyed,” Cottonwood Director of Public Safety Jim Smith told WDHN.\n\nMore wild weather is on the horizon\n\nThe deadly storm raking the entire eastern U.S. Tuesday is the opening act for what's to come over the next week: A potential \"bomb cyclone\" blizzard for the Midwest, an arctic blast courtesy of the Polar Vortex, and possibly the first real East Coast snowstorm in years.\n\n\"The atmosphere is making up for lost time in terms of wintry conditions and snow following a relatively mild and snowless start to the season,\" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.\n\nSnow is likely to pile up in several big Midwestern cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and Kansas City. As much as one to two feet of snow is possible in some areas, AccuWeather said. And just like Tuesday's storm, more severe thunderstorms are forecast to rumble across the South and Southeast, the Storm Prediction Center warned.\n\n\"Strong thunderstorm development is possible Thursday night across parts of central and eastern Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley, where storms may increasingly pose a risk for severe hail, wind and tornadoes prior to daybreak Friday,\" the prediction center said.\n\nA polar vortex is just the beginning:January's weather forecast is chaotic and dangerous\n\nIowa roads and towns are blanketed in snow\n\nTrisch Hoelting shoveled out her driveway and the sidewalks surrounding her home in Bettendorf, Iowa, three times as heavy snow fell Tuesday morning and intensified into the afternoon hours.\n\nAt about 1 p.m., local time, the wind began picking up and Hoelting, a 62-year-old saleswoman for an HVAC contracting company, said the snow started to fall sideways. Hoelting said drivers were told to stay home and off the roads, which by 10 a.m. were blanketed by snow.\n\nForecasters expect areas throughout Iowa and the Midwest to receive snow totals well into the double digits by day’s end. Davenport, the city just west of Bettendorf, had 8.2 inches of snow by noon, according to the weather service.\n\nRoads across the Midwest from Des Moines, to eastern Nebraska, northern Kansas City and northwestern Illinois were completely covered in snow Tuesday. Iowa's Department of Transportation sent about 700 snowplows out to try and clear the roads.\n\nHoelting’s daughter, a local school teacher, stayed home as the public school district canceled classes for the day.\n\n“This is the worst storm this season – by far,” she said.\n\n'God spared me': Tornado rips through Marianna, Florida\n\nDoris Leona Peacock was awakened Tuesday morning by what sounded like shingles being ripped off her house.\n\nAs she rushed out of bed, she saw her power was out. She corralled her two dogs – Marley and Blue – in the hallway, where she sat with them after closing all the doors inside her home.\n\n“We just had the walls between us,” Peacock, 75, told USA TODAY. “I could still hear that wind.”\n\nWhat Peacock didn’t know was that a tornado had ripped through Marianna, a city of about 6,200 hundred people between Panama City and Tallahassee, leaving widespread damage it its wake. It was one of at least three tornadoes that formed throughout the Florida Panhandle early Tuesday.\n\nWhile she was huddled with her dogs, Peacock’s son, who lives about 10 miles away, called her and said a tree had crashed through his living room window, and that, luckily, no one in the house was hurt. Two of his campers were destroyed; one had been tossed into his neighbor's yard.\n\nAround 9 a.m., Peacock ventured outside. Some of the facade was torn off her home and her chain-link fence was bent. A tree had fallen over a nearby power line and debris was littered across the street.\n\nHer street was largely spared. But just a short walk away is Arrowhead Campsites, where entire RVs and campers were flattened. AccuWeather posted aerial footage on social media of extensive damage to buildings and vehicles in Marianna.\n\nRamsey Romero, a spokesperson for the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, said no deaths have been reported and seven people with minor injuries were taken to nearby hospitals as of the early afternoon hours. Deputies were continuing to search through the wreckage of various RV parks and residential areas that were demolished by the storm.\n\n“I'm more than blessed … God spared me,” said Peacock, a retired nurse.\n\nAt least three tornadoes hit northern Florida\n\nSeveral tornadoes were reported throughout Florida’s Panhandle on Tuesday morning as a powerful squall line capable of producing of 70-80 mph wind gusts made its way over the area, knocking out power across the region, including in Tallahassee, the state capital.\n\nThe weather service first reported a tornado 11 miles southeast of De Funiak Springs, between Pensacola and Tallahassee, moving northeast at 55 mph. The storm was accompanied by quarter-size hail.\n\nJust before 7 a.m. a \"large and extremely dangerous tornado\" was located near Panama City, according to the weather service. It was moving northeast at 55 mph. Photos circulating on social media showed damage to multiple homes throughout the small beachfront community.\n\nA half hour later, the National Weather Service in Tallahassee reported a tornado had crossed over the multi-state-spanning Interstate 10, southeast of Marianna.\n\nA storm chaser later shared a video on X of an overturned semi-trailer on the interstate.

If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move to higher ground. Do not wait to be told to move.\n\nIf time allows, prepare your home for a flood by moving essential items to an upper floor, bring in outdoor furniture, disconnect electrical appliances and be prepared to turn off the gas, electricity and water.\n\nDo not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.\n\nDo not drive into flooded areas. If floodwaters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely. You and the vehicle can be quickly swept away.\n\nHave several ways to get emergency information. Examples include NOAA Weather Radio, CodeRED notifications, Wireless Emergency Alerts for mobile devices and others. Make sure your devices have back up batteries and extra chargers.\n\nIf a high wind or tornado warning is issued for your area, get indoors to a pre-designated shelter area such as a basement, storm cellar or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors and outside walls.\n\nAt least 14 dead in Florida after Ian's destruction\n\nIan hammered Florida with heavy rains and powerful winds, leaving a rising death toll and thousands of residents desperately seeking rescue from the effects of one of the most devastating storms in U.S. history.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the storm caused a \"500-year flooding event\" and said Coast Guard helicopters were plucking trapped residents from the roofs of homes. Communities across the state were or will be swamped by the overwhelming waters, he said.\n\n\"The impacts of this storm are historic and the damage that has been done is historic,\" DeSantis said. \"We've never seen a flood event like this, we've never seen a storm surge of this magnitude.\"\n\nAt least 14 people were reported dead in counties across the state, a number that's expected to rise substantially.

Sixteen people were evacuated and several homes near the Hollywood Hills were red-tagged.\n\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said 1,000 firefighters had dealt with more than 100 reports of flooding and rescues of motorists stranded in vehicles on inundated roadways. Shelters added beds for the city’s homeless population of nearly 75,000 people.\n\nAccuWeather estimated that the state's preliminary total damage and economic loss will be between $9 billion and $11 billion.\n\nThe 11.87 inches that fell in a 24-hour span on Monday was a 1-in-1,000 year rainfall event, according to the weather station at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nStorm to bring heavy rain to Las Vegas, Phoenix\n\nAreas of Arizona and Nevada were under flood warnings on Tuesday as the slow-moving storm moved East from California.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, the storm posed a risk of flash floods, including across major cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix. Forecasters anticipate the heaviest rain to hit Las Vegas Tuesday afternoon, while Phoenix residents will feel the most intense impacts overnight and into Wednesday.\n\n\"While even a quick downpour can lead to street and highway flooding in the region, the heaviest rain, from 1-2 inches, is most likely to occur on the south- and southwest-facing mountainsides in Arizona,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Adam Douty said.\n\nNorthern Arizona was forecast to receive significant snowfall, reported the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network.

The group took partial control of a system that regulates water pressure — and one that includes technology manufactured in Israel, according to water authority board chairman Matthew Mottes.\n\n\"This is very direct. It's using the internet as a weapon,\" said Max Kilger, a cyber security professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio who has closely followed the news surrounding the Pennsylvania case.\n\nThe water pressure system, which uses a Unitronics computing device, was quickly disabled after an alarm notified workers of the threat, and crews were able to maintain water pressure along the line, according to Mottes.\n\nAcross the country, the federal government is investigating a handful of other facilities hacked by the Iranian group, two people who were granted anonymity to discuss details that had not yet been made public told Politico.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, hackers who took control of the Aliquippa water pressure system announced they were targeting technology made in Israel, Politico reported. Photos from the site of the cyber attack published by Politico show hackers displayed an on-screen message saying, \"Every equipment ‘Made in Israel’ is Cyber Av3ngers legal target,\" referring to Unitronics, an Israeli supplier of control and valve systems.\n\nThe attack in Pennsylvania thankfully did not impact \"more critical components\" that determine the amount of chemicals added to the water supply, Kilger sad.\n\n\"There's that much more potential for harm. So this should be a wake-up call,\" he said, adding that the pump system computing device was \"low-hanging fruit.\"\n\n\"Attacks on our critical infrastructure like water are unacceptable,\" U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio said following the incident, urging bipartisan support for \"shoring up America's defenses\" against cyber criminals.\n\nManagement at the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa was not able to be reached for contact.\n\nAliquippa has a population of about 9,200.\n\nWhat is Cyber Av3ngers?\n\nThe cyber criminal group Cyber Av3ngers has targeted several water utility facilities in Israel, including most recently following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nNow, it appears the group's most recent round of cyber attacks are targeting Israeli water infrastructure technology at U.S. facilities, Kilger said.\n\n\"They've been around for a while, but these are sort of their recent attacks,\" Kilger said, adding that group is probably \"trying to find other water systems that have equipment coming from Unitronics.\"\n\nThe group is able to locate facilities in the U.S. that use Unitronics computing devices by hunting for and identifying online data that's specific to that brand, according to Kilger.\n\nIn an online forum on the Unitronics website, at least two users reported similar incidents involving Unitronics technology, with one user posting a photo of an on-screen message matching the one found at the Pennsylvania facility.\n\nUnitronics did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhat motivates cyber criminals?\n\nIn the case of Cyber Av3ngers, the group is clearly motivated by the Israel-Hamas war that broke out last month, Kilger said. The Iranian government, which the group is believed to be tied to, has long sided with Hamas in conflicts involving Israel, acting in opposition to the U.S.\n\nMore broadly, Kilger said cyber criminals' motivations fall into six different areas:\n\nMoney\n\nEgo\n\nEntertainment\n\nPolitical cause\n\nEntrance to a social group\n\nStatus\n\n\"This one is very definitely cause,\" Kilger said, referring to the group's message that it intends to target equipment made in Israel.\n\nAround the world, critical infrastructure is an \"obvious\" target for all hackers who want to disrupt and negatively impact physical processes people depend on, said Charles Henderson, IBM's global head of security threat research.\n\n\"Criminals first, then nation-states start asking, 'What can I do that has a real-world impact, that has the most dramatic effect?'\" he said.\n\nIn 2021, the Colonial Pipeline was believed to have been the victim of criminal hackers, causing fuel-related panic along the East Coast, which is served by the pipeline.\n\nOther water authorities respond to Aliquippa hack\n\nThis week, authorities in Morgantown, West Virginia, responded to concerns about the security of their water systems, saying they do not use the same technology targeted in Aliquippa, located about 90 miles north.\n\nIn Texas, forensic investigators are looking into a Tuesday attack against North Texas Municipal Water District.\n\nRansomware group Daixin Team claimed responsibility for the attack, the Dallas Morning News reported. Water service wasn't disrupted for the district's more than 2 million customers, the outlet said.\n\nConsumer in the U.S. shouldn't be overly worried, Henderson said, because \"there are a lot of people in the world who work very diligently\" in the realm of cyber security, and are constantly strengthening defenses.\n\nContributing: Chrissy Suttles, Beaver County Times", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/politics/alleged-russian-hackers-indicted/index.html", "title": "4 Russian government operatives indicted for hacking global energy ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States has indicted four Russian men, including three Russian intelligence officers, for alleged hacking campaigns that targeted hundreds of energy companies around the world from 2012 to 2018, the US Justice Department said Thursday.\n\nThe indictments cover activity from years ago but underscore Russian hacking capabilities against critical infrastructure at a time when US officials are on high alert for Russian cyberattacks and as President Joe Biden meets with European allies over Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nBiden on Monday publicly warned US business executives that Kremlin-linked hackers could target US organizations as the Russian military continues to suffer heavy losses in Ukraine. The FBI also advised the private sector last week that hackers associated with Russian internet addresses have been scanning the networks of five US energy companies in a possible prelude to hacking attempts. There are no known compromises from that recent activity.\n\nBut the new Justice Department charges point to Russia’s hacking prowess and showcase the type of activity the US government is concerned about in light of tensions over Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nIn one indictment unsealed Thursday, three officers at Russia’s FSB intelligence agency are accused of hacking into energy firms, including some in the US, from 2012 to 2017 “in furtherance of the Russian government’s efforts to maintain surreptitious” access to organizations in the energy sector, the Justice Department said. US officials have expressed concern that Russian operatives could use that type of access to disrupt US critical infrastructure firms if Moscow had the incentive to.\n\nIn the other indictment, an employee of a Russian Ministry of Defense research institute is accused of helping hack into a petrochemical facility in Saudi Arabia in 2017 and causing it to shut down twice. That hacking incident caused alarm in the cybersecurity industry at the time because the malicious code used in the incident targeted safety systems that prevent explosions in power plants.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll four of the indicted men are believed to be in Russia.\n\n“In these two cases, we’ve determined that the benefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future,” a senior Justice Department official said. “These charges show the dark art of the possible when it comes to critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe three FSB officers are accused of being part of a hacking group that targeted numerous energy firms in the US and abroad from 2012 to 2017, including the computer network of a corporation that runs a power plant in Kansas.\n\n“Although this (hacking) group is not associated with any known, deliberate disruptive event, today’s indictment and previous research shows how extensively this group operated to breach critical systems globally,” Joe Slowik, senior manager at cybersecurity firm Gigamon, told CNN. “In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this activity becomes especially concerning as potential footholds for future destructive events.”\n\nBefore the 2020 US election, the hacking group breached certain state and local government organizations, but the activity did not affect voting in any way.\n\nThe other Russian hacking group referenced by Thursday’s news, which was involved in the 2017 shutdown of the facility in Saudi Arabia, subsequently attempted to breach the computers of a US firm “that managed similar critical infrastructure entities in the United States,” the Justice Department said in a news release. That hacking attempt was unsuccessful, the senior Justice Department official told reporters Thursday.\n\nIn December, the same hacking group probed the computer networks of US electric utilities that operate liquefied natural gas facilities, CNN previously reported.\n\nUS officials have briefed firms from the US energy and financial sectors, among others, extensively on Russian hacking capabilities in recent months, and many big firms have invested heavily in cyber defenses in recent years.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and background.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/10/14/mercyone-hospital-parent-company-confirms-ransomware-attack-led-to-outages/69562995007/", "title": "MercyOne hospital's parent company confirms ransomware attack", "text": "One of the largest hospital chains in the country has confirmed a ransomware attack has caused hospital-wide outages across multiple health systems this month, including facilities in Iowa.\n\nCertain systems, including online patient portals and electronic health records, have been taken offline for more than a week at MercyOne facilities following the cybersecurity breach at CommonSpirit Health. Other hospitals across the country, including those in Nebraska, Tennessee and Washington, are also facing disruptions.\n\nCommonSpirit, the Chicago-based nonprofit health care system that operates 140 hospitals in 21 states, said in a statement it took \"immediate steps\" to protect its systems and contain the incident once the ransomware attack was detected. Officials said they notified law enforcement and have engaged with \"leading cybersecurity specialists.\"\n\n\"We continue to conduct a thorough forensics investigation and review of our systems and will also seek to determine if there are any data impacts as part of that process,\" the statement said.\n\nMore:3-year-old given too much pain medication after cyberattack shut down MercyOne computers, parents say\n\nMercyOne Central Iowa region officials said in a statement that information systems were affected as part of the cyberattack on CommonSpirit Health, but declined to offer more details.\n\nIt's unclear whether ransomware successfully invaded MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center's computer systems and other affiliated care sites, which have been offline since Oct. 3. Officials would only say last week that systems were taken offline \"as a precautionary step.\"\n\nHealth care providers are required by law to notify the federal Department of Health and Human Services if a breach has compromised the private information of 500 or more patients.\n\nIt's unclear how many hospitals invaded by ransomware\n\nRansomware is software used by hackers to steal data and encrypt an organization's computer systems, blocking access until the hackers' demands for a ransom fee are met. These cyber criminals can be inside an organization's network for weeks, or even months, before they strike.\n\nCommonHealth Spirit did not provide details on the number of facilities within its chain that were hit by the attack.\n\nIn some cases, organizations are able to detect the malicious software before it encrypts is systems. However, in CommonSpirit's case, it's more likely that ransomware had already attacked its system, said Brett Callow, a threat analyst with Emsisoft, a cybersecurity provider.\n\n\"My guess would be based on amount of time systems have been out of action, there actually was some encryption,\" he said. \"But that's a guess.\"\n\nResponding to ransomware is a complex and time-consuming process, and it can often take health care systems weeks to fully recover. However, in the past, hospitals have been able to bring their most important systems back online \"fairly quickly,\" Callow said.\n\n\"But what happened in the past can't necessarily be assumed to happen in future incidents,\" he said.\n\nMore details emerging on other impacts to patient care\n\nOther Iowa-based hospitals affected include CHI Health-Iowa, which operates facilities in Council Bluffs, Missouri Valley and Corning.\n\nA banner displayed on CHI Health's website provided further insight on the scope of the issue, stating providers are following offline processes to manage prescription medications for patients. Officials note Iowa law allows for handwritten prescriptions \"in emergency situations.\"\n\nMercyOne officials said all care locations are open and are able to serve all patients' health needs \"with some disruption to normal operations.\"\n\n\"MercyOne is working with CommonSpirit to resolve the issues as soon as possible,\" officials said in a statement. \"We are grateful to our colleagues and physicians, who are doing everything possible to minimize the impact to our patients. We take our responsibility to our patients very seriously. Our team is committed to ensuring safe, quality care for our patients and community.\"\n\nRansomware attacks are historically known to cause major disruptions to patient care, often leading to delayed procedures, canceled appointments and diverted ambulances. It's unclear how many patients nationwide are affected by this ransomware attack, but ripple effects have been felt locally.\n\nOne Urbandale family told the Des Moines Register their 3-year-old son was given a \"megadose\" of pain medication much too large for his age and size when he was admitted to MercyOne hospital last week. Kelley Parsi, the child's mother, said the only explanation she was given was that the mistake was caused by the downed computer system.\n\nThat appears to be the case in this scenario as well, with news outlets nationwide reporting on patients who have faced disrupted care due to offline systems.\n\nThat can have serious consequences for patient health. A report published last year by the Ponemon Institute found that about one in four health care organizations reported an increase in mortality rates following a ransomware attack.\n\n\"The biggest concern has to be what impacts this will have on patient care and outcomes, both in the short and long term,\" Callow said. \"Health systems are already under a massive amount of stress ― some beyond the breaking point ― and adding a cyberattack into the midst is going to create an enormous challenge for them.\"\n\nSo far this year, 18 health systems nationwide have been hit by ransomware attacks, with data stolen in at least 13 of those cases, Callow said.\n\nThere were at least 168 ransomware attacks against health care organizations in 2020 and 2021, affecting more than 1,700 clinics, hospitals and other health care settings across the country, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nIn 2018, most ransomware victims were small businesses, and the average ransom demand was $5,000, Callow said.\n\nThe situation has changed drastically since then, Callow said. Hackers are targeting local governments, public school districts and other major sectors, in addition to health care, demanding upwards of tens of millions of dollars in ransom.\n\nThat's on top of the major financial toll these attacks can take on hospitals. A 2021 attack on California-based Scripps Health cost the system $112.7 million, mostly in lost revenue.\n\n\"What it really highlights is that governments didn’t take enough action sooner to deal with this problem, and it has spiraled. The attackers are now better resourced and motivated than ever have been,\" Callow said.\n\nMichaela Ramm covers health care for the Des Moines Register.

US authorities have started the process of returning the extorted funds to victims, Monaco said.\n\nThe series of ransomware attacks from North Korea – whose hackers generally either funnel money to the regime or enrich themselves – in some cases disrupted health services at the organizations for “prolonged periods,” US agencies said in a public advisory this month.\n\nBut Monaco lauded the unnamed Kansas organization for reporting the incident to the FBI and urged more US companies to do so to help the bureau disrupt a ransomware ecosystem that thrives on victims keeping quiet.\n\nThe report from the Kansas facility allowed the FBI to identify a new type of ransomware used by the North Koreans, Monaco said, and ultimately seize ransom payments along with cryptocurrency from China-based money-launderers working for the North Koreans.\n\nThe episode is indicative of the challenge facing US law enforcement in recovering the many millions of dollars that US businesses have typically paid ransomware groups in Russia, Eastern Europe and elsewhere in a given year.\n\nUS cybersecurity officials, for example, have long complained that they only are aware of a fraction of the ransomware extortions of businesses and local government. But under a law signed by President Joe Biden in March, certain critical infrastructure firms have 72 hours to report ransom payments to the government.\n\nJustice Department officials are hoping that their appeal for voluntary cooperation from victims, along with the new legal requirements, will give them a more complete picture of ransomware groups who have disrupted US critical infrastructure in brazen attacks.\n\nJustice officials in June 2021 seized roughly half of the estimated $4.4 million ransom payment that Colonial Pipeline, which provides roughly 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, paid to Russian-speaking hackers. That ransomware attack shut down the pipeline for days and prompted long lines at gas stations in multiple states.\n\nThe seizures are enabled by investments that the FBI, Secret Service and Treasury Department make in tracking cryptocurrency payments to cybercriminal groups, including payments that might violate US sanctions. The FBI earlier formed a new team of cryptocurrency experts earlier this year that focuses on blockchain analysis and seizing digital money.\n\nThe roughly $500,000 seizure announced Tuesday, though, pales in comparison to the hundreds of millions of dollars that North Korean hackers have obtained in breaches of cryptocurrency exchanges in recent years. Those heists – and North Korean efforts to apply for jobs at US cryptocurrency firms to fund the regime’s nuclear weapons program – have prompted US officials to conduct a series of threat briefings for companies in recent months, a CNN investigation found.\n\nThe FBI has in recent weeks reached out to private-sector experts to better understand the new ransomware allegedly used by the North Koreans.\n\nAllan Liska, senior intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, told CNN he met with FBI officials this week to exchange information on the North Korean ransomware.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/us-russia-defense-contractors-hackers/index.html", "title": "US says Russian hackers have collected intelligence from American ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRussian government-backed hackers have acquired sensitive information on the development and deployment of US weapons by breaching American defense contractors over the last two years, US security agencies said in a public advisory on Wednesday.\n\nThe information gathered is unclassified, but offers “significant insight into US weapons platforms development and deployment timelines,” and also covers export-controlled technology, according to the FBI, National Security Agency and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\nIt’s one of the clearest public statements yet from the US government on how Kremlin-linked hackers have gathered intelligence on US defense contractors — a problem Washington has faced for years.\n\nThe intrusions hit contractors supporting every US military branch, including the Air Force, Army, Navy and Space Force, as well as firms that work on defense and intelligence programs, US officials said.\n\nThe advisory comes as US officials warn Russia against further invading Ukraine, along whose border Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops, according to US President Joe Biden.\n\nUS government agencies have for years regularly released information on state-sponsored hacking threats, and US officials continue to say there is no credible, specific cyber threat to the US homeland tied to the Ukraine crisis.\n\nContractors targeted by Russian hackers over the last two years have been involved in aircraft design and the development of combat and weapons systems, among other things, the US agencies said.\n\n“By acquiring proprietary internal documents and email communications, adversaries may be able to adjust their own military plans and priorities, hasten technological development efforts, inform foreign policymakers of US intentions, and target potential sources for recruitment,” the advisory says.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the US advisory.

It was the largest cyberattack on an oil facility in US history.\n\nAnd it was a Russian government lab that built tools used in one of the most dangerous cyber offensives in the history of the digital age, penetrating the control systems of a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 for the purpose of setting off an explosion that, had it succeeded, could have killed people.\n\nSo established is Russia’s reputation for cyber sabotage that on February 24 – as its troops began rolling into Ukraine – President Joe Biden issued a warning to the country and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.\n\n“If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,” he said during remarks from the White House.\n\nBut now, even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar shells on civilians in hospitals and neighborhoods and its invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week, no known nightmare cyber scenario — a widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply chain – has come to pass in Ukraine, the US or elsewhere.\n\nTo be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43 million people.\n\nBut the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is not likely to do so.\n\n“We do need to consider this possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,” said Paul Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity firm IntSights.\n\nThe prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America are low, experts say.

Lee, a cybersecurity expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nCyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible – they’ve been happening for years on a low-grade scale.\n\nThe country has been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say, for a much more extensive cyber campaign.\n\nFor instance, in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to power American communities.\n\nThat same year, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThen, in late 2020, came the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world – including multiple US government agencies – were revealed to have been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and withdraw data.\n\n(L-R) FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna and Microsoft President Brad Smith testify during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on February 23, 2021. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nPutin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say.\n\n“They know how to weaponize these things – they’ve done it,” said Melissa Hathaway, who led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “If I need to cause a national crisis in another country, they know how to do this, they’ve systematically been testing the system.”\n\nPrudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking group called Energetic Bear – which has been tied to Moscow’s Federal Security Service, or FSB – is the most likely Russian third-party, state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack.\n\nThe group, which industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including “Dragonfly” and “Berserk Bear,” has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what cybersecurity experts refer to as a “watering hole”-type attack – a practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently visited by employees.\n\n“The group has a history of gaining access and maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don’t do anything with it,” Prudhomme said. “They want to have that access ready at a moment’s notice so, if and when they get the order on demand, they can flip the switch.”\n\nIn 2020, another state-sponsored Russian group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the largest-ever cyber attacks.\n\nBut it’s a two-way street. Experts say that while it’s true Russians are lurking in the software of various structural areas, Americans are also lurking in theirs.\n\nIt’s the “cyber equivalent of mutually assured destruction,” said Karen Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the nuclear standoff of the Cold War.\n\nAnd the Americans, experts say, are currently the more capable threat.\n\nWhile Russian cyberattacks tend to attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered the country’s nuclear program.\n\nPutin, experts say, understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely loath to poke the bear.\n\n“He seems to recognize that that’s a different level of escalation,” Timothy Frye, Columbia professor and author of “Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia,” said of a crippling cyberattack on a major electric utility in the US or another NATO country. “That might be part of the calculations as well.”\n\nStill, some experts say, Europe’s critical infrastructure could be an enticing target for Russia. That’s in part because the continent is far more dependent on Russian oil than the US is.\n\n“I don’t think anyone’s thought through how much control Russia has over the future of Europe,” said Hathaway, now the president of Hathaway Global Strategies.\n\nPutin has been most willing to wreak havoc on the Ukrainian power grid, which the Russians also hacked in 2016 – just a year after shutting off power to more than 200,000 consumers.\n\nLee said the second attack – which reportedly took out about a fifth of the power consumption in Kyiv for an hour – was by far the more impressive of the two.\n\n“That one scared the hell out of everybody,” said Lee, now CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Dragos and a former cyber warfare specialist with the Air Force. “That was a capability they developed that could be deployed on any electric transmission site in the world and have reliable effects everywhere. Like, it was – it was bad.”\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom also have blamed the NotPetya hack of 2017 – which the Trump administration called “the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history” – on Russia.\n\nThe NotPetya attack was launched against a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malware spread to companies across the globe, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.\n\n“It was part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in 2018.\n\nSome experts say the extensive meddling in Ukraine is due in part to how the country is seen as a kind of testing ground for belligerent cyberactivity. This is because the country’s power grid is in some ways similar in structure to those in the US and other Western countries, but Ukraine’s ability to retaliate has historically been minimal.\n\nStill, the US has seen a rise in high-profile cyberattacks. The growing threat prompted Biden to issue an executive order in May to shore up the nation’s cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. And it is a reminder that cyber defense in the United States has troubling vulnerabilities.\n\nThe US has ‘significant’ cyber vulnerabilities\n\nIf the Colonial Pipeline breach demonstrated anything, it is the extent to which critical infrastructure in America is susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nThat event in May prompted the Georgia-based company to shut down the pipeline for the first time in its 57-year history. The six-day shutdown scrambled logistics for several airlines and caused a panic at the pump that led to shortages and briefly raised gas prices. But while it was allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker group called DarkSide, authorities haven’t been able to link it to the Kremlin. (In fact, the Russian domestic intelligence agency arrested the alleged culprit – though the hacker was not extradited.) The ordeal ended when Colonial ponied up the $4.4 million ransom — more than half of which was later recovered by the Justice Department.\n\nMotorists wait in line at a gas station on May 12, 2021 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, following the Colonial Pipeline hack. Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nThat attack, Prudhomme stressed, was financially motivated. The hackers, he said, used a compromised password found in a dark-web data dump and were able to employ an inactive VPN account to penetrate the Colonial Pipeline’s network, which didn’t use multifactor authentication.\n\n“Criminal hackers will tend to go for low-hanging fruit,” he said. “The point of entry here was fairly simple.”\n\nAnother sensitive breach happened in early 2021, when hackers – whose country of origin isn’t known – were able to gain access to a Florida water treatment facility by using dormant remote access software for the purpose of poisoning the water supply. The hack was quickly caught by a human operator at the facility. But the incident illustrates the dangers of remote access work without proper security: The plant had used multiple computers running an aging version of Microsoft Windows to monitor the facility remotely. All of the computers shared a single password.\n\nAbout a year later – this past January – the Biden administration announced a plan to shore up the cyber defenses of the nation’s roughly 150,000 public water systems.\n\nBut even if localized networks are vulnerable, experts say that the American power grid is far too complex to shut down in one simple motion.\n\n“For a successful attack to be able to take the lights out, they need to gain access to a lot of different points … and nobody is looking,” said Vikram Thakur, technical director at cybersecurity company Symantec. “We don’t think it’s plausible.”\n\nSophisticated hackers could, however, still seize on any vulnerabilities to cause smaller-scale damage to the electrical grid and other means of energy production.\n\nSmaller utility companies may not be able to make enough of an investment in cybersecurity, potentially making their systems more vulnerable to attacks. The equipment and devices specifically used to distribute electricity to consumers are also more at risk, experts say, because they are not required to adhere to federal cybersecurity standards that apply to the higher-voltage generators and transmission lines in the electrical industry.\n\nAnd while new cybersecurity requirements were introduced for certain oil and gas pipelines last year, they are not as comprehensive as the electrical industry standards and there aren’t federal cybersecurity regulations for water systems, said Ernie Hayden, who has spent decades working in the power sector, identifying risks to energy and electric providers as a chief information security officer, cybersecurity engineer and consultant.\n\nIf networks aren’t properly secured, a hacker could not only launch a ransomware or malware attack but directly infiltrate systems, known as operational technology, that control critical equipment, said Hayden.\n\nDepending on the location of the attack and the lack of controls, this could result in a range of potential outcomes. If hackers get into the operational controls of a water system – as nearly happened in Florida last year – they could potentially poison a water supply by causing chlorine to be injected at a dangerous level, said Hayden. They could cause short power outages if they found a way to access devices that control the circuit breakers at one of the country’s tens of thousands of substations, which are used to transform voltage before electricity is delivered. And turning off the ventilation controls or valves that control the flow of chemicals, gas and oil at refineries could cause equipment failures and leaks, he said.\n\nEven these smaller-scale, localized disruptions are unlikely, however, and experts said they would not cause the cascading blackouts or mass destruction that many fear. But they could still have a psychological impact, which may be the intent of the attacker.\n\nTom Alrich, a cybersecurity risk management consultant specializing in supply chain threats to software, said he doesn’t believe hackers, including any from Russia, would be able to cause outages by accessing electrical infrastructure. Even if they could, he said, they would get nothing out of it. Instead, Alrich said, the focus should be on ransomware attacks that shut down a company’s operations without directly attacking the systems that control the physical infrastructure, which is what happened in the case of the Colonial Pipeline, or cyberattacks that “poison” the software developed by a given company or organization, such as the infamous SolarWinds hack.\n\nMax Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service – a nonpartisan non-profit that promotes better government – pointed to some federal failures. He noted that the Department of Energy has some key positions unfilled because the US Senate has been slow to confirm nominees.\n\n“The notion of cyber risk is profound,” Stier said. “It’s a battlefield that doesn’t respect physical boundaries, one where we know the Russians already have been playing, and not just the Russians; and it’s one where we have significant vulnerability.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of organizations breached in the SolarWinds hack.

He had to swap out credit and debit cards after fraudulent charges surfaced, according to a federal lawsuit.\n\nA Richmond, Virginia, mom, who'd given birth to triplets in September 2022, received data breach notices addressed to herself and one of her three infants. Since then, she’s received “suspicious medical bills” the hospital has been unable to explain, according to the same class action suit.\n\nThe HCA theft was the largest hospital breach in 2023, a year in which about 1 in 3 Americans were affected by health-related data breaches. The number of attacks has surged in recent years. They've typically been carried out by organized hackers, often operating overseas, who target the computer systems of health providers and the vendors and companies that serve them. Most of the largest hacks targeted vendors who bill, mail or provide other services for hospitals, doctors and other health providers.\n\nLast year, a record 133 million health records were exposed in data breaches mainly carried out by hackers who've attacked health providers and their vendors, infiltrated computer systems and demanded ransom or other payments. An average of two health data hacks or thefts of at least 500 records were carried out daily last year in the United States, according to an analysis by The HIPAA Journal.\n\nThe health care industry has sought to bolster its defenses against these sophisticated hacks with some success.\n\nThese now-routine attacks can hassle consumers and their families must monitor their credit histories with credit-reporting agencies. In the worst cases, bad actors use or sell personal identifying information to credit and debit card fraudsters who open accounts in the victims' names, leaving a digital trail that can take years for victims to clear.\n\nThe HCA theft targeted an external storage system for the Nashville, Tennessee-based company, a hospital chain with locations in 20 states. This system contained patient names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, dates of birth and genders of patients along with dates and locations they'd received service. No health data, such as diagnoses or conditions, was stolen, HCA officials said.\n\nAttorneys for 15 victims said in court documents filed Feb. 2 at the U.S. District Court in Nashville that they \"seek to hold HCA responsible\" for the data hack \"due to its impermissibly inadequate data security measures.\"\n\nHCA has not yet responded to the filing, which seeks class-action status, but a representative said the health provider would respond in court. The official defended the hospital chain's efforts to improve its cyber defenses.\n\n\"HCA Healthcare has several robust security strategies, systems and protocols in place to help protect data,\" said Harlow Sumerford, HCA's spokesperson. \"Not publicly discussing the details of our security measures is part of our overall protection strategy.\"\n\nSabita Soneji, one of the lawyers representing HCA patients whose identifying information was accessed, said the victims have \"good reason to be worried\" because the breach puts them at risk for identity theft, fraud and scams.\n\n\"If you're going to be in the business of collecting (personal) data, you better take care of it,\" Soneji said.\n\nHealth care hacks set new record in 2023\n\nGovernment regulators who enforce data privacy laws have tracked a record number of major data hacks.\n\nHealth care providers, health plans and other entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, must notify the Department of Health and Human Services and individuals if their health information has been breached.\n\nThe HHS Office of Civil Rights, which oversees how companies protect health data, requires that health providers report breaches of protected health information. The agency investigates whether the breaches involve violations of health information privacy and security laws and publicly reports attacks that affect 500 or more on its website.\n\nLast year, HHS reported the highest number ever of major health data hacks: 725, and people impacted by those hacks: 133 million. Those numbers eclipsed the previous record in 2015 when hackers targeted the health insurance giant Anthem. The Anthem attack remains the largest-ever health data breach. In that electronic heist, hackers accessed names, Social Security and medical identification numbers, addresses, dates of birth, emails and employment information of more than 78 million people.\n\nExperts say last year's figures show the changing nature of such attacks, as hackers increasingly target businesses that handle health information but don't provide direct care to patients.\n\nOf the top 20 hacks in which 1 million or more records were accessed last year, the vast majority targeted businesses that provide services to hospitals and health providers, said John Riggi, the American Hospital Association’s national adviser for cybersecurity and risk.\n\nPerry Johnson & Associates (PJ&A), a Henderson, Nevada, company that transcribes medical notes on behalf of hospitals, doctors and other health providers, reported a data breach last year that affected nearly 9 million, according to a November filing with HHS.\n\nHowever, other notices suggest the PJ&A data breach might be larger. That hack breached information from health providers such as Northwell Health of New York, Concentra Health Services of Texas and Cook County Health.\n\nIn an updated notice filed this month with the Maine attorney general, PJ&A said the data hack spanned from March 27 through May 2 and affected the records of 13.3 million people, which would make it the largest hack of 2023.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James urged 4 million New York City and Syracuse-area residents affected by the PJ&A breach to take steps such as credit monitoring and placing a fraud alert on credit reports. She also encouraged affected individuals to obtain copies of their medical records, contest unrecognized medical bills and inform their health insurers about the hack.\n\nPJ&A representatives did not respond on Friday to questions from USA TODAY about the hack.\n\nRiggi, of the American Hospital Association, said third-party data breaches are particularly challenging for hospitals and other health providers to police. HIPAA requires that hospitals and health providers ensure that the companies handling their health records do so in a secure manner.\n\n\"It's virtually impossible in this day and age of highly complex networks and software to ensure our third parties meet all the security standards,\" Riggi said. \"Hospitals don't have control or visibility into their networks. We have to take their word that they patched their liability.\"\n\nEven Medicare was targeted by hackers\n\nThe federal, state and local government has not been immune to such data intrusions. Last July, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced a breach that compromised the records of 2.3 million beneficiaries. The hack targeted MOVEit Transfer, a software program by the computer network of the Medicare contractor Maximus Federal Services Inc.\n\nThe MOVEit Transfer software hack was first disclosed by the software manufacturer Progress Software Corp. The hack ultimately affected tens of millions of people across more than 2,000 companies, government agencies and universities, according to an analysis by the data security company Emsisoft.\n\nFederal investigators determined that a Russian ransomware group called Clop was able to exploit a vulnerability in the MOVEit software program in a wide-ranging attack.\n\n\"Through that one vulnerability across government and all types of private sector industries, including health care, they were able to access millions and millions of health care records,\" Riggi said.\n\nRansomware organizations wreaking havoc\n\nThese organized hacks are often carried out by criminal organizations seeking to profit from these attacks.\n\nIn recent years, hackers have disrupted hospital and health care systems in ransomware attacks. As the name implies, hackers take control of a hospital's data systems and demand a ransom payment for the return of control. Ransomware attacks more than doubled from 2016 through 2021, according to a study published in JAMA Health Forum.\n\nCriminal organizations are also branching out and trying new strategies to make money, said Charles Henderson, global head of IBM Security X-Force, which provides threat intelligence and data security services.\n\nAmong their tactics: They demand ransom, threatening to release or sell personal identifying information of a health system's patients.\n\n\"They're figuring out that certain monetization strategies are more lucrative than others,\" Henderson said.\n\nOther cybersecurity experts said the health care industry has been a popular target because it has transformed from a pen-and-paper orders and records to one that increasingly relies on software systems for electronic health records and remote communication with advent of telehealth services.\n\nThe hackers likely have view hospitals and doctors – and especially vendors who serve these health providers – as \"soft targets,\" said Anurag Lal, president & CEO of Infinite Convergence Solutions, which provides secure messaging services.\n\nWhile the health care industry has been slow to make the type of investment in computer security necessary to repel hackers, Lal said, there are signs the industry is catching up: \"The hospitals and health care entities that recognize (modern hacking threats), understand it and get up and do something about it are the ones who will be in the best position to get past this current situation.\"\n\nKen Alltucker is on X, formerly Twitter, at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/europe/ukraine-cyber-attack-government-intl/index.html", "title": "Cyberattack hits Ukraine government websites | CNN", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nScores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to “be afraid and wait for the worst” and alleging their personal information has been hacked.\n\nUkraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies.\n\nOleg Nikolenko, Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesman tweeted on Friday that the “investigation is still ongoing but the Security Service of Ukraine has obtained preliminary indicators suggesting that hacker groups associated with the Russian secret services may stand behind today’s massive cyberattack on government websites.”\n\nUkraine’s communication intelligence service said in a statement that as many as 70 central and regional authority websites were targeted.\n\nThe attack appears to be a low-level incident but is symbolic coming at the end of a week of frantic diplomacy involving NATO, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and bilateral talks between Russia and the United States – all aimed at trying to deescalate tensions on Ukraine’s border.\n\n“This is not the first time or even the second time that Ukrainian Internet resources have been attacked since the beginning of the Russian military aggression,” the Ukrainian Information Ministry said in a statement.\n\nMost of the affected state resources have already been restored, according to Ukraine’s security service, who said that personal data had not been breached.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nEarly Friday morning local time, Ukrainian government websites, including that of the Foreign Ministry, displayed dark screens with a threatening text that said Ukrainians’ personal information had been hacked.\n\n“Ukrainian!

But others in the administration believe the tough sanctions being weighed would have a manageable impact on the US, and would be worth it to impose severe penalties on Russia.\n\nThe extent of the blowback would depend largely on the parameters of the sanctions and how much Europe would suffer, said Jeff Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who focuses on international trade policy and economic sanctions.\n\n“The problem with discussing these countermeasures is that if you take a strong sanctions action that has a big impact on the European economy, that will in turn rebound to the US economy,” he said.\n\nThe administration has been considering options including targeting major Russian commercial banks, sanctioning Russia’s energy sector, blocking Russia’s access to bond markets, cutting Russia off from the SWIFT international payment system, and tightening export control measures.\n\nAmong the most “realistic” economic penalties that the US and its allies could impose would be to kill the Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, Schott said, which – when operational – will account for about 10-15% of European Union gas consumption but will bypass Ukraine and be a major boon to Russia.\n\nUS officials have been lobbying Germany to commit to killing the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, according to a senior US official, and Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said last month that “in the event of further escalation” against Ukraine, “this gas pipeline could not come into service.”\n\nOfficials are also mindful of the possibility of Russian retaliation in cyberspace against US and European critical infrastructure.\n\nThe potential for such spillover is weighing on how the US responds to any Russian incursion and will also affect how allies react, as the US works to coordinate a response for maximum effect.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN that “any costs that we would bear will pale in comparison to the impact we generate on the Russian economy and financial system.”\n\n“Whatever we decide, in concert with our allies and partners, is the right course for our collective interests and security, we are prepared to deliver severe costs to the Russian economy while minimizing unwanted spillover,” the senior administration official told CNN.\n\nA State Department spokesperson echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that while the department does “not preview potential sanctions actions,” the US and its allies have been consulting on “specific packages of severe consequences for Russia should they go forward with military escalation In Ukraine.”\n\n“As Secretary Blinken said, if Russia chooses to escalate, we will respond swiftly,” the spokesperson said.\n\nCyber risks\n\nAnother scenario top of mind for US and European officials is if Russia moves to retaliate against any sanctions with hacking activity against western critical infrastructure.\n\nRecent National Security Council meetings have included discussions of potential Russian cyber activity should tensions with the US escalate further over Ukraine, a senior administration official told CNN. Meanwhile, the White House has overseen federal agencies’ outreach to US companies encouraging them to maintain strong cybersecurity protections, the official said.\n\n“While there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for Russia to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,” the senior Biden administration official told CNN.\n\nThe Energy Department in mid-December held an unclassified briefing with America’s biggest electric utilities, natural gas and oil companies on Russia’s history of disruptive cyber operations in Ukraine and other parts of the world, two people who listened to the briefing told CNN.\n\nWhile not tied to any specific threat, the Energy Department briefing covered the technical details of previous Russian cyberattacks that cut power in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016, along with more recent Russian cyber activity such as the 2020 espionage campaign that exploited SolarWinds software, said one of the people who attended the briefing, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private call.\n\nThe message from US officials to electric utilities and energy operators on the call was to be vigilant and to “have heightened awareness, as you monitor these geopolitical activities, that there could be spillover” in cyberspace, the source told CNN.\n\nJim Linn, executive director of DNG-ISAC, a cyberthreat sharing center for the downstream natural gas industry, told CNN: “Escalating tensions abroad, especially in Eastern Europe, has the potential to alter the cybersecurity landscape.”\n\nLinn’s threat-sharing center, he added, “is constantly tracking threats posted by members, government and law enforcement as well as sharing information and mitigation techniques.”\n\nA recent classified briefing for key US financial institutions – conducted by Treasury Department and US intelligence officials and part of their regular cyberthreat briefings for banks – featured information on Russian cyber capabilities and the possibility of Russian retaliation in cyberspace if things escalate in Ukraine, a cybersecurity executive at a major US bank familiar with the briefings told CNN.\n\n‘We are not backing down”\n\nWith all of the risks to consider, and with Russia showing no signs of withdrawing its forces from the Ukraine border, intensive discussions have been underway in recent days and weeks about how the US and its allies can mitigate the potential collateral damage, sources said.\n\n“We are not backing down from our willingness to impose these kinds of harsh sanctions if Russia moves to invade,” said one official. “But we still have to figure out how to do them in a way that is smart. How do you craft them in a way that they hit the intended party more than your allies?”\n\nSanctioning members of Putin’s inner circle is still a top option, the first official said, and likely a given if Russia invades because of the more limited impact it would have on the international financial system.\n\nThe White House and senior officials are also discussing potential export control measures that could halt Russia’s ability to import smartphones, key aircraft and automobile components, and materials from many other sectors, threatening major impacts on Russian consumers, industrial operations, and employment, sources familiar with the discussions said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated in a press conference on Wednesday that if Russia does not commit to “diplomacy and de-escalation” during talks next week and instead renews its aggression against Ukraine, the Kremlin will incur “massive consequences” from the US and its allies.\n\nBiden conveyed much the same message to Putin in a phone call last week, telling the Russian leader that the costs of an invasion would include economic penalties as well as “adjustments and augmentations of NATO force posture in Allied countries” and “additional assistance to Ukraine to enable it to further defend itself and its territory,” another senior administration official told reporters.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Sean Lyngaas", "Natasha Bertrand", "Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/01/07"}]}

Your registering does not take away from anybody else, so register with us if you have loss and damages.”\n\nThe Disaster Recovery Center is open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily at the old Kmart building on Hilltop Drive in Redding. Other agencies besides FEMA, such as the Small Business Administration (SBA) and Department of Veterans Affairs are also on site.\n\nResidents can register with FEMA at the Disaster Recovery Center, or by calling 1-800-621-3362 or go to www.disasterassistance.gov.\n\nLindsey said the housing assistance money has been used to secure rentals or rooms in hotels for displaced families and individuals.\n\nThere has been some talk that FEMA would bring in mobile homes and trailers to help house Carr Fire victims.\n\n“That is our last option for assistance,” Lindsey said. “We are trying to make available homes and hotels. That’s our priority. In this situation, we see folks are getting placed, the ones that are getting plugged in (registered) with us — and that is the thing, they need to stay plugged in.”\n\nAssistance also is available for other expenses including medical, child care, and transportation. There also is crisis counseling.\n\nOne thing that could delay getting in the FEMA system is not filing a complete application, Lindsey said.\n\nSBA offers loan assistance to businesses, homeowners and renters, and part of the FEMA application addresses the SBA.\n\nBut because people don’t want a loan, they leave the SBA portion blank. That will kick back the application, Lindsey said.\n\n“We run into the problem all over the United States,” Lindsey said. “The part that throws people is the Small Business Administration piece.”\n\nFilling out the SBA part of the FEMA registration doesn’t commit the person to a loan, Lindsey said.\n\nSBA assistance is available, too\n\nThe acronym stands for the Small Business Administration, but homeowners and renters also can qualify for a low-interest Carr Fire relief loan.\n\n“I don’t think the full recovery timeline and costs really hit home,” SBA spokeswoman Chelsea Irvine said. “Insurance policies are wonderful and cover payments up front, but down the road, is it really going to cover everything?”\n\nLoans of up to $200,000 are available to homeowners for repairs of a primary residence. What’s more, homeowners and renters can get up to $40,000 for personal property losses, including fire-damaged vehicles.\n\nRates for homeowners and renters are as low as 1.938 percent with terms up to 30 years.\n\nThe deadline for homeowners and renters to apply for SBA assistance is Oct. 3.\n\nTax relief is available\n\nThe state emergency declaration from the Carr Fire allows qualified taxpayers to claim related losses as a state tax deduction by amending a 2017 state tax return or when filing a 2018 state tax return next year.\n\nThe Franchise Tax Board follows federal postponement periods for any presidentially declared disasters, so relief offered on the federal side also carries over to state income tax filings.\n\nFor more information, visit https://bit.ly/2nVA4Iq.\n\nMore:Carr Fire: Here’s where to find all your answers\n\nRead:Allegations of price gouging are being filed in Shasta County in Carr Fire's aftermath\n\nRead:Son repeats agonizing line to mom suffering from memory loss: 'Your house burned down.'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/16/israel-hamas-war-live-updates/71201737007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war updates: US troops told to prepare to deploy", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israeli-Hamas conflict, please see Tuesday's live updates file here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will travel to Israel and Jordan this week in a show of solidarity, and to meet with both Israeli and Arab leadership amid growing concerns over the escalating violence in the Middle East.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken announced Biden's visit ahead of a possible Israeli ground invasion of Gaza aimed at crushing the Hamas militant group. The trip comes a week and half after Hamas' incursion on Israel that has killed over 4,000 on both sides and displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\n\n“He is coming here at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world,” Blinken said.\n\nBlinken had returned to Israel on Monday − his second visit in less than a week − after a whirlwind tour of six Arab states aimed at keeping the war from expanding across the Middle East. Blinken met with Netanyahu, reaffirming U.S. determination to provide Israel whatever is needed to protect its citizens, Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe two also discussed coordination with the U.N. and \"regional partners\" to provide humanitarian aid to civilians as well as the U.S. commitment to the speedy release of hostages, Blinken said. Their meeting was interrupted twice by air raid sirens indicating incoming rockets, prompting them and others to seek shelter in a bunker.\n\nAbout 2,000 U.S. troops have been told to get ready to deploy in anticipation of the ground offensive. The American soldiers would not be sent to Israel but could be assigned to other countries in the region for support roles such as medical assistance or providing security at gate crossings, the Associated Press reported Monday, citing U.S. officials.\n\nLater in the day, Hamas said it's holding 200 to 250 hostages − the upper end is about 50 more than previously believed − and added that it would release the non-Israeli ones when it was feasible. And Hezbollah said its fighters targeted five Israeli posts along the Lebanese border Monday afternoon.\n\nNo spillover:Blinken says Arab leaders don't want spillover from Israel-Hamas war\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Biden was pondering a trip to Israel. Biden abruptly called off a trip to Colorado but made no announcement of alternative travel plans.\n\n∎ More than 1 million Gazans have evacuated their homes. Last week Israel ordered an evacuation of northern Gaza, an edict that fueled chaos across the Israeli-occupied territory of about 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\n∎ The Israeli military has ordered people living in 28 communities near the Lebanese border to evacuate amid increasing cross-border fire between Israel and the Lebanese Shiite militia, Hezbollah.\n\n∎ The European Union said it has tripled humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza to nearly $80 million and will send two flights this week through Egypt with provisions for the territory's residents.\n\n∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered the current invasion of neighboring Ukraine that has killed tens of thousands and led to war crime charges against him, urged Netanyahu to seek “a peaceful settlement through political and diplomatic means,” the Kremlin said.\n\nWhat’s happening in Israel?After Hamas attack, understanding the conflict in Gaza\n\n'Deep discussions' seeking opening of Rafah crossing\n\nThe Biden administration and the United Nations are leading \"deep discussions'' with the Israelis, Egyptians and others about getting humanitarian aid for besieged Gaza civilians through the Rafah crossing at the southern border with Egypt, U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said.\n\nThe crossing has been closed since shortly after the war began, partly because of damage caused by Israeli airstrikes and other security issues but also because of Egyptian concerns about a flood of Palestinian refugees coming through. That has left trucks idling at the border with supplies Gazans desperately need.\n\nAs both warring sides continue to launch projectiles at each other, Israel has advised Palestinians in northern Gaza to head south ahead of the ground offensive. But even that hasn't proven entirely safe. At least 12 people were killed and nine were buried in the rubble of a Rafah building that was housing three families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north when it was pulverized by an airstrike, their relatives said.\n\nGriffiths, who is heading to Cairo to participate in the negotiations, said the U.N.’s “overwhelming priority” is to get access to Gaza.\n\n“You cannot ask people to move out of harm’s way without assisting them to do it” by providing safe places and humanitarian aid, which Israel is not currently doing, said Griffiths, who also called for Hamas to immediately release its hostages.\n\nNecessities in short supply in Gaza\n\nPalestinians crowded into hospitals and schools Monday as supplies of food, water and medicine ran low during a tight Israeli blockade of Gaza. Some relief was not far away but still unreachable.\n\nTrucks carrying necessities have waited for days at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt amid negotiations for a cease-fire that would allow them to enter Gaza and allow foreigners to leave. Gaza’s only border link to Egypt was shut down several days ago following Israeli airstrikes, and local media reported another hit at the crossing Monday.\n\n\"The conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory is an awful reminder of how quickly the health of millions of people can be put at risk,\" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a social media post. \"War will bring nothing but destruction and horror.\"\n\nHead of Israeli security agency issues mea culpa\n\nThe head of Israel's domestic security agency took responsibility for the failure to thwart the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught that claimed more than 1,400 lives.\n\n\"We were unable to create enough early warning to prevent the attack,” Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar said in a letter to agency employees. “As the person at the head of the organization, the responsibility for that is on me. There will be time for investigation – now is a time for war.”\n\nShin Bet, which monitors Palestinian extremists, is one of thee major Israeli security agencies along with Mossad and Aman.\n\nAbnormal activity detected in Gaza the night before the massacre prompted Bar to send a small team to the border, not realizing the huge scope of Hamas' planned attack, the Israeli news site Ynet reported. Shin Bet said at least 10 of its members were killed by Hamas forces.\n\nWar's death toll surpasses 4,000, including 30 Americans\n\nThe death toll on both sides of the war has surpassed 4,000 − about 2,800 in Gaza − and more than 10,000 are wounded.\n\nThe U.S. death toll is up to 30, and the State Department said 13 Americans remained missing but could provide no count on the number of U.S. hostages. \"State Department personnel have been in contact with their families,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nFuel, medical supplies stolen from UN agency in Gaza\n\nThieves using trucks purportedly from the Gaza Health Ministry have stolen desperately needed fuel and medical supplies from a U.N. agency compound in Gaza City, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency says. The agency was forced to evacuate the compound Friday and has no access to the site. Security cameras at the entrance and exit to the compound were damaged, the agency said.\n\n\"@UNRWA fuel & other types of material are kept for strictly humanitarian purposes − any other use is strongly condemned,\" the agency said in a social media post.\n\nIllinois stabbing attack investigated as possible hate crime\n\nThe Justice Department opened a federal hate crimes investigation into the Illinois stabbing death of 6-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume, a Palestinian-American boy. His mother, Hanaan Shahin, 32, was seriously injured in the attack.\n\nTheir landlord, Joseph Czuba of Plainfield Township, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago, is facing murder and hate crime charges, Czuba, 71, was denied bail at a court hearing Monday and must remain behind bars.\n\nCzuba was charged Sunday with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and two counts of a hate crime for what authorities believe was a targeted attack against a Muslim family in response to the Israel-Hamas war, according to the Will County Sheriff's office.\n\nThe alleged assault has evoked fears among Arab Americans of possible reprisals stemming from the war.\n\n“No one in the United States of America should have to live in fear of violence because of how they worship or where they or their family come from,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in announcing the hate crime investigation.\n\n− Bart Jansen, Thao Nguyen and Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nStabbing death of 6-year-old Muslim boy:llinois incident to be investigated as hate crime\n\nHundreds of Floridians return home on special flight\n\nAlmost 300 Floridians who had been trapped in Israel because of flight cancellations have arrived in Florida on a flight arranged by the state and the global rescue agency Project Dynamo. Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, took a dig at the Biden administration, saying he was \"proud of how quickly we have been able to activate resources and do what the federal government could not – get Floridians and other Americans back home, reunited with their families, free of charge.”\n\nDeSantis said the state also is sending medical supplies, hygiene products, clothing and children’s toys to Israel to help Israelis affected by the war. And he said Gazans should not be welcomed into the U.S., saying Arab nations should \"open their borders and absorb\" Gaza refugees.\n\n\"As president, the number of people I will bring in from Gaza is zero,\" he said.\n\nUS gas prices fall despite war\n\nThe national average for a gallon of gas fell last week despite a tumultuous period for oil prices after Hamas launched the attack on Israel. A gallon of regular unleaded fell about 12 cents to $3.628 on Friday, according to AAA, a nonprofit federation of motor clubs that tracks fuel costs. The decline comes even as oil rose by about $5 to around $90 per barrel last week. The price of crude, which is refined into gasoline, makes up more than half the price of a gallon of fuel. The cost at the pump is dropping because of lower demand from drivers and less expensive blends of winter gasoline coming into the market, AAA says.\n\n“As long as this war does not spread to include more countries in the region, the effect on the oil market will remain muted,” AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement.

The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) is a coalition of over 170 non-governmental organizations that includes tens of thousands of Palestinians and Israelis who share the goal of building state peace between the two communities. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also aims to protect victims of conflicts and provide them with assistance.

On Oct. 7, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea. Hamas says the attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.\n\nBut Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of Israeli settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel. Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, and the attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, a decade after its founding. Several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/07/2024-state-of-the-union-live-updates/72841823007/", "title": "State of the Union replay: Biden's fiery SOTU, Britt's response", "text": "President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address on Thursday, his last before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe president addressed a sweeping range of issues facing the nation and the world, from providing aid for Ukraine to expanding abortion rights.

Biden made restoring abortion rights a major theme of his speech, blaming Trump for the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 by appointing three justices who tilted the court's conservative majority.\n\nHe also addressed challenges both at home and abroad, getting into a heated confrontation with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., over the border and calling on Israel to “do its part” in sending humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden, Donald Trump troll each other during SOTU speech\n\nHe never mentioned Donald Trump by name. But President Joe Biden was quick to go after his “predecessor” and “the last administration” Thursday during the State of the Union address, hammering Trump on everything from Russia policy to abortion, taxes and the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump started jabbing Biden hours before he entered the House chamber, where he delivered his speech. Trump complained about Biden being late when the event didn’t start on time and kept up his “Play by Play” throughout much of the speech.\n\nFor instance, at one point in the speech, Biden accused Trump of trying to “bury the truth about Jan. 6” to which Trump defended Jan. 6 participants on Truth Social and repeated unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\n-- Zac Anderson and Michael Collins\n\n‘Remember Abbey Gate’ man yelling interrupts SOTU speech\n\nApproximately one hour into the speech, in which Joe Biden drew sharp contrasts between himself and the Republican Party, a person began shouting causing the President to pause briefly. “Remember Abbey Gate!

We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt zeroes in on Joe Biden's border policy\n\nKatie Britt on Thursday said the American dream \"has turned into a nightmare for so many families.\"\n\n\"President Biden's border policies are a disgrace. This crisis is despicable. And the truth is, it is almost entirely preventable,\" she said.\n\nBritt told the story of a Texas woman who was trafficked by drug cartels. She also referenced Laken Riley, a Georgia woman who was killed. An undocumented immigrant has been charged following her death.\n\n\"Mr. President, enough is enough. Innocent Americans are dying, and you only have yourself to blame.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt hits Joe Biden in Republican SOTU response\n\nKatie Britt kicked off her response to Joe Biden's State of the Union address by calling the president a \"permanent politician,\" referring to him as \"out of touch.\"\n\n\"Under his administration, families are worse off,\" Britt said.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden addresses concerns about his age\n\nJoe Biden ended his speech by addressing Americans' well-documented concerns about his age, cracking a joke.\n\n“I know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” he quipped.\n\nThe president said he is still up to the task, citing his experience and wisdom. He seemed to draw a direct comparison to his predecessor and opponent, alluding to his belief that he and Donald Trump think different core values define America.\n\n“My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy... Honesty. Decency. Dignity. Equality,” he said. “Now some other people my age see a different story. An American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.”\n\nBiden also highlighted his decades of experience in politics, reminding viewers that there was a time in his career when people told him he was “too young.”\n\n“Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures,” he said. “The very idea of America, that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nStanding up to China\n\nRelations with China have stabilized – for now. But competition with the rival nation remains a top priority for the Biden administration.\n\n“America is rising,” Joe Biden said Thursday. “We’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan straits.”\n\nBiden said Thursday that he had revitalized U.S. alliances in the region and taken steps to protect American investments in advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\n“Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,” Biden said.\n\nMoments later, as Biden said that issues such as the reduction of fentanyl production and trafficking should be bipartisan, he chafed at Republicans seated in the chamber.\n\n“You don’t want to do that huh,” he said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho yelled 'Liar!' at Joe Biden?\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., was the first Republican to accuse Joe Biden of being a 'liar' during the state of the union, according to reports.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Van Orden told USA TODAY in a text message: \"Who?\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nContaining the “threat posed by Iran”\n\nJoe Biden warned Houthi rebels in Yemen that the U.S. will take any means necessary to protect commercial vessels in the Red Sea and minimize disruptions to global trade.\n\nAn attack by the Iranian-backed group on a shipping vessel killed three crew members on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its coalition partners are wary of escalating the conflict. They have responded to previous episodes of violence with limited airstrikes.\n\nBut the president said Thursday, that “containing the threat posed by Iran” is key to achieving stability in the region.\n\n“As commander-in-chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel,” Biden said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden calls for temporary cease-fire in the Middle East\n\nBiden rebuked Israel for the high death toll in Gaza and called for a temporary cease-fire in its war with Hamas.\n\n“Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip,” Biden said. “Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.”\n\nHe added: “As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.”\n\nThe bloody conflict began five months ago, to the day, when Hamas fighters kidnapped, killed and most likely engaged in “sexualized torture” of Israeli civilians, according to a U.N. report, during the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBiden pledged to the families of hostages that he would not rest until their loved ones return home. The commitment drew a standing ovation from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd while the U.S. firmly supports Israel’s right to defend itself, Biden said, the price that innocent Palestinian women and children are paying is too high.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Biden said.\n\nBiden pressed both sides to accept the terms of a six-week ceasefire that would bring about the release of hostages, including an unknown number of Americans, and help get higher amounts of aid into the Gaza strip.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden demands assault weapon ban, touts lower crime rates.\n\nJoe Biden told the joint session that he is demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks.\n\n“None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged Jasmine, whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers at a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Biden said families who lost their children urged him to “do something” to address gun violence.\n\n“Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was president,” he said.\n\nBiden claimed America is safer today than when he took office and touted his American Rescue Plan's investment in public safety.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nProtestor who interrupted Joe Biden handcuffed and arrested\n\nThe protestor who interrupted Joe Biden, yelling about Abbey, Gate was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden interrupted by a protestor\n\nA protestor loudly interrupted Biden's speech from the House gallery overlooking the House floor, yelling about Abbey Gate. It's a reference to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which saw 13 military members killed.\n\nThe protestor was escorted out by security.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says his \"predecessor\" is playing politics with border\n\nJoe Biden talked about introducing a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system, secure the border, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, he said, would be the toughest set of border security reforms and would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers. But Republicans killed the legislation earlier this month, even after GOP lawmakers participated in negotiations.\n\n“But unfortunately, politics have derailed it so far,” he said. “I’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him.\"\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nRepublicans are leaving Biden's State of the Union early\n\nIn a sign of disinterest and disdain at the president's address, a handful of Republicans have slowly been trickling out of the House chamber as Joe Biden has been speaking.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden calls for expanded voting rights\n\nIn recognition of a dark moment in U.S. history, Biden pressed Congress to strengthen voter protections.\n\nHis speech fell on the 59th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when Alabama police clubbed and attacked civil rights advocates with tear gas during a peaceful demonstration.\n\nThe incident was a catalyst for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 several months later, which banned literacy tests and introduced other measures intended to help African Americans exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\nBiden held hands and marched with civil rights activists last year in Selma; Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at this year’s commemorative event.\n\n\"There are forces taking us back in time. Voter suppression. Election subversion. Unlimited dark money. Extreme gerrymandering,\" Biden said Thursday. \"It's time do to more than talk. Pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act!\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden pushes for a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nBiden said he would like to see a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit he approved during the pandemic. The credit enacted as part of his American Rescue Plan was only active in 2021.\n\nThat year, the Child Tax Credit increased from $2,000 to $3,000 per child over six and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under six. It also raised the age limit from 16 to 17. Working families received the full credit if they made less than $150,000 for a couple or $112,500 for families with a single parent.\n\n“Restore the Child Tax Credit because no child should go hungry in this country,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDemocrats to Marjorie Taylor Greene: 'Shut up!'\n\nAs Joe Biden railed against Republicans for killing a bipartisan border and migrant deal earlier this year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene got into a testy back and forth with the president and yelled \"It's about Laken Riley!\"\n\nRiley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nDemocrats immediately stood up to boo at Greene, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was seen yelling at her to \"Shut up!\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n“Strong and getting stronger”\n\nBiden sought to boost confidence in America’s future, saying on Thursday that when the country gets knocked down, it gets back up.\n\n“We keep going. That’s America,” Biden said.\n\nIt’s because of the tenacity of the American people that Biden said he could say in his address, “The state of our union is strong and getting stronger.”\n\nThe line drew loud cheers and applause from Democrats in the chamber, who erupted in chants of “Four more years!” Republicans stayed seated.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublicans jeer as Biden accuses them of cutting Social Security\n\nBiden accused Republicans of supporting cuts to Social Security and vowed to protect the social safety net, provoking jeers and a handful of GOP members yelling \"Liar!\" back at the president.\n\n\"If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them,\" Biden said.\n\nIf the dynamic sounds familiar, that's because it is. Biden made the same point at last year's State of the Union address, and Republicans responded the same way.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vows to lower housing costs\n\nTo address the increasing cost of housing, Joe Biden said he wants to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down.\n\n“I know the cost of housing is so important to you,” he said.\n\nHe said the administration is also eliminating title insurance fees for federally backed mortgages so that when a homeowner refinance their home, they can save you $1,000 or more.\n\nHe also urged Congress to pass his housing plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring rents down.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden: ‘I want to make college more affordable’\n\nBiden pushed for making college more affordable and urged lawmakers to continue increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families.\n\nHe acknowledged Keenan Jones, a public school educator from Minnesota, who was a guest sitting near the first lady Thursday evening.\n\n“While we’re at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise,” he said.\n\nBiden told the joint session that he wants to give every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three and four year olds as well as expand high quality tutoring and summer learning to increase reading levels.\n\n“To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene: 'Tell Hunter to pay his taxes!'\n\nWhen Biden spoke about raising the corporate tax rate, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., interrupted and yelled, \"tell Hunter to pay his taxes!\" referring to the president's son, Hunter Biden and his federal tax evasion charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden calls for Medicare to negotiate lower prices on 500 prescription drugs\n\nJoe Biden touted his administration’s steps to lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs, noting that “for years, people have talked about it, but finally we got it done.”\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022, gave Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices directly with drug companies. As a result, Biden said, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market.\n\nNow it’s time to go further, he said, and give Medicare the authority to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorge Santos, during the State of the Union, announces he's running for reelection\n\nDuring Biden's speech, embattled former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House for his extravagant lies and slate of criminal charges, announced he was running for reelection, challenging his fellow New Yorker, Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.\n\n\"Tonight, I want to announce that I will be returning to the arena of politics and challenging Nick,\" Santos said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIVF and Roe v. Wade take center stage\n\nJoe Biden during his speech highlighted Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision treating embryos as children.\n\n“She was told her dream would have to wait,” Biden said. “Let’s stand up for families like hers,\" said Biden.\n\nHe also pointed to Kate Cox, who was denied an abortion in Texas.\n\n“Here are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need,” said Biden. “Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain warms up to Joe Biden\n\nUnited Auto Worker President Shawn Fain mouths \"it's you,\" in response to accolades from Joe Biden.\n\nIt's a big turnaround: Fain and the UAW withheld an endorsement for Biden for months as the United Auto Workers pressured the administration to strengthen union rules. The union openly criticized the administration for failing to tie generous federal funding to strong labor requirements.\n\nThey finally endorsed Biden earlier this year after big contract wins in the fall.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDonald Trump's Truth Social website is down\n\nWhile Joe Biden has attacked Donald Trump at length, the former president has not responded as often as expected.\n\nHis Truth Social website went down shortly after Biden began his speech.\n\nTrump aides are weighing in often on Biden on other social media, but the candidate himself is silenced …. for now.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: ‘My predecessor failed’ handling COVID-19 pandemic\n\nBiden said America is on the comeback from the worst pandemic and economic crisis in the century.\n\n“My predecessor failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people—the duty to care,” Biden said. “I think that’s unforgivable.”\n\nBiden said the COVID-19 pandemic no longer controls our lives. And while the U.S. economy was on the brink, it’s now the “envy of the world.” He cited unemployment at record lows, an increase in small business owners, new manufacturing jobs, a decrease in inflation and increase in exporting American products.\n\n“It doesn’t make news, but in 1,000 cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told,\" he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nJoe Biden condemns Jan. 6 mob attack in SOTU address\n\nWarning that democracy is under assault, Joe Biden cited the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election.\n\n“The insurrectionists were not patriots,” Biden said. “They came to stop the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nLies about the 2020 election and the plot to steal the election posed the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War, Biden said, “but they failed.”\n\nTrump and some Republicans in Congress “seek to bury the truth about Jan. 6,” Biden alleged. “I will not do that.”\n\n“Here’s the truth,” he said. “You can’t love your country only when you win.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Lies!' one House GOP lawmaker yells\n\nAs Joe Biden was speaking, one House Republican interjected and yelled \"Lies!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., instructed GOP members to remain cordial throughout the address, but that message evidently didn't get through to some lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is sitting behind Joe Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., are sitting behind the president on Thursday. It's traditional for the vice president and speaker of the House to sit behind the president during the State of the Union.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden criticizes Donald Trump's attacks on NATO\n\nOne of Biden’s few foreign policy successes since last year: the addition of Sweden to the NATO alliance.\n\nSweden cleared the final obstacle on Tuesday when, after more than a year of delays, the Hungarian government finally approved the nation’s membership. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson submitted the accession paperwork in Washington, D.C. hours before Biden’s evening address.\n\nThe ceremony made it convenient for Kristersson to attend the State of the Union as a guest of the White House. And it gave Biden a ready-made opportunity to juxtapose his support for the alliance that is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary with the position of likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nTrump last month claimed he once told the leader of a NATO nation that Russia can do “whatever the hell” it wants countries to countries that spend less than they should on their national defense.\n\n“We will not walk away. We will not bow down,” Biden said Thursday. “I will not bow down!”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden opens remarks with call to support Ukraine aid\n\nPresident Joe Biden opened his speech by declaring loudly that America stands with Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin continuing to wage war on the sovereign nation.\n\nBiden said he hoped to \"wake up the Congress\" and alert the American people \"this is no ordinary moment\" with democracy under threat in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\"If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not,\" Biden said from the House chamber. “But Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is asking.\"\n\n\"They are not asking for American soldiers,\" Biden said. \"And I'm determined to keep it that way.\"\n\nA national security bill that included assistance for Ukraine cleared the Senate with bipartisan support. Facing potential blowback from conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not brought the bill for a vote.\n\nKyiv’s ambassador to Washington, Oksana Markarova, and a Ukrainian soldier, Andrii Chevozorov, were present for the remarks.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nBiden kicks off speech with a joke\n\nAs Biden reaches the podium, he quips: \"If I were smart I'd go home now.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, standing over Biden's left shoulder, cracks a smile.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDemocrats chant 'four more years'\n\nAs President Joe Biden made his way down the aisle in the House chamber, Democrats erupted in chants of \"four more years!\" dispelling at least any public perception of Democratic concerns about the president's reelection prospects.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, looked on silently.\n\n– Riley Beggin and Ken Tran\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona is SOTU designated survivor\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona is the designated survivor for this year’s State of the Union.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members. The practice ensures that someone in the line of presidential succession is always available to assume the presidency if the worst-case scenario happens.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJoe Biden has arrived to applause from both sides of the aisle\n\nJoe Biden is now on the House floor to raucous applause from Democrats – and at least some from Republicans.\n\nUpon entering the chamber, Biden greeted Republicans and was seen in a long conversation with ultraconservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden's cabinet has arrived\n\nPresident Joe Biden's cabinet has entered the House floor, to a lot of cheering from Democrats.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the reception wasn't as warm from Republicans, who stood in silence besides the few who did applaud.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden bypasses protesters en route to Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:59 p.m., just 10 minutes after departing the White House.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters blocked parts of Pennsylvania Avenue, a major street that connects the White House to the Capitol and is the route usually taken by the presidential motorcade when heading to the Capitol.\n\nReporters traveling with Biden said the motorcade took a different route that bypassed the protests.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nSCOTUS arrives at State of the Union\n\nThe Supreme Court justices have arrived on the House floor ahead of Joe Biden's speech, to bipartisan applause.\n\nSort of.\n\nNoticeably not as many Democrats opted to cheer compared to Republicans as the justices walked down the aisle. The court's 6-3 conservative majority has been a frequent point of criticism from Democratic lawmakers, especially after the court overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the constitutional right to an abortion, in 2022.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden en route to Capitol\n\nJoe Biden’s motorcade departed the White House at 8:49 p.m. for the short ride to the Capitol, where he will deliver his State of the Union address.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGOP lawmaker wears Donald Trump T-shirt\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, one of former President Donald Trump's most outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill, is wearing a T-shirt sporting Trump's booking photo with the caption \"NEVER SURRENDER\" along with a bowtie with an American flag pattern.\n\nTrump took the photo in association with the criminal charges he faces in Georgia. The former president is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from Joe Biden in the Peach State.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nProtestors host “People’s State of the Union”\n\nA group of protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Middle East gathered outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of Biden’s speech for an event dubbed the “People’s State of the Union.”\n\nProtestors attempting to block Biden’s motorcade in Washington chanted “free, free Palestine,” some wearing t-shirts that read “Biden’s legacy = genocide.”\n\nIfNotNow, an organization made up of Jewish American activists, took credit for displaying banners calling for a cease-fire on nearby freeways earlier in the day on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nKamala Harris, senators arrive ahead of Joe Biden's State of the Union\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, joined by senators, have arrived to the House floor after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the lower chamber into order to introduce them.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vs. Donald Trump polls\n\nNow that Joe Biden and Donald Trump are expected to face off in November, where do the rivals stand in the polls?\n\nIn a hypothetical general election match-up, Trump leads Biden by 1.8 percentage points, according to a Real Clear Politics average of nationwide polls. But keep in mind that's within the margin of error of many surveys.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat does SOTU mean?\n\nIf you're keeping up with Joe Biden's State of the Union address tonight, you're probably going to see four letter a lot: SOTU. If you need a primer, SOTU stands for State of the Union.\n\nAnother acronym you might see tonight: POTUS. That stands for president of the United States.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhy are women wearing white at the State of the Union?\n\nIn the House chamber, where Biden is expected to speak in less than an hour, several female House Democratic lawmakers are dressed in all-white to commemorate the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden expected to slam Republicans for rejecting bipartisan border deal\n\nJoe Biden is likely to criticize Republican lawmakers on Thursday for rejecting a bipartisan border security deal that Senate conservatives killed earlier this month.\n\nRepublicans initially demanded that border security policies be attached to additional foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that Biden requested last year. After months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of senators released an agreement that would have significantly restricted asylum and created a new emergency mechanism to stop migrants from illegally entering the country.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump came out against the provisions, and many Republicans followed suit. House leaders declared it “dead on arrival” in their chamber, and Senate Republicans abandoned it when it became clear it wouldn’t get the support of a majority of their conference.\n\nDemocrats have since seized on the turnaround, arguing Republicans aren’t serious about their claims of urgency at the border. Republicans, however, are also expected to bite back: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., is expected to say Biden “invited” the border crisis and describe it as “despicable” and “a disgrace” in prepared remarks of the formal GOP response.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat time does the State of the Union address start?\n\nThe State of the Union address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nJoe Biden will begin addressing lawmakers and Americans across the country after he enters the halls of Congress alongside officials from all three branches of America's government.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden set to address IVF after Alabama Supreme Court ruling\n\nAs Joe Biden addresses the nation Thursday in his State of the Union speech, hopeful parents and medical experts will be looking for signs that access to IVF, or in vitro fertilization is not in jeopardy.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The court’s ruling alarmed prospective parents and IVF clinics, and the real-world consequences were immediate. At least three Alabama medical facilities halted in vitro fertilization treatments.\n\nThe issue is sure to take center stage during Biden's speech. Among the guests joining first lady Jill Biden is Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the court's decision.\n\nThere is a good chance that Biden will emphasis her experience as yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nGeorge Santos is back on Capitol Hill for State of the Union\n\nFormer Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House last year for fabricating his background and his sweeping criminal charges, is back on Capitol Hill today for the State of the Union address.\n\nOne House Republican told USA TODAY that Santos “should stay away.”\n\nBut, the Republican joked, his return is fitting since “he’s already delivered a State of the Union address,” referencing the embattled for lawmaker's lies.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat notable guests are attending the State of the Union?\n\nEvery year, invited guests are an important part of the messaging strategy for the president’s State of the Union speech. This year, the First Lady Jill Biden's guest list reflects key themes Joe Biden is expected to address, including the conflict in the Middle East, the student debt crisis, reproductive rights, and other top issues.\n\nAmong her 20 invitees are:\n\nShawn Fain of Detroit, Michigan.

Frank\n\nRepublican response to focus on economy, border\n\nKatie Britt will call Joe Biden “a dithering and diminished leader” during the Republican response to the State of the Union this evening, according to advance excerpts from her speech.\n\n“America deserves leaders who recognize that secure borders, stable prices, safe streets, and a strong defense are the cornerstones of a great nation,” she says in prepared remarks.\n\nThe 42-year-old first-term senator also plans to touch on border security, the economy and crime, painting a picture of the country “at a crossroads,” choosing between a bright future or “an America in decline.”\n\nBritt will speak shortly after Biden’s remarks conclude.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nBiden's crucial SOTU: Addressing age, the economy, and Donald Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden faces a pivotal State of the Union address Thursday as he looks to silence skeptics about his ability to keep serving, convince restless Americans of a strong economy and reestablish the stakes of a likely rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nIn what could be his final State of the Union address, the moment could not be much bigger for Biden, who is saddled with challenges at home and abroad.\n\nBiden hears heckling regularly from pro-Palestinian protesters as he tries to navigate the U.S. role in the Israel-Hamas war without further alienating his liberal base.\n\nHe's been unable to assuage concerns about his age and ability to effectively serve another four years. Despite a booming stock market and historically low unemployment, Biden isn't getting credit for an economic rebound. His approval rating, already hovering in the low 40s for two years, dipped even lower in recent weeks.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden housing plan set for State of the Union\n\nTimes are tough for homebuyers and renters. Between high mortgage rates, lack of availability, skyrocketing home prices and dire rental prices, housing costs are devouring the American pocketbook.\n\nWith the dismal housing outlook weighing on family budgets, President Joe Biden will use his State of the Union speech Thursday to showcase plans to help Americans obtain mortgages and to push down monthly rents, according to the White House.\n\nBiden will call on Congress to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide first-time middle-class homebuyers an annual tax credit of $5,000 for two years.\n\nThis would effectively reduce the mortgage rate by more than 1.5 percentage points, the White House said, and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first home over the next two years.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden will address abortion rights, economy in SOTU\n\nAccording to excerpts released ahead of his speech, Biden will highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights against Trump.\n\nAccording to excerpts, Biden will also highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights, vowing to codify abortion rights if given a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\n“Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,” Biden will say. “But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\nBiden will also tout the “greatest story never told” as he talks about the nation’s economic rebound following the pandemic.\n\n“Let’s tell that story here and now,” Biden will say. “America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down, investing in all of America – in all Americans – to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden to reject ‘an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution’ in State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden will say he rejects “an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution” during Thursday’s State of the Union address as he frames a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, according to excerpts released by the White House, will say his life has taught him to “embrace freedom and democracy” and values such as honesty, equality and giving everyone a fair shot.\n\n“Now some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s not me,” Biden is expected to say.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is a designated survivor?\n\nMembers of Joe Biden’s Cabinet are expected to attend tonight’s speech at the U.S. Capitol, but one of them – a “designated survivor” – will be watching from a secret location.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members. The practice ensures that someone in the line of presidential succession is always available to assume the presidency if the worst-case scenario happens.\n\nThe White House hasn’t said who this year’s designated survivor will be. During last year’s address, the designee was Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. In 2022, it was Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTonight's State of the Union is happening later in the year than usual\n\nTonight’s State of the Union address is only the second to take place during March since 1964. The first was Biden’s speech in 2022. Last year, Biden delivered his address on Feb. 7.\n\nPresidents have mostly delivered their State of the Union speeches in January, but some have taken place in February in recent years, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nThis year’s scheduling allows Biden to address the American public two days after winning several state primary elections on Super Tuesday. In contrast, Trump delivered his State of the Union speech a month before Super Tuesday took place in 2020.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHouse Republicans donning badges with Laken Riley's name\n\nAhead of Biden's State of the Union address, House Republicans are wearing pins and badges bearing Laken Riley's name. Riley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are handing out pins and badges to their fellow Republican colleagues as the GOP continues to focus on the crisis on the southern border as a messaging point against Biden.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow long have previous State of the Unions lasted?\n\nState of the Union speeches typically range from about 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes. Biden’s previous addresses each lasted more than an hour. In 2022, he spoke for just over an hour and in 2023 he spoke for an hour and 13 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nFormer President Richard Nixon delivered the shortest State of the Union address in 1972, speaking for under 29 minutes. Former President Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech. During his 1995 and 2000 addresses, he spoke for close to an hour and a half.\n\nBiden is the most talkative president in recent memory in terms of the actual number of words spoken in his speeches.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow can I stream the State of the Union?\n\nThe State of the Union address will be streamed on the USA TODAY YouTube channel and through the USA TODAY channel on your smart television.\n\n– James Powel\n\nState of the Union bingo: Everything you need to play during Joe Biden's speech\n\nIt's time to play State of the Union bingo! You know − the game where you play along as Joe Biden gives his annual address to the nation.\n\nIn his State of the Union address, Biden is expected to speak about domestic and international challenges. We've done our best guess to compile a list, or rather bingo cards, of talking points or phrases Biden probably will use.\n\nPick a card and cross off a square every time Biden brings up one of the statements or terms to claim political victory over your opponents.\n\nWho is Katie Britt?\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Thursday evening.\n\nBut who is the first-term lawmaker? Britt, 42, is the youngest Republican woman to ever be elected to the upper chamber and is considered a rising star among a party dominated by older men. On Thursday night, she'll also offer a contrast to President Joe Biden, the oldest sitting president in American history.\n\nShe has two children still in middle and high school and said in a statement ahead of the speech that the Republican Party is the party of \"hard-working parents and families.\"\n\nBritt's speech will come just over two weeks after the Supreme Court in her home state issued a decision that rocked families across the country: The Alabama high court determined that frozen embryos used in IVF are children and have legal protections under state law.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden’s State of the Union address to focus on four themes\n\nThe White House briefed Democratic congressional aides on Thursday morning about Joe Biden’s address and outlined key themes of his speech, according to a person in the briefing. A slideshow, shared with USA TODAY, was presented to staffers read out four themes:\n\nProgress and possibility\n\nDefend democracy and freedom\n\nEconomy from middle out, bottom up\n\nMove the country forwards, not backwards\n\nThe presentation also alluded to the presidential election and former President Donald Trump. Another slide in the presentation read that the “key message” after Biden’s address will be that “there’s a clear contrast” and “competing visions for the country.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDonald Trump to prod Joe Biden during State of the Union\n\nRest assured: The 2024 Republican frontrunner will not stay silent during Biden's speech tonight.\n\nDonald Trump says he and his staff will provide running (critical) commentary on social media as Biden delivers the State of the Union.\n\n\"We did this once before to tremendous success,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. The former president on Thursday also put out a \"prebuttal\" video statement, mostly hitting Biden over immigration and border security.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHow long is SOTU?\n\nLast year, President Biden spoke for one hour and 13 minutes according to UC Santa Barbara's \"American Presidency Project.\" The shortest State of the Union address (00:28:55) was given by President Richard Nixon in 1972. Bill Clinton gave the longest-ever State of the Union address (01:28:49) in 2000.\n\nMore than a speech:5 things Biden really needs to do in the State of the Union\n\nIt's not just what he'll say to a joint session of Congress Thursday. It's also how he looks and sounds to perhaps his biggest TV audience of the year.\n\n− Carli Pierson\n\nWhat is the State of the Union? Why is it important?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nJerry said the State of the Union often provides a spotlight for the president to reference values such as unity or American innovation. She said it also provides a \"unique opportunity for Americans and people around the world to see how this checks and balances system of our government works.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/12/israel-war-hamas-gaza-live-updates/71151815007/", "title": "Israel war news updates: Israel orders the evacuation of Gaza City", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from the Israel-Hamas war from Thursday, Oct. 12. For the latest news and updates on the conflict in Israel, read USA TODAY's live coverage for Friday, Oct. 13.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces called for the evacuation of all civilians in Gaza City early Friday, on the heels of what the United Nations said was a warning they received from Israel to evacuate 1.1 million people living in the north of Gaza within 24 hours.\n\nThe military warned civilians that the armed forces would be operating in the city in the following days. \"This evacuation is for your own safety,\" the Israeli military said in a warning it said was sent to Gaza City civilians.\n\nThe broader order was delivered to the U.N., according to United Nations spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric, who called the order “impossible” without “devastating humanitarian consequences.”\n\n\"This is chaos, no one understands what to do,\" said Inas Hamdan, an officer at the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency in Gaza City while she grabbed whatever she could throw into her bags as the panicked shouts of her relatives could be heard around her. She said all the U.N. staff in Gaza City and northern Gaza had been told to evacuate south to Rafah.\n\nAlarmed civilians and aid workers, who were already in distress from Israeli airstrikes and a blockade, were sent into chaos. Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza City, told The Associated Press through tears that there was no way one million people could evacuate that fast.\n\n“Forget about food, forget about electricity, forget about fuel. The only concern now is just if you make it, if you’re going to live,” Farsakh said.\n\nFarsakh said many medics were refusing to evacuate hospitals and abandoned patients, which included the elderly, children, and many wounded civilians.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately confirm the broader evacuation order but the alert could signal an imminent ground offensive. Israel has been bombarding Gaza with airstrikes and on Thursday an airstrike killed at least 45 people in a Gaza refugee camp Thursday, the territory's interior ministry said, potentially stoking global protests a former Hamas leader has called for that have provoked fears among travelers.\n\nMinistry spokesman Eyad Bozum told The Associated Press the late-afternoon airstrike hit the al-Shihab family house at the center of the densely populated Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza, adding that the death toll would probably rise.

On Wednesday, the State Department raised its alert level for American travelers to Israel and the West Bank, urging them to reconsider their plans. Travel advisories already are in place urging increased caution for U.S. citizens traveling to Jordan and Turkey and advising them to reconsider travel to Egypt and Lebanon because of terrorism.\n\n\"Terrorists may attack with little or no warning,\" the agency warns.\n\nThe uncertainty follows a trip to Israel by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met Thursday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv in a show of support. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to arrive in Israel on Friday to discuss military aid.\n\nBlinken is continuing his trip with stops in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, seeking to prevent the conflict from escalating and pursue the release of hostages.\n\nIsrael says siege will continue until hostages are freed\n\nThe Israeli siege of Gaza has left its 2.3 million people desperate for food, fuel and medicine while hospitals get overwhelmed amid relentless bombing and lack of power. Those conditions won't improve until Hamas militants free the approximately 150 hostages captured in the weekend assault, Israel officials said. Israel has halted deliveries of basic necessities and electricity to Gaza, and Egypt has enforced a blockade. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade, restricting the passage of people and goods in and out of the territory,\n\n“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.\n\nAids organizations are warning of a humanitarian crisis as resources become increasingly scarce, and what's available is hard to access because of airstrikes that have involved 6,000 munitions, according to the Israeli military.\n\n“We can’t flee because anywhere you go, you are bombed,” Khalil Abu Yahia said from a refugee camp in north Gaza. “You need a miracle to survive here.”\n\n$6 billion in unfrozen funds not released to Iran for now\n\nIran, long a financial and military supporter of Hamas but not directly linked so far to Saturday's attacks, won't have access for a while to the $6 billion unfrozen by the U.S. as part of a prisoner exchange last month.\n\nThe U.S. has reached a deal with Qatar, where the funds are held, not to release them for the time being, a U.S. official said Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration has being criticized for the agreement with Iran, which freed five detained Americans, and Hamas' weekend onslaught in Israel has only sharpened Republican rebukes. Administration officials say Iran will only be allowed to spend the money, which is not technically refrozen but inaccessible, for humanitarian needs.\n\n\"Funds from that account are overseen by the Treasury Department, can only be dispensed for humanitarian goods — food, medicine, medical equipment — and never touch Iranian hands,” Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nBlinken meets with Netanyahu in Israel\n\nBlinken expressed U.S. solidarity with Israel, its military operations in Gaza and its goal of destroying the militant Hamas organization during his meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.\n\n\"Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews,\" Blinken said. \"No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or return to the conditions that allowed it to take place.\"\n\nThe war has already claimed over 2,500 lives on both sides. International aid groups warn that the death toll may rise after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity to Gaza.\n\nBlinken said victims from Saturday's attack include citizens from 36 nations. He said Hamas, instead of promoting the well-being of Gazans, rules repressively and funnels resources to \"terror tunnels and rockets.\"\n\nBlinken said the Israeli government shared photos and videos of Hamas' atrocities and called them \"overwhelming.''\n\n\"A baby, an infant, riddled with bullets. Soldiers beheaded. Young people burned alive in their cars or in their highway runs,'' Blinken said. \"It's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way.''\n\nSocial media site X says it is removing war disinformation\n\nThe social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, has removed or labeled tens of thousands of pieces of \"illegal\" content that encouraged violence or misrepresents the war, CEO Linda Yaccarino said. Yaccarino released a statement in response to a warning from the European Commission that X could face penalties if it did not take action against \"illegal content and disinformation\" since Hamas' attack on Israel.\n\n\"There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time,\" Yaccarino's statement said.\n\nUS brings 'massive' firepower to region as deterrent\n\nAustin plans to meet with military and civilian leaders to signal the depth of the U.S. commitment to Israel and to assess its requests for security assistance, according to a senior Defense official.\n\nIsrael has received its first shipment of weaponry this week, according to the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Israel has sought missile interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system, precision-guided munitions and artillery shells. Shipments from Pentagon supplies are expected to be continuous, the official said.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. military continued to build a “massive amount” of firepower in the Middle East this week as a warning to adversaries not to attack Israel, the official said. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and the ships in its strike group are operating in the eastern Mediterranean with intelligence and long-range strike capabilities, the official said. In addition, a squadron of A-10 ground-attack aircraft arrived in the region Thursday.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nAcross US, families wait for news about loved ones in Israel\n\nGillian Kaye awoke Saturday to a nightmare: Her stepson was missing.\n\nSagui Dekel-Chen, 35, was last seen by his family early that morning in Israel when Hamas destroyed his home as part of an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns near the border with Gaza. He lived at kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, two daughters, and 400 others until it was decimated by the militant group, leaving only around 160 people alive and accounted for.\n\n“This is so unfathomable,” said Kaye, a resident of Sarasota, Florida who was traveling when she learned of the assault.\n\nDekel-Chen, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, is among an estimated 130 missing Israelis following the attacks.\n\nAccording to his family, he sent his wife and children to the house’s bomb shelter while he confronted the attackers upstairs. Kaye and her family are urging Americans to write to their representatives in Congress to bolster search and rescue efforts. With no information about her stepson's whereabouts, Kaye said spreading the word is the only course of action.\n\n“We do what needs to get done,” Kaye said. “And what needs to get done is to do everything possible to get Sagui home.”\n\n− Heather Bushman, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nFBI provides expertise in finding hostages\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department has been working with families of missing Americans to locate their loved ones, including those taken hostage. The department offered Israel assistance through the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, Operational Security Division and Laboratory Division.\n\n“These highly trained hostage rescue specialists and other experts stand ready to advise their Israeli counterparts to help locate and bring home missing U.S. citizens,” said Garland, whose ancestors fled religious persecution in Eastern Europe.\n\n“And, as always, we remain focused on the threat terrorism poses to our country,” Garland added.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nA summary of Israel-Hamas war\n\nHamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks since the militant group was formed in 1987. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says Saturday's attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel, the blood enemy of Hamas. The attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nBy land, sea, air and online:How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian enclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since Israel was founded in 1948 and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip. Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem. Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. Prompted by the Holocaust, the UN United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish.\n\nWar quickly broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, leading to Israeli expansion three-quarters of Palestinian mandate territory. Over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N. Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories that had been sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. But Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/10/03/mental-health-puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona/8080396001/", "title": "'A terrible cycle': Hurricane Fiona, natural disasters expose mental ...", "text": "In the days after Hurricane Fiona, Dr. Brenda Rivera-García sat at home without electricity, water and Wi-Fi in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nShe was stuck listening to the hum of generators powering households across the neighborhood, drowning out the cheerful coquis that chirp throughout the night.\n\nThe sad hum, the droning \"lullaby,\" mirrored the island's collective grief, Rivera-García said.\n\n“It’s one thing after the other. There is so much you can take,” said Rivera-García, senior director of Latin America and Caribbean programing at Americares, a health-focused disaster relief nonprofit.\n\nPuerto Ricans may be facing a mental health crisis, experts say, as hurricanes, earthquakes, and a global pandemic have traumatized island residents, destroyed homes and ripped families apart over the last five years.\n\nThe inadequate local and federal responses to these natural disasters adds another layer of despair as many Puerto Ricans struggle with the island's economic and political status as a U.S. territory.\n\n“There’s a real sense of uncertainty of the future of Puerto Rico,” said Daniel Gaztambide, clinical psychologist and assistant director of the clinical psychology program at the New School in New York City. “There has to be a response to address the immediate natural disaster and a response to address the past, present, and ongoing political disaster.”\n\n'We owe Puerto Rico a hell of a lot':Biden will visit to assess Fiona recovery efforts\n\nRise in anxiety and depression\n\nPuerto Rico’s Mental Health and Anti-Addiction Services Administration (known as the Spanish acronym, ASSMCA) said calls to its crisis hotline have skyrocketed since Hurricane Fiona hit the island.\n\nThe hotline received nearly 3,000 calls in the five days after the storm, with over 1,900 related to Fiona, ASSMCA director Dr. Carlos Rodriguez Mateos told USA TODAY. That’s double what the hotline typically gets in a normal week.\n\n“We’ve seen through those calls how feelings of sadness, anxiety, fear, insecurity, uneasiness, and even loss of appetite have all increased,” he said. “And that all coincides with the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Maria.”\n\nHurricane Maria hit the island on Sept. 20, 2017, as a Category 4 storm. Rodriguez Mateos said calls to the hotline have increased after every major natural disaster in Puerto Rico, which tracks with studies showing how mental health on the island has suffered since Hurricane Maria.\n\nA survey by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation found more than one-fifth of the island’s residents reported needing or receiving mental health services a year after the disaster.\n\nThose who may need mental health and psychosocial support services include students and frontline workers, Rivera-García said.\n\n“Those are some of the populations that we need to start thinking about really carefully,” she said. “Our first responder and health care workers have been on the frontlines of everything while still being survivors themselves.”\n\nAnother study by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign showed more than 49% of workers in Puerto Rico met the diagnostics criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder a year after the disaster.\n\n'Humanitarian and economic crisis':5 years later, Puerto Ricans are still struggling with Hurricane Maria's devastation. Then came Hurricane Fiona.\n\n'Colonialism within America':After Hurricane Fiona, will Puerto Rico ever become a state or an independent nation?\n\n“Abandonment issues among the elderly are some of the things that we also need to consider,” Rivera-García said, as many young families migrate from Puerto Rico to the mainland in search of stability, leaving their loved ones behind.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Maria, more than 123,000 Puerto Ricans permanently relocated to U.S. states, especially New York and Florida, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\n\nMental health services shouldn't be limited to Puerto Ricans on the island, experts say. Dr. Luis Rodriguez, CEO and president of the Puerto Rican Family Institute, said he still wrestles with his own complicated feelings years after leaving.\n\n“I love Puerto Rico, I love to go to Puerto Rico and every time I leave, I feel so sad,” he said. “The guilt comes back. It’s a cycle, it’s a terrible cycle.”\n\n‘Colonial melancholy’\n\nThe immediate impacts of the storm aren’t the only sources of stress for Puerto Ricans, mental health experts say. Many criticize the lack of political and economic response to past natural disasters and worry history will repeat itself.\n\n“The last time this happened, we had a sitting president who threw rolls of Bounty at people,” Gaztambide said. “Recent history gives us some pause, some anxiety, and anticipation of what the U.S. response is going to be.”\n\nThe federal response after Maria was considered slow compared with aid provided after similar disasters in the U.S. mainland, according to critics. It took nearly a year to completely restore power across the island, becoming the largest blackout in U.S. history and the second-largest in the world, according to the Rhodium Group, a policy analysis firm.\n\nPreparing for another setback:Puerto Rico's schools struggled long before Hurricane Fiona. Now they need more help\n\nHow can I help?:Mutual aid, nonprofits to support Puerto Rico after Hurricane Fiona\n\nThe Puerto Rican government in 2020 signed a 15-year contract with LUMA Energy, a Canadian-American company that pledged to reduce power interruptions. Despite the contract, rolling blackouts persisted. Over the past year, Puerto Ricans have repeatedly protested against the energy company. Last month, hundreds gathered outside the governor’s mansion in San Juan, calling on Gov. Pedro Pierluisi to cancel LUMA’s contract.\n\nBefore Fiona made landfall Sept. 18, it provoked a general blackout affecting the entire U.S. territory of 3.2 million people. Two weeks later, LUMA restored power to about 92% of the island, according to a statement sent to USA TODAY Sunday.\n\n“When Fiona went down, that accentuated a lot of pain and anger because there’s a sense of helplessness here,\" Gaztambide said. “It’s a colonial melancholy.\"\n\nJenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, Puerto Rico's nonvoting congressional representative and an advocate for statehood, told NPR there’s \"a direct connection\" between Puerto Rico's governmental status and its 47% poverty rate.\n\n“It’s a colonial relationship that makes it so a select class in Puerto Rico can become very wealthy while the rest of the population struggles,” Gaztambide said.\n\nResilient people\n\nASSMCA prepared for the expected emotional toll from Fiona by rolling out a mental health campaign prior to the storm, Rodriguez Mateos said.\n\nThe agency launched it on social media and dispatched mental health providers – including psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and clinicians – to shelters in areas that saw Fiona's biggest impact. As shelters closed, providers knocked on doors.\n\n“We have personnel going house to house, to identify resources and do early interventions,” Rodriguez Mateos said. “Providing tools and hope.”\n\nIn addition to social support, Gaztambide said it's also important to stay connected with loved ones on the island and on the mainland. He suggests connecting with local resource providers, places of worship, or community organizations that can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and fear.\n\nIt's normal to feel anxious and depressed after a natural disaster, health experts said. It's important that Puerto Ricans address and validate those emotions, Gaztambide said.\n\n“There is no 5-minute mindfulness exercise to forget about colonialism,” he said. “Let there be room to be angry, to be really upset, and really sad about what’s happening and allow that anger to be a source for others to call for what we deserve and demand.”\n\nThe island may be facing a mental health crisis but Gaztambide said Puerto Ricans are uniquely resilient and he's hopeful for the future.\n\n“There is going to be pain and there is going to be this anxiety and sense of sadness and depression,” he said. “At the same time, we are a very resilient people and we have been through much in the 500-plus years that Puerto Rico has been in existence.\n\n“We’re still standing and figuring out a way to take care of ourselves and each other.”\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

This is on top of the normal annual rate of separations from military service. On Veterans Day, let’s think about all America’s soldiers who are receiving pink slips.\n\nMembers of the military receive rigorous training from a very selective institution, and they served their country under difficult circumstances that required adaptability, perseverance, teamwork and maturity. What more could an employer want?\n\nIt would seem a lot more. Despite the many veteran employment initiatives out there — put forward by the White House, mayors’ offices, corporations and nonprofit organizations — it’s still difficult for veterans to find work, let alone jobs that use their skills well. The Syracuse University Institute for Veterans and Military Families offers one explanation that applies to me and other veterans I’ve talked to: Many veterans take work that is a poor fit for their knowledge, skills, ability and experience. This leads to dissatisfaction, lower performance and job-hopping.\n\nIf you were a helicopter mechanic in the military, then it makes sense to seek work fixing helicopters as a civilian. It’s harder for veterans whose primary military job skills don’t directly translate to the civilian workforce. As an infantry officer for the Army (who left before the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan started), my work included managing a fleet of armored vehicles, supervising the distribution of water in Honduras, and assisting a State Department official in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When I completed the coursework for my doctorate degree in public health, I started applying for emergency management and disaster services positions.\n\nI wasn’t even getting called for job interviews, though. Rather, I’d get letters saying that I met the education and skill requirements, but didn’t have the “right” experience for a job. They were looking for specific junior job titles on my resume that I would never have unless I was to start at the lowest rung of the career ladder at 41 years old.\n\nI ended up getting two jobs precisely because I am a veteran. One employer had a contract with the Army and needed someone who could “speak Army.” I became highly prized for my ability to produce PowerPoint slides and “decision-support matrices” according to Army norms. I got my second job when a mentor introduced me to an organization that serves veterans and their families and they created a position just for me. The problem was they didn’t know what to do with me. During the first three months, I only worked on occasional tasks and found myself unable to tell others what my job was because I didn’t have an official description or direct supervisor. Things finally changed for the better only after I explained that I needed a project and accountability.\n\nMichael Poyma, an employment specialist for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Michigan, has heard many stories similar to mine. And he thinks some of the most common approaches to matching veteran job seekers and employers need to be rethought. For example, both job seekers and employers have told Poyma that many job fairs are a waste of time. While some people find jobs this way, it’s a drop in the bucket.\n\nPoyma and others have also noted that veterans gravitate in disproportionate numbers toward certain fields: government service, law enforcement, government contracting, work with veterans. These jobs allow veterans to continue working in a familiar environment related to public service.\n\nBut isolation can just entrench the misunderstanding. This is why Chris Marvin of Got Your 6, and previously, The Mission Continues, has embarked on projects to help veterans integrate fully into the civilian world that they have rejoined. The Mission Continues, for instance, puts veterans to work painting houses, tending community gardens, or mentoring kids at a wide range of community and nonprofit organizations.\n\nPoyma and other VA representatives are about to start pilot seminars that will seat potential employers and veterans on opposite sides of the room, separated by a “demilitarized zone.” He will conduct exercises to dismantle the demilitarized zone by discussing systemic barriers to employment, the stigmas that follow veterans, and each side’s particular acronyms and jargon. In the end, he hopes to demonstrate that there is hidden value in a veteran’s resume if employers will only take the time to look.\n\nStajura is a doctoral candidate at the University of California-Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health.

The Holy Orthodox Order of the Holy Great Martyr George confirmed the bombing, adding that more than 500 people were being housed at the church and monastery.\n\n\"The bombs hit the two church halls where the refugees, including children and babies, were sleeping. Presently, survivors are searching the rubble for other casualties,\" the order said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe blast comes after an explosion Tuesday that rocked the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, in whose compound many Palestinians had been seeking refuge from the persistent Israeli bombardment. According to a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis, the death toll was on the \"low end\" of 100 to 300.\n\nThe incident triggered outrage across the Middle East, as Hamas and Israel blamed each other for the attack. Since the war began on Oct. 7, the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said 3,785 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12,500 others have been wounded. And in Israel, more than 1,400 people have been killed.\n\nIsrael’s defense minister has told troops to be ready for a ground offensive in Gaza but he has not said when the assault will begin.

The aid deal struck Wednesday had included a stipulation that roads essential to the flow of aid would first be fixed.\n\n∎ Israeli Minister of Economy Nir Barkat told reporters the military, not political leaders, will decide when to invade Gaza. \"The Israeli government made a decision, they green-lighted the army, 'Wipe them out,' and now it's in the hands of the army,'' he said.\n\n∎ More than 100 retired U.S. generals have signed an open letter from the Washington-based Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs calling on President Joe Biden and Congress to give Israel all the support it needs militarily, diplomatically and logistically against the \"Iran-backed terrorist threats that surround it on all sides.\"\n\n∎ The U.S. is waiving travel visa requirements for Israelis earlier than expected.\n\n∎ Hamas fighters likely fired North Korean weapons during their Oct. 7 assault on Israel, a video and weapons seized by Israel show, despite Pyongyang’s denials that it arms the militant group. South Korean officials, two experts on North Korean arms and an Associated Press analysis of weapons captured on the battlefield by Israel point toward Hamas using Pyongyang’s F-7 rocket-propelled grenade, a shoulder-fired weapon that fighters typically use against armored vehicles.\n\nGaza's dwindling water, electricity supply could turn hospitals into 'morgues'\n\nIsrael bombing Gaza 'safe zones' in south\n\nNo place was safe for more than 2 million Palestinians as Israeli bombs slammed the Gaza Strip, including parts of the Palestinian territory that Israel had declared “safe zones.”\n\nAt least 12 people were killed and dozens wounded when a residential building in the southern city of Khan Younis was struck, medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said. The intensified shelling came one day after Israel agreed to allow limited shipments of humanitarian aid into southern Gaza from Egypt.\n\n“Israeli Air Forces continued to strike southern areas despite the directive for people in #Gaza to move south,” the UN Relief and Works Agency said. The agency said at least 14 of its own staff had been killed and nine more wounded − adding that the “actual number is likely to be much higher” − in less than two weeks since a stunning, bloody incursion of Hamas militants killed more than 1,000 Israeli citizens and fueled military reprisals from Israel.\n\nThe commander of the Hamas-led National Security Forces, Maj. Gen. Jihad Muheisen, was killed in an Israeli strike on his Gaza City home along with some relatives, Hamas said. Israel Defense Forces says it is attacking Hamas militants wherever they hide in Gaza and has accused the militants of taking shelter among the civilian population.\n\nThe death toll of Israelis and Palestinians surpassed 5,000, making the conflict the deadliest of five wars involving the narrow, densely populated strip of land bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nUS issues 'worldwide' travel caution\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Thursday issued a \"worldwide caution\" for U.S. travelers. The travel advisory cites \"increased tensions in various locations around the world, the potential for terrorist attacks, demonstrations or violent actions against U.S. citizens and interests.\"\n\nThe agency urges Americans overseas to exercise increased caution and stay alert in known tourist spots that might be attractive targets. It also suggests travelers sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive information and alerts − and to make it easier to locate someone in an emergency overseas.\n\nUS warship shoots down missiles, drones in Red Sea\n\nA U.S. warship in the northern Red Sea shot down three missiles and several drones fired from Yemen, the Pentagon said Thursday, in the latest danger sign of how the Israel-Hamas war could expand into a regional conflict.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said the projectiles were launched by Iranian-backed Houthi militants, who have expressed support for the Palestinians and threatened Israel. Last week, their leader cautioned that they may fire missiles and drones if the U.S. intervened in the war.\n\nA U.S. official told The Associated Press the missiles were likely not aimed at the USS Carney, the Navy destroyer that intercepted them over the water. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations that have not been made public.\n\n“We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters.\n\nRyder said the Defense Department is still trying to ascertain the missiles' target, adding they were destroyed because their flight pattern indicated a possible threat. He said the U.S. is prepared to do whatever is required “to protect our partners and our interests in this important region.”\n\nHouthi officials declined to comment.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook, Associated Press\n\nUN to supervise aid going into Gaza despite lack of cease-fire\n\nThe United Nations will inspect the trucks bringing in humanitarian aid from Egypt into Gaza and will help oversee the process, but the organization's head would prefer the desperately needed supplies could be carried in under a cease-fire.\n\nThe warring parties have not agreed to suspend hostilities, although a U.N. flag will fly over the Rafah crossing to dissuade Israeli airstrikes. The crossing has been expected to open Friday, but CNN reported that road repairs and other concerns will likely delay that till later in the weekend.\n\n“Civilians in Gaza need core services and supplies, and for that we need rapid and immediate humanitarian access, we need water, food and medicine now,'' U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said. \"We need it at scale, and we need it to be sustained.”\n\nIsrael agreed Wednesday to allow aid into Gaza after a request from Biden, but demanded the assistance not go through its territory, only via Egypt, and that it be kept away from Hamas. Israeli officials have said their siege of the Palestinian territory won't be lifted until Hamas releases the approximately 200 hostages it captured during its Oct. 7 rampage.\n\nOne unresolved issue is whether Israeli will allow fuel into Gaza, a particularly important matter at a time when several hospitals in the territory have closed for lack of diesel. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\nAs war in Israel, Gaza rages onAs war in Israel, Gaza rages on, President Biden is having a moment\n\nUS armored vehicles delivered to Israel\n\nA U.S. cargo plane arrived in Israel carrying the initial shipment of armored vehicles designated to replace vehicles damaged during the war, the Israel Ministry of Defense said Thursday. Armored ambulances, trucks and mechanical engineering equipment are expected to arrive in coming days, the ministry said.\n\nThe first delivery came the day after Biden's trip to Tel Aviv, where he pledged the U.S. would stand by Israel and provide whatever is needed to defend itself in its war with Hamas. Biden said he would seek congressional approval of an \"unprecedented support package\" to bolster Israel's defense.\n\nHe also pledged $100 million in U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nPalestinians, Israelis flee homes\n\nMore than a million people have fled their homes in the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected Israel invasion that seeks to eliminate Hamas’ leadership after its deadly assault. Aid groups warn an Israeli ground offensive could hasten a humanitarian crisis. About 300,000 Israelis have been internally displaced since the start of the war, the Times of Israel reports, citing Israel Democracy Institute research. Most are from southern Israel in the Gaza border towns where Hamas carried out its murderous rampage.\n\nBiden emerges as leading global backer of Israel\n\nThe president has made a sudden transformation from a political figure whose commitment to Israel was often questioned by conservative critics inside and outside the Jewish state to arguably the world's leading champion of Israel outside the Middle East. Biden's actions and words since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, capped by a dramatic visit to Israel on Wednesday, have been lauded even by many of Biden's biggest skeptics in Israel as he stands in solidarity with the country and pledges \"unprecedented\" military assistance.\n\n\"Israelis were hungry for a father figure that will hug them and show empathy. And the president has done that in such a way that really touched every Israeli,\" said Nimrod Novik, a former foreign policy adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and now a fellow with the Israel Policy Forum.\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nGaza hospital explosion:How a deadly blast near al-Ahli center unfolded\n\nPalestinian-Americans face backlash in US\n\nPalestinian Americans are seeing two fronts in the Israel-Hamas war: One is the bloodshed in the Middle East, the other is emotional backlash from bigotry and hate in the U.S.\n\nA U.S. Department of Justice hate crime investigation into the fatal stabbing of a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy in Illinois is one of several incidents of alleged hate being directed at Palestinian Americans, allies and people who look like them since the war began.\n\nThe community feels under siege, American Muslims for Palestine executive director Osama Abu Irshaid told USA TODAY, but at the same time wants to show support and express grief in the crisis.\n\n“They’re not out there to threaten anyone,\" Irshaid said. \"They’re not there to delegitimize another narrative.

It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel became an independent country.\n\nBefore the war began, the IDF had 169,500 active troops and was the 28th largest military in the world by active personnel, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Military Balance 2023.

Live updates\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 by activists connected to the Muslim Brotherhood during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997, and several other nations also consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for the establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material, and logistical support from Iran. So far, however, the U.S. and other nations have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/01/02/japan-coast-guard-plane-crash-graphics/72083108007/", "title": "How the Japan coast guard plane crash unfolded: A visual explanation", "text": "Authorities are investigating the fiery collision Tuesday of a Japan Airlines passenger jet and a Japan Coast Guard plane on a runway at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. The accident killed five people.\n\nFive of six crew members on the Coast Guard plane died. All 379 passengers and crew aboard the JAL flight evacuated to safety. Fourteen passengers on the jet had minor injuries, and the Coast Guard pilot was severely injured.\n\nJapan Airlines Flight JAL-516, an Airbus A350-900, was making a normal landing on Runway C at about 5:47 p.m. local time when the crash occurred.\n\nThe jet caught fire shortly after striking the Coast Guard plane, a turboprop De Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 that was waiting for takeoff. Passengers used evacuation slides to scramble off the jet before it was engulfed in flames.\n\nWhat caused the Japan plane crash?\n\nIt will take time to determine the cause, investigators said. The Coast Guard plane was not equipped with a modern ADS-B transponder, according to Flightradar24, an international flight-tracking service.\n\nADS-B is an acronym for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. It provides a three-dimensional position and identification of aircraft or other vehicles.\n\nADS-B transponders automatically broadcast information about an aircraft, including:\n\nGlobal Positioning System location.\n\nAltitude.\n\nGround speed.\n\nThe information is relayed by satellite-linked GPS to air traffic controllers and other aircraft once every second. It's considered more accurate than conventional radar systems.\n\nThe collision happened after dark. A former commercial pilot told Sky News, a British media company, that the Coast Guard plane's relatively small size and wingspan may have made it difficult to detect.\n\nPassengers told Japan news agencies they felt the impact of the landing and had to leave the jet at the front because the back and middle doors couldn't be opened.\n\nIt took more than 100 firefighting vehicles six hours to extinguish the blaze.\n\nWhere were the planes headed?\n\nThe Coast Guard plane, based at Haneda, was due to deliver relief supplies to people in Niigata after the region was struck by a devastating earthquake Monday. At least 55 people have died.\n\nThe JAL flight was arriving from the New Chitose Airport in Sapporo in the northern region of Hokkaido.\n\nAirbus said it was sending specialists to help in the crash investigation.

Heck, that’s about the average lifespan of the typical family dog. That also happens to be the amount of time fans have waited for the release of Kingdom Hearts III after Kingdom Hearts II.\n\nThink about it.\n\nIf you were 15 years old when you finished the second game back when it came out, you would be 28 years old now. And if you were age 15 when you first played the original Kingdom Hearts in 2002, you’d be about 32 or 31 right now. That’s right, the kids who got into the series when it first came out could very well have kids of their own now (in fact, that’s the case with a family member that I gifted the first KH game to as a birthday present).\n\nThis puts Kingdom Hearts 3 in an interesting spot. One of the trickier things that the game has to deal with is the fact that it basically caters to three different audiences. You have folks like me who were in their 20s when the first game came out. You have those young kids and teens I just mentioned who have since gotten older. Then you have today’s crop of younger kids and teens for whom this is likely their first game in the series.\n\nLike Sorcerer’s Apprentice Mickey suddenly facing a multiplying horde of brooms in Fantasia, I could just see Tetsuya Nomura and his merry band of Kingdom Hearts imagineers mulling how to deal with such an expansive and diverse audience. Apparently, their solution proved to be a simple one. Just make Kingdom Hearts 3, well, a Kingdom Hearts game.\n\nNot to say that this game doesn’t bring anything new to the table. The first thing I noticed was just how visually stunning it is. Remember when cutscenes for games like Final Fantasy 8 were pre-rendered and looked way, way better than the actual character models and environs in the game itself? Well, the regular character models and environs in KH3 put those old cutscenes to even more shame than Cersei Lannister walking through the streets of King's Landing at the end of Game of Thrones' fifth season. Heck, I remember Pixar investing an insane amount of money on technology to create and render the visuals for the first Toy Story. Now you have debates on the Internet on whether Kingdom Hearts III’s Toy Story scenes are better than the original movie’s or not.\n\nKingdom Hearts III, to its credit, boasts visuals that are crisp, vivid and punchy. The fact that it runs on a $300 console makes you realize just how far technology has come. I'm not just talking about the 8-bit days of yore. I'm also talking about the jump from the previous-gen PS3’s cell processor and “Emotion Engine,” which Sony hyped to the moon at the time. During the start of this console generation, I wasn’t that impressed by the visuals of the first batch of games for the PS4 and Xbox One — at least when compared to the changing of the guard from previous console generations. I still remember being wowed by the jump from 8-bit to 16-bit and then the transition to the Saturn, PS1 and Dreamcast. The shift from the PS3 and 360 to the PS4 and Xbox One, on the other hand, didn’t seem like it was as big a leap visually. As current-gen systems reach the tail end of their life, however, games like KH3 show just how much performance developers can squeeze out of the machines. Console performance still is not on the level of a tricked-out PC. But it is mighty impressive for a $300 box (well, $400 in my case with the PS4 Pro).\n\nKingdom Hearts III also does a great job in unifying a smorgasbord of disparate art styles into a cohesive whole. From a world dominated by simpler shapes and childish designs such as Toy Story to the grittier, more realistic style of Pirates of the Caribbean, KH3 incorporates a wide palette of distinctive and — at times — incoherent or disjointed art styles. And yet it manages to make them all work together. These include impressive attention to detail, which you notice when looking up close. I thought Hercules’ design was a bit “meh” at first. Then the camera zoomed in during a cut scene and I could see the textures on his clothes. Even as I laugh sometimes about the preponderance of zippers in this game’s original clothing, I can’t help but be impressed with the level of detail present in KH3.\n\nBesides the little things, Kingdom Hearts 3 handles the big stuff with aplomb as well. From giant boulders raining down as you scale Olympus’ walls to big fights that can be literally and figuratively described as titanic, the production values for KH3 are top notch. Boss battles in the game are like an event, and the use of over-the-top, colorful special attacks that have an almost Disney ride feel make it feel like you’re taking part in an interactive parade at the Magic Kingdom.\n\nThe game also doesn’t tie down its battles to one plane. Kingdom Hearts III loves to make use of all the real estate it can provide, whether it be by land or sea, sky or even space. You’re encouraged to use the environment to zip around or alternate between attacking on the ground or shooting up in the air, giving battles a larger sense of scale and freedom.\n\nWhile Kingdom Heart III’s ambition works well with its visuals, however, it can get a bit convoluted when applied to its combat. There are just so many things going on as well as mechanics you have to keep track of, that it can be a slog to familiarize yourself with everything at first. These include timed inputs, Flowmotion movement, melee, magic switching, link attacks, Keyblade form changes and all sorts of other stuff in between. So much so that it’s easy to get confused and lose track of the action, especially when you’ve got a cornucopia of colors and other stimulus competing on the screen. Having shortcuts help but I literally had to load up the tutorial after taking a break for a few days to review other games, just so I can remember how to do everything again. I also wish you had the option to remap buttons. I’m so used to jumping with the PS4’s X button in other games so I always go through an adjustment phase when switching back to KH3.\n\nEven when you get a hang of the mechanics, however, there’s still what I consider the biggest issue with the game’s combat: its lack of precision. This especially can be a problem when fighting multiple foes on tiered surfaces where you can fall. It feels great when things are working the way you want to and you’re hitting exactly what you want to hit and heading where you want to go. Sometimes, though, I’ll lock-on to an airborne enemy, proceed to home in on it, but it flies off the edge and you end up falling several levels below after you dispatch it. I’ve had this happen a few times after activating a special attack, only to have the attack time out as I try to return to get back up to the mob I was originally fighting. The combat also feels a bit floaty for me. I can play a game like Bayonetta with pinpoint precision, for example, and pretty much have my brain go on autopilot while deftly switching between attacking, dodging and counters and be exactly where I want to be. In KH3, I’ll try to Flowmotion off a pole to pounce on an enemy and half of the time, I end up not quite doing what I wanted to do.\n\nInterestingly, what I enjoyed a lot with the combat are the shooting mechanics or sequences. I especially loved stuff like the Blaster Blaze shooting cart special, the Big Magic Mountain special attack and the Panzer Dragoon-esque sequence during the Pirates of the Caribbean segment of the game. I even liked the Gummi Ship shooting portions, which combine mechanics from Star Fox, Galaga and a few other games. These just felt simple and to the point, and I could cut loose without having to worry about a lack of precision or flying off the edge.\n\nThe other major part of Kingdom Heart’s three-legged stool is its story. As the KH title that's supposed to provide closure for this particular story arc, the story is probably one of the most anticipated parts of the game from hardcore fans. What happened to Aqua? What’s Ventus’ fate? These are all questions that fans who have stuck with the series have wanted answers to for a long time. For folks who fell in love with the game’s various protagonists, you can even say that its resolution is something personal.\n\nThe good news is that Kingdom Hearts III will finally provide those answers. The bad news? If you’re a newcomer or someone who played the first two games but didn’t keep track of the numerous side games such as Birth By Sleep or Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, it’s like being dropped off in a foreign country where people don’t speak your language. That’s because these side games include some chunky and important exposition that is not present in the first two mainline games. There’s just so much narrative bulk to keep track of that it’s easy to feel lost. Heck, even if you played those other games, so much time has passed that it’s easy to lose track of what happened. Instead of dumping the entire plot on players right from the start, Kingdom Hearts III decides to go the slow and steady route. Honestly, it's likely the best course of action as the series’ plot has transformed into a Gordian Knot at this point, to the point that it feels like a long journey without a map at times. Eventually, though, you start to recognize the route and you’ll make it to your final destination.\n\nIs the payoff worth it? For longtime fans, I’d say it is. Even if you’re new to the series, I believe it’s still a journey worth taking. The Kingdom Hearts series is one of those rare occurrences that required plenty of things to happen at the right time and the right place in order for it to exist. Who knows if we’ll ever see a crossover with the sheer size and scope of this one, especially with a Disney cast? I wish it had more Square Enix characters, to be honest. But it remains a testament to the grand ambition of the minds behind it and their unyielding determination to see it through even after all these years.\n\nUltimately, despite its convoluted story, Kingdom Hearts III is the tale of a boy and his friends out on a grand adventure to save the people they care about. While there are certainly plenty of action-adventure games out there, there aren’t many games like this one. In that sense, it’s almost akin to playing a slice of video game history. Who knows? Perhaps 13 years from now, it’s one most folks will look back on fondly as well.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nKingdom Hearts 3 is no small world after all, featuring a ton of Disney characters and areas for you to connect with. Figuring out the story can be like wrapping your arms around a giant boulder festooned with tons of zippers. The floaty combat also can be a bit slippery to get an adequate handle on at times. It’s stunning visuals, wonderful sound and epic grand scale, however, make this a magic carpet ride you’ll want to get on board with, whether you’re young or young at heart.\n\nRating: 8.5 out of 10\n\n8.5 out of 10 Cost: $59.99; PS4 (reviewed), XB1\n\n$59.99; PS4 (reviewed), XB1 www.kingdomhearts.com/3/us/home/\n\nTechnobubble covers games, gadgets, technology and all things geek.

It has been updated to reflect Florida’s 2023 special legislative session.\n\nCNN —\n\nDisney’s Orlando-area theme parks and who will govern them are under renewed scrutiny in Florida – the latest in a yearlong spat between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s largest private employer.\n\nLawmakers have returned to Tallahassee for a special session called in part to address what happens to Disney’s special taxing district, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, after they previously passed legislation dissolving it, which was supposed to take effect in June.\n\nState Republicans on Monday unveiled a bill to turn over control of Disney’s special taxing district to a five-member board hand-picked by DeSantis and rebrand Reedy Creek the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.”\n\nThe move to take over Reedy Creek comes after DeSantis sparred last year with Disney over a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nHere’s a look at the history of Reedy Creek, why it has become the focus of another special legislative session in Florida, and how proposed changes would give DeSantis more control.\n\nWhat is Reedy Creek?\n\nReedy Creek is the name for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special purpose district created by state law in May 1967 that gives The Walt Disney Company governmental control over the land in and around its central Florida theme parks. The district sits southwest of Orlando.\n\nAt the time, the land was little more than uninhabited pasture and swamp, according to Reedy Creek’s website. With the special purpose district, Disney took over responsibility for providing municipal services like power, water, roads and fire protection – but was also freed from dealing with legal red tape or paying taxes for services that benefited the broader public.\n\nAccording to Richard Foglesong, the author of the book “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando,” Disney had previously had issues with the government of Anaheim, California, at its Disneyland park, completed a decade earlier. With those issues in mind, Disney pushed for a special purpose district in Florida that would give the company the ability to self-govern.\n\nIn exchange, Florida became the home base for Disney World and its millions of tourists.\n\n“Florida needed Disney more than Disney needed Florida,” Foglesong told CNN.\n\nToday, the Reedy Creek special district encompasses about 25,000 acres in Orange and Osceola counties, including four theme parks, two water parks, one sports complex, 175 lane miles of roadway, 67 miles of waterway, and the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, its website says.\n\n“The cooperation and commitment between the Reedy Creek Improvement District and Walt Disney World Company is as strong today as it was when the District was created in 1967,” the Reedy Creek website states. “The result is an example of how a working partnership between business and government can be prosperous for both sides.”\n\nWhy is this an issue now?\n\nLast year, DeSantis challenged lawmakers to unravel the 55-year-old Reedy Creek Improvement Act as part of a special legislative session and ultimately signed a bill that would sunset the district on June 1.\n\nLawmakers left town without a plan to unwind a half-century of Disney control or for how to ensure Orange and Osceola county residents wouldn’t be on the hook for funding Reedy Creek services or its $1 billion in debt. Amid the fallout, Reedy Creek told its bondholders that Florida could not dissolve the district without assuming its debts.\n\nDeSantis repeatedly offered assurances that taxpayers wouldn’t have to pick up the tab.\n\nNow, GOP lawmakers have returned to the state Capitol and are trying to breath new life into the taxing district and keep many of its special powers. The final page of the 189-page bill proposed Monday states: “The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not dissolved as of June 1, 2023, but continues in full force and effect under its new name.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled legislature is likely to pass the proposed changes within the next couple of weeks and the governor is supportive of them.\n\nWhat are lawmakers proposing?\n\nThe bill, introduced Monday by state Rep. Fred Hawkins, seeks to limit the damage that could be done to Disney, one of the state’s most vital tourism engines, and to taxpayers.\n\nThe measure guarantees that the changes to Reedy Creek will not affect the district’s existing debt or any other contracts.\n\nInstead of ending the district, the proposed legislation would rebrand it as the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District” and curb some of its powers, including the ability to build an airport or a nuclear power plant.\n\nThe board, previously made up of Reedy Creek landowners with close ties to Disney, will instead become a five-member board of supervisors appointed by the governor. The bill makes clear that none of the appointees chosen by the governor can be recent Disney employees or their relatives, nor that of a competitor. The state Senate, where Republicans hold a super majority, would have final approval of the appointees.\n\n“These actions ensure a state-controlled district accountable to the people instead of a corporate-controlled kingdom,” DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern said.\n\nWhat has Disney said?\n\nDisney said Monday it is watching the bill.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said the company is “monitoring the progression of the draft legislation, which is complex given the long history of the Reedy Creek Improvement District.”\n\n“Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” Vahle said.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Florida schools?\n\nReedy Creek has been tied to the feud between DeSantis, who has widely been seen as a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, and Disney over a measure that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom.\n\nThe “Parental Rights in Education” bill – which critics have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – was signed into law last March and prohibits schools from teaching children about sexual orientation or gender identity “in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” The legislation also allows parents to bring lawsuits against a school district for potential violations.\n\nThe law’s vague language and the threat of parental lawsuits have raised fears that it will lead to discrimination against LGBTQ students and will have a chilling effect on classroom discussion. DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said on Twitter last year that the legislation would protect kids from “groomers,” a slang term for pedophiles, and described those who oppose the law as “probably groomers.”\n\nBob Chapek, the then-CEO of Disney, which employs 75,000 people in Florida, initially declined to condemn the law last year but reversed course after facing employee criticism. A company spokesperson then released a statement stating its goal was for the law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.\n\n“Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,” the March 2022 statement said. The company said it was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Dianne Gallagher Steve Contorno Jack Forrest", "Eric Levenson", "Dianne Gallagher", "Steve Contorno", "Jack Forrest"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/05/13/tiana-splash-mountain-ride-open-disney-world/73668379007/", "title": "Tiana's Bayou Adventure to open at Disney World in Orlando Florida", "text": "Almost there, it's almost there. The grand opening date for the new \"Tiana's Bayou Adventure\" attraction, which replaced the classic Splash Mountain ride, was finally announced Sunday night on \"American Idol.\"\n\nRight after Jenifer Lewis — the voice of Mama Odie from the Disney movie \"The Princess and the Frog\" — and Terance Blanchard performed a rollicking version of \"Dig a Little Deeper\" for Disney Songbook Night, with a full New Orleans-style jazz band complete with Louis the alligator on trumpet, host Ryan Seacrest joined them to announce some exciting news.\n\n\"The new attraction 'Tiana's Bayou Adventure' will be opening at Walt Disney World in Florida June 28,\" he said, to applause. \"Inspired by 'The Princess and the Frog.' So bring our crew and join Princess Tiana and friends on a thrilling adventure in the bayou where anything can happen.\"\n\nThe attraction also will be opening at Disneyland in California later this year, he said.\n\nWhat is 'Tiana's Bayou Adventure'?\n\nThe new attraction is based on the animated Disney movie \"The Princess and the Frog\" where a New Orleans girl in the 1920s named Tiana gets caught up in a wild chase of magic, parties, princes and powerful voodoo practitioners when all she wants to do is open a restaurant. The setting takes place after the event of the movie.\n\n\"Join Princess Tiana and jazz-loving alligator Louis on their journey through a shimmering bayou as they prepare for a spirited celebration during Mardi Gras season,\" Disney's site said about the ride. \"Along the way, you’ll see familiar faces and make new friends as you’re brought into the next chapter of Tiana’s inspiring story.\"\n\nWhile waiting for the ride, guests will learn about Tiana's efforts to give back to her community through a food co-op as they enjoy the wafting scent of fresh beignets.

James Basket, who won an Oscar for his role as Uncle Remus, an elderly Black man who told stories depicted in colorful animations, did not attend the film's Atlanta premiere because Black people were forced to sit separately in the theater's balcony.\n\nDisney has not publicly connected the change to the controversy over the movie, although a Change.org petition that year called for a change. The company just said the move had already been in the works, although when Disney CEO Bob Iger was asked at a shareholders meeting that year if \"Song of the South\" was going to be added to Disney+ he said, \"I've felt, as long as I've been CEO, that 'Song of the South' was – even with a disclaimer – was just not appropriate in today's world.\"\n\n\"Song of the South\" was never released on home video in the U.S. and is not included in Disney+.\n\nIn 2021, controversy over the controversy erupted when a loyal Disney fan's guest column in the Orlando Sentinel bemoaned the company's change in values and the alterations to park attractions that have been criticized as racist such as Splash Mountain and the Jungle Cruise, which was criticized for its depictions of indigenous peoples. The column went viral and triggered a nationwide response.\n\n\"I love Disney World, but wokeness is ruining the experience,\" Jonathan VanBoskerck wrote. \"The next time I ride Jungle Cruise I will not be thinking about the gloriously entertaining puns of the skippers, I will be thinking about Disney’s political agenda. That’s a mood killer.\"\n\nVanBoskerck said he also was concerned about Disney's announcement that the company was adding inclusion as one of its core principles, allowing gender-neutral hairstyles and costuming for cast members, and providing adaptive costumes to accommodate employees in wheelchairs.\n\nReaction to his column was mixed but passionate, with some people supporting him and complaining about wokeness but most criticizing him for wanting to embrace the idealized, mythological antebellum South.\n\nMeanwhile, Disney went on to wage a two-year war with Gov. Ron DeSantis over the then-Disney CEO's public objections to the state's \"Parental Rights in Education\" bill banning instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, which critics referred to as the \"Don't Say Gay\" law. DeSantis lashed out in return, hammering the company as a bastion of wokeness in campaign speeches and moving to strip the company's 55-year-old self-governing status and put it under the control of a DeSantis-appointed board. After months of lawsuits and failed appeals the war was called off and the lawsuits dropped, for now.\n\nEve Chen, USA TODAY, contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/07/21/bugs-land-faces-extermination-disney-california-adventure/805547002/", "title": "'Bug's land' faces extermination at Disney California Adventure", "text": "Marla Jo Fisher\n\nThe Orange County Register\n\nDisney is getting rid of the ants – and other cute bugs too – as it plans the latest major renovation to Disney California Adventure theme park. Disney has announced that it will close down “a bug’s land” after Sept. 4, to make way for a new Marvel superhero land that will be developed in its place.\n\nFans of “a bug’s land” and its carnival-style rides geared toward smaller children have until the day after Labor Day to enjoy them before the land is closed permanently. It will be replaced with a new Marvel Land under development that will feature comic book superheroes and be anchored by the Guardians of the Galaxy ride.\n\nMore on Southern California theme parks:\n\nMany people have been fans over the last 16 years of the charming themed elements of the bugs’ land, which thrusts visitors into a “bug’s eye view” of a world where they are the size of insects inside a giant garden. The design concept was that all the elements were cobbled together by the bugs themselves from natural materials or human discards.\n\nThe area, based on the hit 1998 Pixar film “A Bug’s Life,” was built hurriedly to inject more fun into Disney California Adventure, after it opened in 2001 to generally poor reviews complaining about the lack of rides. But its rides appeal mainly to small fries and were built hurriedly using so-called “off the shelf” technology that doesn’t showcase what Disney does best.\n\n“When I was small, it was really fun because all the rides were my size and I enjoyed it,” Tracy Stovall, 32, of Escondido said at Disneyland on Thursday morning. “Now it’s in the past.” She said she would look forward to a new Marvel superhero land.\n\nThe bug land’s stellar attraction, the “It’s Tough to Be A Bug!” theater, closed in March. The other rides in Flik’s Fun Fair, including Heimlich’s Chew Chew Train, Flik’s Flyers, Tuck and Roll’s Drive ‘Em Buggies, Francis’ Ladybug Boogie and the Princess Dot Puddle Park splash fountain, will close after Sept. 4.\n\nIn December, Disney author and unofficial historian David Koenig described the land’s attractions as “four off-the-shelf rides that are just horrible.\n\n“It’s themed really well, the environment is very convincing, but it’s just cheap little carnival rides they dressed up,” Koenig said.\n\nHowever, Disney bloggers have pointed out that the Flik’s Flyers ride that sends wee ones flying through the air in a simulation of hot air balloon baskets looks remarkably similar to the new Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind! ride slated to open in 2019, suggesting the ride may be retooled and recycled in a new home in Pixar Pier.\n\nThe closure date was first reported on the official Disney Parks blog July 18, which read, “In addition, as we previously announced, ‘a bug’s land’ will be closing to make way for the Super Hero-themed land, which will open in 2020. The last day to experience the fun of being a bug is Sept. 4.”\n\nThe new Marvel land’s iconic ride has already been built. In response to Disney’s acquisition of the rights to Marvel properties, engineers remodeled the former Twilight Zone Tower of Terror into Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT! which opened in May 2017. Today, it’s the most popular attraction at the Disneyland Resort, according to park officials.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/theme-parks/2024/06/11/tiana-bayou-adventure-disney-world-preview/74015430007/", "title": "We're among the first people to ride Tiana's Bayou Adventure. It's no ...", "text": "Tiana's Bayou Adventure is a feel-good ride that's perfect for families.\n\nIt's not a roller coaster, but guests may want to bring a poncho to stay dry.\n\nTiana's Bayou Adventure opens on June 28th at Walt Disney World in Florida and later this year at Disneyland in California.\n\nEarly on in Disney’s “The Princess and the Frog” movie, Tiana’s dad James tells her, “You know the thing about good food? It brings people together from all walks of life. It warms them right up, and it puts little smiles on their faces.”\n\nInstead of food, insert Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, and you’ll know what to expect when the highly-anticipated attraction officially opens on June 28th at Walt Disney World in Florida and later this year at Disneyland in California.\n\nUSA TODAY got a preview of Disney World’s new ride, which replaces Splash Mountain at both parks. Here’s what guests should know.\n\nWhat is Tiana’s Bayou Adventure like?\n\nTiana’s Bayou Adventure is a feel-good ride.\n\nUnlike “The Princess and the Frog,” the ride has no villains, like Dr. Facilier. Guests with little ones who are scared of the dark should be aware that it gets quite dark for multiple stretches, but there’s nothing else to be afraid of. Even the big drop is more thrilling than frightening. Lively music plays the whole time, and the bayou critters guests see along the way are as endearing as Louis the alligator from the film.\n\nThe outside of the attraction is covered in lush foliage, which carries into parts of the interior. Inside are some digital on-screen visuals mixed in with physical sets, but not as many as on Mickey and Minnie’s Runaway Railway or Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure. And the swinging and swaying audio-animatronics are just what fans have been asking for after seeing the technological advancements at Disney’s international parks.\n\nIs Tiana's Bayou Adventure the same as Splash Mountain?\n\nNo. The bones of the attraction may be similar and there are few Splash Mountain Easter eggs, but it’s a completely different story. The big splashdown is still there, but the mountain has been reimagined as a salt dome-like Avery Island, Louisiana, which Imagineers visited on one of their research trips for Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. This salt dome houses Tiana’s Foods, an employee-owned cooperative that guests learn about in the ride queue.\n\n“She's continued to grow her business, but this time she's included members of the community,” said Ted Robledo, one of Disney’s creative executives on the attraction. Robledo explained that a co-op was chosen because it was accurate for Tiana’s time and region, and co-ops empowered the historically disenfranchised.\n\nInclusion, authenticity and representation are significant parts of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, which fellow creative executive Charita Carter called “truly a love letter to New Orleans.”\n\nWho is Tiana inspired by?\n\n“Tiana would not be possible if we were not Leah Chase,” said fellow Disney creative executive Carmen Smith. Chase was the famed late executive chef and owner of Dooky Chase’s Restaurant in New Orleans. “It wasn’t just a restaurant. It was a gathering place that inspired so many.”\n\nChase’s grandson and the restaurant’s current executive chef Edgar ‘Dook’ Chase IV said his grandmother invited everybody into the kitchen. “That's what her true gift was – not only her passion of food, but she just loved people.”\n\nHe said she would’ve been honored and humbled to be part of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. “Every time she would get recognized, she would always say, ‘I have to work that much harder. I have to do more to showcase this honor that I'm getting,’” he said.\n\nSmith said the Chase family was a “huge part of this project.” Louisiana artists like Sharika Mahdi and Malaika Favorite inspired the feel of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure, and some of their work is featured outside it. New Orleans music legends PJ Morton and Terence Blanchard worked on the music.\n\n“It makes me feel as though I’m seen and that they took so much care to not just like use the culture, but actually understand the culture and involve the people who help continue the legacy of that culture,” said Victoria Wade, a Disney fan and theme park influencer who previously spoke with USA TODAY about the cultural impacts of both Splash Mountain and Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. “It's important, and it's honestly a great way, especially with this particular princess, to continue a legacy for New Orleans and for Black people in general.”\n\nWhy did Disney shut Splash Mountain?\n\nSplash Mountain's Br'er Rabbit story was tied to \"Song of the South,\" a 1946 Disney film, which has been criticized for its idealized portrayal of plantation life. A petition to retheme Splash Mountain went viral in 2020.\n\nThat same year, Disney announced the ride’s reimaging, saying, “The new concept is inclusive – one that all of our guests can connect with and be inspired by, and it speaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks each year.” Disney also noted that changes had been in the works since 2019.\n\nWade was one of the first people to preview the new ride.\n\n“There's a sign when you enter, and it says everyone's welcome,” she recalled. “I love that message so much because it's not just about, you know, Black people. It's ultimately welcoming everybody in to be joyful and celebrate one another in our cultures and what makes us unique.”\n\nTiana may be Disney’s first Black princess, but Carter noted, “Tiana is everybody's princess. She comes from a real place in America. She wasn't born into royalty. She has a working mom. She has military ties. And there's so much about her life that is relatable.”\n\nZip-a-Dee-Doo-Done:Why some Disney fans were done with Splash Mountain\n\nWhat is Tiana's Bayou Adventure based on?\n\nTiana’s Bayou Adventure is the next chapter in the story that begins with “The Princess and the Frog.”\n\nSpoiler alert: At the end of the film, Tiana’s dream of owning a thriving restaurant finally comes true. Now, she’s giving back to her community and hosting a big Mardi Gras party, where everyone is invited.\n\nThe only trouble is she’s missing a key ingredient. Mama Odie shrinks guests down to the size of frogs to help look for it in the bayou. Along the way, they’ll see familiar characters voiced by the same actors from the film and meet new musical critters.\n\n“Technologically wise, it was phenomenal,” Wade said. “They're very lifelike in their movements. I was particularly impressed with the Louis the gator animatronic.”\n\nIs Tiana's Bayou Adventure a roller coaster?\n\nNo. It’s a log flume-style water ride like Splash Mountain was. Guests may want to bring a poncho to stay dry, though there is plenty of Tiana-themed merchandise for sale if they need a change of clothes.\n\n“I didn't get wet, but I think it's because I was in the back of the boat,” Wade said with a laugh. “I actually love what they did with the drop. I feel like, based on how it looks with Mama Odie's bottles, it’s reminiscent of the (movie’s) ‘Dig a Little Deeper’ scene. I feel like at night, particularly, it's going to look absolutely incredible.”\n\nCan I meet Tiana at Disney World?\n\nYes. Princess Tiana greets guests in her signature ball gown at Princess Fairytale Hall in Magic Kingdom.\n\nGuests can also meet her outside the parks with character dining at 1900 Park Fare at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. She wears her new pantsuit there.\n\nWhat is Tiana's restaurant called at Disneyland?\n\nJust like in “The Princess and the Frog,” Tiana’s restaurant in Disneyland is called Tiana’s Palace. The quick-service eatery opened last September and serves iconic New Orleans dishes like gumbo, po’boys, muffaletta sandwiches, and beignets.\n\nWhile there’s no Tiana’s Palace at Disney World, guests can get Tiana’s Bayou Adventure treats in Magic Kingdom from June 28 through Sept. 6 and at select locations across the resort for a limited time.\n\nThey can also take home Mama Odie’s Hot Sauce and Dooky Chase’s Seasonings, which were previously only sold at Dooky Chase’s Restaurant in New Orleans.\n\nThe reporter on this story received access to the event from Disney.

Clad in purple uniforms with white fringe, the students appear to mimic a tribal dance and at one point chant “scalp ‘em.”\n\nDisney said the performance was “not consistent with the audition tape the school provided” and that it has “immediately put measures in place so this is not repeated.”\n\n“The live performance in our park did not reflect our core values, and we regret it took place,” an emailed statement reads.\n\nShannon O'Loughlin, CEO and attorney for the Association on American Indian Affairs and a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, called the performance \"deeply horrendous.\"\n\n\"Our children shouldn't still be spouting this kind of language,\" she told USA TODAY. \"(It is) offensive to see Disney, of all places, who have been the perpetrators of racial stereotypes in history, allowing something like this in their park, this kind of song, regardless of the young, innocent voices singing it.\"\n\n'I LET YOU DOWN':Disney CEO apologizes for 'Don't Say Gay' bill response\n\nCherokee Nation asks 'offensive imagery' to stop\n\nTara Houska, tribal attorney and co-founder of Not Your Mascots, a grassroots organization fighting against stereotypical Native representations in sports teams, said it was “not super shocking” when she came across the Indianettes' performance online.\n\n“I've seen iterations of leftover racism in the form of mascots in professional teams and collegiate level teams,” Houska, a citizen of Couchiching First Nation, told USA TODAY. “This one is unique just in the sense that it was really overt – like saying ‘scalp ‘em’ – and that it was at Disney parks.”\n\nHouska shared the video of the performance in a tweet that has amassed more than 20,000 retweets, quote tweets and likes as of Friday evening.\n\nWhile Disney spokespeople said the performance was not consistent with the drill team's audition tape, Houska pointed out that the group's name and uniform are also offensive.\n\n“(Disney) should not be giving a platform to overt racism,” Houska said. \"If you're a parent and you've got a small child there and your kid is seeing firsthand people being dehumanized right in front of them for fun – I mean, that's not a good message to be sending our children.\"\n\nThe school did not respond to multiple requests for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cherokee Nation shared two letters that were sent to the school district in 2020 and 2021, asking the school to stop using \"derogatory\" imagery. The Cherokee Nation said the school district has yet to acknowledge its letters or requests.\n\nA Friday statement from Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said the traditions do \"nothing but dishonor us and all Native American Tribes\" and called on the school leaders to apologize after its performance at Disney World.\n\nData from the National Center for Education Statistics says Port Neches-Groves high school had four students classified as American Indian or Alaska Native out of nearly 1,500 students in the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nOPINION:Disney CEO (finally) speaks out on 'Don't Say Gay' bill. But where's the gay Disney fairy tale?\n\nThe district issued a statement to KFDM-TV in Beaumont, Texas, saying it is \"aware of the concern regarding the performance.\"\n\n\"We are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in our school district,\" the statement reads. \"Our district is nearing 100 years old and our Board of Trustees is committed to always making the best decisions for our students, staff, and the communities of Port Neches and Groves.\"\n\nKFDM-TV reported this is the eighth time the school has performed the routine at Disney World, according to a school spokesperson.\n\nDisney's history with Native American depictions\n\nOver the years, Disney has been criticized for its depictions of Native Americans in films like \"Peter Pan\" and \"Pocahontas.\" Last year, Disneyland and Disney World removed racially insensitive depictions of Indigenous people from their Jungle Cruise attractions.\n\nThe parks are also making other changes when it comes to the representation of marginalized communities, like replacing Splash Mountain's \"Song of the South\"-related theme with a new storyline featuring Princess Tiana of \"The Princess and the Frog.\"\n\nWHAT'S IN A NAME:Disneyland's Native American-inspired spa comes with history\n\nThe drill team incident comes at a time when The Walt Disney Co. is taking heat for its response to what's been called Florida's \"Don't Say Gay\" bill. If signed by the governor, the Parental Rights in Education legislation would prohibit \"classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in certain grade levels.\"\n\nDisney initially withheld public comment on the matter, despite calls from fans and employees to weigh in with such a large presence in the state. CEO Bob Chapek told investors the company spent weeks \"working behind the scenes engaging directly with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle\" before the bill passed. Days later, amid calls to boycott the company, he wrote an apology to employees for not being a \"stronger ally in the fight for equal rights.\"\n\nDisney has since paused political donations to all Florida lawmakers as it reviews its framework for its giving and pledged to donate more to advocacy organizations. While some fans and employees have said it's a step in the right direction, others say it's still not enough.

We are not your mascot.\"\n\nWASHINGTON COMMANDERS:Washington Football Team announces Commanders as new NFL nickname\n\nNatalie Masucci of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, a self-described Disney parks fan, said watching the video of the performance was heartbreaking.\n\n\"Disney has been so inclusive of every minority, and just seeing them kind of making a laughingstock of my minority, it's a slap in the face,\" she said.\n\nMasucci was an annual pass holder at Disney World before the pandemic and had been planning to visit the parks more after COVID-19 cases settled. Now, she's not so sure.\n\n\"Seeing that at the parks still happening makes you lose trust in Disney,\" she said.\n\nChase Iron Eyes, a spokesperson for Indigenous Peoples Movement and advisor to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairwoman's office, called the performance \"a punch to the core.\"\n\n\"They are appropriating from our dance, our song,\" said Iron Eyes, a Standing Rock Oglala Sioux and enrolled member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe. \"We need leadership from Disney. We need leadership from (the school). Somebody has to step forward and recognize that this was wrong and say to all of our children and all of their children, our children collectively, that we want to make it right.\"\n\nIron Eyes added that he hopes Disney, which he called \"one of the largest purveyors of cultural mythology in the world,\" commits to including more Indigenous voices in its work.\n\n\"We want to share our stories,\" he said. \"But we're constantly running up against a lack of understanding or just a complete ignorance about how Indigenous nations have been deliberately marginalized.\"\n\nTURNING RED:How 'Turning Red’ tackles growing up with a cultural spin\n\nMasucci said she hopes Disney does more than just issue a statement following the performance.\n\n\"Include more indigenous people in things. Show us that you actually appreciate our culture,\" she said.\n\nO'Loughlin hopes to see Disney take action as well, both by apologizing and investing in educating more students about the history of Native American genocide within the United States.\n\nBut she doubts she'll see much come out of the controversial video.\n\n\"(Disney will) maybe look a little bit closer at their high school performance group.

Now he’s saying “Goodbye, Disney (DIS).”\n\nChapek’s rocky two-and-a-half year tenure at the head of the entertainment giant had a few wins. He navigated the Covid-19 pandemic, which shuttered theme parks around the world and halted film production, grew Disney+’s subscriber base and held his ground against an activist investor.\n\nBut Disney made the surprise announcement Sunday that its revered former CEO Bob Iger is making a return as the head of the company.\n\nChapek, who served as chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products before taking over for Iger, will be stepping down immediately.\n\nWhy? Chapek’s downfall arose, at least in part, out of his bungled response to Florida’s controversial Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics. His decisions had far-reaching effects on both Disney’s reputation and on the company’s “favored nation” status in the state.\n\nEarly this year, Disney faced mounting criticism for not taking a public stance on the bill. The law bans educators from discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in some classrooms.\n\nChapek ended up igniting a political firestorm — despite his initial efforts to keep the company out of politics. (Iger had publicly condemned the bill on Twitter).\n\nLackluster response\n\nChapek addressed the issue in an email to staff but refused to issue a public statement against it in March. He defended that decision saying corporate statements “do very little to change outcomes or minds” and can undermine “more effective ways” of implementing change.\n\nChapek’s response marked a change in tone for Disney, which had previously been led by an outspoken CEO who had famously considered running for president.\n\nThe backlash was immediate, both within the company and in the public. Disney employees began staging walkouts, saying Chapek’s statements “utterly failed” to grasp the threat to LGBTQ communities.\n\nLater that same week, Chapek apologized for his public silence on the bill. In a letter to employees, the CEO said the issue was not just about “a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights …You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.”\n\nAn apology too late\n\nChapek’s attempt to keep Disney out of politics quickly backfired. While the company began bracing for further walkouts and protests from progressives, Chapek’s eventual response led to a full blown battle between two Florida giants: the Walt Disney Company and the state’s Republican governor, Ron Desantis.\n\nDeSantis quickly ripped Disney after Chapek’s public condemnation, calling the company a “woke corporation” with questionable business interests in China during a private event.\n\nDisney is the main driver of Florida’s massive tourism industry and the state’s largest private employer. Before the public condemnation, Chapek told shareholders he had called Desantis to express his “disappointment and concern.”\n\nHe also announced a pause in political contributions in Florida (the company had previously donated $50,000 to DeSantis’ bid for reelection).\n\nThe feud eventually led to the Florida legislature revoking Disney’s special status to operate as an independent quasi-government around its Orlando-area theme parks.\n\nThe bill states the special designation, which also gives Disney significant tax advantages, won’t dissolve until June 2023. The Reedy Creek Improvement District, the entity that manages the Disney properties, argued it can’t be dissolved until Florida pays off its bond debts, essentially saying the special district can continue to operate as normal.\n\nIger vs Chapek\n\nThe fallout over the LGBTQ legislation created a rift between Iger and Chapek. CNBC reported that several Disney employees called Iger “to express their disappointment in Chapek.”\n\nIn June, it seemed that Chapek wasn’t going anywhere despite the public missteps – Disney announced a three year contract extension that would run into 2025.\n\n“Disney was dealt a tough hand by the pandemic, yet with Bob [Chapek] at the helm, our businesses — from parks to streaming — not only weathered the storm, but emerged in a position of strength,” Disney board chair Susan Arnold said in a statement, adding he was the “right leader at the right time.”\n\nDespite the public controversies and feuds, Chapek was dealt a lifeline with Disney+. The service’s subscriptions skyrocketed during the pandemic, and totaled more than 137 million at the time of Chapek’s contract extension.\n\nBut now economic uncertainty is looming over corporate America, and Chapek recently announced a hiring freeze and job cuts to manage costs, Reuters reported.\n\nStreaming success wasn’t enough to save Chapek’s tenure or his reputation, as the company lost $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nInvestors celebrated Iger’s return as CEO, sending Disney shares up nearly 7% Monday after dropping roughly 38% this year.\n\n– CNN’s Frank Pallotta, Steve Contorno, Jamiel Lynch, Chris Boyette and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/happyeverafter/2014/12/23/vilma-gonzalez-sarah-maas-heather-lyons-interview/20769125/", "title": "Interview: Sarah J. Maas and Heather Lyons on fairy tale-inspired ...", "text": "Vilma Gonzalez\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nOne of my personal favorite genres is fantasy, and lately I've been especially excited to read fairy-tale retellings. This year, I fell in love with Sarah J. Maas' Heir of Fire fantasy series. When I found out she was releasing A Court of Thorns and Roses, a novel inspired by Beauty and the Beast, I immediately started a mental countdown. In addition, one of my favorite authors, Heather Lyons, created an imaginative tale with The Collectors' Society, a fabulous modern-day retelling of Alice and Wonderland. Next year, Lyons is poised to deliver the sequel, The Hidden Library.\n\nI'm really excited to see what 2015 will bring to us readers and, in the interim, wanted to explore the trend, inspiration and process around these kind of stories. I was thrilled to be able to interview Sarah and Heather to further delve into the topic.\n\nVilma: Can you each tell us about your upcoming fairy-tale retelling? What can readers expect?\n\nSarah: Sure thing! A Court of Thorns and Roses is the first book in my new (slightly older, darker and steamier) fantasy series. It's set in a world in which humans were once slaves to faerie overlords — and after a long, bloody war for freedom 500 years ago, a wall was built to separate the human and faerie lands. The story begins when my heroine, Feyre, unwittingly breaks the rules of the peace treaty between their two realms while hunting in the woods one day, and finds herself dragged into the faerie territory by a shape-shifting faerie lord as payment for her crime. But the faerie lands aren't what Feyre expects — and neither is her captor. And as Feyre's feelings for him shift from hostility to something quite the opposite, she discovers that a deadly shadow is creeping over the faerie world — and if she doesn't stop it, it might not just doom the faerie realm, but the human one as well.\n\nHeather:The Hidden Library is the sequel to The Collectors' Society, and while the first book focused on Alice's backstory, this one features Finn's. In addition, the Society is still on the hunt for the masterminds behind the deletions of Timelines, but the more secrets they uncover, the more dangerous the game becomes. But as always, there will be lots of surprises and familiar faces popping up!\n\nVilma: What inspired you to write these stories?\n\nSarah:A Court of Thorns and Roses was actually inspired by three of my all-time-favorite fairy/folktales: Beauty and the Beast, East of the Sun, West of the Moon and Tam Lin. I got the kernel of inspiration by wondering: \"What if 'Beauty' was a huntress?\" (And then promptly asked myself: \"What if the 'beast' was a shape-shifting, very sexy Faerie lord?\" Because that's obviously what a normal person would think/wonder.) From there, the characters and faerie realm of Prythian just kind of exploded — and I couldn't stop writing the story. I wound up writing the first draft over the course of a month (wayyyy back in 2009), and during the years that I've revised/tweaked the story, it became more of an original fantasy novel than a straight-up retelling (though there are nods to the original source material here and there).\n\nHeather: I think, as not only a writer but also a voracious bibliophile, I've always been enchanted by the what ifs that come with reading a book that truly sucks you in. What if these worlds were real? What if these characters existed, that their hearts beat and they lived and loved? What if books actually were what we all hoped they would be — true doorways to new lands and peoples? What if libraries and the treasures they hold were truly the magic portals we hope they are? In a lot of ways, The Collectors' Society series is my ode to the wonderful power books, libraries, and museums have had over me throughout my life.\n\nVilma: Retellings have been around a very long while, but lately they seem to making a re-emergence. We're also seeing more fairy tale-inspired stories being devoured by a wider audience. Why do you think that is?\n\nSarah: Honestly, I think there's a cycle to the popularity of fantasy and fairytales, that usually coincides with times of unrest or hardship in our own world. By retelling these legends or immersing ourselves in fantasy realms, we can safely explore the very real, very day-to-day darkness of our own lives. These stories have remained with us through the centuries because they still manage to be a reflection that teaches us, and helps us — and even reminds us to hope and work for a better ending.\n\nHeather: Fairy tales — even the classics — have a strong hold on readers for a reason: their stories resonate within us. There's a wonder to them, a sense of hope and magic that we cling to. I think they, like so many other things in our world, continue to evolve throughout the ages. Think of it like that game telephone children play, where a story starts out one way, but changes from person to person. Storytellers over the centuries have been doing this with tales they'd been given from storytellers before them.\n\nVilma: Do you feel added pressure touching, morphing, expanding stories that are already so cherished and well-known, particularly as you take much-loved characters and mold them into new iterations of themselves?\n\nSarah: Is it strange if I say no? I've been rewriting and retelling my favorite fairy tales since I was a child — mostly in terms of recasting the classic heroines to be more active and doing the \"fun\" things (slaying dragons, elaborate rescues from dark castles, fighting legions of goblins). So doing that with A Court of Thorns and Roses felt second-nature — like something I'd been waiting to do my whole life. Even my Throne of Glass series emerged from the desire to retell Cinderella — when I asked myself, \"What if Cinderella was an assassin who went to the ball not to dance with the prince, but to kill him?\" I've always loved retellings, and loved fairy tales, so publishing ACOTAR just feels like the culmination of a lifetime of daydreaming and \"what if\"s?\"\n\nHeather: Honestly, I had to take a step back from such thoughts while writing The Collectors' Society, or I think I wouldn't have been able to go through with putting down the story I did. Because it is a lot of pressure to put out a story featuring such beloved characters.\n\nVilma: Heather, did your writing process change in any way when you were writing this type of story compared to a fantasy or a contemporary story?\n\nHeather: In a way. Using familiar characters, I had to be careful to match speech patterns and vocabulary to specific books and time periods. And I was constantly fact-checking the dozens of books scattered around my desk and documents open on my laptop to ensure my world-building was where I wanted it to be. It was a slower go, I think, than some of my other books that have worlds built entirely within my imagination. For those, I was free to just go with the flow. Here, it's like piecing a puzzle together. All the edges have to fit just so.\n\nVilma: Tell us about the kind of research each of you did for your upcoming projects.\n\nSarah: I reread the original legends, but didn't want to cling to them too much, or get too wrapped up in the specifics while drafting. If anything, I did more research on what it feels like to have a broken nose or an infected wound — which is totally not as fun.\n\nHeather: I reread all of the original source materials and then delve into numerous scholarly, literary analyses of all the characters and themes associated with them.\n\nVilma: How much content did you draw from the original text, and how much did you come up on your own?\n\nSarah: It was a mixture — I'd say there are definitely some nods to the source material, and definitely a fairy tale-like feel to the book ... But most of the book — the world, the politics, the characters — was invented on the spot. Though I did have a ton of fun researching various types of monsters from around the world to populate the lands of Prythian.\n\nHeather: I would say it's probably 50-50 for me. The past for the cast of The Collectors' Society is rooted firmly within their original stories (and must be, to work within the world I've constructed), but as one of my characters says, authors always leave room for interpretation for in-betweener moments. So that allows me to fill in bits and pieces and then fully expand upon everything as these characters age and move into the employ of the Society.\n\nVilma: Let's move to your other projects! Sarah, can you give us a teensy weensy hint at what the heck will happen to our favorite assassin?! (#TeamChaol!!!!!)\n\nSarah: Haha, so, so hard not to spoil anything — both for the fourth Throne of Glass book (out fall 2015), and for readers who haven't read the series yet! BUT — I will say that book four is perhaps the darkest installment so far, and I've had a total blast working on it. It picks up right where Heir of Fire left off, and follows Celaena as she finally returns to Adarlan — and learns about the fate of her friends.\n\nVilma: And Heather, perhaps you can tease us with what to expect in the next Fate series installment?\n\nHeather: The next book with be a companion book, meaning it will not star the original three main characters of the series. That said, it'll be the first one to be told from two points of view, and it will take place approximately 10 years after the epilogue of A Matter of Forever. I'm really excited about it, because it will be a nice blend of new characters while still finding out the fate of beloved older ones!\n\nVilma: OK, now that you have us all even more excited about your books, let's take a step back and get to know each of you a bit better with some fun, rapid-fire questions.\n\nFavorite fairy tale character?\n\nSarah: It's a toss-up between the heroine from East of the Sun, West of the Moon and Vasilisa from Vasilisa the Beautiful. Both are very active, very determined heroines who use their wits and tremendous will to save themselves (and their heroes) from harm.\n\nHeather: The headstrong girl from East of the Sun, West of the Moon.\n\nFavorite book boyfriend?\n\nSarah: Lucivar Yaslana from Anne Bishop's Black Jewels series.\n\nHeather: Brigan from Fire by Kristin Cashore.\n\nFavorite Starbucks drink?\n\nSarah: I recently broke free of my coffee addiction, so I'm going to be lame and say English Breakfast Tea with a splash of milk.\n\nHeather: Tall non-fat hot chocolate at 140 degrees.\n\nLast time you fangirled over someone and who was it?\n\nSarah: Garth Nix. He's part of the reason why I started writing and reading fantasy, and getting to do a panel and signing with him at the Texas Teen Book Festival this past fall was overwhelmingly cool and wonderful. I'm pretty sure I came across as a stalker, because half of my answers on the panel all involved explanations of how he'd changed my life. He was super, super gracious and chill — and having him sign the copy of Sabriel that I've owned since I was 12 years old was a dream come true.\n\nHeather: I met Scott Hutchison, the lead singer of my favorite band, Frightened Rabbit, outside of the Troubadour before one show and I fear I was shaking and babbling, I was so excited. Poor guy!\n\nLast super awesome book you read?\n\nSarah:Dirty Rowdy Thing by Christina Lauren (looove all their books) — and The Darkest Touch by Gena Showalter (adore her Lords of the Underworld series).\n\nHeather: I just finished reading My True Love Gave to Me, which is a series of holiday short stories by a bunch of rad YA authors. It was so much fun!\n\nSong you can't get enough of right now?\n\nSarah: I feel like I've been obsessed with Run Boy Run by Woodkid for the past year. I literally can't go a day without listening to it. It's kinda bizarre, now that I think about it.\n\nHeather:Like a River Runs by Bleachers. I'm obsessed.\n\nOne word you use too often?\n\nSarah: Dude.\n\nHeather: Rad.\n\nFavorite holiday tradition?\n\nSarah: Going on vacation over New Year's with my best friend, Susan Dennard (author of Something Strange and Deadly and the upcoming epic fantasy Truthwitch). We always go away somewhere together for the holiday — and getting to end and begin every year with her is seriously the best.\n\nHeather: Going to Disneyland with my family to see all the lights. We have annual passes, and it's our can't-miss event!\n\nFor more information on Sarah J.

But some Indigenous viewers aren’t particularly interested in returning to it.\n\n“Avatar: The Way of Water” and its director are facing fresh scrutiny from Native audiences, some of whom have criticized the franchise for its “White savior” narrative, use of stereotypes and inadequate representation of Indigenous people.\n\nYuè Begay, a Navajo artist and activist, called for a boycott of the film in a tweet that’s since received more than 47,000 likes, while Autumn Asher Blackdeer, a scholar from the Southern Cheyenne Nation, compiled a widely shared list of Indigenous-led sci-fi films for viewers to watch instead. Countless others have also weighed in with their own complaints, with some – including Begay – calling out remarks made by Cameron in earlier interviews.\n\nThe “Avatar” franchise isn’t subtle in its anti-colonial, anti-imperialist and environmentalist themes – Cameron has said as much, previously referring to the first film as “a science fiction retelling of the history of North and South America in the early colonial period.”\n\nBut despite the director’s intentions, critics of “Avatar” feel the films fall short in their execution.\n\n‘Avatar’ is a ‘White savior’ narrative, critics say\n\nThe original 2009 film follows protagonist Jake Sully as he’s dispatched to the moon Pandora as part of an imperialist mission. There, he inhabits a new body that mimics the appearance of the Na’vi, the blue humanoid species indigenous to this new environment. As Sully bonds with the Na’vi and falls in love with princess Neytiri, he’s forced to choose between both worlds. In the sequel, Sully is now chief of the Omaticaya clan as he and his family once again come up against the colonial ambitions of the humans.\n\nThe \"Avatar\" sequel picks up more than a decade after the original, following Jake Sully and his family. Courtesy 20th Century Studios\n\nThe decision to center Sully – whose race isn’t explicitly mentioned but whose outsider status is a clear parallel to White settlers – plays into the tired trope of the “White savior” and was a missed opportunity, said Crystal Echo-Hawk, president and CEO of IllumiNative.\n\n“(Cameron) might be telling that story of colonization, but he’s telling it through the lens of a White male,” she told CNN.\n\nBy involving more Indigenous people at all levels of production, Echo-Hawk said Cameron might have been able to tell a more authentic story that would have resonated with audiences better.\n\n“It’s a level of arrogance once again that a White filmmaker can just somehow tell a story that’s based on Indigenous peoples better than Indigenous peoples ever could,” she added.\n\nShe said her organization IllumiNative, which aims to improve media portrayals of Indigenous people, is in talks with Disney on how the “Avatar” franchise might avoid similar pitfalls in its third installment, set to release 2024.\n\nOthers criticize its lack of Indigenous representation\n\n“The Way of Water” does go a little deeper than its predecessor. It introduces the Metkayina people of the reef in a nod to the Māori, in an attempt to showcase the diversity of Indigenous peoples around the world. It also casts Cliff Curtis, who is of Māori descent, as Metkayina chief Tonowari. But many of the other characters are still voiced by White actors.\n\nAdam Piron, a filmmaker and director of the Indigenous program at Sundance Institute, said he hasn’t yet seen the latest installment of the “Avatar” franchise, though he plans to. But he sees Cameron’s sci-fi epic as part of a long history of White filmmakers projecting their own ideas of Indigeneity onscreen, rather than involving Indigenous people themselves.\n\n“All that’s left anymore with those films is the non-Indigenous desire to be Indigenous or to have some sort of connection to Indigenous people,” he added.\n\n\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" introduces a new Na'vi clan called the Metkayina, a people of the reef. Disney\n\nThe films have also been accused of cultural appropriation for the way in which they bring together disparate elements of Indigenous cultures in their portrayal of the fictional Na’vi. While “The Way of Water” does draw inspiration from the Māori, Echo-Hawk said the film could have benefited from a deeper partnership.\n\n“It’s based on what James Cameron’s notion is of what he thinks Indigenous history is, what he thinks Indigenous culture is,” she said. “Everyone thinks that we’re a monolith. What it does is flatten who Indigenous peoples are, what Indigenous cultures, language, practices are.”\n\nPart of the outrage around the sequel has also stemmed from recently resurfaced comments that Cameron made in 2010 to The Guardian as he joined the Xingu people in the Amazon in their fight against a dam project. Witnessing Indigenous ceremonies in the Amazon, Cameron said, prompted him to consider the plight of Native peoples in North America.\n\n“I felt like I was 130 years back in time watching what the Lakota Sioux might have been saying at a point when they were being pushed and they were being killed and they were being asked to displace and they were being given some form of compensation,” he said at the time. “This was a driving force for me in the writing of Avatar – I couldn’t help but think that if (the Lakota Sioux) had had a time-window and they could see the future… and they could see their kids committing suicide at the highest suicide rates in the nation… because they were hopeless and they were a dead-end society – which is what is happening now – they would have fought a lot harder.”\n\nCameron responded to criticism of “Avatar” earlier this month, telling British media site Unilad that “the important thing is to listen and to be sensitive to issues that people have.”\n\n“It’s not up to me, speaking from a perspective of White privilege, if you will, to tell them that they’re wrong,” he said of his critics. “It has validity. It’s pointless for me to say, ‘Well, that was never my intention.’”\n\nRhonda Lucy, founder of the Toronto Indigenous Filmmakers Collective and the media production company Sun Raven Arts, said she doesn’t plan to see “The Way of Water.”\n\n“I live that reality. My community lives this reality,” Lucy said. “Why would I want to pay the small amount of money I make to hand over to a massive money making machine to pay them to show me heartache and pain that’s just glazed over?”\n\nBut while she understands and shares in the criticism, she hopes that Indigenous creatives will take this as a sign to develop their own ambitious projects.\n\n“We have a whole bunch of nerds in our community who love writing and creative writing and doing so much sci-fi,” she said. “I want to see our people leave all of this stuff in the dust, and say, ‘We made our own.’”", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/17/entertainment/little-mermaid-racist-backlash-halle-bailey-disney-cec/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Why racist 'The Little Mermaid' arguments don't hold up ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEver since Disney released the first look for its 2023 live-action remake of “The Little Mermaid,” the internet has been sodden with wave after wave of racist critics complaining that Ariel, the completely fictional underwater fish woman, shouldn’t be Black. Hashtags like #notmyariel are bouncing around social media, and YouTube hid the dislike counter on the official video after it was bombarded with racist comments and more than 1.5 million “dislikes.” One group of critics went as far as to share a digitally altered version of the teaser that featured a White woman in place of the movie’s star Halle Bailey, who they called a “woke actress.”\n\nBy now, we know it’s not unusual to see racist responses whenever a person of color is cast in a role considered “traditionally” White. While there are plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike a movie, these critics often hide their discomfort behind other thin arguments, claiming historical or cultural accuracy or, of all things, science.\n\nHere are some real arguments people have levied to protest the casting choice. The facts prove they just don’t hold water.\n\nClaim: ‘The Little Mermaid’ is a Danish story, therefore Ariel should be White\n\nThe original “Little Mermaid” story was written by Hans Christian Andersen and first published in 1837. If we’re going to dignify this argument, according to the text, Ariel and the rest of her mermaid kin are from “far out in the ocean” (literally the opening lines of the story) at the “bottom of the sea.” So, not Denmark or anywhere near it.\n\nIf critics are truly worried about staying faithful to the original story, we shouldn’t gloss over the original ending where the mermaid is instructed to kill her prince, but throws the knife away in despair and dissolves into sea foam instead. Not to mention, while the 1989 Disney version has a Prince Eric with bright blue peepers, Anderson specifically described the prince as having “coal-black eyes” and “raven hair.” (Also “The Little Mermaid,” who doesn’t even have a name in the original story, isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Mermaids live under the sea and therefore would not have dark skin\n\nCould be a mermaid, who knows. @adopamanatee\n\n“From a scientific perspective, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to have someone with darker skin who lives deep in the ocean.” So says far-right pundit Matt Walsh, who opined about the “Little Mermaid” casting on “The Matt Walsh Show.” He claims he framed the comment as a joke, since he goes on to say that “​​not only should the Little Mermaid be pale, she should, actually, be translucent.” However, the context of his comment is still racially charged, and he still implies pale skin is closer to a “scientific” mermaid than dark skin.\n\nAgain, if we’re going to take an academic look at these unnecessary bits of discourse, not all abyssal creatures are pale. Not all underwater creatures are pale. Also, since mermaids also get close enough to the surface to see other humans, if you want to look at it scientifically, mermaids would probably have a specific type of pigmentation that allowed for both a deep sea and shallow water existence. We also know that, centuries ago, seafarers often mistook one particular animal for a mermaid: the manatee, which is not pale. (Also “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Mermaids are a European mythological figure and therefore Ariel should be White\n\nNumerous Twitter scraps have cropped up with people trying to argue European folklore, or even Homerian epics like “The Odyssey,” have some sort of monopoly on the idea of mermaids. In reality, it’s fascinating to see how many different cultures throughout history have arrived at parallel folklorical themes. Humanoid creatures that dwell in the water are part of innumerable mythologies around the world.\n\nEast Asian and Oceanic folklore is replete with stories of underwater kingdoms and merpeople both good and evil, from the Magindara in some Philippine regions to the tale of the Indian Princess Suriratna or Hwang-ok that reached South Korea. Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the classic “Arabian Nights” collection, which dates back more than a thousand years, feature several accounts of sea-dwelling human creatures. In parts of continental Africa and among the African diaspora, folklore describing water spirits, oftentimes in the shape of beautiful women, are common. According to Shona mythology in Zimbabwe, the “njuzu” are mermaids who occupy lakes or rivers.\n\n(Also, not all Europeans are White. Also, “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.)\n\nClaim: Making Ariel Black is ruining childhoods and changing the character\n\nOn message boards and comment sections across the internet, people are debating whether a new, dark-skinned Ariel somehow negates or erases the classic 1989 version.\n\nDisney’s 1989 “The Little Mermaid” is still available to watch, own and share. The animated character of Ariel is part of Disney’s wildly profitable “Disney Princess” franchise and her name and image are valuable and heavily trademarked Disney properties. The red-haired, fair-skinned Ariel is here to stay.\n\nFar from ruining childhoods, many fans think making a different iteration of Ariel will only increase the Disney magic. Just look at the sweet reactions of young Black children and the praise of Disney icons like Jodi Benson, the voice of the original Ariel.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Videos of young Black girls reacting to 'Little Mermaid' trailer go viral 01:07 - Source: CNN\n\nMore importantly, the remake of one film doesn’t erase the existence of the previous films: 1999’s Mr. Darcy and 2005’s Mr. Darcy live in harmony with every other character from the roughly 300 “Pride and Prejudice” film remakes. Pennywise looks different in every “It” iteration, as does Frankenstein’s monster. The story of “Cinderella,” which predates even the famous Brothers Grimm version, seems to have a different remake out every year. One notable version, 1997’s “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella,” featured a racially diverse cast that included singer Brandy as the first Black Cinderella and Whitney Houston as the fairy godmother. It aired on TV as part of the “Wonderful World of Disney.”\n\nWhile Disney has produced a very famous iteration of “The Little Mermaid,” it isn’t the first, only, or universally definitive work. No one owns the concept of mermaids or what they look like. A White, red-haired animated teenager is not the only version of “The Little Mermaid” to exist.\n\nAlso – and this is very important – “The Little Mermaid” isn’t real.", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/09/17"}]}

Two Austin chefs and one out-of-towner who recently opened two restaurants in the city took home major honors.\n\nNixta Taqueria chef-owner Edgar Rico earned the title of emerging chef at the awards ceremony held in in Chicago. It is the first time an Austin chef has received a national honor from the culinary nonprofit whose awards are considered by some as crowning achievements in the restaurant world.\n\nRico, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, received local and national attention for the creativity and craft he brings to his tacos and tostadas at the East Austin taqueria he opened with partner Sara Mardanbigi in the fall of 2019. The couple's restaurant quickly ascended to the top tier of Austin Mexican restaurants with dishes like a beet tostada and a duck confit taco.\n\n“Honest to God, I did not expect to win this award tonight,” an emotional Rico said from the stage in Chicago while receiving his award. “This is huge for La Raza. This is huge for my people. For all the taqueros out there in the world, anything is possible, because if you work your ass off, you can be here on this stage.”\n\nReview from 2019:Nixta Taqueria takes craft approach to some of city’s best tacos\n\nRico worked in the kitchens of the celebrated Son of a Gun, Sqrl and Trois Mec in Los Angeles before coming to Austin. The chef told the American-Statesman by text on Monday night that the award was a culmination of all of the hard work put in by him and Mardanbigi, his fiancé. He also hinted at some future plans.\n\n“To see this dream come true, it honestly means the world to me,\" Rico wrote. \"And all I know is the future is bright, and you will definitely be seeing some more projects from Nixta hospitality in the future.”\n\nRico's win set the stage for another big accolade for an Austin chef. El Naranjo chef Iliana de la Vega won the award for best chef in Texas. Because of the cancellation of the James Beard Awards in 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic, this was the first time the award for Texas had ever been handed out. Texas chefs competed in the Southwest category through 2019.\n\nMexico City native De la Vega, who moved to Austin from Oaxaca with her husband, Ernesto Torrealba, more than a decade ago, tearfully accepted the award and thanked her home country of Mexico for \"teaching her\" and the United States and Austin for receiving her. This was De la Vega's first James Beard Award.\n\nDe la Vega told the Statesman on Monday night that she had worried her business would not survive the pandemic, but even her semifinal nod had helped usher in a new wave of business.\n\n\"We thought we were not going to make it and look at this,\" she said via text message. \"It's an honor that we have to live for.\"\n\nDe la Vega is the first Austin chef to win a regional award from the James Beard Foundation since Aaron Franklin took home the 2015 prize for best chef in the Southwest. Tyson Cole of Uchi, Austin’s first regional James Beard Award winner, garnered the accolade in 2011 and Paul Qui, then of Uchiko, followed that up with a win in 2012.\n\nChef Mashama Bailey may not be an Austin chef, but the co-owner of The Grey in Savannah did open two restaurants in Austin in April and Monday night took home one of the evening's biggest prizes — outstanding chef for the country.\n\nBailey, who opened The Diner Bar and Grey Market at the local Thompson hotel with partner Johno Morisano, thanked her parents, mentors, business partners, chefs and employees at her Savannah and Austin restaurants in her speech and said, \"Thank you for betting on Black.\"\n\nRelated:Chef Mashama Bailey brings famous Savannah touch to Austin’s new Diner Bar and Grey Market\n\nBailey acknowledged that Black- and brown-owned restaurants and mom-and-pop businesses had been \"bubbling underneath the surface for a long time,\" and that with her win, \"Today a little Black girl or a little Black boy can see themselves as a future outstanding chef.\"\n\nThe big year for Austin chefs at the James Beard Awards actually started Sunday night, when Dai Due chef-owner Jesse Griffiths won a book award for his \"The Hog Book: A Chef's Guide to Hunting, Butchering and Cooking Wild Pigs.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2018/04/10/garden-state-culinary-arts-awards-finalists-2018/499998002/", "title": "Garden State Culinary Arts Awards finalists named for 2018", "text": "Staff Report\n\n@MyCentralJersey\n\nCentral Jersey chefs and restaurants, farmers and wine professionals are among the finalists for the 2018 Garden State Culinary Arts Awards (GSCAA).\n\n\n\nThe awards will be presented by The Garden State Culinary Arts Foundation in a ceremony and reception to be held from 5:30 to 9 p.m. Sunday, April 29 at Bell Works, 101 Crawfords Corner Road in Holmdel.\n\nThe awards ceremony will begin at 6 p.m. A gala reception, with dishes that focus on New Jersey ingredients, will follow from 7:15 to 9 p.m. under the direction of 2017 Outstanding Chef winner Drew Araneo, of Drew's Bayshore Bistro in Keyport, and 2017 Rising Star honoree AJ Capella, formerly of the Ryland Inn, Whitehouse Station.

Many are military veterans.\n\nBrenda Priestly Jackson, a Democrat, and Randy DeFoor, a Republican, are Jacksonville City Council members who joined forces early on to successfully fight the attempted sale of city-owned JEA.\n\nFor the first time, an EVE of the Moment Award was presented to two women involved in the coronavirus crisis as a symbol of the multitudes dealing with the pandemic. They are:\n\nPhysician Jennifer Fulton, who as critical care director for Baptist Health, was charged with developing how Baptist’s five hospitals responded to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTeacher Lauren Skipper started Blessings in a Backpack at Chets Creek Elementary School a decade ago to ensure that at-risk children have food over the weekend. She ensured its continued success during the COVID-19 pandemic when children were not at school.\n\nThe late Janet Owens was the recipient of the Arnolta J. “Mama” Williams Lifetime Achievement Award. Owens, who died in April 2020 of metastatic breast cancer, had a long career as a nonprofit administrator at Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), Girl Scouts of Gateway Council, the United Way of Northeast Florida and Volunteer Jacksonville.\n\nMiller reflected on her life and the importance of goal setting, attitude and committing yourself to excellence. And she touched on how to appreciate failure because it is recovering from failure that makes you stronger.\n\nMiller is the most decorated Olympic gymnast in U.S. history with seven medals, consisting of two gold, two silver and three bronze. She competed at age 15 in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona and the 1996 games in Atlanta as leader of the “Magnificent Seven,” the first-ever women’s gymnastics team to win gold for the U.S.\n\nThey entered the Georgia Dome to a sea of red, white and blue flashbulbs like the 4th of July, 40,000 screaming people and a world stage. It was a triumphant time.\n\nMiller had qualified for the all-around title. On the floor exercise, she stepped out of bounds on a tumbling pass that cost her a chance for a medal that night.\n\n“I was heartbroken,” Miller said, admitting that the time and effort she had put into training and then one misstep led her to shed tears for “all the world to see.”\n\nBut she had to think of the next event, the next step. She had never missed the vault. She raced down the 70-foot runway and over the top of the horse, landing splat on her backside.\n\n“My first thought was 'what just happened' and then the fear set in,” she said.\n\nWhat if she fell on the balance beam, the one remaining event, the last chance to bring home an individual medal for her country.\n\nThat night, she talked to her mother who asked her if she had done the necessary work, knowing she always had. Her mother reminded her that she could walk into that arena, head held high, shoulders thrown back and confident that she had done everything she could to succeed. Then Mom reminded her to appreciate the moment.\n\nBut it was the balance beam, only four inches wide, with the reputation of being the most feared event in gymnastics. It was the fastest 90 seconds of her life. One twist, two flips and she nailed her landing.\n\n“It was just this most amazing feeling,” she said, adding that she wanted to live in that moment. Over the years, Miller said she’s often asked what she was thinking, and the answer is thank you to the incredible team of people who helped her follow her dream. That team included her parents, her coaches, her teachers, the community in which she grew up in Oklahoma and more. It was the first time an American gymnast captured gold on the beam.\n\nAfter she retired at age 19, Miller said she lost sight of how to apply that concept of team outside the world of sports.\n\nThen in January 2011, she was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer with a baseball-sized cyst on her left ovary. It was caught early and treated with an aggressive form of chemotherapy.\n\nIt left her sick, drained and in the hospital, wondering how she would get through it. A nurse walked in and a cartoon-light bulb flashed with the word “team.” Miller said she went from a victim to a competitive mentality. She thought of her team of friends, family members and people willing to pitch in to help.\n\n“You never know how one word or one act may give someone hope and the strength to carry on,” Miller said, adding that she’s been cancer-free for nine years.\n\nOver the years, Miller said she’s been asked to give speeches and participate in charity golf tournaments. But painfully shy growing up, she always turned them down. Eventually, she started saying yes to both and found she enjoyed talking to and with people.\n\nShe brought it back to the Gold Medal Mindset, maintaining a positive attitude, setting goals and following through even when no one is watching, working as a team, holding your shoulders back, your head high and doing your best to win each day and committing yourself to excellence.\n\n“That was how I was wired,” she said. “My parents instilled in me this commitment to excellence … I’m not talking about perfection. It’s the little things, that extra effort that takes you from good to great. It’s also understanding that you have to make every moment count.”\n\nMeet the 2020 EVE Award winners\n\nEVE Winners: Randy DeFoor, Brenda Priestly Jackson honored for JEA stand\n\nEVE winner: Time as patient changed Jennifer Fulton's views on health care\n\nEVE winner: After escape from Iraq, Basma Alawee lobbies for refugees\n\nEVE winner: Shannon Nazworth’s desire for challenge led to nonprofit world\n\nEVE winner: Janet Owens continued to serve nonprofits even during cancer battle\n\nEVE winner: Lauren Skipper steps up to help hungry kids\n\nFull profiles of the winners will appear in the Times-Union’s Life section Sunday.

Another trophy will be named for him. Another Hall of Fame will induct him. Another honor. Another phone call. Congratulations.\n\nThis one was different.\n\nThis one, he didn’t see coming.\n\nOn Monday night the NBA will present Robertson – perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time, and without question the greatest our city has ever produced – with its Lifetime Achievement Award. Robertson, who led Crispus Attucks to state championships in 1955 and ’56, will become the award’s second recipient. A year ago it was former Celtics player Bill Russell, winner of 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons in Boston. Russell also coached two NBA teams, worked in the league as a television commentator, and in 2009 had his name added to the NBA Finals MVP Award. Bill Russell, the inaugural recipient of the league’s lifetime achievement honor? Made all the sense in the world.\n\nOscar Robertson is not Bill Russell. He never coached in the NBA. Never worked in TV. An NBA award named after him? Please. Oscar Robertson’s name is on something else – Robertson vs. National Basketball Association, the 1970 lawsuit that gave the NBA Players Association a revolutionary labor victory: the end of the contractual reserve clause, and beginning of free agency.\n\nMore Doyel on Crispus Attucks:Willie Gardner had so much, lost so much\n\nMore:Hope (and football) for Crispus Attucks\n\nMore:Pacers' usher Cleveland Harp is a \"player,\" too\n\n“The Oscar Robertson Rule,” that decision is called. The rule’s namesake possibly was — and he certainly believes he was — shut out by the NBA after retiring in 1974 as the No. 2 scorer in league history.\n\nSo I’m telling you, as Oscar was telling me a few days ago: This phone call from the NBA, telling him about the Lifetime Achievement Award, was not one he saw coming.\n\n“No,” he says. “I did not.”\n\nNow I’m asking him: What does it mean, to win this award?\n\n“It means I stayed around a little while,” Robertson says, and he’s chuckling and he’s being modest, and I could let it go. But I don’t, because this is why I called him: To find out what this award means to him, and to his relationship with the league.\n\nFor various reasons, some of the biggest basketball names in state history have gotten sideways with their past. It took Lebanon legend Rick Mount nearly four decades to mend fences with Purdue, but in January 2016 he ended his self-imposed exile and returned to Mackey Arena to a long and thunderous ovation, one giving me chills as I remember it 2½ years later. Former IU coach Bob Knight cannot get past his 2000 firing in Bloomington, rejecting repeated invitations to be honored with his most successful teams, but returning to Indiana to help Gene Keady raise money … for Purdue.\n\nMore Doyel on Rick Mount: Desperately seeking Rick Mount\n\nWhat has become of Knight is sad. Mount is another story, a much happier story, one of grace and healing.\n\nWhich brings me back to Oscar, and the reason for my phone call. What’s your story going to be, I was asking Oscar in so many words — sad, or graceful?\n\nThe line goes quiet for one second, two seconds. I swear he’s hung up on me —\n\n“It’s just something,” Oscar is saying, or trying to say. He stops there. It’s just … what? This is an important topic, delicate, and he wants to say this just right. And he’s about to. He’s about to say something beautiful. Here it comes:\n\n“When you play ball for a long time,” he says, “you get beat up a lot. You win, you lose, it’s a real competitive thing. And now this comes along, and it’s just wonderful. Almost like running a long race — you keep running and running and running, and boy, finally you can see some daylight.”\n\nThe relationship between Oscar Robertson and the NBA was stormy for so long, starting in 1965 when he became president of the NBA Players Association. He became the longest-running NBPA president in history: nearly a decade, from 1965-74. Along the way he won important pension benefits from the league, but his biggest contribution to the union — and the biggest wedge between the NBA and one of its greatest players — came in 1970 when the Robertson-led union filed an anti-trust lawsuit against the NBA to end the reserve clause. Six years later the union won free agency by negotiating a favorable settlement in a bruising legal battle that bears his name: Robertson vs. National Basketball Association.\n\nOscar wasn’t done. In 1992 he co-founded the National Basketball Retired Players Association (NBRPA) and served as president from 1992-98. In that role he helped negotiate what the NBRPA calls “the best pension plan for retired players amongst professional sports organizations in North America.”\n\nLots of history here. The two sides — Oscar and the league — haven’t been openly hostile, just … estranged. Robertson was named to the NBA’s 50th anniversary team in 1996, but that was chosen by a panel of media and coaches and team executives, which makes this newest honor different. After honoring Bill Russell, the NBA had scores of choices for its second lifetime award. To name just three: Elgin Baylor was third in the NBA in scoring when he retired in 1972, and spent another 26 years as an NBA coach or executive. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all-time scoring leader. Jerry West is the logo.\n\nBut — no. Oscar Robertson will be next.\n\nAnd here, NBA commissioner Adam Silver was saying on Sunday, is why: Because Oscar Robertson, fierce competitor and all-time NBA great, was so much greater, even, than that.\n\n“Oscar is undoubtedly one of the greatest players in NBA history, and his staunch advocacy for the game and its players continues today,” Silver said. “He remains a wonderful resource to me and others in the league, and will always be one of the most consequential members of the NBA family. We are thrilled to recognize Oscar’s lasting impact with our Lifetime Achievement Award.”\n\nFor Oscar, there is appreciation for an honor he didn’t see coming.\n\n“It means a lot,” he was telling me, and in all the conversations we’ve had over the years, this is the happiest I’ve ever heard him. “I’ve gone through quite a bit because of ‘the Oscar Robertson rule,’ but it is what it is, and I’m so happy to have been part of that. Look what it’s done for basketball.”\n\nIndeed, the NBA has become a global phenomenon with annual revenue rocketing toward $10 billion. On Monday night in Santa Monica, Calif., the league will hold the 2018 NBA Awards show on TNT. It will hand out MVP and Rookie of the Year and other trophies, and at some point it will summon 79-year-old Oscar Robertson onto the stage for the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nAfter 40 frigid years, this is the league delivering not just an honor, but a message: The sun is shining now, Big O. Come feel the warmth.\n\nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter: @GreggDoyelStar or at facebook.com/gregg.doyel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2018/07/18/adventist-health-simi-valley-gains-stroke-distinction/787281002/", "title": "Adventist Health Simi Valley gains stroke distinction", "text": "Staff reports\n\nAdventist Health Simi Valley has received the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association’s Get With the Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award and landed on the Target: Stroke Honor Roll for a second consecutive year.\n\nThe award recognizes the hospital’s commitment to ensuring that stroke patients receive the most appropriate treatment according to nationally recognized, research-based guidelines based on the latest scientific evidence.\n\nMore on the Simi Valley hospital:\n\nThe hospital earned the award by meeting specific quality-achievement measures for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke patients at a set level for a designated period.

He wouldn’t say who. He just wanted all to have a meaningful, motivational message ready.\n\nDuring that gathering, three regulars widely respected by teammates were summoned – starting cornerback Justin Watson, running back Thomas Jefferson, who’d been 2015 CAA co-Offensive Rookie of the Year, and tight end/h-back Kyle Yocum.\n\n“I was inspired. They all had great messages,” said Patrick Crowley, then a red-shirt sophomore who’d made the team as a walk-on out of Concord High.\n\nWhen it came time for the fourth and final speaker, Brock said it was someone players may not expect. Then he called Crowley.\n\n“I asked Frank Raggo, ‘Did he say my name?,’ ” said Crowley, who was sitting alongside the Delaware kicker. “He said ‘Yeah, go up!’ I was like ‘Oh wow.’ I was nervous.’ ”\n\nTo the front of the room stepped Delaware’s smallest player, a 5-foot-6, 180-pound special teamer and third-level cornerback who had appeared in just one career game up to then.\n\nHe promptly explained to his teammates how much it meant to him to play football for Delaware. It was a lifelong dream, come true.\n\n“His message was awesome,” teammate Troy Reeder would say later.\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: No easing up on end-zone celebrations\n\nBLUE HENS: Could Spruill be CAA's next freshman back to excel?\n\nCrowley is the grandson of Archie Rapposelli, an honored Delaware high school football coach who’d played for the Blue Hens. Crowley had been attending games and practices since his childhood, often wearing a full uniform, while making friends with players, such as quarterback Joe Flacco.\n\nAt one of those games, against James Madison when Crowley was 11 in 2006, he had walked down from his seat in the West stands at Delaware Stadium, plopped himself in a box-seat chair just above the field and introduced himself to the person next to him.\n\n“Remember my name. I’m going to be on this team one day,” Crowley informed that individual, who happened to be then-UD president David Roselle. Crowley’s aunt, Maryann Rapposelli, a UD employee, watched in stunned amazement.\n\nJerry Oravitz, Delaware’s former football operations director and now an associate athletic director in development, remembers Crowley standing outside Delaware Stadium following games wearing a full uniform, even sporting eye black, as he greeted his heroes.\n\n“Someday, somehow, Pat Crowley was going to be a Blue Hen,” Oravitz, who got to know the ubiquitous child, remembered thinking.\n\nAmong Crowley’s prized possessions are two photos of him and Flacco from 2006 and a framed hand-written letter Flacco sent him during his rookie season with the Baltimore Ravens, where he is now entering his 10th season as the starting quarterback.\n\nAs he spoke to his teammates last October, Crowley was addressing mostly players from out of state who’d been recruited by numerous schools and were on scholarship.He mentioned the young boys who await the players, asking for a chinstrap or wristband or just a high-five, as they head toward the locker room after games.\n\n“I told them I was that kid,” Crowley said. “You have to think about the people that you’re playing for. You might just think, ‘Oh, it’s Delaware football, it’s no big deal,’ but to some people, it’s a huge deal.”\n\nCrowley's love for the Blue Hens was honed as a childhood spectator, rooting for his idols, and has grown stronger now that he’s a player himself.\n\n“The way I feel about it is, I’m more tied to this team than anybody who signed the contract [for a scholarship] freshman year,” he said, reflecting on his comments to teammates. “I have to be here. There are ties between me and this Delaware football program that I have to be a part of it. It means more to me than a scholarship. I could play on this team forever. My worst nightmare is waking up and realizing I’m not going to be a Blue Hen one day, I’m not going to be on this team anymore because I absolutely love being on this team.\n\n“Up to this point in my life, it’s my proudest accomplishment.”\n\nCrowley’s father, Jim, said Patrick’s bedroom in their suburban Wilmington home is “a shrine to Delaware football and Joe Flacco.” That framed letter hangs above his bed, though Sonny Riccio, Flacco’s predecessor at quarterback in 2004-05, was his first favorite.\n\n“If there’s ever a Rudy II, this is it,” Jim Crowley said, referring to Daniel “Rudy” Ruettinger, the Notre Dame walk-on who played in his last game in 1975 and is the subject of the popular 1993 film “Rudy.”\n\nDevotion rooted in family\n\nThe Blue Hens begin the 2017 season Thursday night against Delaware State at Delaware Stadium in Newark.\n\nThe opener is being greeted with a new sense of excitement. Brock was fired the day after Delaware lost that game at William & Mary. In December, Delaware lured coach Danny Rocco away from CAA rival Richmond. He has a 90-42 record in 11 seasons as a head coach – the first six at Liberty – and has never had a losing year.\n\nDelaware is coming off its first back-to-back losing seasons – both 4-7 – since the late 1930s and hasn’t reached the NCAA playoffs in six years, double its second-longest absence (1983-85).\n\nThe Blue Hen Nation aches for a winner and Crowley, now in his red-shirt junior season, feels the pain.\n\nBut season-ticket sales have nearly doubled from last year, due in part to an unpopular UD Athletic Fund required donation being removed, and enthusiasm is strong.\n\n“I think he’s more hurt than anybody by the past couple years because he’s been around it for so long,” Brody Kern, Delaware’s fifth-year senior center and co-captain, said of Crowley. “He’s been coming to games since he was a little kid and all he ever wanted to do was play Delaware football.\n\n“He’s an amazing person, a great guy to talk to. He can talk to anybody, too. Because the history of Delaware is the way it is, having Pat is a reassurance of what we could be and what we should be.”\n\nCrowley’s love for Delaware football was instilled by his grandfather, Rapposelli, who donned his leather helmet to play guard on coach Bill Murray’s 1948-50 Blue Hen teams after a year on the freshman squad.\n\nIronically, rosters listed him as 5-foot-6, 181 pounds, one pound from the identical size as the grandson who would play for the Blue Hens almost 70 years later. Rapposelli played on the offensive line, now manned by behemoths typically weighing around 300 pounds and standing more than six feet tall.\n\nRapposelli died June 3, 2005, at age 76. Patrick was 10 and has fond memories.\n\n“I had a lot of Delaware football conversations with him, before I even started going to games,” Crowley said. “I always heard about Delaware football. They played in Wilmington [at 30th Street and Gov. Printz Boulevard]. He always told me about that stadium.”\n\nRapposelli was state high school football coach of the year in 1968 when he guided Claymont to a 9-0 record and the Blue Hen Conference Flight B title. There were no state tournaments then. A Claymont grad, Rapposelli had become the Indians coach in 1966 after nine years as an assistant at Salesianum. He coached Claymont through 1972.\n\n“My dad loved all of his grandchildren and he would always tell them to be the best you can be and give them words of encouragement,” said Patrick’s mother Margaret. “I think he’d be busting at the seams really to see Patrick out there on the field being 5-foot-not-much, sticking with it, working hard, because he made it all on his own.”\n\nMargaret Crowley spent some time on the field at Delaware Stadium herself. In 1984, as a UD sophomore, she wore the Blue Hen mascot suit – pre-YoUDee – during football games. Patrick’s two older sisters Michelle and Brenda also attended UD. His identical twin brother, Michael, is a senior who has played the lead role in several UD theatre productions.\n\nAt Concord, Pat Crowley was a two-year starter at cornerback, saw spot duty at quarterback and also kicked, sometimes scoring when he ran on direct snaps. He was captain his senior season in 2013, which was long-time Raiders coach George Kosanovich’s last before retiring.\n\n“Pat worked so hard all the time and earned his way to get to where he was,” Kosanovich said of Crowley, whom he called the type of dedicated player who “really makes a program go.”\n\nKosanovich was coaching at Wilmington High when Crowley’s grandfather was at Claymont, knew him well and coached with him in several Blue-Gold all-star games, a fact Crowley appreciated.\n\n“I loved Archie,” Kosanovich said. “You didn’t have to think twice about what Archie was thinking or what he was going to say. Everything he did was right on his collar and you knew what was coming.”\n\nWhile in high school, Crowley took part in theDamion Daniels Elite Training program, where he got to know players who actually were elite, such as Newark’s Taylor Reynolds, who starred as a James Madison cornerback and had an Atlanta Falcons free-agent opportunity; St. Elizabeth’s Andre Patton, the Rutgers wide receiver now in the Los Angeles Chargers’ camp; and Middletown’s Chris Godwin, the wide receiver drafted in the third round by the Tampa Buccaneers in April out of Penn State.\n\n“There’s a lot of guys who got me better training with them,” Crowley said. “It was all to get to Delaware. That was my end goal. My size wouldn’t get me here, my speed, nothing like that. So I thought my work ethic would have to set me apart to be seen by the coaches.”\n\nWhen former Delaware assistant coach Brian Ginn came to recruit Concord teammate Grant Roberts, Crowley took the opportunity to make some contacts himself. It led to a 2013 recruiting visit during Delaware’s win over James Madison and a 2014 summer tryout that earned him a walk-on spot.\n\nCrowley’s uncle Joe Rapposelli played for the Blue Hens in the early 1990s. Last year, after Crowley saw his first game action against Delaware State, Joe had a present for him.\n\nIt was Archie Rapposelli’s 1950 Delaware letter sweater, made of thick blue wool with a yellow ‘D’ sewn on. Archie Rapposelli had proudly stitched a purple and gold Claymont ‘C” on the other side.\n\n“That’s when I realized how proud my grandfather would be that I was playing for Delaware,” Crowley said.\n\nLifelong dream fulfilled\n\nThe Blue Hens were well on their way to a 56-14 opening-night win over Delaware State last season at Delaware Stadium when Crowley was sent onto the field for the first time in a game to play cornerback.\n\n“It brought tears to my eyes,” father Jim said.\n\nThat was an epidemic inside Delaware Stadium, where a woman sitting near Mike Buono asked the Brandywine Warriors youth coach why his eyes had turned misty. He told her it was from seeing one of his all-time favorite players step on the field to play for the Blue Hens.\n\n“I get chills talking about that,” Crowley said of his first game action as a Blue Hen. “I saw my family in the stands. That was the first thing I did. I was looking up at the pressbox and I was like ‘Wow. This is like the most special moment of my life.’\n\n“Then I started locking in. The coaches were yelling at me. I think the call was something like ‘Buzz!” and I was like ‘I have to play football’ and when the play is over I can think about it again. That was amazing.”\n\nCrowley made Delaware’s travel roster, which consists of roughly 70 players, and midway through the season he became a starter in the punt block unit, which Delaware calls “pride and joy.”\n\nIt certainly fit that description for Crowley, who appeared in five games last season.\n\n“That’s when I really felt like I belonged and was contributing to the team,” said Crowley, who has also been a holder for kicks this year. “That was really eye opening.”\n\nThose contributions continue and they are not taken lightly, said Rocco.\n\n“There are a lot of ways to add value to your program and it’s not always the guys who are the star players who are adding value,” said Rocco, who spent his childhood glued to the high school teams his father, Frank, was coaching throughout Pennsylvania.\n\n“Pat certainly adds a lot of value in a lot of different ways. He comes in every day to practice with a great attitude. He comes to work. His enthusiasm rubs off on the teammates. It’ll bring me great joy to be able to get him out there in a game and give him an opportunity to do some things to help us get some wins.”\n\nChris Cosh, Delaware’s defensive coordinator and secondary coach, credits Crowley, a sport management major who aspires to coach college football, for a willingness to help other players be better.\n\n“He’s making calls from the sidelines, predicting routes,” Cosh said. “He’ll come tell me, ‘Coach, so-and-so did this.’ He’s into it and when he gets out there he has the same expectations as everyone else. He takes a lot of pride in his work. He brightens up my day by being out there.”\n\nTurns out Crowley has a history of helping Delaware defensive backs, going back to when he was 12.\n\nIn 2007, the week before it played Navy, Delaware had an open date. Some UD players happened to be at 69th Street Field in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, that Saturday watching youth games. Crowley, playing there for the Brandywine Warriors, spotted cornerback Anthony Walters.\n\n“He said, ‘Be ready next week when you play Navy because of that receiver, number such and such, you’re gonna be covering. Watch him,’ ” Jim Crowley recalled. “Anthony was like, ‘We haven’t even looked at any film yet.’ ”\n\nThe following week, Jim brought Patrick to a UD practice.\n\n“Anthony walked over,” Jim Crowley said, “and said, ‘You’re not gonna believe this. We’ve been watching game film. He was spot on. He knew exactly what they were running and that’s the guy I’m covering. He knew that. I don’t know how in the world . . . ’ ”\n\nDespite young Crowley’s scouting report, the UD defense had a tough time in Annapolis with Navy’s triple-option attack. But Flacco threw for a career-high 434 yards and four touchdowns and Omar Cuff rushed for 141 yards and four TDs of his own in a 59-52 win.\n\nA year later, as a Ravens rookie, Flacco answered a letter from Crowley, then 13, with an advice-filled, full-page response in which he urged the then-quarterback hopeful to “always be working to be the best self you can be!!”\n\nHe closed the letter by writing, “It would be great to see you at QB for the Hens someday, but don’t be afraid to picture yourself playing QB at USC or Notre Dame either.”\n\nSitting there listening to Crowley that night in Williamsburg, and understanding his lecture as well as anyone, was Troy Reeder.\n\nReeder was a standout at Salesianum and then started for Penn State as a red-shirt freshman linebacker on 2015. He transferred back to Delaware, where father Danny starred, so he could play with younger brother Colby.\n\nAt Penn State, Reeder had been around kids who’d been lifelong Nittany Lions fans and “are dying to just be on the team, no matter what their role is,” he said.“It might their fifth year, their last game of the season, they get to run down on a kickoff.”\n\nDelaware football, Reeder knows, has similar allure.\n\n“Pat’s a real good example of what can happen when you do have a positive attitude for everything,” Reeder said. “All of a sudden you go from a guy who walks onto the team and people from the outside think you don’t have much of a shot and he’s on punt return holding guys up or holding kicks or whatever.\n\n“That’s a tribute to him and I think he inspires a lot of guys on our team.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini atktresolini@delawareonline.com.

He announced his retirement Feb. 18, 2002.\n\n“Nothing lasts forever, and so it is with me,” Raymond, then 76, said that day.\n\nRaymond, who lived in Landenberg, Pennsylvania, since the 1990s, was often credited with raising tiny Delaware’s stature nationally better than anyone – until another First Stater and former UD freshman football player, Joe Biden, became vice president in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Raymond was recognized by the Delaware Historical Society as its sixth History Maker award winner at a Carpenter Center gala, where former UD athletic director Edgar Johnson said Raymond was more “legend” than coach.\n\n“He stands with the immortals,\" Johnson told the gathering. “If you said ‘Tubby,’ everybody in the country in football knew who you were talking about. He’s had such a huge impact on our small state.’’\n\nJohnson was shaken by the news of Raymond's passing Friday.\n\n\"It's a sad day,\" he said. \"No matter where you went throughout the country, when you said you were from the University of Delaware, people would say, 'Oh, that's Tubby Raymond's school.' He got more out of his players than other coaches, and he was a good man.\"\n\nOne of those players was Johnson's son, Chris, a Salesianum School graduate who played on Raymond's 1991-93 teams.\n\n“He was the best neighbor you could ask for,” said former Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, who grew up in Newark’s Windy Hills neighborhood near the Raymonds. “Not just because he let us on the field at the Boardwalk Bowl but because he would stop by the house just to make sure us kids were OK. One in a million.”\n\nMarkell added that Raymond gave him his first haircuts.\n\nA 1999 Sports Illustrated list ranked Raymond fourth among Delaware’s all-time greatest sports figures behind McKean High graduate and Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White, Negro leagues star and baseball Hall of Famer Judy Johnson and Seaford High three-sport standout and 13-year major league baseball player Delino DeShields.\n\n“In our eyes, Tubby was always 10 feet tall,’’ former player Joe Purzycki said of the 5-foot-7 Raymond, who earned his nickname as a chunky child in Flint, Michigan. He lost the weight but not the moniker.\n\nThe late Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant enjoyed calling Raymond “Napoleon” from their work together in all-star games.\n\nRaymond came to Delaware in 1954 as Nelson's backfield coach and was his hand-picked successor in 1966, when Nelson feared Raymond would bolt UD for a head coaching job somewhere else. His 1971 and '72 teams were voted small-college national champions in wire-service polls.\n\nThe NCAA began playoffs for schools at Delaware’s level in 1973 and Raymond’s 1979 team won the Division II title. Raymond’s teams lost Division II championship games in 1974 and 1978.\n\nAfter moving from Division II to I-AA in 1980, Delaware reached the national semifinals four times (1982, 1992, 1997 and 2000). The Hens lost their lone I-AA title-game appearance under Raymond in 1982.\n\nHis Blue Hens qualified for the NCAA playoffs 16 times, won 14 Lambert Cups, symbolic of Eastern supremacy, and captured six Yankee Conference/Atlantic 10 titles.\n\n“He was a master motivator,” 1978-80 starting linebacker K.C. Keeler, who would later be named Raymond’s successor, said the day Raymond retired as coach. “We didn't know if he was a mad scientist or the crazy professor. But he knew how to deal with everybody differently, and he knew how to get the most out of you.’’\n\nRaymond remained a familiar presence around UD football, which was then coached by Keeler (2002-12), Dave Brock (2013-16), Dennis Dottin-Carter (2016) and now Danny Rocco. All welcomed Raymond into football meetings and practices, and he often watched videotape with coaches.\n\n\"What he has done kind of transcends time,\" said Rocco, who has coached since 1984 and was well aware of Raymond's legendary status before arriving at Delaware last December. \"He has touched so many young people's lives and he's changed the lives of so many of his ex-players. He has been able to shape and mold them into being men of good character who've been able to go out and contribute in our society and men that remain extremely proud of being part of the Delaware Blue Hen family.\"\n\nRocco added that Raymond's influence always has been and always will remain an important part of UD football. The playing surface at Delaware Stadium has been called Tubby Raymond Field since his retirement.\n\n\"To this day I recognize him as being a very caring and giving human being,\" Rocco said. \"That's what kind of caught me off-guard when I first got here and met him. He was a lot more interested in meeting me. … It'll hurt a lot, but I think it'll even continue to help us appreciate what we had.\"\n\nRaymond also did some radio work following retirement and attended weekly UD football press conferences, even challenging Keeler, at times, over his fondness for bringing in so many transfer players.\n\nHe also took part in the annual alumni spring golf outing, enjoying the reunion with former players.\n\nAn accomplished artist, Raymond continued to paint portraits of senior players, on which he would include a clever comment and a quip from Dick, the mid-20th-century name accorded the Blue Hen mascot, which he also drew. That weekly tradition dated to his coaching days.\n\nEASEL DOES IT: Tubby Raymond still painting Hen portraits\n\nRaymond also established the Tubby Raymond Foundation to benefit area programs aiding at-risk children and used his paintings as fundraising material, including a popular work depicting UD/NFL quarterbacks Rich Gannon, Scott Brunner and Joe Flacco.\n\nAs a coach, Raymond frequently said his greatest pleasure came from seeing the value players drew from the shared bond of teamwork and accomplishment and how their academic experience enriched their lives well after they left Delaware.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed by this experience,’’ Raymond said the day of his College Football Hall of Fame induction in South Bend, Indiana. “It's impossible for me to explain it, how it happened. I never had a job. I coached football. It was all wonderful. I loved all the people there [at Delaware].”\n\nRaymond attended the University of Michigan, where he was a catcher who captained the baseball team but a rarely used quarterback and linebacker on the football squad.\n\nHe played two years of minor league baseball before fellow Michigan graduate Harold Westerman, who had just replaced Nelson as head coach at Maine when Nelson left for Delaware, summoned Raymond in 1951 to join his Black Bears coaching staff. Raymond also coached the Maine baseball team.\n\nIn 1954, Nelson, also a Michigan man, lured Raymond to Delaware and installed him as backfield coach on the football staff and baseball coach. Delaware’s 1963 team won the national title. Raymond also guided UD baseball teams to a 164-72-3 mark from 1956-64.\n\nIn football, Raymond teamed with Nelson to make the Delaware Wing-T, invented by Nelson and honed by him and Raymond, into a nationally recognized offensive scheme used by high school, college and even NFL teams. The Wing-T was effective by utilizing smaller players in schemes that fooled defenses with motion and misdirection. Before and after he was named head coach, Raymond turned down numerous opportunities for higher-level coaching jobs to stay at Delaware.\n\nRaymond married childhood sweetheart Suzanne Heinmann in 1951, and they had three children – daughter Debbie and sons Chris and David, who punted for his father’s 1976 and ’77 teams and later became well known as the first Phillie Phanatic mascot. Sue Raymond, who lost her hearing because of an illness and became an advocate for the hearing-impaired, died of cancer in 1990. In 1993, Raymond married Diane Esterling, who has a daughter, Michelle.\n\nRaymond had 11 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Tubby Raymond Foundation.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Nearly 100 alumni currently have students in one or both schools.\n\n“Our Legacy Breakfast was a gesture to thank our alumni parents for their commitment to Catholic education. But it was also to recognize the value these alumni have placed on the education that they received at these two schools, so much so that they wanted their children to have the same experience,” said Stacey Mezzacca Geary, class of 1991, advancement associate, who coordinated the program. “We started the morning in the Immaculata Chapel for Mass, followed up with a group picture, and then shared lots of memories, as we enjoyed the refreshments.”\n\nAnna Trapani Ferreira, class of 1980, whose daughter is a student at ICS, was pleased to attend. “When I visit Immaculata High School, I think of family and tradition. Being in the Immaculata Chapel feels like home.

I hope this will be a new tradition to celebrate with my daughter and husband. I know she will experience special relationships just like I did. Friends become family at IHS.”\n\nKate Schmeider McCabe class of 92, who has children at both schools, echoed Anna’s sentiments. “What was so poignant was the continuity of the experiences from each Spartan, the great friendships we made, the fulfilling services we accomplished, and the Spartan Spirit weeks we all enjoyed. As we were walking out, we each said to one another ‘Yes, those were four of the greatest years of our lives and we are so grateful that we can give our kids the opportunity to experience the same!’”\n\nPrincipal Jean Kline, herself an Immaculata graduate, along with her husband, two daughters, and four family members, addressed the gathering. “There is no greater tribute to Immaculate Conception and Immaculata High School than when alumni choose to send their children to their alma mater. We take immense pride in educating generations of ICS and IHS families. It is so gratifying to hear how our graduates have embraced our school’s four pillars (faith, scholarship, service, and friendship) and how they encourage these concepts with their children. Our legacy parents are the part of the Spartan heritage and traditions that make our schools extraordinary and we look forward to seeing more legacy parents next year.”\n\nLebanon Valley College\n\nAnna Evanko of Glen Gardner, received a bachelor's degree in art and visual culture on May 12.\n\nMiami University\n\nRingoes resident John Mondoro, a student at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. spent the winter semester in Thailand as part of a study abroad group.\n\nMount Saint Mary Academy\n\nMount Saint Mary Academy junior Grace Gordon from Annandale, and sophomore Melanie Valliciergo from Mountainside have earned grants to study in Italy this July for 12 days from IACE (Italian American Committee on Education).\n\nBoth students submitted multimedia projects on Italian cinema and its ties to Umbria and Narni, Italy and they were recommended for the grant by Teresa Sengel, World Language Department at the Watchung-based academy, and Italian teacher Giuseppina Lane.

The paper, “Contactless Magnetic Gears – A Project Based Learning Approach to Understanding Magnetic Gear Systems,” will be published in the Conference Proceedings.\n\nHiamang, a resident of Easton, Pennsylvania, who is studying civil engineering at the college, presented the work with RVCC Professor Peter Stupak. She conducted her research with Stupak during the fall 2017 Semester.\n\nThe conference also featured a paper highlighting a collaborative, interdisciplinary work created by RVCC’s Authentic Engineering Experience Team and Professor Darren McManus' Visual Design class. The paper, “Backpacking Tent Light – An Engineering/Visual Communication Interdisciplinary Product Development,” describes the Backpacking Tent Light that provides 30 minutes of green-energy, battery-free illumination for backpacking in a mountain-tent environment. The paper’s authors include Adam Walton of Hillsborough, Tyler Sarno of Flemington, Rachel Geiler of Pittstown, Kimberly Tsui of Hillsborough, Laure Turlybekova of Summit and Erick Hernandez of Stewartsville, as well as McManus.\n\nThe Engineering student team consisted of two second-year engineering students participating in an Authentic Engineering Experience course where they were asked to design, prototype, build and deliver a real product to a real customer — in this case, RVCC Professor Darren McManus — n one semester. The Visual Communication student team, composed of nine Visual Communication majors enrolled in the fall 2017 Visual Design 1 course, were each tasked with developing a complete graphic identity for the product. This included a unique product name; a logo; corporate collateral, such as business cards, envelopes and letterhead; a series of print advertisements; and product packaging based on the envisioned target market for the product.\n\nFor additional information about the Authentic Engineering Experience at RVCC, contact Professor Peter Stupak at peter.stupak@raritanval.edu.\n\nPennsylvania College of Technology\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents received their degrees on May 12 from Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport, Pennsylvania:\n\nMatthew M.

She has a dual bachelor's degree in special education and history also from The College of New Jersey. She started working as an autism teacher in Hillsborough in early May for a class of seven 3-4 year olds, all boys.\n\nThe Wardlaw+Hartridge School\n\nALSO: On Saturday May 12, the Middle School Robotics Club and Upper School Robotics Team from The Wardlaw+Hartridge School in Edison participated in the Botball Tournament in Rahway. Although this is the sixth year that the middle school competed, it was the first year for Upper School. During the year, teams built autonomous robots using Lego components and metal parts. New team members learned how to code in C language, while returning members took their code to a higher level with variables, functions and Boolean logic.\n\nIn the run up to the tournament teams collaborated on documentation detailing their project plan, mechanical design, code analysis and lessons learned. Both teams earned perfect scores on these documents. During the tournament teams contended in seeding rounds then double elimination challenges against 23 teams.\n\n“The competition is really enjoyable and a great bonding experience. This year, we did really well, scoring over 20 points each round,” Faizah Naqvi of South Plainfield said.\n\nAfter a long day of head-to-head challenges, the team’s dedication and cooperation paid off. The W+H Middle School team placed eighth and the Upper School team placed 12th.\n\nMiddle School team members: Faizah Naqvi of South Plainfield and Shiv Tickoo of Scotch Plains (captains), Robin Zhong of Edison, Nate Valcourt of South Plainfield, Feisal Kiiru of Edison, Naischa Puri of Edison, David Flateau-Jones of Scotch Plains, Andrew Kojima of Woodbridge, Charlie Silver of Rahway, Naomi Valcourt of South Plainfield, Joanne Ding of Iselin and Kayla Martel of Winfield Park.\n\nUpper School team members: Mark Zhang of Edison and John Papetti III of Elizabeth (captains), Steven Li, Mike He and George Zhong of Edison, Rihan Sajid of Carteret, Alex Caiola of Westfield and Armaan Kapoor of Millburn.\n\nTrine University\n\nMichael Meisenbacher of Basking Ridge was named to the spring dean's list at Trine University in Angola, Indiana.

Horeb School, Woodland School, Angelo L. Tomaso School and Central School put their passion for reading to the test on May 30, during the annual Battle of the Books competition conducted at Mt. Horeb School.\n\nAll grade 5 students from each elementary school have been preparing since November by reading or listening to as many as 15 books from a selected reading list. “Shoeless Joe & Me: A Baseball Card Adventure” by Dan Gutman, “The Familiars” by Adam Jay Epstein & Andrew Jacobson, “The Watsons Go to Birmingham, 1963” by Christopher Paul Curtis and “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe” by C.S. Lewis are among the list of books selected for the grade 5 students.\n\nThe library was filled with spectators who came to witness this district wide competition. After 12 rounds of very specific questions pertaining to each of the books on the selected reading list, the Reading Rock Stars from Angelo L. Tomaso School came in first place answering the most questions correctly, including knowing the authors’ names for each book.\n\nEach team of students displayed their very best effort during this impressive showcase of reading comprehension. Teammates worked collaboratively to come up with the best response for each question. The team captains of each of the 4 teams answered all of the questions in a clear and confident manner and all participants were enjoying the experience. The library media specialist from each elementary school, Christine Burkhardt, Susan Jackson, Kate Zaleski and Lindsay La Neve, coordinated the event.\n\nWestfield High School\n\nFive Westfield High School students achieved the highest score possible on the April 2018 ACT standardized tests, according to recent reports received by the school.

The Tuscaloosa News reports Saban and his wife, Terry, are making a $1 million donation for what will become the Saban Center, and Saban’s private foundation, Nick’s Kids, will donate another $250,000. The more than 100,000-square-foot complex will be located in the existing Tuscaloosa News building near downtown. It will be updated as a home to the Tuscaloosa Public Library, a hands-on children’s museum and the Tuscaloosa Children’s Theater. The center, Saban said at a luncheon, will become “a hub for a lot of educational matters.” City leaders voted to buy the newspaper building, located downtown above the Black Warrior River, for nearly $8 million in October.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The state Department of Environmental Conservation has submitted its required final air quality improvement plan to the Environmental Protection Agency to reach compliance with the Clean Air Act. KTVF-TV reports the department released the Serious State Implementation Plan for Fairbanks North Star Borough allowing the public to see changes and their effective dates. Officials say this plan reflects revisions made after the department received public feedback. Department officials say the plan would prohibit the use of wood as the only heating source in homes, require EPA-certified wood burning devices in homes and prohibit commercial sellers from selling anything other than dry wood. Officials say some of the changes have delayed effective dates, but most of the regulations are expected to go into effect Jan. 8.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: After six weeks of parts of the Central Arizona Project canal being dry in order to do $6 million in repairs, Colorado River water will be flowing again Tuesday. The repairs were made to the canal where it tunnels beneath the Salt River in north Mesa. Water was still delivered to customers west of that point, but about 75% of CAP water is normally delivered beyond there. Several cities, tribes and irrigation districts rely on CAP water deliveries to supplement water supplies they get from the Salt and Verde rivers and from groundwater pumping. CAP general manager Ted Cook says plans for the repairs took about three years so that all of the customers who would have to go without Colorado River water for the duration could prepare. The inside of a 21-foot-diameter steel pipe needed recoating to protect against rust, officials say.\n\nArkansas\n\nLowell: A 24-year-old man drowned in a lake after driving a truck into the water during a police chase, authorities say. Late Saturday, Lowell police pulled over the truck, which initially stopped but took off as the officer was exiting his patrol vehicle, the police department said in a press release. Officers pursued the truck onto a highway that dead-ended at a boat ramp. Lowell police said Carlos Martinez then drove the truck into Beaver Lake. Martinez and two female passengers began swimming, but police said Martinez submerged and did not resurface. One passenger made it to the shore, where she was taken into custody, and the other was apprehended in the water, police said. Both women were treated for hypothermia, and police said they will face charges. Martinez’s body was recovered from the water shortly after the pursuit, police said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Recent heavy storms have wiped out much of the state’s abnormally dry conditions. Two months ago, the U.S. Drought Monitor categorized more 81% of the state as abnormally dry because of above-normal temperatures and a lack of precipitation six weeks into the water year that started Oct. 1. The percentage climbed to 85% as recently as last week. But heavy rains throughout the state have shrunk the percentage to a sliver along the Oregon-California border. This was the 10th driest October since record-keeping began in 1895, says David Simeral, a research scientist at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno. The category put most of the state one step above moderate drought level and indicates the soil is dry, snow pack is minimal, and fire danger is high. California had seven years of drought that ended March 2019.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal appeals court has ruled that officials at a supermax prison in the state sufficiently changed their policies and corrected their mistakes after refusing to distribute a magazine that provides legal information to inmates. The three-judge panel of the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected an argument by the magazine’s publisher, Prison Legal News, that a court order was warranted to prevent future censorship. “The Warden has declared that PLN’s future publications substantially similar to the previously rejected publications will not be rejected,” said the opinion written by Judge Scott Matheson Jr. The facility is the highest-security prison in the U.S., housing inmates such as Unabomber Theodore Kaczyinski, Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and, more recently, drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Public utilities regulators have asked the state’s two largest electricity providers to increase efforts to reach out to customers who might qualify for hardship status. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, in response to a surge in shutoffs over the past few years, asked Eversource and United Illuminating last week to prepare a script that call centers would use when talking to customers to determine and recognize hardship eligibility, according to the Hartford Courant. The board also asked the utilities to prepare single-page, straightforward explanations on hardship criteria and to hold meetings in neighborhoods where the people who need the information and assistance the most are located. The move was hailed by advocates. “It’s a extraordinary decision. They heard us,” says lawyer Bonnie Roswig of the Center for Children’s Advocacy in Hartford.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In a city that is almost 70% African American and Latino, the diversity of the police charged to serve and protect residents does not reflect that number. But more than half of the City Council says it should. The council voted 6-5 recently to postpone the forming of a new class of cadets until more is done to ensure that class’s diversity. Opposing them were council members who said diversity matters, but violent crime in the city is more important, and a class should be started immediately. Those who voted to postpone argued that Police Chief Robert Tracy has not given the council a plan about how he would make sure the next class of cadets was more diverse. They questioned his seriousness about doing so. “I’m surprised that this is on the agenda because, as it was said, we had a meeting about this,” Councilman Trippi Congo said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Four former D.C. police officers are suing their old department, saying it regularly violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and forced them to retire over mental or physical illnesses. The federal lawsuit filed Thursday against the district, the department and its chief alleges the department pushed out disabled officers without trying to accommodate them by providing extended leave or changing their responsibilities, WTOP-FM reports. The suit seeks a jury trial. Department policy forced employees into disability retirement if they were on less than full-duty status for 172 cumulative work days over a two-year period for an injury or disability suffered outside work, the lawsuit alleges. One of the former officers says the department also made improper medical inquiries and imposed improper medical examinations on him.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The city has a different take on the presidential turkey pardoning for the holidays. Mayor Carlos Gimenez is adding some caliente to the tradition by pardoning a pig. Roasted pig, or lechon, is the centerpiece of many South Florida Christmas feasts. The annual pig pardoning ceremony took place Monday at Latin Cafe 2000 Brickell. The two lucky pigs, Peppa and Petra, were rescued from a local slaughterhouse by the Aguacate Sanctuary of Love. The rescue group says the pigs will have ample space to run free. The ceremony was open to the public, with pork-free light bites served along with, of course, Cuban Cafecito.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An economic forecast predicts fewer jobs will be created in the state next year as its economy continues to grow, but at a slower pace. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 4.2% in 2020, compared to an estimated 3.7% for all of 2019, according to the Georgia Economic Outlook. The report was presented Wednesday in Atlanta by University of Georgia Terry College of Business dean Benjamin Ayers, according to a news release from the school. Nonfarm employment is expected to rise by 21,000 jobs statewide. That’s more than a third less than the 69,000 jobs the state is expecting to add in 2019, the report produced by UGA’s Selig Center for Economic Growth found. The “guiding light” of the 2020 economy will be consumers, Ayers said. Consumer spending, low interest rates and rising home values are expected to spur growth. But international trade tensions are the main recession risk, according to Ayers.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: While a taste for its flavors may continue, a Hawaii ice cream company is facing an unsavory blow to its business after a supply partner declared bankruptcy. Dave’s Ice Cream Inc. may have to reduce its supply after last month’s bankruptcy of national food and beverage firm Dean Foods, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Dave’s sells about 15,000 gallons of ice cream made in Pearl City on Oahu to eateries and stores, owner Dave Leong says. The company distributes its desserts under a wholesale arrangement with Dean Foods subsidiary Meadow Gold Dairies-Hawaii. Meadow Gold plans to import ice cream from Utah to supply Hawaii restaurant customers beginning next month, Leong says. The move would cut off a third of Dave’s business, amounting to more than $1 million annually, Leong says.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Press Club and four Boise-area journalists have won a lawsuit they filed against Ada County officials under the Idaho Public Records Act. In Friday’s ruling, 4th District Judge Deborah Bail wrote that the county’s approach to the public records requests it had received from the journalists was so far removed from the requirements of the state law that it was as though the county were doing the opposite of what the Idaho Public Records Act required. All of the documents requested by the journalists, with the exception of just a few, must be turned over to them, Bail said. She also ordered Ada County to pay the Idaho Press Club’s attorneys fees. “Ada County’s approach to handling the Idaho Public Records Act requests in this case was troubling,” the judge wrote in Friday’s ruling.\n\nIllinois\n\nOregon: The restoration project for a northern Illinois landmark known as the Black Hawk statue is near completion after funding and weather-related delays. The 108-year-old monument at Lowden State Park has spent most of the past five years beneath plastic covering to protect it from harsh weather. Standing at 48 feet tall, the statue overlooks the Rock River in the city of Oregon. It is one of the tallest concrete monolith statues in the world. Lorado Taft, the sculptor who designed it, dedicated the statue as a tribute to Native Americans in 1911 and named it The Eternal Indian. The statue’s arms had to be fully replaced, WLS-TV reports. The head needed to be repaired, and most of the decayed exterior concrete has been chipped away and replaced with a new, less permeable concrete mix. The project is expected to be completed at the end of December.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: The city is renaming a street to honor controversial 1960s civil rights leader Malcolm X. Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson said one of her last acts in office will be issuing an executive order to rename Virginia Street as Malcolm X Boulevard. She said Malcolm X emphasized, particularly toward the end of his life, “how much those who struggled and those who were underserved and underprivileged had in common.” Malcolm X, a Muslim minister who broke away from the Nation of Islam in 1964, was assassinated Feb. 21, 1965, at the age of 39 by three Nation members during a speaking engagement in Manhattan. Freeman-Wilson said she will issue the Malcolm X order Dec. 20. It will take effect July 1 because street signs and addresses will need to be changed.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The state auditor on Monday criticized $40,000 in relocation benefits that helped a veteran Iowa State Patrol supervisor move his family to a home farther away from his new assignment in western Iowa. State Auditor Rob Sand concluded there was no “public benefit” for taxpayers to cover closing costs and other expenses on the sale of Lt. Joel Ehler’s home in Adel. Sand wrote in a report that the sale was more related to Ehler’s purchase of a new home in West Des Moines than to his relocation to become the patrol’s district commander of Council Bluffs. Sand’s office investigated the matter after the Associated Press reported on the allocation of benefits in May. Its findings contrast with those of an internal investigation by the Iowa Department of Public Safety, which found that the benefits were appropriate and that Ehler did nothing wrong.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas prisons have exceeded their operating capacity, and it will cost the state millions of dollars to send hundreds of prisoners to a privately owned and operated prison in Arizona. The Kansas Department of Corrections this month announced a contract with CoreCivic to move inmates to Saguaro Correctional Center, KCUR-FM reports. Plans call for 360 male prisoners to be moved starting this summer, and up to 600 inmates could be moved. CoreCivic plans to fly the first group of 120 inmates to the prison in Eloy, Arizona, and others will be driven to the facility. The prison is roughly a 12-hour drive from the southwestern corner of Kansas. State Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita, said the rise in prison population is due to decades of policies in which more people are being sent to jail and for longer periods of time.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Days after his administration was questioned for not having the POW/MIA flag on top of the state Capitol, Gov. Andy Beshear has announced the flag will return and remain through his time in office. “Every day we honor the sacrifices of Kentuckians and Americans who are still prisoners, missing or unaccounted for,” Beshear said in a Sunday evening news release. “To show our daily commitment to these heroes and their families, the POW/MIA flag will be flown permanently at the Capitol.” He signed a proclamation to that effect Monday. On Dec. 9, the POW/MIA flag was flown as part of a POW/MIA ceremony held at the Capitol before Beshear took office, according to the release, but outgoing Gov. Matt Bevin’s administration did not issue an order for it to remain. The next day, Beshear was inaugurated, and all flags were removed and new flags put up, but a POW/MIA flag was not put back up.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State education leaders are pushing for all high school graduates within a decade to leave school with college credit or an industry-based credential, a target in line with the state’s new higher education master plan. The Advocate reports that the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which oversees K-12 public education, and the Board of Regents, which oversees public colleges, adopted the goal for 2029 graduates during a joint meeting last week. The goal, if accomplished, would double the current achievement level through courses known as dual-enrollment, in which students take college-level classes for both high school and college credit. Half of the high school graduating class of 2018 earned college credit for at least one course or a marketable industry credential, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A National Park Service effort to improve dozens of miles of historic carriage roads in Acadia National Park is scheduled to reach completion next year. The park service says next year Eagle Lake Carriage Road will be rehabilitated with a goal of stabilizing and improving the road surface. Partial road closures from one intersection to another should be anticipated from April 15 to Nov. 15, the service says. The improvements to Acadia’s carriage roads are designed to preserve the roads for future generations, the park service says. Acadia “contains nationally significant cultural resources including the best and most extensive example of a historic carriage road system in the United States,” the service said in a statement.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Some construction projects in the state are costing tens of millions of dollars more than original estimates, in large measure because of a lack of skilled trades in the region. The increase in price for just two large projects at the University of Maryland was about $64 million. Maryland Center for Construction Education & Innovation President Bob Ayudkovic says the labor shortages in Maryland and nationally can be traced back to the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009. Issues include a high demand for and low supply of skilled workers, which result in higher wages, adjustments to the scope of projects and rebidding trade packages. Documentation for the University of Maryland projects also indicated that multiple large mechanical, electrical and plumbing contractors are no longer in business.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City officials are expected to consider renaming the square in a historically black neighborhood to Nubian Square. Sadiki Kambon, chair of Nubian Square Coalition, says his group’s proposal is expected to go before the Public Improvement Commission on Thursday. Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh supports the effort. A citywide ballot referendum on the idea failed in November, but the vote tally showed that residents in the Roxbury neighborhood, where the name change is being proposed, overwhelmingly favored it. Supporters say the commercial center should be renamed because Roxbury resident Thomas Dudley was a leading politician when Massachusetts legally sanctioned slavery in the 1600s. But opponents counter that slavery was also part of the ancient Nubian empire, which ruled over swaths of modern-day Egypt and Sudan thousands of years ago.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: Michigan State University researchers have reached their goal of breeding a purple potato, and now it’s being made into purple, kettle-cooked potato chips. Dave Douches, director for the MSU Potato Breeding and Genetics program, and other researchers spent 20 years crossing potato varieties and testing to develop what they call the Blackberry potato. The MSU potato program and Traverse City-based Great Lakes Potato Chip Co. partnered to produce the chips as a way to capitalize on the Blackberry potato and to celebrate the chip company’s 10th anniversary. It does not taste sweet like a blackberry, but Douches says it makes a tasty potato chip. Douches began developing the potato after he found a hole in the potato market. There were other purple potatoes, but none of them had a deep purple color like the Blackberry potato.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state government will continue to consent to refugee resettlement, Gov. Tim Walz said Friday, in response to a recent presidential executive order that requires consent from states and counties. “The inn is not full in Minnesota,” the Democratic governor said in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just ahead of the Christmas holiday. Walz also said he rejects the intent of the executive order and reserves the state’s right to challenge its requirements. Minnesota has the country’s largest Somali and Karen populations, the second-largest Hmong population and one of the largest Liberian populations – all made up of people who fled their war-torn homelands and their descendants. The city of Minneapolis also responded to Trump’s order Friday when its mayor and City Council approved a resolution affirming a pledge to be a welcoming city that strongly supports the resettlement of refugees.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A board working to build an arts pavilion is hoping to raise awareness for the plan by selling a princess – or at least a replica of one. The board of directors of the proposed Mississippi International Arts Pavilion in Vicksburg is selling reproductions of the Porcelain Princess, a statue featured in the Porcelain Room of the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, Spain. The limited number of statues is being sold for $2,000 each to raise money and awareness for the art pavilion, board member Kendra Reed told the Port City Kiwanis Club on Thursday, according to The Vicksburg Post. “Jackson has the catfish, Hattiesburg has swans, and Meridian has the carousel horse,” Reed said. “Our ambassador will be the Porcelain Princess. There are only 30 of them (available), and we’re going to have them placed around town so that people will see what we are trying to do and create conversation.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City officials have voted to ban local veterinarians from declawing cats, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The St. Louis Board of Aldermen voted 21-1 on Friday for an ordinance to end the practice. Declawing a cat involves slicing through bone to amputate the first segment of a cat’s toes. The operation was once commonly performed to protect furniture and human skin from feline scratching but has in recent years come under scrutiny by animal welfare advocates, cat owners and many vets. Democratic Alderwoman Christine Ingrassia has said the procedure can be painful. She said cat owners sometimes declaw cats to prevent them from scratching, but Ingrassia said there are alternatives to address those issues. The bill includes an exception for medically necessary procedures.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s health department will begin enforcing its emergency ban on the sale of flavored vaping products beginning Wednesday, state officials say. A temporary restraining order preventing the ban from taking effect expired Oct. 28, the Department of Public Health and Human Services says. The judge who heard arguments on a motion by vaping shop owners seeking a preliminary injunction to block the ban has not made a ruling six weeks after hearing arguments. The restrictions include the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products including flavored nicotine, THC and CBD e-cigarette products, both in store and online. The rules do not require businesses to destroy their inventory. The health department issued emergency rules Oct. 8, citing reports of lung injury and deaths by people who had used vaping products and concerns that the flavored products were enticing minors to become addicted to nicotine.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An $18 million homeless shelter, the largest in the state, opened last week with beds for as many as 450 people. The new Siena Francis House shelter was built on the site of a former salvage yard in north downtown Omaha. Officials say the new, 43,000-square-foot building will be better able to meet the community’s needs without having people sleeping on mattresses on the floor. The facility is also equipped with a commercial kitchen and larger space for people to gather while waiting for case management and other services. The Siena Francis House’s executive director, Linda Twomey, told the Omaha World-Herald the new facility that opened Thursday will allow the organization to provide a variety of services all in one location. The City of Omaha provided $2.5 million for demolition and cleanup of a salvage yard that had occupied the location. Private donations covered most of the rest of the cost.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Cluck Norris, a cowboy pigeon in a tiny orange hat, has been captured. Lofty Hopes, the Las Vegas pigeon rescue tracking a pair of hat-wearing birds for more than a week, found Cluck in a trap Monday near the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus. The fashionable bird’s counterpart, Coolamity Jane, is still on the lam more than a week after a video showing the pigeons strutting down the street in tiny hats went viral and captured the country’s attention. Intrigue surrounding the travels of Coolamity Jane and Cluck Norris made them social media sensations and even inspired a parody country song. The tiny cowboy hats appear to be glued on the pigeons, Lofty Hopes co-founder Mariah Hillman says. When the rescue first encountered Cluck Norris, there were feathers stuck to his tiny red hat. Who made a joke at the expense of the birds’ well-being remains a mystery.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: Organizers of an annual display of hand-crafted ice castle sculptures are looking for some help as they prepare for the upcoming season. The frozen attraction is located in six places across North America, including in North Woodstock. The castles include LED-lit sculptures, frozen thrones, ice-carved tunnels, slides and fountains. So far, the New Hampshire attraction is slated to open late December or early January, depending on the weather. Some jobs are advertised on its website. The winter wonderland is built from scratch when the cold conditions allow the ice to sprout from the barren ground.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: This car-packed state may be more bicycle-friendly than you think. A new report has named it the 12th-most bicycle-friendly state in the country. The 2019 report card from the League of American Bicyclists ranked the state between Pennsylvania and New York, mainly backed on the strength of its policies and planning. However, state officials need to convert those plans into action, says Ken McLeod, the league’s policy director. The league’s top recommendation is increasing its use of federal transportation funds for biking and walking projects. Over the past five fiscal years, New Jersey has the nation’s lowest use of federal funds on biking and walking per person, at 63 cents on average, records show. New Jersey’s outlay is roughly 5.5 times less per person than New York’s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Samples of a street photography project that is more than a half-century in the making are set to go on display in the city, and organizers want residents to visit and help find family members. The exhibit called “Let the Sunshine In” is scheduled to start Saturday at the Albuquerque Museum and will feature 100 images from the street photography project, KRQE-TV reports. In 1967, the museum hired street photographers to capture the city’s ongoing urban renewal, a mass exodus from downtown to the suburbs and a time of social change. The museum’s current Digital Archivist Jill Hartke narrowed down roughly 8,000 35-millimeter slides taken between 1967 and 1972 to best tell the Duke City’s story. No one featured in the exhibit has been identified because the photographers practiced authentic street photography.\n\nNew York\n\nLewis: An Adirondack mountain has been renamed in honor of Inez Milholland, a human rights activist known for leading a suffrage parade astride a white horse on the eve of President Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration in 1913. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Board on Geographic Names approved naming a peak in the town of Lewis Mount Inez, according to the National Women’s Law Center in Washington. The old name was Mount Discovery. Milholland died in 1916 at the age of 30 during a cross-country trip promoting national candidates supporting women’s voting rights. She was buried near her family home in Lewis, not far from the mountain now bearing her name. The town of Lewis renamed Mount Discovery as Mount Inez soon after her death, but a lack of follow-through at the federal level left the name unofficial.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s superintendent of public instruction is alleging that more than 70,000 third grade students have been wrongly promoted since 2014 even though they did not meet mandated reading requirements. News outlets report State Superintendent Mark Johnson in a memo criticized the State Board of Education and former staff members of the Department of Public Instruction for “aggressive work-arounds” that he claims have “gutted” a program meant to ensure students can read proficiently before advancing to fourth grade. Lawmakers approved the Read to Achieve program in 2012. Under the program, students are to be promoted based on their academic abilities, not their age. State Board Chairman Eric Davis denies Johnson’s allegations, saying that if the board had enacted policies that were not in accordance with the law, the General Assembly would have already taken action.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has sent a letter to President Donald Trump requesting a presidential disaster declaration after an October storm dumped heavy rain and snow on a large part of the state. The letter was sent to Trump on Friday through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Burgum’s office said preliminary assessments show the rainfall and blizzard caused up to $9.7 million in damage to public infrastructure. Burgum asked that the declaration cover the period from Oct. 9 through Oct. 26 and include 15 counties. If granted, a presidential disaster declaration would unlock FEMA public assistance to help cities, counties and townships pay for the costs of repairing roads and other infrastructure. North Dakota experienced weather extremes this year ranging from spring flooding to a severe summer drought to the wettest August-to-October period in 125 years of record keeping.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is expanding an online check-in program aimed at reducing the time people spend waiting in line at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Ohio officials say the “Get In Line, Online” program will expand statewide over the next six months to benefit customers waiting for services such as license renewal and vehicle registration. With the virtual queuing system, customers check in online, then arrive at their deputy registrar location within a four-hour window and claim their spot in line. A pilot project was launched in June in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hancock counties. Officials say it helped shave nearly 15 minutes off those customers’ average in-person wait times.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Two women have launched an initiative petition for a public vote on whether to legalize the use of marijuana in the state by adults 21 and older. A proposed ballot title was submitted for review last week with little fanfare by Oklahoma City residents Amy Young and Vanessa Avery. Once it’s been reviewed, supporters will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures to qualify the question for the ballot. If approved, it would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to allow for adult use of marijuana. The proposal also would impose a 15% tax on the sale of marijuana, in addition to state and local taxes. Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program launched last year and has been wildly successful, with more than 220,000 patient and 1,500 dispensary licenses issued so far.\n\nOregon\n\nAstoria: Fishing for fall chinook is now banned in multiple rivers on the state’s north coast because extremely dry conditions have fueled a widespread die-off of the species. After two months of low rainfall, hundreds of adult fish on multiple coastal streams are dying from an unusual outbreak of a naturally occurring parasite before they get a chance to spawn, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Extended periods of low water levels mean that salmon waiting to swim upstream to spawn are spending extra time in shallow water where conditions are more conducive to the cryptobia parasite, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said. The parasite doesn’t pose a risk to humans and only affects certain species of fish.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s top prosecutor said Monday that he has told state police to treat unassembled “ghost guns” as firearms under state law, meaning felons may not legally possess them. Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro issued a legal opinion to the Pennsylvania State Police that the gun frames, also known as “80% receivers,” qualify as firearms. The guns can be quickly assembled and lack serial numbers, so they cannot be traced. Purchases have not been subject to mandatory background checks. Shapiro’s opinion, in the form of a letter issued Monday to the state police commissioner, Col. Robert Evanchick, says the ghost guns are firearms if they are designed to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, or if they can be readily converted to do so.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: A post office will be renamed in honor of a 19th-century abolitionist and suffragist. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, R-D.I., said President Donald Trump signed a bill late last week to honor Elizabeth Buffum Chace by naming the Central Falls post office after her. Rhode Island’s congressional delegation introduced the bill, which passed both chambers. Chace dedicated her life to advocating for women’s rights and the abolition of slavery. She married Samuel Chace, and their home in Valley Falls, Rhode Island, became a way station for escaped slaves and abolitionist speakers in the 1850s, according to the Rhode Island Historical Society. They built their Central Falls home in 1858. Chace led the Rhode Island Women’s Suffrage Association from 1870 until her death in 1899.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A peaceful revolution 300 years ago in what would become South Carolina is getting its own exhibition at the state Department of Archives and History. The exhibit is called “ ‘To preserve us from utter ruine’: The Revolution of 1719” – named after one of the hundreds of thousands of critical and historic documents stored at the archives headquarters in north Columbia. The exhibit highlights the period when South Carolina transitioned under the rule of Great Britain from a proprietary colony run by a businessman or other leader to a royal colony with more involvement from the king. Organizers said the exhibit will link the 1719 revolution in what was then called Charles Town to the American Revolution in 1776 and South Carolina’s decision to leave the Union and help form the Confederacy in 1860. The free exhibit opens Wednesday and runs through September.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Higher gold prices are generating new interest in drilling in the state’s Black Hills. At least five companies are currently drilling for gold in the mountainous region, which extends from western South Dakota into Wyoming. After being under $1,400 per ounce for several years, the price for gold has climbed above that level in recent months. F3 Gold, of Minneapolis, is funding an environmental assessment it hopes will lead to the approval of its plan to drill on Black Hills Forest Service land near Silver City, about 15 miles west of the state’s second-largest city, Rapid City. Another factor driving exploration interest in the Black Hills is its well-known history as a gold-producing region, the Rapid City Journal reports. The former Homestake Mine near Lead became the largest and deepest gold mine in North America and generated 40 million ounces of gold during its 126-year life.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Two African penguins have been born at the city’s zoo, bringing the total number of the birds housed there to 20. The penguin chicks were born at the end of October, but they are not yet on exhibit because they are currently being hand-raised, Memphis Zoo officials said in a news release. Zookeepers should be able to determine the sex of the chicks in the next few weeks, the release said. The chicks’ mother is named Tulip, and the dad is named Cameron. The African black-footed penguin can be found in large colonies in southern Africa. They are one of 17 species of penguins found in the world and are considered the most endangered type of penguins, the zoo said. Forty-two penguin chicks have been hatched and reared at the Memphis zoo, officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: The remains of three people were found at the Alamo amid an archaeological exploration ahead of planned renovations at the site of one of the most famous battles in American history, state officials say. The remains of an infant, a teenager or young adult, and an adult were found during archaeological exploration in Alamo church’s monks burial room and nave, the Texas General Land Office said in a news release Friday. An on-site tribal monitor was notified, and excavation was halted in the area of the discovery, according to the office, which operates the Alamo. The announcement comes after the Tap Pilam Coahuiltecan Nation filed a federal lawsuit in September seeking to halt the $450 million makeover of the sacred shrine on track to be completed by 2024. The group wants a say in what happens to unearthed human remains because many of its citizens are descendants of people who lived near the site.\n\nUtah\n\nDraper: Inmates are learning to tell their stories through a speech club, bolstering communication skills that help them navigate life after release and teach others to avoid their mistakes. About 50 men are part of the New Visions Speech Club, which serves the Promontory state prison facility where inmates have demonstrated good behavior and want counseling and therapy, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The club uses a similar method as Toastmasters International, the public speaking club that teaches participants to express their points by telling a story. The techniques allow inmates to do things like ask a parole board for a release date. It can also help in job interviews as they work to rebuild their lives, says Frank Lewis, a prison volunteer who helped bring the speech club to the facility.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Sixty-nine public, private and independent schools across the state have been awarded $1.4 million in grants that will be used to complete 150 projects, Gov. Phil Scott’s office announced Monday. The Legislature approved the funds during the 2019 session to enable eligible schools to plan for and install equipment to enhance building security. Priority was given to exterior and interior door locking mechanisms and public address systems to ensure all those in and outside school buildings can be informed of an emergency. Other improvements include security cameras and window shading. “Supporting security improvements in our schools helps ensure all Vermont kids have the safest possible learning environment, and these funds fill gaps left by the first round of grants,” Scott said in a statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An effort is being made to honor unheralded black soldiers who fought in the Civil War. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports a group called the Honor the 14 Foundation is behind the push, which aims to memorialize 14 Medal of Honor recipients from a black regiment of the Union Army. Donald E. King, a senior partner at the McGuireWoods law firm and board member of the American Civil War Museum, initiated the push. King said the foundation plans to privately raise millions to erect the statue in Richmond. Black troops in the Union army defeated Confederate forces at the Battle of New Market Heights in 1864 after two previous attempts failed. Fourteen of the black soldiers who fought received the Medal of Honor.\n\nWashington\n\nFederal Way: Authorities are calling a Christmas tree thief a real-life Grinch after arresting a man they say stole dozens of evergreens from a family-owned farm. The Seattle Times reports that police in Federal Way made the arrest Friday after getting reports that about 78 trees had vanished from the Snowshoe Evergreen Christmas Tree Farm the previous weekend. The trees were valued at more than $6,000. Police say the suspect, whose name was not released, also stole a truck and cargo trailer and planned to sell the trees at a pop-up tree stand. He had chopped down the trees one by one and dragged them from the business.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice’s attorneys asked the state Supreme Court on Friday to dismiss a legal challenge seeking to force him to live in the capital, saying it’s a “nebulous” requirement that would entail “court-supervised monitoring” of the governor’s whereabouts. The Republican’s filing comes amid lawsuits by Democratic state Del. Isaac Sponaugle that have accused Justice of violating a passage of the state Constitution stating the governor “shall reside at the seat of government.” Justice is hoping that the state’s high court will rule in his favor amid a legal back-and-forth over the definition of the word “reside.” The billionaire has drawn criticism from Democratic and Republican members for being absent at the Capitol in Charleston amid litigation facing his expansive business holdings.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state recorded its wettest year ever in 2019 since record-keeping began in 1895, climatologists say. Climatologist Mike Timlin told Wisconsin Public Radio it’s been wet all year. Wisconsin received 41.75 inches of precipitation through last month. The amount of rain and snow so far this year broke the previous record of 40.09 inches set in 1938, according to Steve Vavrus, senior scientist with the Nelson Institute’s Center for Climatic Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “One of the remarkable things about this year is that it hasn’t just been one part of the state that’s been socked. It’s been everywhere,” Vavrus said. Four of Wisconsin’s top five wettest years have taken place in the last decade – three of them in the past five years (2019, 2018 and 2016).\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The park opened its gates Sunday to tourists riding snowcoaches and snowmobiles. Visitors may now travel the park’s interior roads on commercially guided snowmobiles and snowcoaches from the North, West and South Entrances. Visitors who have proper permits can also take snowmobile trips without a commercial guide. The East Entrance Road over Sylvan Pass will open for oversnow travel Dec. 22. During the winter season, Yellowstone also offers a variety of activities, such as ranger-led programs, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The National Park Service reminds winter visitors that weather in the park is extremely unpredictable, and road closures or delays can occur with little or no warning. People are reminded to have personal emergency survival equipment and appropriate outdoor gear for the cold weather. Lodging and services are limited during winter.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/20/dancing-street-dior-doug-pug-news-around-states/39499443/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Hundreds of demonstrators marched to the Capitol on Sunday to protest the state’s newly approved abortion ban – the most stringent in the nation, making performing an abortion a felony, with no exception even for rape or incest – chanting “my body, my choice!” and “vote them out!” Similar demonstrations were held in Birmingham and Huntsville on Sunday. Alabama is part of a wave of conservative states seeking to mount new legal challenges to Roe v. Wade. None of the laws has actually taken effect, and all are expected to be blocked by the courts as the legal challenges play out with an ultimate eye on the Supreme Court. Amanda Reyes, who runs Yellowhammer Fund, a nonprofit that provides funding to help low-income women obtain abortions, says donations have begun streaming in since the bill’s passage.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: Supporters of Storyknife Writers Retreat attended groundbreaking ceremonies this month for a main house and cabins that will house visiting female authors, the Homer News reports. Storyknife founder Dana Stabenow turned the first bit of earth at the property just north of Homer on May 4. Stabenow, the best-selling author of the Kate Shugak mystery series, spoke of being inspired to start a residency program just for women after attending the nation’s only other such facility, Hedgebrook on Whidbey Island, Washington. When Storybrook is finished, there will be six cabins and a main house, Eva, named after poet Eva Saulitis, where writers will congregate after a day’s work. The complex is expected to be ready by next spring, when the first group of writers attends. For more information on Storyknife, visit www.storyknife.org.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Diamondbacks have recruited their cutest, furriest player yet – Brenly, a 6-month-old golden retriever working to become a certified therapy dog and raise awareness of issues faced by abused, neglected and at-risk children, according to a statement from the baseball team. Brenly was named after sportscaster and former Diamondbacks manager Bob Brenly, says his trainer, Blake Blackman-Woody from Gabriel’s Angels, which provides pet therapy for at-risk children. The pup drew a crowd at the ballpark Sunday and proved cool and collected when swarmed by groups of children and fans at Chase Field’s Phoenix Children’s Hospital Sandlot. Brenly will be at the ballpark spreading love and comfort for six Sunday games this season to help prepare him for his certification test, says Debbie Castaldo, vice president of corporate and community impact for the Diamondbacks.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said he will hire an Indiana company to operate five state youth prisons, despite lawmakers’ concerns about the company’s operations in other states. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Arkansas Legislative Council voted 9-5 Friday against a contract with Youth Opportunity Investments LLC, but the governor has said he will override that vote. Lawmakers say Youth Opportunity has been issued more than a dozen written citations for poor performance in other states, and they criticize what they say was a cursory review of the company. Gov. Hutchinson says that he was “disappointed” with the lawmakers’ decision and that youth facilities are monitored closely to ensure children are cared for “properly and safely.” Youth Opportunity will begin operating facilities in Dermott, Harrisburg, Lewisville and Mansfield on July 1.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCorona: A new assessment by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers raises concern about the potential for failure of the spillway of a flood control dam on a Southern California river where 1.4 million people live downstream. The Corps says it has changed the risk characterization of Prado Dam from moderate urgency to high urgency. Prado Dam is located on the Santa Ana River in Corona, about 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The 96-mile river begins in the San Bernardino Mountains and runs through inland Southern California and Orange County to the ocean. It typically has little water flow except during winter, when storms can turn it into a raging torrent that historically caused serious floods. The dam, which otherwise is typically dry, was designed in the 1930s and constructed in 1941.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse is calling for an investigation to be reopened into allegations that the National Park Service tried to remove references to human-caused climate change from a University of Colorado researcher’s report. The Denver Post reported Sunday that the Colorado Democrat is urging the U.S. Department of the Interior’s inspector general to relaunch the probe that was closed when the park service ultimately published Maria Caffrey’s report, which examined projected sea level rise at coastal parks, without edits last year. Neguse says the incident raises questions about whether department researchers are “able to do their work free from political influence.” Caffrey declined comment, citing involvement in legal negotiations. The newspaper could not reach National Park Service and Department of Interior officials Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers are collecting clothing donations for veterans looking to join the workforce. Democratic state Rep. Dorinda Borer of West Haven and Sen. James Maroney of Milford, the co-chairs of the General Assembly’s Veteran Affairs Committee, have joined forces with other state lawmakers, the nonprofit Save-A-Suit organization and the Max Cares Foundation to hold the fourth annual Save-A-Suit Drive at the state Capitol in Hartford. The May 30 event will be held from 9 a.m. to about 5 p.m. Donations of gently used, dry-cleaned or new clothing will be accepted outside the state Capitol building, weather permitting. Organizers say they’re looking for men’s suits, blazers, pants, shirts, ties, sweaters, coats, belts, shoes and accessories. For women, they’re seeking suits, tops, pants, dresses, skirts, bags, shoes and scarves.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Cabot, a 533-pound white shark that recently appeared off the state’s coast, is likely among the early-bird crowd of sharks that will be heading north along the East Coast as southern waters begin to warm. Besides making local headlines, Cabot’s recent First State rest stop also marks some great news for big-fish fans who care about the health of the ocean, says Chris Fischer, founder and expedition leader of the OCEARCH research and education team, which he brought on an expedition in the Delaware Bay two years ago. “What we learned there is that the sharks are likely just kind of passing through,” he says. “It’s a fantastic sign for your bay if the sharks are coming by and pausing there. It means there’s abundant life, and you’re doing a good job managing resources.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metro will start running all Yellow Line trains to Greenbelt, Maryland, this Saturday, a month ahead of schedule, WUSA-TV reports. The change comes as the system begins a giant improvement project that will close six Yellow and Blue line stations south of Reagan National Airport. “By making this change now, we can better serve our customers impacted by the summer-long closures,” Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said in a release. Metro said a recent weekend simulation of what this summer will look like showed officials that extending all Yellow Line trains to Greenbelt would improve train spacing, reduce congestion and “maintain Metro’s commitment to operate normal service outside of the shutdown area.” The unprecedented three-month shutdown aims to fix crumbling outdoor station platforms that have been worn away by the elements.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A federal judge says 32 more counties in the state must provide election materials and ballots in Spanish. A recent order from U.S. District Judge Mark Walker expanded a temporary injunction that he granted ahead of last fall’s elections. Under Walker’s latest order, election supervisors in the 32 counties must provide ballots in Spanish by March 2020, when the presidential primary election is held. Fifteen counties already do so. Walker’s order would raise the total to almost four dozen of Florida’s 67 counties. If a county holds an election before then, elections supervisors must provide sample ballots in Spanish. The order also says election supervisors must have a bilingual hotline to assist Spanish-speaking voters during early voting, provide information in Spanish on their website and recruit bilingual poll workers.\n\nGeorgia\n\nEllijay: A north Georgia community has come up with a unique approach to emergency medicine. WABE Radio reports that Gilmer County residents were concerned about three years ago when the local hospital prepared to close, as not having a hospital can jeopardize the health of residents and can also scare off business owners who consider locating there. The CEO of Piedmont Mountainside Hospital about 20 miles away saw an opportunity in the local facility’s closing. By opening a free-standing emergency room in Gilmer County, officials could take pressure off Piedmont Mountainside’s ER and hold on to their 30-35% market share in Gilmer County. The emergency room opened about a year after the old hospital closed. WABE reports it’s among the first of its kind in the region.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Staff from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are settling into another temporary office in Hilo, their third move since the Kilauea volcano eruption forced the evacuation of their headquarters in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports Tina Neal, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory’s chief scientist, says the relocation should be complete by the end of the month and expects no glitches in the monitoring of active volcanos. The agency is awaiting congressional approval of a bill that would allocate disaster recover funds to construct new headquarters. Neal says Hawaii Island will remain its base, even if some staffers relocate to Oahu, which she says is being considered for additional technical capacity. The former headquarters on Kilauea was heavily damaged during numerous collapses and earthquakes last year.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: A former Idaho State University professor wants to solve a 1970s death mystery and is raising money to find additional clues. The Idaho Falls Post Register reports Amy Michael is raising money for DNA testing on cut-up human remains found in Buffalo Cave, also known as the Civil Defense Cave, in east Idaho near the Montana border. A family searching for arrowheads found a male torso in 1979. The arms and legs were found 12 years later. The head has not been located. Clark County Chief Deputy John Clements says cuts on the body parts indicate someone dismembered the man with a saw. Michael hopes new forensic DNA testing can help identify the dead man and says she needs $2,300 to perform the tests. She had raised $470 as of Wednesday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A wildlife biologist has taken prairie chickens from Kansas, which has a more robust population, and released them in Illinois in an effort to boost the population of the endangered birds. The Chicago Tribune reports that the birds once numbered in the millions across the Prairie State, but there are now just about 200 left. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published a pioneering scientific report last week on biodiversity that found that 1 million species, including the prairie chicken, remain imperiled. Illinois Department of Natural Resources wildlife biologist Bob Gillespie says a recent translocation project that captured prairie chickens from Kansas and freed them into the Prairie Ridge preserve has helped the birds stave off extinction.\n\nIndiana\n\nHuntertown: A conservation group says it planted 55,000 native hardwood saplings this spring on more than 100 acres of marginal farmland. ACRES Land Trust says the reforesting efforts at three of its nature preserves represent the most trees it’s planted in a single year. The organization credits planning, donors and volunteer support for its brisk tree-planting pace. The Journal Gazette reports that the group reforested 80 acres of the Walter H. and E. Marie Myers Nature Preserve near the northern Indiana community of Chili, 17 acres of the James P. Covell Nature Preserve near Auburn and 9 acres at the James M. & Patricia D. Barrett Nature Preserve near Huntertown. Since 2016, the nonprofit has reforested 165 acres by planting nearly 100,000 trees at six nature preserves.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An unmarked street curb has cost city taxpayers nearly $1.7million after cyclists involved in bike crashes there sued the city over their injuries. The city has settled two such cases and now faces a third. Des Moines installed the curb in March 2017 at the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway and Southwest 16th Street. It was part of an intersection redesign to direct pedestrians to a brick crosswalk across the road just south of downtown. In several lawsuits filed against the city, cyclists claimed they were injured after striking the unmarked curb while riding east on the trail. The 6-inch curb, which has since been removed, cut off what was previously a straight path for cyclists using the Martin Luther King Jr. Trail, forcing them to veer left to reach the ramp at the crosswalk.\n\nKansas\n\nGarden City: Hispanic residents make up more than half of the population in Ford, Finney and Seward counties, but there is only one Hispanic elected official in all three southwestern Kansas counties and their three largest cities. KCUR-FM reports that some groups want to recruit more Hispanic candidates so residents can choose leaders who truly represent them. Karem Gallo, president of the Liberal chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, says the group has been working to let Latino residents know they have support to seek public office. Garden City School Board member Tim Cruz says money and time remain the biggest hurdles, while Finney County Commissioner William Clifford points to the county Republican Party’s failure to recruit immigrant groups. Clifford, who chairs the party, says immigrants deserve representation.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has lashed out at protesting teachers and ridiculed judges during a tumultuous term steering the commonwealth on a conservative course. Now the pugnacious governor faces the first test of his re-election campaign in a race that could offer clues about the electorate’s mood heading into a presidential election year. Voters get to speak Tuesday in a state where the GOP has recently dominated but Democrats see an opportunity to win back the governorship. Three prominent Democrats, including the son of Bevin’s predecessor, are competing for the chance to challenge Bevin. The leading Democrats are Attorney General Andy Beshear, ex-state auditor Adam Edelen and longtime state Rep. Rocky Adkins. Beshear’s father served two terms as governor. Bevin has three Republican primary challengers, including state Rep. Robert Goforth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s debt load has declined for the first time in a decade, a notable benchmark as Louisiana tries to get a handle on its finances after years of budget gaps and record borrowing. But the amount Louisiana owes for every man, woman and child still outstrips the national average. An updated debt report presented to the State Bond Commission shows Louisiana’s per capita, tax-supported debt dipped to $1,497 in 2018. That’s down $61 per person from $1,558 a year earlier, as the state works to shrink its outstanding obligations for construction projects. It was the first drop in the debt load since 2008, after years of continued rises. Louisiana owes an amount per state resident that is lower than in 2014, when it hovered slightly above $1,500.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: With recreational marijuana legalization in sight, the state is looking to learn from mistakes its counterparts have made in legalizing the drug. The state’s proposed marijuana rules will be the subject of a public hearing in Portland on Thursday that officials expect will be well attended. It’s the latest step on the road to a legal framework that pot lovers and state officials say they hope will weed out problems such as oversupply and underage use that have cropped up elsewhere. Maine voters chose to legalize adult use marijuana in 2016, but the legal sales haven’t started because of trouble implementing laws as political squabbles slow the process. The state now has draft rules in hand that could govern subjects such as licensure and cultivation, and the Legislature must approve them.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Assateague Coastal Trust is bringing back its internationally recognized Swim Guide water quality monitoring program to monitor and report on the health of area waterways. Swim Guide is a smartphone app that enables users to find safe beaches and swimming areas to recreate and enjoy the waterways through a simple platform that relays local area water quality, according to a news release. The app is available at the Apple App Store, Google Play and Theswimguide.org. The program will run through Labor Day weekend. This year the organization is monitoring 10 locations throughout Herring and Turville Creek, Isle of Wight Bay, Assawoman Bay and the St. Martin River, according to a news release.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A letter written by Alexander Hamilton in 1780 to the Marquis de Lafayette that was stolen from the state archives decades ago has been found, and now an effort is underway to return it. The U.S. attorney’s office in Boston filed a forfeiture complaint in federal court last week asking a judge to order the Revolutionary War-era letter returned to its rightful owner. Hamilton’s letter was stolen by an archives employee sometime between 1937 and 1945, according to the government. “The theft, which also involved original papers of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere and Benedict Arnold, among others, was not discovered for several years,” the federal complaint says. Most of the other documents were recovered, but Hamilton’s letter remained missing. The letter to the French aristocrat who served as a general in the Continental Army appears to detail the movements of British forces.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Motown Museum has created a park that was unveiled Sunday in conjunction with a celebration of its founder, Esther Gordy Edwards. Thousands headed to Hitsville, U.S.A., to salute the homegrown music legacy. Dancing in the Street Park was officially inaugurated with a spirited “Dancing in the Street” by Martha Reeves in a rare public reunion with the original Vandellas, Rosalind Ashford-Holmes and Annette Beard. Young performers from the museum’s summer-camp programs stepped up for often-impressive renditions of Motown classics by Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson and the Temptations, as Reeves sat nearby keeping time with a handheld shaker. Mayor Mike Duggan was among those on hand for the opening of the cozy plaza next to the Hitsville building, located in the former home of Motown Records’ offices and studio. The lot had sat vacant since 1971, when the office-house there was destroyed in a fire.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Department of Health officials say the state needs more community paramedics to assist residents leaving the hospital in managing chronic health conditions at home. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that the state agency says there are 127 certified community paramedics, nearly half working in the Twin Cities. Regions Hospital in St. Paul has partnered with the city’s fire department and a health clinic on a three-year community paramedic program. The project made nearly 1,000 home visits to help people manage diabetes and high blood pressure. Nearly half of the program’s hypertension patients lowered their blood pressure to a healthy level, while almost 80% of diabetic patients reduced blood sugar levels. Aaron Burnett, who oversees the program, says patients are coming back to the hospital less and are more satisfied with their care.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The Tupelo/Lee County Hunger Coalition is gearing up for a summer nutrition program to help needy families. The group is extending its weekend backpack program that provides food for families of children who qualify for free and reduced-price school meals. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports that the coalition aims to feed up to 800 students this summer through its Break Box program. Coalition director Jason Martin says 20% of Lee County residents are considered to be food insecure. Summer food boxes are filled with shelf-stable items, including milk, juice, canned vegetables and fruit, and protein, like chicken and tuna. The boxes will also include meals that children can heat in a microwave, plus snack items. The coalition will distribute boxes monthly in June, July and August.\n\nMissouri\n\nEl Dorado Springs: Scientists are preparing to end a seven-year program that has reintroduced the first federally endangered species to the state because the beetles are showing signs they could survive on their own. The St. Louis Zoo has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Missouri Department of Conservation and the Nature Conservancy to restore American burying beetles in Missouri since 2012. The program has released more than 2,800 American burying beetles in the soil at Wah’Kon-Tah Prairie near El Dorado Springs. Merz tells the Joplin Globe that the program has seen “positive trends that indicate it is time to see how the beetles are doing on their own.” Merz says scientists will continue to monitor the species, but the beetles will have to find their own food sources.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest has grown with the acquisition of about 620 acres. The Independent Record reports that the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation has transferred ownership of the Green Mountain National Trails property to the U.S. Forest Service, opening the land to the public. Foundation chief conservation officer Blake Henning says the land about 35 miles east of Lincoln is within the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail corridor and the Continental Divide Grizzly Bear Recovery Area. The land also contains part of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. The foundation says the trail was rerouted out of the private property to public lands several years ago, but the trail will now be restored to its historic route.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Ten artistic additions to the city have been installed as the inaugural Norfolk Sculpture Walk officially began this month. The 10 sculptures that will be featured this year include lifelike bronze statues, steel creations up to 7 feet high and intricate works of stone. Traci Jeffrey, director of the Norfolk Area Visitors Bureau, told the Norfolk Daily News there’s something everyone will enjoy. Those partaking in the sculpture walk are encouraged to vote for a favorite online. The winner will be announced at the Riverpoint Arts Festival in September. Each sculpture is also for sale. The Norfolk Sculpture Walk was inspired by other such walks around the region and brought to the city by a committee of area residents, artists and the Norfolk Area Visitors Bureau in partnership with the City of Norfolk, the Norfolk Area Chamber of Commerce, the Norfolk Arts Center and numerous sponsors.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has approved $75,000 for a contractor to assess hazards and clean up waste at a site north of the city that’s polluted with ammunition casings left by target shooters. Kurt Miers, an environmental protection specialist for the agency, says the piles of casings have contaminated the soil with lead. He says the contamination is as much as four times what’s considered the maximum allowable level for lead in residential areas. The site near Chimney Road at the north end of Sun Valley is near hundreds of homes and a middle school under construction. Target shooting is allowed on most public lands but illegal within 5,000 feet of homes.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: An analysis says the Hobo & Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad in the state accounts for more than $17.4 million in total economic impact annually. The report released by Stone Consulting of Warren, Pennsylvania, says that amount affects nearly 380 full- and part-time jobs in the restaurant, hospitality and retail sectors. The railroad operates excursions from Lincoln, Meredith and Weirs Beach. The report says last year, 61% of its passengers traveled from outside New Hampshire, resulting in $8.8 million in additional spending while visiting. In 2018, the railroad welcomed more than 260 bus tours, which accounted for nearly 12,000 additional guests to the region, and more than 50% stayed overnight after traveling on the railroad.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Oprah Winfrey announced she’s giving $500,000 to an initiative at a high school that’s aimed at keeping kids off the streets. Principal Akbar Cook’s “Lights On” program keeps West Side High School in Newark open on Friday nights from 6 p.m. to midnight. WPVI-TV reports kids can play basketball, shoot pool, play video games or even use a recording studio. Winfrey’s gift will help the program operate three nights a week over the summer. She told hundreds of cheering students Friday during a surprise visit that she was inspired by “all of the great things that are happening here.” Cook also garnered headlines last fall for installing washing machines so students who couldn’t afford to wash their clothes wouldn’t miss school because they were being bullied for wearing dirty clothes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHobbs: Two counties in the state remain among the top oil-producing counties in the U.S., according to new federal numbers. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that Lea County was the No. 2 oil-producing county in January, behind North Dakota’s McKenzie County, The Hobbs News-Sun reports. Lea County produced 14.6 million barrels of oil in January, the report says. Meanwhile, New Mexico’s Eddy County was listed as the No. 6 top oil-producing county. It produced 10 million barrels during the same month. In November, a group of major oil and gas companies with plays in the Permian Basin announced the formation of an energy alliance, collectively committing more than $100 million over the next several years to spur additional private-sector investment in the region.\n\nNew York\n\nSouthampton: The U.S. Coast Guard says work is underway to extract oil from a British tanker sunk by a German U-boat off Long Island during World War II. The Coast Guard says in a news release that a team has been at the site of the tanker, named Coimbra, since April 29 and has pumped more than 62,000 gallons of oil from its tanks since May 11. Initial dive operations found the tanker was leaking small amounts of oil. The Coimbra was torpedoed in January 1942, killing 36 officers and crew members about 30 miles off Long Island’s south shore. It’s now about 180 feet deep. German U-boats sank 148 petroleum tankers and countless other ships near the U.S. Gulf and East coasts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: Long-awaited passenger-only ferry service between two popular Outer Banks destinations is finally sailing. The Department of Transportation says runs between Hatteras and Ocracoke villages began Monday with two free preview days. It costs $1 per person starting Wednesday. Currently space will be first-come, first-serve. State ferries already transport people and their vehicles for free between the southern end of Hatteras Island and northern tip of Ocracoke Island. Motorists then drive 12 miles to reach Ocracoke Village. The passenger-only ferry will run three times daily through Sept. 5. There’s no extra charge for bicycles. Passenger-only service was supposed to begin last year but got delayed by boat construction issues.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state is once again tops in the nation in the production of honey. The Agriculture Department says producers with five or more colonies totaled 38.2 million pounds of honey in 2018, up 13% from the previous year. That led the nation for the 15th consecutive year. The number of honey-producing colonies in North Dakota was up 16% to 530,000. Average yield was down 2 pounds, to 72 pounds per colony. The total value of honey produced in the state was up 12%, to $71.7 million. Nationally, honey production was up 2%, to 152 million pounds. Montana produced the second-most honey, followed by California, South Dakota and Florida.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is expanding its Eastern black rhino exhibit to more than twice its current size to accommodate its herd of five rhinos. A zoo release says the $1.5 million expansion will be paid for by the Cleveland Zoological Society and Cleveland Metroparks. It also will include an expanded viewing deck for guests. Other renovations will add an indoor rhino barn, a wallowing pool, and shading and misting areas to cool the rhinos. Zoo Executive Director Chris Kuhar says expansion of the exhibit in the zoo’s African Savanna area will allow staff to better care for the herd. He says the Eastern black rhino is one of the world’s most endangered species. Construction will begin this fall and is expected to finish in the spring of 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials monitoring the state’s Department of Human Services have said the agency’s child-welfare system has had its best performance to date but have also warned it needs to increase the number of foster homes for children who require therapeutic care. The Tulsa World reports that the biannual assessment released Friday says the department made “good faith efforts” in 29 of the 31 criteria measuring child welfare. The oversight panel also says the department has seen a 77% decline in specialized foster homes for children in state custody who need therapeutic care. The reports are issued twice a year by monitors as part of a 2012 settlement that alleged foster children were victimized in state care.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A multifaceted gun control bill pushed by Democrats in the Legislature may be dead this session, but advocates and opponents alike are confident it will return. Senate Bill 978 was a casualty of the deal that got Senate Republicans to end their four-day walkout and return to the Capitol, allowing Democrats to pass a multibillion-dollar education revenue bill May 13. The move to include SB978 in the trade disappointed gun control advocates inside and outside the Capitol. The measure would have required safe gun storage; placed liability on gun owners if a gun is stolen, but not reported, and used to injure a person or property; outlawed untraceable and undetectable firearms; granted local authorities the power to regulate firearm access in public buildings; and allowed retailers to set higher minimum purchasing age restrictions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: The state has the nation’s highest debt among its recent college graduates, according to Peterson’s financial aid survey, an annual voluntary survey of four-year colleges and universities. The survey uncovered that the average loan debt is $36,193 for a 2017 graduate of a Pennsylvania school, compared to the national average of $28,288. Michael Brown, a data analyst for LendEDU, studied the numbers and found that schools in the Northeast consistently ranked among the highest in the nation for debt per student. “I think, just in general, the cost of living in this part of the country is just more expensive than it is in other parts of the country,” Brown said. Loans may cover everything the student can’t afford to pay, including tuition, housing, food and transportation costs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRichmond: The state has created breeding wetlands to support the endangered Eastern spadefoot toad. The Westerly Sun reports that the state Department of Environmental Management, the University of Rhode Island and several conservancy organizations have teamed up for “Operation Spadefoot RI” in Richmond. The project aims to build new breeding grounds in areas where the toads are already known to be. Eastern spadefoot toad populations have declined dramatically in the state in recent decades. The toads require specialized wetlands that are vulnerable to disturbance, and much of their habitat has been lost or degraded because of human development. The new wetlands are located on land protected jointly by the Richmond Rural Preservation Land Trust and The Nature Conservancy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: It has been a historic year in the Legislature. This is the first time in the state’s history that nine African American women have served simultaneously in the House of Representatives, a monumental moment shared among a sisterhood of women who say their primary mission is to serve. The African American women serving in the House are Reps. Wendy Brawley of Hopkins, Gilda Cobb-Hunter of Orangeburg, Chandra Dillard of Greenville, Rosalyn D. Henderson-Myers of Spartanburg, Patricia Henegan of Bennettsville, Annie E. McDaniel of Winnsboro, J. Anne Parks of Greenwood, Leola Robinson Simpson of Greenville and Krystle Simmons of Ladson. And whether it is their first year or their 28th year in the Legislature, the lawmakers say they are passionate about their service and the difference they can make.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Bronze statues of Presidents George W. Bush and Harry S. Truman have been returned to their spots in downtown Rapid City – and local leaders have picked a spot for the 44th president. The statue of Barack Obama will join 43 other presidents who stand at street corners throughout downtown. Obama’s likeness will be unveiled in a ceremony July 13. The City of Presidents tourist attraction project began in 2000 to honor the legacy of the American presidency. The Rapid City Tribune says the Truman and Bush statues were damaged when they were hit by vehicles. They sustained some dents and scratches and required a new bronze finish from Spearfish sculptor James Michael Maher.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Local canine celebrity Doug the Pug had a big day Monday, as Mayor David Briley has declared May20 “Doug the Pug Day.” Briley designated the date for the local holiday because it’s the birthday of Music City’s furry friend. Monday was also National Rescue Dog Day, which seeks to bring attention to the benefits of adopting a four-legged friend. Doug’s owner, Leslie Mosier, encouraged all of the pug’s fans to engage in “chillin’ hard” and eating “lots of pizza” during the holiday. Doug currently has 2.8 million followers on Twitter and 3.8 million on Instagram, plus more than 6 million likes on Facebook.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The more than 70 years of fashion created by the famed House of Dior will be examined in an exhibit in the city that features almost 200 dresses. “Dior: From Paris to the World” opened Sunday at the Dallas Museum of Art. The exhibit profiles the Parisian fashion house’s founder, Christian Dior, along with subsequent artistic directors, who include Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano. The show also explores Dallas’ link to the fashion house’s history: Christian Dior visited the city in 1947 to receive luxury retailer Neiman Marcus’ award for distinguished service in fashion. That was the same year Dior presented his first collection, which became known as the New Look. The exhibit was previously at the Denver Art Museum. Dallas is its only other U.S. stop.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Students interested in science and technology will soon be able to attend class in an old military plane. The Standard-Examiner reports a Vietnam-era cargo plane has been converted into a classroom for science, technology, engineering and math students and attached to a museum at the Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City. Crews renovated a plane that had been stored at The Hill Aerospace Museum and Aerospace Heritage Foundation of Utah for decades and connected it to the building. The classroom was dedicated in a May 14 ceremony. Museum education instructor Mark Standing told The Standard-Examiner that the classroom will be used for aerospace lessons, science experiments, competitions and other activities.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A high school prankster who damaged school property is finally paying the price – and then some – just in time for his 25th reunion. As a Montpelier High School senior, Michael Burzycki painted and stitched together tarps to create a 60-by-16-foot banner that read “LIVE LONG AND PROSPER CLASS OF 1994.” He and a classmate lugged it up to the school’s roof and triumphantly hung it up outside the auditorium. But water bottles they used to weigh down the corners ended up breaking a window. Principal Peter Clarke didn’t punish him. Instead he handed him a bill for $1,994, due at Burzycki’s 25th reunion. Burzycki told WPTZ-TV that he has the money but wanted to do more, so he started a GoFundMe page for the school that has raised more than $5,000.\n\nVirginia\n\nMelfa: The president of a foundation seeking to establish a four-year university on the state’s Eastern Shore has asked officials to consider committing land at the county industrial park in Melfa to the project. A four-year university could grow to about 2,000 students and result in 1,000 jobs and up to $100 million per year in cash flow, according to the foundation. Terry Malarkey, president of the University of the Eastern Shore of Virginia Foundation, told the Accomack County Board of Supervisors the group wants to recruit “a high-quality” science, technology, engineering, mathematics and health university to set up a branch on the shore. He said if Virginia were considered and ranked as two separate education entities – the Rural Horseshoe and the urban corridor – “rural Virginia comes in 50th in the United States,” while the urban section ranks second, behind only Massachusetts. Combined, Virginia ranks sixth.\n\nWashington\n\nVashon Island: This idyllic island near Seattle known for its counterculture lifestyle and low immunization rates is seeing an increase in the number of children vaccinated for measles and other diseases. Advocates attribute the rising vaccination numbers on Vashon Island to increasingly visible pro-vaccine information, expanded access to shots, and media coverage of measles outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and New York this year. Public health officials say the number of fully immunized kindergartners in the Vashon Island School District jumped by 31% in the past six years, from 56% to nearly 74% in the 2017-18 school year. While the gains are notable, the district still has some of the lowest vaccine rates in the U.S. It’s far below the 95% target needed for herd immunity that a majority of schools across the country hit.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State lawmakers have reconvened for their special session but are pushing back debate on education measures that caused a two-day teacher strike earlier this year. The House of Delegates and the Senate met Monday to take up bills that were vetoed for technical reasons. Legislators were supposed to focus on education this week, but Republican Senate President Mitch Carmichael says the GOP is still working on its proposals. Republicans are expected to push for charter schools and school vouchers, which drew strong opposition from teachers and led to a strike. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have debuted eight education bills that include measures to raise teachers’ pay and put mental health professionals in schools. The extra session comes after lawmakers failed to compromise on education when the regular session ended in March.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An industry expert says the impending bankruptcy of a major frac sand mining company signals the financial woes that could cripple more mines based in the state due to a nationwide oversupply of sand. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that Emerge Energy Services entered into a debt restructuring deal with its lenders last month. The company owns Superior Silica Sands. CEO Rick Shearer says restructuring negotiations are ongoing. The company may file for bankruptcy if a settlement isn’t struck out of court. An energy consulting director at analytics firm IHS Markit says up to 75% of Wisconsin mines that supply oil and gas producers might have to close. Samir Nangia says the oversupply is due to companies building more mines near oil fields in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Hot Springs: Yellowstone National Park is proposing to add more housing for seasonal workers employed by private companies operating inside the park. Park administrators are taking public comment on plans to construct six modular houses and up to 14 RV sites at the Canyon Campground and up to 25 RV sites and a bathhouse near the park’s west entrance. The projects would be paid for by two park concessionaires – Delaware North Corporation and Xanterra. More than 3,000 people work for Yellowstone concessionaires during the peak summer tourist season. A study of the proposals says they would have minimal negative effects on the environment and visitor experiences. Park officials are taking comment on the housing projects through June 14.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/19/state-fair-upheaval-sewage-testing-new-mask-rules-news-around-states/111985738/", "title": "State fair upheaval, sewage testing: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Mayor Steven Reed issued an executive order to mandate masks in Montgomery, bypassing a tied City Council vote that failed to do the same less than 24 hours prior. Reed announced the order in a news conference at City Hall on Wednesday afternoon. It goes into effect at 5 p.m. Friday and is intended to be temporary until the next council meeting for members to consider another ordinance, Reed said. “We felt the city should have taken official action last night,” Reed said of the council’s deadlocked vote on mandatory mask wearing. “As you know, we’ve been encouraging our community to wear masks. Most of our community has done just that. However, not enough members of the community have done those things, and so we start to go from an encouragement to an enforcement phase.” The order comes with a $25 penalty for not wearing a mask, which can be a simple cloth covering, according to the written order.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The first nationally distributed children’s series to feature an Alaska Native as the lead character has been awarded a prestigious Peabody Award. KTVA-TV reports PBS program “Molly of Denali” won the award in the children’s and youth division. The show focuses on the cartoon character Molly Mabray, an Alaska Native of Gwichin, Koyukon, Dena’ina and Athabascan heritage. The program, which first aired in the summer of 2019, depicts the 10-year-old helping her parents run the Denali Trading Post while promoting Alaska Native values and literacy. There were 60 nominees chosen this year for the Peabody Awards from nearly 1,300 entries spanning radio and podcasts, digital platforms and television. The shows covered a broad range of issues from the criminal justice system to the #MeToo movement and immigrant rights.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Mayors are free to make wearing face masks mandatory to slow the spread of coronavirus, Gov. Doug Ducey said Wednesday, a turnabout amid pressure as the state became a national virus hot spot. The Republican governor, who entered his weekly virus news conference for the first time wearing a face mask but took it off to speak, said allowing cities to decide would work better than a statewide mandate. The governor had as recently as last week resisted allowing cities to do more than the state allows to slow the virus’s spread, saying statewide directives avoid a patchwork of regulations. But he pointed to vastly different county rates of COVID-19 cases and alluded to pushback that some more conservative counties may have to a mandate. Mayors in Phoenix, Tucson and Flagstaff said they would move quickly to require masks.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s attorney general has sued TV pastor Jim Bakker over his promotion of a product falsely touted as a cure for the illness caused by the coronavirus. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge filed the lawsuit in Arkansas against Missouri-based Bakker and Morningside Church Productions, less than three months after the state of Missouri filed a similar lawsuit. Rutledge’s lawsuit says 385 Arkansans made purchases from Bakker’s company totaling approximately $60,524 for colloidal silver, a product often sold on the internet as a dietary supplement. “Jim Bakker has exploited Arkansas consumers by leveraging COVID-19 fears to sell over $60,000 worth of their products that do nothing to fight the virus,” Rutledge said in a statement. The Republican attorney general added that her case was about consumer fraud, not freedom of religion.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: An appellate judge on Wednesday stayed a lower court’s order barring Gov. Gavin Newsom from issuing directives that might conflict with state law, freeing him to take additional executive actions during the coronavirus pandemic. Sutter County Superior Court Judge Perry Parker on Friday temporarily blocked Newsom’s executive order requiring in-person balloting stations even as every registered voter is mailed a ballot for the November election. The judge also sided with two Republican lawmakers by more broadly requiring Newsom to refrain from new orders that might be interpreted as infringing on the Legislature’s responsibilities. The lawmakers argued that Newsom, a Democrat, has overstepped his authority with dozens of orders preempting state law since the pandemic began. Other state and federal judges have repeatedly blocked previous challenges to the governor’s emergency orders during the pandemic.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Citing public health and safety as the foremost priority, Colorado State Fair General Manager Scott Stoller, with unanimous support from the fair’s board of authority, is moving forward with a “reimagined” 2020 expo. In light of current local, state and national health directives and guidelines that limit the number of people who can gather in one place at one time, a traditional Colorado State Fair would, with tens of thousands of visitors per day, be a high-risk event. As such, the board of authority on Tuesday supported Stoller’s recommendation to cancel all entertainment events in the Southwest Motors Events Center and grandstand arena and on the grounds. The annual fair is held at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo. All entrance fees would be waived in the modified fair scenario.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A steady stream of customers lined up for barbecue at lunchtime Wednesday at Bear’s Smokehouse in Hartford and for the first time in three months were allowed to take a seat inside, under the second phase of the state’s reopening amid declining coronavirus numbers. Connecticut on Wednesday also allowed the reopening of gyms, spas, movie theaters, hotels and other businesses, under strict social distancing and health protocols. Phase 2 of the economic restart, which was expected to reopen 95% of the economy, came three days earlier than originally scheduled amid a steep drop in both COVID-19 hospitalizations and positive virus test rates. A third reopening phase is expected sometime next month. Officials plan to increase the limit on indoor gatherings to 50 people; increase the limit on outdoor gatherings to 250; allow amphitheaters, race tracks and other outdoor venues to reopen at 50% capacity; and allow fireworks shows, municipal park concerts and other outdoor gatherings with 15 feet of space between blankets.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: This week brought yet another change for restaurants in the state. In the second phase of economic reopening that began Monday, restaurants can seat customers up to 60% of fire code capacity. The first phase allowed 30% capacity. Gina Monteleone, owner of Wolfie’s Bar and Grille, said the change will bring back all of her tables and half the bar seats. She said she is eager to see more of her customers again. “We just look forward to getting back to it and seeing all our favorite people,” she said. “We’ve really built a big, giant family, and I can’t wait to have all of them back.” While Monteleone said she thinks people are still nervous to dine out, one thing has helped: outdoor seating. Gov. John Carney announced in mid-May that restaurants could apply to their municipal or county government to temporarily expand outdoor seating. Four restaurants in Dover applied to the planning office, and all were approved in about 48 hours.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A water utility company in the D.C. area is urging customers to stop flushing disinfectant wipes down the toilet. WSSC Water said it has seen a tremendous increase of wipes at its pumping stations since the coronavirus pandemic started, WUSA-TV reports. WSSC Water reported seeing a 17-ton increase in wipes coming into water treatment facilities during March and April this year compared to the same time in 2019. The utility company has spent millions of dollars over the past decade installing grinder pumps to deal with the problem. However, workers have to shut down the pumps, manually unclog them and haul the garbage to a landfill when things get too bad. In the past couple of months, workers have also seen personal protective equipment, such as gloves and masks, coming into the water treatment facilities.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: In parts of the state, people under age 35 are testing positive for the coronavirus at a higher rate since the pandemic began, contributing to a recent surge in the number of cases, officials said Wednesday. Because of this, some mayors are considering tightening restrictions on places where younger folks gather – namely, bars and restaurants. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced Wednesday that due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, there will be increased enforcement to shut down businesses not following rules put in place to safely reopen during the pandemic. St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman said Wednesday that all employees who have contact with the public will be required to wear masks – something some South Florida cities hard-hit by the virus have been doing for weeks. He’s also crafting a second ordinance that would require residents to wear masks when inside businesses or other public spaces. He was critical of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has “encouraged” people to use masks and not “mandated” them.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The governor and the state school superintendent plan to ask for federal permission to suspend all state standardized testing in public schools for a second year. Gov. Brian Kemp and State Superintendent Richard Woods said in a joint statement Thursday that the tests would be “counterproductive” given disruptions to the upcoming 2020-2021 school year from COVID-19. They also said they would rather the state spend the money it would pay for tests on helping students in other ways. “In anticipation of a return to in-person instruction this fall, we believe schools’ focus should be on remediation, growth, and the safety of students,” the two elected Republicans said. “Every dollar spent on high-stakes testing would be a dollar taken away from the classroom.” Georgia and most other states nationwide canceled standardized testing this spring after in-person classes were suspended in March.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Hawaii County’s mayor has issued new guidance enabling short-term vacation rentals to begin operating again following a forced closure resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, but he said the rule applies only to renters not subject to mandatory 14-day quarantines. Mayor Harry Kim announced the rentals could reopen for business Friday but then issued the quarantine clarification Tuesday, West Hawaii Today reports. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued the emergency proclamation in March requiring 14-day quarantines for all travelers arriving in Hawaii from outside the state. Ige last week extended the order to July 31. “If you don’t have a residence here, you need to quarantine in a hotel,” Kim said. Kim’s office said the state Department of the Attorney General issued guidance saying mayors can allow the opening of short-term rentals, but they are not permitted as quarantine locations.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A company wants to build and operate a compact fast nuclear reactor in the state. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday that it has accepted a license application submitted by California-based Oklo Inc. to build a 1.5-megawatt reactor at the U.S. Department of Energy’s nuclear site in eastern Idaho that includes the Idaho National Laboratory. However, the commission said in a June 5 letter to the company that it would need more information on key safety and design aspects on the “first-of-a-kind submission” before beginning an overall review of the project. The timeline for that process is not clear. The Energy Department in recent years has been eyeing fast reactor designs that backers say have the potential to use spent nuclear fuel produced by conventional nuclear power plants.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Illinoisans struggling to pay mortgages or rent and small businesses, all impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, will have access to $900 million in grants, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Wednesday. According to state officials, $150 million of the funds, to be administered by the Illinois Housing Development Authority, will be available for emergency rental assistance, with the same amount for mortgage assistance, beginning in August. Pritzker also announced a residential eviction ban will be extended to July 31. He first banned evictions when he issued a stay-at-home order March 21. Pritzker said nearly 1 in 3 Illinois adults either missed last month’s rent or mortgage payment or is worried about their ability to pay next month’s rent.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state reported an additional 584 cases of coronavirus Thursday, all but six of which were confirmed Wednesday, and an additional 15 deaths. These new numbers put the total deaths at 2,304 and the total of positive cases at 41,438. The state also reported a new high of 10,701 test results reported, thanks in part to the addition of a lab to the state’s electronic reporting system. This tally included 2,936 negative tests, some of which date back to March. With the addition of these negative tests, the total number of tests performed for the state reached 384,722, just under 11% of which have been positive. Elkhart County once more had about twice as many new cases as Marion County, with 122 compared to 59. Marion’s case count still far outstrips that of any other county in the state at 10,852.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: More than 9,500 people in the state filed unemployment claims last week, and the number of continuing claims still tops 150,000, a state agency reported Thursday. Iowa Workforce Development said there were 9,516 claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending June 13. That’s a little higher than last week, but the number of continuing claims was down by about 3,500. The highest number of new claims came from workers employed in manufacturing. The numbers of unemployment claims in Iowa and across the country have soared since March, when officials ordered businesses to close or limit their operations in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Most of those restrictions have been eased in recent weeks even as a significant number of virus cases are reported.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Topeka Rescue Mission has teamed up with city government and local businesses, churches, organizations and volunteers to create Operation Food Secure, a program to fight hunger, City Manager Brent Trout announced at Tuesday evening’s City Council meeting. The rescue mission is working to secure funding that will enable it to hold regular food distribution events in this community, with help from the city’s neighborhood improvement associations, Trout said. Barry Feaker, executive director of the rescue mission, talked about Operation Food Secure during an audio program posted Tuesday on the mission’s Facebook page. He said economic problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have left an increasing number of people vulnerable to hunger. Feaker said Operation Food Secure will seek in particular to get food to people who can’t get out to acquire it for themselves.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Researchers from the University of Louisville are teaming up with the Louisville/Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District to find out if the key to tracking the spread of COVID-19 could be in the city’s sewage. MSD is providing samples from eight sites in its vast network of pipes and five treatment facilities for study at U of L, according to a news release from the university. U of L researchers will analyze the wastewater for evidence of the coronavirus, in collaboration with researchers from Arizona State University, the release said. ASU will use RT-PCR tests, a technique for detecting genetic material of the virus, to count copies of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in the wastewater and sewage sludge samples. The researchers believe the presence of this RNA sequence is an indicator of the level of infection with the virus in a given community. The research is part of the Co-Immunity Project to track and curb the spread of COVID-19.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The health department didn’t provide a daily update on the state’s coronavirus data Thursday, saying it was “reviewing all data” on the outbreak. No further information was immediately provided from the Department of Health about the interruption in releasing daily information about deaths from COVID-19 and the number of people who have tested positive for the disease. The disruption comes as case numbers have shown spikes as Louisiana reopens more businesses and loosens its restrictions on activities. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, has said too many people are ignoring public health officials’ continued calls for precautions, refusing to wear masks and to keep their distance from others.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is reconsidering its plan to allow bars to open for indoor service July 1 because of recent COVID-19 outbreaks tied to bar patrons in other states. Outbreaks involving dozens of customers and employees at bars in Jacksonville, Florida, and Boise, Idaho, show how easily the new coronavirus can spread, said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control. Tight quarters and loud talking or singing raise the risk of spreading the virus, he said. “When we think about COVID-19, the duration and density of exposure, bars raise significant health concerns on both fronts,” Shah said. “This constellation of factors is prompting us in Maine as well as health authorities in a number of other states, including Massachusetts and Vermont, to re-evaluate our timeline for when bars can safely reopen.” Bars, breweries and tasting rooms are currently allowed to open for outdoor seating only. Restaurants are allowed to open for indoor seating.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Nearly 42,000 people filed for new unemployment claims last week, the state’s labor department reported Thursday. Last week’s 41,941 filings were down from 53,464 the week before. The latest number of filings came a day after protesters rallied in front of the labor department in Baltimore to call for a better state response to requests for claims. Residents have endured difficulties navigating a state website and reaching people for help. More than 800,000 people have filed for jobless benefits in the state since March 14. Meanwhile, the state reported 260 cases of the coronavirus for Wednesday, the lowest since March 31. The number of intensive care cases also is reportedly the lowest since April 5 at 269. The statewide percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 has dropped to 5.43%. The state health department urged county leaders to increase testing efforts to meet the goal of testing 10% of their populations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nOxford: This central Massachusetts town has cut off power and water to a gym that defied government orders and reopened amid the coronavirus pandemic. Mark Reich, a lawyer for the town of Oxford, told WBZ-TV on Thursday that “domestic water and electricity service have been discontinued” at Prime Fitness & Nutrition. A judge this week ordered the town to shut down the facility, which opened last month even though gyms are supposed to remain shuttered until Phase 3, which could begin June 29 at the earliest. The gym’s owner, Dave Blondin, told WBZ on Wednesday that he “will continue to fight if this goes on two years, then so be it.” “Mr. Blondin is flouting the law and making no effort to respect public health and safety guidelines,” Reich told The Boston Globe on Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Legislature on Wednesday unanimously approved spending $880 million in federal relief aid in response to the coronavirus pandemic, setting aside funding for front-line workers, municipalities and child care providers. The bill would allocate more than a quarter of the $3 billion that was sent to the state government by Congress and President Donald Trump. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose administration was involved in negotiations, said she will sign it. About $2.1 billion would remain unspent as the governor and lawmakers from both parties in the Republican-led Legislature seek federal flexibility to use rescue funds to fill multibillion-dollar revenue shortfalls this fiscal year and next, not just cover additional COVID-19-related expenses. Democrats want Congress to approve additional funding for states, too.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health and education officials on Thursday asked school administrators to plan for three scenarios on reopening in the fall, and they promised a decision by the week of July 27 on which of the three will be used. K-12 schools will be restarting under the cloud of the coronavirus. The state Health and Education departments asked administrators to prepare for in-person learning for all students; hybrid learning with social distancing and capacity limits; and distance learning only. “Decisions around the fall may change as we learn more about which scenario will be in the best interest of public health, and specifically the health and safety of our school communities,” the Department of Health said in a statement. Republicans quickly criticized the state for waiting until late July to make a decision.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state reported one of its largest single-day increases in cases of the new coronavirus Wednesday, more than two weeks after Republican Gov. Tate Reeves lifted most of the restrictions he had put on businesses because of the pandemic. “I’m concerned that people are losing interest in the effort to keep each other safe,” Reeves said Wednesday on Twitter. “We are all tired and ready to be done, but the virus doesn’t care. Please be on your guard – small efforts have a big impact!” The governor has asked people to wear masks in public, but he has not required it in most places. The state Health Department said Wednesday that Mississippi has had at least 20,641 cases and 938 deaths from the coronavirus as of Tuesday evening. Reeves called the increase of 489 cases a day prior “a large number by any measure.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson has reopened Missouri, but some state buildings will remain closed to the public to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Parson said in a Twitter post Tuesday that Missouri moved into “phase 2” of his recovery plan after the state’s social distancing order expired Monday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The Governor’s Mansion and the state Capitol were still not allowing tours. The Governor Office Building, which houses some state offices, was closed to the public Tuesday, according to signs posted at the building’s entrances. “We continue to be hopeful for the future,” Parson said at a Tuesday news briefing. “But again, we have to remember that COVID-19 is still out there.” Chris Moreland, spokesman for the state Office of Administration, said 31% of the state’s workforce was working remotely.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The state reported 25 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Thursday, the most in a single day since late March, as the number of infections continues to trend back up. The new reports came from every region of the state, including two cases in Richland County in the northeast and four cases each in Big Horn County in the southeast, Gallatin County in the southwest and Flathead County in the northwest. No new deaths were reported, leaving the number of fatalities at 20. State officials have attributed the increase in confirmed cases over the past several weeks to moves to reopen the economy and increased testing for the virus. The trend will likely worsen as the reopening progresses, the officials said. The continued troubles on the public health front came as applications for unemployment benefit payments in Montana continued their decline from the record-high levels seen earlier this spring.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state saw a small uptick in new unemployment applications last week after several weeks of declining numbers from the all-time high caused by the coronavirus. The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that 4,918 people filed for jobless benefits during the week that ended June 13. That’s up from the 4,697 who filed the prior week. The highest number of weekly claims filed during coronavirus pandemic was 26,539 during the week that ended April 4. The numbers have trended downward ever since. Nebraska’s unemployment soared during the pandemic along with the rest of the country due to government-mandated social distancing restrictions that forced the closure of many businesses. The restrictions are in place to try to keep the virus from overwhelming hospitals with patients. Gov. Pete Ricketts has been gradually easing those restrictions.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Washoe County has temporarily suspended COVID-19 testing of most people with no symptoms because of a backlog of test samples at the state lab caused in part by increased testing of inmates at state institutions. The number of new cases reported statewide Wednesday dropped sharply from the peak number of 379 new cases Monday to 184 on Tuesday. Before Monday, the largest one-day increase had been 295 cases May 22. Washoe County began testing asymptomatic people June 1 and had been ramping up those tests since, but it has suspended them until next week due to the state lab backlog, County Health District Officer Kevin Dick said Wednesday in Reno. Vulnerable populations continue to be tested whether they have symptoms or not. Dick said the county is still awaiting results of tests sent to the lab last Friday and warned a recent drop in daily positive cases may be tied to that delay.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As summer is about to begin, nearly half of the licensed day camps in the state have closed because of the coronavirus, and only six residential camps are still trying to open, the president of the state camp directors association said Wednesday. State safety guidelines that came out recently for the camps to run are “extraordinarily challenging,” Ken Robbins told a group of legislators gathering input for the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. For some camps, it would’ve meant changing the nature of their program; for others, it meant dealing with the costs of screening and testing campers, modifying buildings, and increasing health care staff. “The cost of opening for the summer, in some cases, actually exceeds the cost of staying closed and, for some, to the point of being unfeasible,” he said. A quick survey shows that camps will see more than an 80% drop in gross revenue over 2019 numbers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Jobless claims climbed 14% to 26,392 last week, the state Labor Department said Thursday. Claims had been falling since their peak of 215,000 claims in late March and early April. The department did not explain the uptick. More than 1 million people in the state have filed claims since the COVID-19 outbreak began. “The volume of claims continues to be staggering, well beyond anything the states could have been prepared for,” Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo said in a statement. Roughly 1.24 million workers – 28% of the state’s workforce –have been sidelined since the outbreak struck in New Jersey in early March, the department said. The state has paid out $7.2 billion in benefits as of June 13, with more than half coming from the federal government and the state making up more than $2 billion, according to the statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: High-stakes initiatives to improve lagging public schools are on the financial chopping block in the state as economic turmoil from the coronavirus undermines New Mexico’s most significant commodity – petroleum. Nearly half the state’s $7.6 billion annual spending plan is devoted to public schools, with a large amount of that coming from oil and gas revenues. A $2.4 billion shortfall in income this year and next has left lawmakers with the impossible challenge of boosting teacher pay and preserving funding for landmark education efforts aimed at expanding learning opportunities for more students. It was easy to lobby the Legislature earlier this year when oil prices were higher, said MaryBeth Weeks, a mother of seven and president of the New Mexico Parent Teacher Association. It’s different now. Aside from collapsing revenues, the statehouse is closed to lobbyists, advocacy groups and the general public as a precaution against coronavirus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants will be allowed to open with outdoor seating Monday as New York City enters the second phase of easing coronavirus restrictions, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday. De Blasio said the outdoor seating plan will provide a lifeline for New York’s crucial restaurant industry as the city emerges from lockdown. “We have to save this industry,” he said. “It’s part of our identity.” Gov. Andrew Cuomo followed the mayor’s briefing by cautioning that public health experts will review data to finalize whether the city can start Phase 2 on Monday. “We have global experts who look at the data, and when they sign off, then I sign off,” Cuomo said at his own briefing. The two Democrats have often been at odds over details of managing the pandemic, but de Blasio said that “there’s been a high degree of unity.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The capital city is set to require people to wear face coverings in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin signed an emergency proclamation Wednesday mandating face coverings be worn over the mouth and nose when people come in contact with those who are not members of their household in both public and private spaces where it is not possible to stay at least 6 feet apart. All restaurant, personal care, grooming, tattoo and retail employees also must wear face coverings while on duty under the order, set to go into effect Friday at 4 p.m. Children 12 and under and those with medical or religious exemptions aren’t required to comply. Anyone in the city who chooses not to wear a mask would not be fined or arrested, but law enforcement officers are “strongly encouraged to educate and encourage voluntary compliance,” the mayor said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s eight commercial airports are showing signs of life after the coronavirus outbreak tanked passenger traffic, according to state aviation officials. In April, the airports had their lowest monthly passenger count since record keeping began 40 years ago. Approximately 5,000 passengers used the airports, or 5% of normal traffic, according to the state Aeronautics Commission. The Bismarck Tribune reports that in May that number increased to nearly 13,500 passengers. While that’s still about only 14% of normal traffic, Aeronautics Commissioner Kyle Wanner called it “an encouraging sign.” The Federal Aviation Administration is providing more than $85 million in aid to 53 North Dakota airports through the federal COVID-19 economic rescue package, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Coronavirus deaths in nursing homes continue to make up the vast majority of pandemic fatalities in the state, according to the most recent Ohio Health Department data. Wednesday marked at least the fifth week in a row that 7 of every 10 COVID-19 deaths have involved long-term care residents, with 1,860 nursing home residents dying since the pandemic began out of a total of 2,611 confirmed or probable deaths, according to the state data. That’s a rate of 71%. At least 40 residents at one long-term care center in Mahoning County have died of COVID-19 since April, The Repository reports. As the deaths continued, the governor ordered teams of National Guard medical personnel into nursing homes to ramp up testing. Meanwhile, the state said Thursday that jobless claims continue to fall as the state reopens, though the numbers remain high compared to pre-pandemic times.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A record-setting number of new COVID-19 cases was reported Wednesday for the second consecutive day, state health officials said. Officials reported 259 new cases of the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, beating the previous record of 229. The total reported Wednesday brought the total number of cases reported in the state to 8,904. One related death reported Wednesday brings the death toll for the Oklahoma outbreak to 364, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health website. “We have reached a peak that is higher than at any other point in the pandemic here in the state,” said Dr. Dale Bratzler, University of Oklahoma Medicine’s chief enterprise quality officer. “We are bending the curve – sadly in the wrong direction.” Tulsa County has displaced Oklahoma County as the state’s leading COVID-19 hotspot with 1,825 cases to Oklahoma County’s 1,754 cases.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown announced Wednesday that residents in seven counties will be required to wear masks in indoor public spaces as COVID-19 social distancing restrictions are tentatively eased. Multnomah County, the state’s most populous, is among the counties where people will be required to wear masks indoors. Brown also gave the go-ahead to four counties to enter a new reopening phase, including Multnomah, home to Portland, which had been the only county that had not yet entered the first phase. These announcements come as the state continues to see a spike in cases. As of Wednesday’s case count, the total number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus in Oregon is 6,218. In addition, one more person died from the disease, raising the state’s death toll to 183.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s Public Utility Commission on Thursday rejected an attempt by one of its members to end its three-month-old moratorium preventing utilities from terminating service to nonpaying customers while the state fights the spread of the coronavirus. The motion failed on a 2-2 vote, with the panel’s Democrats opposing the motion and the panel’s Republicans backing it. The author, Commissioner John F. Coleman Jr., sought to allow non-natural gas utilities – electric, water, sewer and telephone – to begin termination processes for nonresidential customers July 1 and for residential customers July 15. The utility commission slapped a moratorium on shutoffs in March as Gov. Tom Wolf was in the midst of a cascade of shutdown orders to help stop the spread of the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State officials on Wednesday reported 11 new coronavirus deaths and 49 new positive cases. That brings the state’s virus death toll to 876. The state has reported more than 16,200 positive cases. Nearly 130 people are hospitalized, according to data released by the state. There were 17 patients in intensive care. That’s an increase of one patient from the previous day. Thirteen patients were on ventilators. Besides the 49 tests that came back positive, about 2,800 tests came back negative – representing a positive test rate of less than 2%, according to the state. Gov. Gina Raimondo said the positive testing rate has been higher in more densely populated areas of Rhode Island, but even in more urban communities, results were improving. The Democrat said the positive testing rate in Providence has been below 10% for the past few days, compared to about 18% or 19% at the end of May.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Deaths from the novel coronavirus are expected to rise through the summer and into fall, a change from earlier models that indicated the state’s deaths had peaked in early April. By Oct. 1, about 2,853 people in South Carolina could die of complications with COVID-19, with about 25 deaths each day by early fall, according to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The number of confirmed infections is projected to increase slightly, and testing is projected to rise steadily through the summer. About two months ago, IHME researchers said South Carolina would see about 214 deaths by Aug. 4. Then in early May, the researchers said there would be more than 1,100 deaths by Aug. 4, citing relaxed social restrictions. South Carolina businesses began reopening around that time, with restaurants allowed to reopen May 11 and some nonessential businesses allowed to reopen May 18.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of South Dakotans applying for unemployment benefits continues to rise. The South Dakota Department of Labor and Regulation said Thursday that during the week of June 7-13 there were 1,006 initial weekly unemployment applications. That’s an increase from 880 initial weekly claims made the week prior. The state has received more than 53,000 initial claims for unemployment benefits since mid-March, when layoffs began to steadily increase because of the coronavirus pandemic. The labor department also processed 321 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims last week. That program provides up to 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to individuals who are self-employed, independent contractors, nonprofit and temporary employees who otherwise would not qualify for regular unemployment.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Memphis in May has been canceled due to the “continuing threat of COVID-19.” Officials with Memphis in May confirmed that all its 2020 events – which had been pushed to the fall – would be canceled, “in the interest of public safety and under advice from local health authorities.” The Memphis in May International Festival includes the Beale Street Music Festival, the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest and the Great American River Run. Despite the cancellation of the 2020 events, Memphis in May also confirmed its plans to resume all events in 2021. The organization added that all ticketholders, teams and registrants will “be offered a full refund or can opt to use their tickets or entries for the 2021 festival events.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath said Thursday that public schools will be open in the fall for on-campus learning, but there will be flexibility for parents who want to keep their children at home. Texas already allows campuses to hold summer school with social distancing guidelines. Details of a broader reopening of campus for the fall semester will be released next week, Morath said. The announcement comes as Texas faces record highs of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Even in that environment, Morath said state officials have determined it will be safe to return to school. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered schools closed March 19, sending more than 5 million students into distance-learning programs to finish the spring semester.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State leaders said Wednesday that updated plans intended to help drive economic recovery won’t compromise the health of residents even though the state is experiencing a multiweek rise in cases. Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, said the increase in cases was somewhat expected because many businesses were allowed to reopen starting in May, and restrictions on how many people can gather together have been loosened. He acknowledged that the rise causes “concern and pause” but said the state shouldn’t have to choose between keeping people healthy and making plans to reopen businesses and get people back to work. “It’s false choice to say we can only do one and not the other,” Herbert said. He also issued a new plea for Utah residents to use face masks, comparing it to wearing a seat belt in a car. Herbert has stopped short of making masks mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state Department of Health on Thursday reported six new positive cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, including three that are linked to an outbreak in Winooski. The new cases raise to 86 the number of cases linked to the Winooski outbreak. They bring the statewide total of positive cases of the novel coronavirus to 1,135. Also Thursday, the state reported the first death from COVID-19 since the end of May, bringing the statewide total to 56. The new cases come as the state is continuing to reopen gradually. On Wednesday, Gov. Phil Scott announced that outdoor visits would be allowed at the state’s long-term care facilities. The state also announced that limited visitation would be allowed for hospital patients. More details of the state’s reopening are expected to be released Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nWaynesboro: A free COVID-19 testing event will be held June25 in Waynesboro. The Central Shenandoah Health District of the Virginia Department of Health, along with the Virginia National Guard and the City of Waynesboro Department of Emergency Management, will be conducting a community testing event from 2:30 to 6 p.m. in the parking lot of William Perry Elementary School. Three hundred tests are available, and they will be provided on a first-come basis, a release said. No registration or pre-screening is required, and tests will be available in both a drive-thru and walk-up manner. Testing will be free, and no insurance will be required. Participants are requested to wear a mask, respect social distancing of 6 feet between individuals at all times, and advise the testing and health care staff if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, the release said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal prosecutors say a staffer at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Seattle stole respirators and other equipment, then sold it online amid the coronavirus pandemic. Gene Wamsley was arrested Wednesday after being charged in U.S. District Court with theft of government property. Investigators said the 41-year-old Bonney Lake man was employed as a respiratory therapist at the VA Medical Center until being placed on leave June 9. According to the criminal complaint, the medical center first noticed in January that two of its bronchoscopes were missing. Another of the devices went missing in April, and three respirators went missing about the same time. Investigators with the VA Office of the Inspector General said they traced eBay transactions to an account run by Wamsley.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The State Fair of West Virginia has been canceled due to a coronavirus outbreak in the county where the event was set to take place, organizers said Thursday. The fair’s board of directors, which last week had voted to move ahead with the event, said an unfolding virus flare-up linked to a church in Greenbrier County has caused them to reverse course and scrap the festival for the first time since World War II. “After speaking with local and state health officials as well as community leaders, it is a hard decision, but it is the right decision,” said a statement from the fair. In an interview, state fair CEO Kelly Collins called the move “heartbreaking.” Last week, Republican Gov. Jim Justice had praised the fair’s board for its decision to hold the event, saying organizers and health officials would implement sufficient safety protocols. The fair draws thousands of visitors each year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin-Madison officials announced Wednesday that the state’s flagship school will reopen as scheduled this fall, but in-person classes will end at Thanksgiving, lecture courses will be offered online only, and students will have to wear face masks. Chancellor Rebecca Blank outlined the new parameters, dubbed the Smart Restart plan, in an email to students. She acknowledged campus life will look very different from in years past. “It’s going to be different, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be worse,” Blank said during a video conference with reporters to tout the plan. “I actually think there’s going to be some sense of camaraderie, of being in this together. If we create that kind of culture on campus, we will get people to follow the health protocols and respect each other in a way that keeps everyone healthy.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A federal magistrate judge in the state has ordered two women to spend two days in jail for leaving a boardwalk and damaging a thermal area in Yellowstone National Park. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Mark Carman also ordered 31-year-old Tara Davoli and 30-year-old Sarah Piotrowski of Philadelphia to pay a $350 fine and about $107 each in restitution and banned them from the park for two years. Prosecutors say the women illegally left the boardwalk in the park’s Midway Geyser Basin on June 11. Witnesses tried to stop them, but prosecutors say they damaged orange bacterial mats at Opal Pool. The women pleaded guilty during a hearing Tuesday. They represented themselves. Phone messages left for Davoli and Piotrowski were not immediately returned Thursday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/14/retired-monkeys-freeze-dried-blood-hidden-figures-way-news-around-states/39581447/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A sculpture project highlighting the sister-city relationship between the capital of the Heart of Dixie and the Italian city of Pietrasanta points to the idea that we all exist under the the same moon. Artists Craigger Browne and Marcello Giorgi are joining forces on “Nostra Luna,” Italian for “Our Moon,” which will eventually have a home at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts. Browne is an artist in residence in Sylacauga whose commissioned work includes a Helen Keller statue in 2017; Giorgi is a master carver from Pietrasanta. Browne says the moon is believed to have two faces in Italian folklore – one side toward the past and one toward the future. Giorgi’s side will feature an older woman looking back over Pietrasanta “with prideful approval of many centuries of classical tradition,” Brown says. On the other side, he is carving a younger woman “looking forward over Montgomery with joyous hope for the future.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: At least 60 ice seals have been found dead along the state’s west coast, and federal biologists are trying to determine the cause. Some carcasses had lost hair, and NOAA Fisheries hopes to determine if that was due to decomposition or abnormal molting. The agency noted the importance of ice seals to Alaska Native coastal communities. Bearded, ringed and spotted seals were reported dead south of Nome and north of the Bering Strait. A hunter counted 18 carcasses along 11 miles of shore north of the village of Kotlik and dozens of others along an island near Stebbins. Eight young bearded seals were found Monday on St. Lawrence Island. North of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea, a National Park Service biologist counted six dead seals near Kotzebue’s airport. NOAA Fisheries also received accounts of up to 30 dead seals between Kivalina and Point Hope.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Sales taxes have gone uncollected because of flaws in a new state program created to make the process more efficient, according to auditors. The Arizona Department of Revenue failed to identify many businesses that weren’t paying taxes and erased active businesses from its tracking system, says a recent report by the Arizona auditor general. Some cities and counties, which were assured they no longer had to deal with sales tax collection issues, now are assigning staff again to assure their cities get the money they are owed. The Department of Revenue fully took over auditing and collecting sales taxes for all cities, towns and counties in 2017. More than a year later, the auditor general showed the Department of Revenue was auditing significantly fewer businesses and, at one point, had completely stopped checking whether businesses had licenses.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Police Department announced Wednesday it is overhauling policies for obtaining no-knock warrants in drug raids, eight months after a man alleged officers blasted down his door and raided his apartment without probable cause. Police Chief Keith Humphrey said at a news conference that the department will now use more detailed information when determining whether a no-knock warrant is reasonable. In October, Roderick Talley said he was suing the department and the city, alleging police lied to obtain a no-knock warrant and used similar boiler-plate language on dozens of other warrants. He showed video footage from outside of his home that he said proved officers lied when they claimed they witnessed a confidential informant buying cocaine from Talley. Footage showed the informant ringing Talley’s doorbell and leaving minutes later – after no one answered the door.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State judges say prison inmates can legally have small amounts of marijuana – if they don’t inhale. The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday that California voters in 2016 legalized recreational possession of less than an ounce of cannabis with no exception – even for those behind bars. The court overturned the convictions of five inmates who were found with marijuana in their prison cells. However, the three-judge court said state law does prohibit smoking or ingesting pot in prison. Also, officials can still punish possession as a rules violation – and corrections officials say pot possession is still against those rules. Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office says it’s reviewing the appellate court ruling but didn’t say whether it will appeal.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Casinos in the state saw an increase in combined 2018 revenue that set a record for the state. The Denver Post reports that casinos in Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek reaped combined revenue of $842.1 million last year. The American Gaming Association says the figure is a 1.7% increase over the state’s $828 million take in 2017 and a nearly 13% increase over 2014. The association’s 2019 edition of its “State of the States” roundup found 12 of 24 states with legalized commercial gambling enjoyed record revenues last year. The association says the industry brought in an all-time national high of $41.7 billion in 2018, a 3.5% increase over 2017. Officials say Colorado still lacks legal sports betting, which contributed significantly to the national increase.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: A popular state park is reopening more than a year after it was hit by a tornado that brought down thousands of trees. Gov. Ned Lamont says Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden will reopen to the public beginning at 8 a.m. Friday. State workers and volunteers have spent months clearing the extensive trails in the 1,400-acre park, named for its 2-mile ridge that resembles a man in repose. The park has been closed since the storm hit on May 15, 2018. Final work on restoration of the main Tower Trail was completed earlier this week. The cost of the restoration work has totaled about $735,000. The state anticipates that about 75% of that will be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Black-and-white license plates are coveted as a sign of prestige in the First State. They’re reserved only for low-digit tag numbers, and people bid thousands of dollars for them. Yet they suddenly seem to be everywhere. Turns out a lot of them are “illegal tags,” says C.R. McLeod, community relations manager for the Delaware Department of Transportation. Jordan Irazabal, who is behind the Facebook page and website TheDelaware3000.org, has for the past 11 1/ 2 years been trying to find and photograph the 3,000 lowest Delaware tag numbers and running into what he says is a disturbing trend. Irazabal says he finds the fakes offensive and has started a petition asking police to crack down on people with unauthorized plates.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The street outside NASA’s headquarters in the capital has been renamed “Hidden Figures Way” to honor the black female mathematicians who helped send humans to the moon. News outlets report district officials, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and others gathered Wednesday to unveil the new street sign. “Hidden Figures” author Margot Lee Shetterly and the families of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson also attended the event. Shetterly’s 2016 book details the struggles of the women as they crunched numbers at the NASA Langley Research Center in the pre-computer age. Cruz in August proposed renaming E Street SW through the Hidden Figures Way Designation Act, which passed in December.\n\nFlorida\n\nBig Pine Key: Marine researchers have finished a 10-day assessment of the iconic green sea turtle in the Florida Keys. The study completed Wednesday examined where green turtles live and feed in Keys waters and evaluated green turtles’ general health. Data acquired from 26 green turtles included measurements, skin biopsies and bloodwork. All were released except for three that are being treated at the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for Fibropapillomatosis, a herpes-like virus that affects turtles worldwide. The effort was a collaboration of the Turtle Hospital, other marine research groups and Force Blue, a nonprofit that aids returning combat veterans through mission-focused programs to help the world’s ocean environment. Green sea turtles in the southern Atlantic Ocean are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRoswell: The city could begin penalizing hotels that burden police with an outsized number of calls for help. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports a hotel safety ordinance was proposed for Roswell on Tuesday by City Council member Mike Palermo. He says there are just a few hotels in town that burden taxpayers with frequent calls for help. The newspaper says most of the calls involved drug use and prostitution. The proposed bill would punish these hotels by dividing 911 calls by the number of rooms and charging offenders accordingly. A similar act that passed narrowly in Alpharetta last month would require a 100-room hotel making 42 calls for police service in a year to hire an off-duty police officer nightly for $90,000 a year. The law would not penalize medical and fire calls.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A snake stowed away in a man’s bag and remained undetected until it completed the trip from Florida to Hawaii, officials said. The southern black racer snake slithered out of the man’s backpack when he arrived on Maui on Monday, KGMB-TV reports. Snakes have no natural predators in Hawaii and pose a threat to Hawaii’s native species. The Virginia man was not aware of the animal until it emerged after he arrived at a vacation rental property in the community of Pukalani, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The non-venomous snake measured about a foot long and a quarter-inch in diameter, officials said. The property owner told the visitor that snakes are illegal in Hawaii and alerted police, who captured the snake along with state Department of Land and Natural Resources personnel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says law enforcement officers can’t arrest someone for a misdemeanor unless they have a warrant or actually saw the crime being committed. The unanimous ruling made Wednesday has advocacy organizations scrambling because it likely means police will have to dramatically change how they respond to domestic violence calls. The ruling came in a drug conviction case, but the high court noted the Idaho Constitution’s provision against unlawful search and seizure doesn’t allow warrantless arrests without probable cause. That means no misdemeanor arrests unless the officer saw the crime. Officers responding to domestic violence calls often arrest the person they suspect of committing the violence on a misdemeanor charge as a way of separating those involved and defusing the situation.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Abraham Lincoln history buffs will have the chance to learn more about the courtship and marriage of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is hosting tours over the summer that will let visitors learn about their unexpected romance. It’s called “Abe and Mary: Quite Contrary.” Tour guide Jen Brownell says Lincoln and Todd were different on so many levels from education to temperament, yet they seemed to complement each other. The free tours will be offered Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 10 a.m. until Aug. 7. The tour covers 1.5 miles and will take about an hour. Visitors are encouraged to reserve a space online.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Butler University is planning a $100 million upgrade and expansion of its science facilities that will become the school’s largest single investment to date. The private Indianapolis college announced Thursday that its trustees approved the three-phase project last week. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the school says the project will create 96,000 square feet of space for a science complex featuring “high-tech classrooms, modern research labs and collaborative working spaces.” Construction on the first two phases is expected to be completed within about 18 months. Butler’s science program enrollment has increased 70% in the past decade, causing the department to outgrow its space. Administrators hope to raise at least $42 million through philanthropy and have already secured $27.5 million in donations. A bond issue will fund the remainder.\n\nIowa\n\nArnolds Park: The Iowa Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame’s hundreds of inductee exhibits have been moved to a new and bigger space in Arnolds Park. They can be found now in the same building that houses the Iowa Great Lakes Maritime Museum. The Hall of Fame had been in the Roof Garden, an open-air complex next to the amusement park. The garden was demolished and is being rebuilt as part of the multimillion-dollar Restore the Park campaign. The new Hall of Fame museum has three times more space than the old version for the photos, videos and memorabilia from bands, musicians and radio personalities. Highlights include recording equipment from Iowa studios, contracts to perform at the Roof Garden that were signed by the likes of Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison, and a bright red suit worn on stage by the late Tommy Bolin, a Sioux City native and guitarist for such bands as Deep Purple and the James Gang.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The new owners of a long-abandoned amusement park want to transform it into an outdoor event center and paintball range. The Wichita Eagle reports that the plan is set to go to the City Council next month after winning approval from planners and neighbors. Councilman James Clendenin says he’s pleased to see some redevelopment finally occurring at the site. He says the area has been a nuisance since Joyland shut down for good in 2006. After years of vandalism, a fire destroyed much of what remained in August 2018. Three months later, Gregory and Tina Dunnegan bought Joyland’s 57 acres at auction for $198,000. A consultant wrote in a site proposal that the owners envision temporary outdoor festivals and amusement rides to “capture the old flavor of Joyland.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Donated blood generally has a six-week shelf life, but University of Louisville researchers are testing a way to convert red blood cells into a longer-lasting powder that potentially could save the lives of soldiers, trauma patients and maybe even astronauts. U of L professors Michael Menze and Jonathan Kopechek, as well as Ph.D. candidate Brett Janis, have spent two years developing this “freeze-dried” approach to storing blood, which has drawn interest from the U.S. military, NASA, emergency responders and other groups. “So many people told us, ‘We really want this. We really need this,’ ” Kopechek said. Menze, Kopechek, Janis and U of L students have devised a process of preserving red blood cells though freezing and dehydration. The powder remains viable at a wider range of temperatures than donated blood, which has to be refrigerated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Justice Department says hate crime charges have been filed in connection with three fires that destroyed African American churches earlier this year. A news release from the department says 21-year-old Holden Matthews faces three counts of intentional damage to religious property. He’s also charged with three counts of using fire to commit a felony. The indictment says the fires were set “because of the religious character” of the properties. Matthews has pleaded not guilty to related state charges. His attorney declined comment on the federal charges. Three historic African American churches were burned over 10 days, beginning in late March, in and around the city of Opelousas. The June 6 federal indictment was unsealed Wednesday.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state legalized medically assisted suicide Wednesday, becoming the eighth in the nation to allow terminally ill people to end their lives with prescribed medication. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who had previously said she was unsure about the bill, signed it in her office. “It is my hope that this law, while respecting the right to personal liberty, will be used sparingly,” Mills said. While still controversial, assisted suicide legislation is winning increasing acceptance in the United States, and this year at least 18 states considered such measures. Maine’s bill would allow doctors to prescribe terminally ill people a fatal dose of medication. The bill declares that obtaining or administering life-ending medication is not suicide under state law, thereby legalizing the practice often called medically assisted suicide.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A jury has awarded nearly $3 million to an inmate who was beaten by prison guards almost six years ago in what his attorney called a “systemwide failure.” The Daily Record of Baltimore reports jurors awarded $2.7 million to Kevin Younger, who was assaulted by officers at the Maryland Reception, Diagnostics & Classification Center in Baltimore in 2013. Officers beat Younger the day after he witnessed other inmates assaulting a guard. Younger’s lawsuit said three officers attacked him as “misplaced retaliation” because they believed he was involved in the attack. Attorney David Daneman said the attack resulted from a “systemwide failure” at the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A lawsuit being filed against state officials says the education funding system shortchanges low-income school districts. Advocates planned to announce the lawsuit at the Statehouse on Thursday on behalf of more than a dozen parents around the state. The plaintiffs argue that the current formula used by the state to distribute education money to school districts violates the civil rights of children in underfunded communities. The lawsuit comes amid behind-the-scenes efforts on Beacon Hill to revamp the 1993 formula which many critics view as outdated and responsible for a widening gap in academic achievement between students from wealthier communities and their less-advantaged urban counterparts. Plans to overhaul the spending formula have been introduced by Democratic lawmakers and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, but no consensus has been reached.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History is marking Black Music Month with a concert featuring many of Detroit’s prominent musical, visual and literary artists. Singer Joan Belgrave, wife of late jazz trumpeting great Marcus Belgrave, is producing and performing at the June 27 concert, “Our Music Our Lives.” The show aims to explore connections between music and the American black experience. It will include works from slavery through modern times and span several genres, including R&B, jazz, gospel, blues and spoken word. Dance and graphic art also will be featured. Scheduled performers also include Mark Scott of the Miracles, Motown Legends Gospel Choir, poet and playwright Bill Harris, and the Lisa McCall Dancers. Black Music Month was recognized by President Jimmy Carter 40 years ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for spring storms and flooding that caused nearly $40 million in damage to infrastructure across the state. Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday that the declaration will provide federal emergency relief money for 51 Minnesota counties and four tribal governments. Walz had requested the federal aid in a letter to Trump two weeks ago. The governor says that “Minnesota is on the road to recovery,” and the incoming federal money “will expedite that process enormously.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized using federal public assistance funds to reimburse affected communities for response and recovery costs. FEMA will pay 75% of eligible expenses. The state will cover the other 25% from the Disaster Assistance Contingency Account.\n\nMississippi\n\nPicayune: A city worker was passing by a home when he noticed it was on fire and saved a girl inside who had woken up to find smoke filling her room. The Picayune Item reports Stanley Hart saw smoke coming from the house Tuesday morning. Hart and a neighbor, Mark Jones, arrived to find a 15-year-old girl inside who was knocking on the window for help to get out. Hart called 911, and then he and Jones broke the window with a cinder block to rescue the teen. Fire officials say the initial investigation shows the fire started near the kitchen stove. The 15-year-old was airlifted to a hospital in New Orleans. No one else was in the home at the time of the fire.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson: This tourist town is getting a new science attraction called WonderWorks. The Orlando, Florida-based operation announced this week that the new location will open in November in the former theater for the Baldknobbers, one of the longest-running country music shows in town. WonderWorks bills itself as “the indoor amusement park for the mind.” Chief operations officer Janine Vaccarello says it appeals to all age groups, with a lot of hands-on activities and themed areas that cater to the interests of the communities where WonderWorks has a presence. The Branson location will have a military room and a space devoted to the city’s history. WonderWorks has five other locations, including in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Panama City Beach, Florida; and Syracuse, New York.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Campers and hikers used to seeing “pack it in, pack it out” signs may soon be seeing some “pull your share” notices as well. The Pull Your Share movement, started by Great Falls High teacher Dan Wilkins three years ago, encourages people to spend five to 15 minutes on their trips pulling out noxious, nonnative knapweed at campgrounds and other sites. An annual Pull Your Share field trip has teachers and students from local high schools heading out to pull the weeds in hopes of encouraging all recreationists to “pull their share.” Since the first year, it’s grown from two students and one teacher to 190 students and nine teachers. Wilkins says knapweed cannot be used by wildlife or domestic livestock and doesn’t have enough nutrition for them to survive.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A city councilman says an ordinance that forces the Muslim owners of a new hookah lounge to serve alcohol in violation of their faith must change. The ordinance requires businesses in Lincoln that allow smoking indoors to have a liquor license. Those businesses must stock and serve booze. The Lincoln Journal-Star reports that Councilman Roy Christensen has been working with city lawyers to write a new ordinance that would allow businesses like 88 Hookah Lounge to operate in compliance with the owners’ faith and local rules. Cigar bars are legal in Nebraska under the state’s Clean Indoor Air Act as long as they do not sell anything else. City Attorney Jeff Kirkpatrick says the difficulty will be drafting a law that allows the hookah lounge to serve non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The city is closing down some downtown streets as NASA resumes a series of drone tests in high-density urban settings. Beginning Friday, Lake Street will be closed from 1st to 2nd streets from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. through June 20, and again June 23-25. Chism Street also will be closed from Dickerson to 2nd Street from June 14 to July 2. It’s part of the final stage of a four-year effort to develop a national drone traffic management system. NASA and the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems conducted initial tests last month, flying drones for the first time above Reno streets beyond the operator’s line of sight. They’re researching emerging technology that someday will be used to manage hundreds of thousands of small unmanned commercial aircraft delivering packages.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: Jenness State Beach is getting an upgrade. The state Parks and Recreation Department is hosting a ribbon-cutting celebration for the new bathhouse at the Rye beach on Friday at 1:30 p.m. The design is similar to the style of the facilities at Hampton Beach State Park and North Hampton State Beach. It features exterior changing rooms, rinse-off showers and a family bathroom. The bathhouse is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily until Labor Day. It replaces the previous bathhouse, built in 1980. Jenness Beach is one of five state park beaches along New Hampshire’s seacoast.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFort Lee: A little more than a year after the death of celebrity chef and native son Anthony Bourdain, the Garden State is honoring his memory with the launch of the Anthony Bourdain Food Trail, a statewide tribute that includes 10 of the restaurants he visited for a 2015 episode of his CNN food and travel show “Parts Unknown.” The food trail kicked off Thursday and continues Friday with statewide ceremonies featuring Chris Bourdain, the late chef’s brother; New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way; and Jeffrey Vasser, executive director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. Thursday’s event locations included Hiram’s Roadstand in Fort Lee and Frank’s Deli in Asbury Park. Sites slated for Friday visits, open to the public, are James’ Salt Water Taffy in Atlantic City and Donkey’s Place in Camden.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Air Force has begun construction on a facility at Kirtland Air Force Base that officials say will play a role in the proposed “space defense.” The Albuquerque Journal reports the Air Force Research Laboratory’s $12.8 million Space Control Laboratory will consolidate efforts on the base. The new facility will include office and lab space for 65 civilian and military contractors. It will contain a 5,000 square-foot high-bay laboratory space and more than 5,000 square feet of secure office, laboratory and meeting space. Air Force Col. Eric Felt says space is now “a war-fighting domain.” President Donald Trump has proposed creating a new U.S. Space Force – a plan that has hit widespread resistance on Capitol Hill.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state would become the 13th to permit driver’s licenses for immigrants who entered the country illegally under legislation passed by the state Assembly on Wednesday. The measure has the support of liberal groups, the state’s largest business organization and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. Yet its fate remains uncertain in the state Senate, which has not scheduled a vote on the bill. During floor debate in the Assembly, Democrats argued that immigrant families deserve to have the same ability to drive given to other New Yorkers. Licensing immigrants, they said, would improve road safety and help the businesses that rely on immigrant employees. “This bill is common sense,” said Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, D-Bronx and sponsor of the legislation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: An increasing number of North Carolinians live with hepatitis C, many unaware they’re infected. In response to a dramatic statewide spike in infections fueled by the opioid crisis, the state launched a multimillion dollar initiative Thursday to fight the virus, seeking to increase access to screenings and treatment. It is funded by biotech company Gilead Sciences and partners with local health care providers and the Harm Reduction Coalition, which advocates for health services for drug users. The state’s health department estimates that 110,000 people in North Carolina live with hepatitis C and that in 2017, 186 people were newly diagnosed, a roughly fivefold increase from a decade earlier. The virus can cause severe liver damage or death. In 2016, the most recent year that data is available, 511 people died in North Carolina of hepatitis C-related causes.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: State residents are donating blood to fill a shortage this summer that a blood transfusion nonprofit says is leaving hospitals in the region without enough donations to meet their needs. Vitalant serves hospitals in North Dakota and parts of South Dakota. The organization’s donor recruitment official, Colleen Scott, tells the Bismarck Tribune that the region’s blood supply was critical in February because of people getting sick and snowstorms affecting blood drives. But she says donations have significantly dropped in the summer months, when people are typically busier. Vitalant is hosting daily blood drives, reaching out to loyal donors and encouraging everyone to bring a friend.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: In honor of LGBTQ Pride month, more than 100 Cincinnati Bell employees used Post-it notes this week to create a Pride mural on the north side of the company’s Atrium 2 headquarters. The mural extends from the 9th floor to the 16th floor and is made up of approximately 26,000 sticky notes put on 96 windows. And for the first time, Cincinnati Bell illuminated its signage on top of Atrium II using Pride colors Wednesday night. Both the mural and the Atrium 2 illumination will remain through the end of June. The company is a corporate sponsor of Cincinnati’s Pride Parade, set for June 22.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPryor: Google has announced a $600 million expansion project at a data center in Pryor and a $6 million grant for computer science education for students in 4-H chapters in rural areas of 20 states. The announcement was made Thursday outside the data center. The expansion project is expected to add about 100 jobs to the more than 400 now employed at the center that opened in 2011. National 4-H Council President Jennifer Sirangelo said the grant through Google.org will focus on computer science training for an estimated 1 million children in rural areas that have limited access to computer science education. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the grant will be used to teach coding and leadership skills to students.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city has launched a program to distribute portable toilets in order to reduce cleanup costs and improve public health and hygiene. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Mayor Ted Wheeler proposed the Hygiene Street Response initiative after receiving numerous complaints about human feces in public places. Wheeler says that beyond cleanliness, bathrooms are needed to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as hepatitis A. The city council voted last month to provide $877,000 in funding. Officials say the program will deploy six portable toilets in high-need areas and build mobile bathrooms and shower trailers to be given to nonprofit groups serving the homeless population. A city report says disposal of more than 3,300 gallons of waste, without including other related fees, cost $26,480 for one year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Dozens of rare 13-star American flags never before exhibited will be on display at the Museum of the American Revolution. Antique flag dealer and expert Jeff Bridgman has loaned the historic flags to the Philadelphia museum for display starting Friday, which is Flag Day. The flags feature 32 arrangements of 13 stars representing the 13 original colonies. There was no official pattern for the stars until 1912. Flag makers had previously arranged the stars however they wanted. A highlight of the display is a nearly 6-foot flag that features 13 stars that roughly form the letters “U” and “S.” Three flags from flag maker Sarah McFadden, known as the “Betsy Ross of New York,” will be on display. “A New Constellation: A Collection of Historic 13-Star Flags” runs through July 14.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCoventry: A man sick of potholes has taken matters into his own hands. WJAR-TV reports that Seth Kerstetter spent his own money Sunday to fill holes on Centre of New England Boulevard in Coventry. Kerstetter was at Home Depot when he decided to purchase supplies and fix the most problematic potholes. He blocked traffic, put out traffic cones and worked for about two hours. The boulevard is lined with shopping centers and apartments. Because it is privately owned, neither the town nor the state is responsible for its upkeep. The road is in receivership and under the supervision of attorney Matthew McGowan. McGowan says because the developer ran out of money, the road was never properly surfaced. He says an effort is underway to find money to fix it.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Autumn the giraffe is pregnant again at the Greenville Zoo. The 13-year-old female Masai giraffe is expected to give birth in early July. Autumn gave birth to her first calf, Kiko, in 2012. Kiko now lives at the Toronto Zoo. She had a second pregnancy in 2014 that ended with a stillborn calf. Autumn later gave birth to Tatu in 2016. Tatu was later transferred to the Lehigh Valley Zoo. In January, Autumn gave birth to Kiden, her first calf to be fathered by Miles, a 10-year-old male giraffe who still lives at Greenville Zoo. Miles is also the father of the expected calf. In the past, Autumn’s previous calves were transferred before she gave birth. This time, Kiden will remain with his parents through the birth. The public can keep an eye on Autumn’s pregnancy progress via the zoo’s webcam.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Local artists are taking to the streets, literally, in an effort to keep the area’s rivers healthy. The city’s Downtown Storm Inlet Art Project, now in its third year, aims to remind citizens the dangers of throwing and dumping “litter, debris and hazardous chemicals” into storm drains, which are direct lines to the Big Sioux River running through the heart of Sioux Falls. Artists Molly O’Connor and Ashton Dockendorf painted two of the six new inlets of 2019 on Dakota Avenue last Friday, with motifs depicting the value of aquatic well-being. Eighteen total painted inlets sit along a seven-block stretch. The Big Sioux River could use some help, says Jessica Sexe, the city’s sustainability coordinator. Sediment from farms and lawns has left the Big Sioux listed as an “impaired water body” unsafe for swimming, kayaking and canoeing.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority is ready to clean up and demolish the Allen Fossil plant in South Memphis. But plans to do so are drawing concern from environmental groups that say the cleanup process has not been publicly vetted and involves pumping dangerous amounts of arsenic solids into the Mississippi River. Inactive since March 2018, the once coal-powered Allen plant still contains an estimated 3 million cubic yards of coal ash waste and other combustible residuals. The water near and in these coal ash pits and their stilling ponds was recently ranked among the worst in the nation for contamination due to the high amount of arsenic present in the water. TVA has said its preferred option for cleaning up the coal ash ponds is removal, but doing so involves a process called “dewatering,” a plan the Southern Environmental Law Center has criticized.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: Friends and family of former President George H.W. Bush gathered in Texas on Wednesday to mark the first day of issue for the U.S. Postal Service stamp honoring him. The event was held on the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, where Bush’s presidential library is located. Bush died in Houston on Nov. 30 at the age of 94. Speakers at the event, which was held on what would have been Bush’s 95th birthday, talked about the 41st president’s prolific letter writing. His grandson Pierce Bush said his grandfather’s words, dreams and hopes live on through his letters. “His letters showed his unique ability to lift others up, just at the time they needed to be lifted,” he said. George H.W. Bush served as president from 1989 to 1993.\n\nUtah\n\nCapitol Reef National Park: Officials say vandals have etched an image of an eye onto a sandstone rock formation at Capitol Reef National Park. Park visitors reported the graffiti on the Temple of the Moon monolith in the remote Cathedral Valley on June 6. Park officials say the etching is more than 2 feet wide and about 1 1/ 2 feet tall. Officials are determining if the graffiti can be removed or hidden. Defacing national park structures is a federal crime punishable by jail time and fines. Park law enforcement officers are investigating the vandalism. Information on the crime can be called in or submitted on the National Park Service website.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State health insurance regulators are planning to tweak Medicaid rules so transgender youth no longer have to wait until age 21 to seek gender-affirming surgery. The changes are aimed at removing barriers for people seeking a suite of surgeries in order to alleviate gender dysphoria, a conflict between a person’s gender identity and physical gender, says Nissa James, policy director for the Department of Vermont Health Access. Gender-affirming surgeries covered by Medicaid include 16 types of genital surgery, as well as breast augmentation or mastectomy, a surgery that removes the whole breast. The changes would be “enormously positive” for transgender people, especially those in their late teens, says Dr. Rachel Inker, who runs the Transgender Health Clinic at the Community Health Centers of Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A state agency has issued permits for three new solar projects. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Wednesday that the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality has signed off on two new projects in Halifax County and one project in Orange County. Combined, the new projects are expected to generate more than 200 megawatts, or enough energy to power about 25,000 homes. Virginia has seen a dramatic increase in solar facilities in recent years, driven largely by large technology companies seeking carbon-free energy sources for data centers.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state says drivers won’t pay tolls to use the city’s downtown Highway 99 tunnel until this fall. The Seattle Times reports Washington State Department of Transportation toll spokeswoman Emily Glad said Wednesday that no specific date has been set. When the four-lane tunnel opened Feb. 4, the state intended to begin collecting money from drivers this summer. But if tolling started now, drivers would encounter even worse congestion on Alaskan Way, where demolition crews are taking down the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and on First Avenue, which is crowded with detouring buses that had used the viaduct. State lawmakers approved the tunnel in 2009 to replace the aging Alaskan Way Viaduct and now have required that tolls raise $200 million toward the $3.2 billion project.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A beekeeping garden has been added to the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center in hopes that it will help the building attain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports that the first urban beekeeping garden in the city was set up last week on the convention center’s balcony. Along with three beehives, the garden contains flowers and herbs. Assistant Director Jim Smith says it’s also a way to show the public how the center participates in sustainability efforts, as well as recycling and energy management. In its quest for certification, Director John Robertson says the facility is implementing a more efficient air conditioning system and reducing the amount of electric and water used.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWestfield: Izzle, Timon, Batman, River and Mars spent years confined inside a lab, their lives devoted to being tested for the benefit of human health. But these rhesus macaques have paid their dues and are now living in retirement – in larger enclosures that let them venture outside, eat lettuce and carrots, dip their fingers in colorful plastic pools, paint, and hang from pipes and tires – in relative quiet. More research labs are retiring primates to sanctuaries like Primates Inc., a 17-acre rural compound in central Wisconsin, where they can live their remaining years, according to the sanctuaries and researchers. For some monkeys, it’s their first time hanging out in the fresh air. There were approximately 110,000 primates in research facilities in 2017, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Eastern Shoshone Tribe has joined a growing list of municipalities and groups nationwide in suing the makers and distributers of prescription painkillers. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the tribe announced Tuesday it had filed a federal lawsuit against two dozen companies, claiming they used deceptive marketing to convince doctors to prescribe opioids for treatment of chronic pain. The tribe says the opioid crisis has caused substantial increases in child welfare and social service costs. The lawsuit notes the opioid crisis has disproportionately affected Native Americans. The lawsuit is similar to those filed by other Wyoming entities, including the city of Casper and the Northern Arapaho Tribe.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/27/bomber-boneyard-flying-farmer-crashes-blueberry-bonanza-news-around-states/118952548/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The state is considering whether to use $400million in pandemic relief funds to build new prisons, a proposal Gov. Kay Ivey and Republican legislative leaders said would save state taxpayers’ money, but that critics argue is not for what the funds are supposed to be used. Lawmakers on Monday begin a special session focused on a $1.3 billion prison construction plan to build at least three new prisons and renovate others. The projects would be done in phases and funded with a $785 million bond issue, $150 million in general fund dollars and $400 million from the state’s $2.2 billion share of American Rescue Plan funds. Ivey and Republican legislative leaders have defended the use of the virus funds, saying it will enable the state to essentially “pay cash” for part of the construction and avoid using state dollars as well as paying interest on a loan.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state reported more than 1,700 resident COVID-19 cases Friday, which state health officials said included reports from earlier this month as they work to clear a backlog that has built up during the latest case surge. Health officials encouraged looking at cases by their symptom onset date versus the date they were submitted to the state health department. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, also recommended looking at weekly trends. Zink said the high daily report includes a mix of current and older cases, “but it does not diminish the fact we continue to see tremendous COVID spread in our communities.” Dr. Joe McLaughlin, the state epidemiologist, told reporters there is no indication yet that Alaska has hit a peak.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: More than a dozen B-1 bombers decommissioned by the Air Force have been flown to a boneyard in Tucson. The last of the 13 bombers destined for storage or disposal at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson arrived Thursday after being flown from a base in California, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force decommissioned a total of 17 B-1s, with the other four going to various locations for testing and other purposes. With the retirements of 17 of the B-1 bombers, 45 others remain in the Air Force’s active inventory. In addition, four of the B-1s sent to Davis-Monthan will be stored in a manner that would allow them to be put back into use if needed. The Air Force said retiring some of its B-1s will allow it to give more attention to remaining B-1s to increase their readiness while the service transitions to a bomber fleet consisting of only two types of aircraft – rebuilt B-52s and a new model, the B-21.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients in Arkansas’ hospitals hit its lowest point in two months on Friday as the state reported more than 1,300 new coronavirus cases. The state Department of Health reported COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by 62 to 894. It’s the lowest number of COVID-19 patients the state has reported since 875 were hospitalized on July 24. The state reported 1,365 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 491,221. Arkansas ranks 23rd in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California will strike the word “alien” from its state laws, getting rid of what Gov. Gavin Newsom called “an offensive term for a human being” that has “fueled a divisive and hurtful narrative.” Newsom on Friday signed a law that removes the word from various sections of the California state code. California passed laws in 2015 and 2016 that removed the word from the state’s labor and education code. But the law Newsom signed on Friday finishes the job by removing the word from all state laws. The word will be replaced with terms such as “noncitizen” or “immigrant.” “By changing this term, we are ensuring California’s laws reflect our state’s values,” Newsom said. The federal government has used the term “alien” to describe people in the U.S. who are not citizens since at least 1798 with the passage of the “Aliens and Sedition Acts.” But Assemblywoman Luz Rivas, a Democrat from Arleta, said the word “has become weaponized and has been used in place of explicitly racial slurs to dehumanize immigrants.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Whistleblower allegations that the state health department’s air pollution division interfered with staff efforts to properly enforce federal air quality standards are unsubstantiated, according to an independent report released Friday by the Colorado attorney general’s office. The Colorado Department of Law, which is led by Attorney General Phil Weiser, hired the independent investigator after a complaint was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of inspector general in March. Three whistleblowers alleged that dozens of air pollution permits were issued unlawfully by the health department’s Air Pollution Control Division to companies, and that at least one whistleblower was asked to falsify data to get pollution estimates under permitted limits. They also alleged that health department division leaders ignored EPA regulations on modeling and permitting short-term pollutants from important Colorado industries – including mines, asphalt plants and oil and gas gathering sites. They said the permits were part of a larger problem of state officials allegedly catering to industry. The Denver Post reported the findings released Friday didn’t substantiate the claims of fraud and suppression.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDurham: A retired Connecticut physician and surgeon’s license was suspended Friday by a state medical board for allegedly providing people she had not treated with blank vaccine, mask-wearing and other exemption forms, so long as they sent her a self-addressed stamped envelope in the mail requesting the paperwork. The state Department of Public Health said it received an anonymous tip in July about Dr. Sue Mcintosh of Durham sending people fraudulent exemption forms. After an investigation, DPH called on the Connecticut Medical Examining Board to hold Friday’s emergency hearing and summarily suspend the doctor, saying she poses a “clear and immediate danger to public health and safety.” The panel voted unanimously in favor of the suspension. A full hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Oct. 5.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to order a hospital to administer the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin to a man who is seriously ill with COVID-19. Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn said in a ruling issued Friday that patients, even if they are gravely ill, do not have a right to a particular medical treatment. She also said a health care provider’s duty to treat is bound by that provider’s standard of care. “While ivermectin has been approved as safe and effective to treat human parasitic infections, and so is distinct from a wholly unapproved new drug, DeMarco still has no right to compel its use to treat COVID-19 outside the standard of care,” Zurn wrote. The ruling came a day after a hearing in a lawsuit filed last week by Mary Ellen DeMarco on behalf of her husband, David, against Christiana Care Health Services. Despite refusing to issue an injunction sought by Mary Ellen DeMarco, Zurn indicated she was prepared to quickly consider an application for an interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Two women, a pastor and a college student, who live in the D.C. area, will headline CBS's “Survivor 41” that premieres at 8 p.m. Wednesday, WUSA-TV reported. Shantel Smith, 34, who is from Toronto, is a pastor at Emmanuel Brinklow Church,.and Liana Wallace, 20, who is from Evanston, Illinois, is a junior at Georgetown University. The Emmy Award-winning series returns this fall on CBS as 18 new castaways will compete for $1 million and the title of Sole Survivor.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A ferret has tested positive for the coronavirus in Florida, the first ferret to test positive for the virus in the United States, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture news release. A ferret in the European nation of Slovenia previously tested positive for the virus. USDA officials said samples from the Florida ferret were tested after the animal showed symptoms that included sneezing and coughing. Officials believed the ferret acquired the virus from an infected human. The small mustelids are commonly kept as pets. Officials didn’t say where in Florida the infected ferret was found. COVID-19 has been reported in several animal species around the world, usually animals that come in close contact with infected humans, officials said. The USDA said the the risk of animals spreading the virus to people is low and doesn’t recommend routine testing for animals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The largest city in coastal Georgia is in talks about a new way to recycle glass that it’s burying in a landfill, even though it still accepts glass in recycling bins. WTOC-TV reported Savannah officials are in talks with Glass WRX SC, a South Carolina company that seeks to recycle glass into air and water filtration systems, road surfaces and prefabricated interior walls. The city stopped recycling glass more than five years ago after running out of users willing to accept the bulky material. It’s a common problem nationwide. Savannah still finds new users for paper, plastic and metals that it collects from all-in-one recycling bins. In 2020, about 25% of what the city collected from recycling bins, including about 1,000 tons of glass, were buried in the city landfill. Some of that was because materials were too contaminated for further use. City officials recently toured Glass WRX SC’s facility in Beaufort, South Carolina. One use is turning glass into rock-like water filters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines said a passenger assaulted one of its flight attendants in an unprovoked attack during a flight. The airline said the incident occurred shortly after flight HA152 left Honolulu for Hilo at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The flight attendant was walking down the aisle at the time. The pilot returned the plane to Honolulu. Deputy sheriffs assigned to the airport arrested a 32-year-old male passenger for third-degree assault based on information they received from the airline, said Toni Schwartz, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety. The FBI was investigating the matter, said agency spokesperson Joy Van Der Voort. Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson Alex Da Silva said the flight attendant was evaluated for injuries and released from work to rest. The flight took off again for Hilo at 9:09 a.m.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense is taking input on its plan to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho. The department began a 45-day comment period on Friday with the release of a draft environmental impact study evaluating alternatives for building and operating the microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. The department’s energy needs are expected to increase, it said. The draft environmental impact statement cited President Joe Biden’s Jan. 27 executive order prioritizing climate change considerations in national security as another reason for pursuing microreactors. The draft document said alternative energy sources such as wind and solar were problematic because they are limited by location, weather and available land area, and would require redundant power supplies.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford:The northern Illinois city that figured prominently in the movie “A League of Their Own” might be getting a museum of its own. The Rockford Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimously last week to grant a special-use permit to build a $10 million International Women’s Baseball Museum at Beyer Park on the city’s southeast side, the Rockford Register Star reported. The city and the league gained international fame in 1992 when the movie starring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna was released. At the park, Beyer Stadium was the actual home of the real Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 1950s. To put the museum on the site, the Rockford Park District, which owns Beyer Park, plans to sell an acre of land at the north end of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. The vote came after a group called Friends of Beyer Stadium urged the zoning board to find a different site for the museum – an effort the group said will continue as the issue moves to a Rockford City Council committee on Monday and the full council on Oct. 4.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:A beverage can company has started work on a factory in eastern Indiana where it expects to produce about 3.6 billion cans a year. A groundbreaking ceremony was held last week for the new aluminum can factory in Muncie that will be operated by Canpack, a subsidiary of the Polish company Giorgi Global. The factory is expected to ultimately employ about 340 people, according to the company. The new factory will help meet the demand for more beverage cans in the U.S., company executive Tom Johnson told The Star Press. Johnson said the company plans to start recruiting employees early next year and have the factory in operation by late 2022. Delaware County approved 15 years of property tax breaks for the new factory, while the state agreed to provide up to $6 million in tax credits and worker training grants.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: At least 16 people in eastern Iowa were charged with gun crimes after a two-day sweep by federal authorities this week. Grand juries met Wednesday through Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern Iowa and issued the indictments, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported. Many of those indicted have already been charged in state courts for weapons offenses. Most of the indictments were for felons in possession of a firearm or for having a firearm and using drugs.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said the state will adopt the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concerning Pfizer booster shots as part of the effort to fight COVID-19. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky ruled Thursday that people 65 and older, nursing home residents and those ages 50 and older who have chronic health problems such as diabetes should be offered a booster once they’re six months past their last Pfizer dose. Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release that she has authorized all COVID-19 vaccine providers to begin administering Pfizer booster shots to eligible Kansans as of Friday. Kelly said the CDC’s announcement “will provide additional protection to the most vulnerable Kansans and our frontline healthcare workers.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear called on the state’s residents Friday to honor a 15-year-old Fayette County student who died from COVID-19 by lighting porches with green lights. In a statement posted to social media, he also urged Kentuckians to “encourage vaccinations among friends and family and to mask up indoors.” Sophomore Christopher “C.J.” Gordon Jr. died from virus, Fayette County Superintendent Demetrus Liggins confirmed Thursday in a news release. Gordon’s mother, Renita Wright Gordon, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Gordon always put other people first and you rarely saw him “not smiling.” Earlier this month, a 15-year-old Shelby County student who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 before the school year began also died from the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: Next month, people can order firewood from the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Office and in the process help out the community and inmates. Sheriff Mark Wood has started a firewood project that can help recycle the many trees felled by recent hurricanes and winter storms. Priority for the wood will go to elderly and disabled residents of the parish, but anyone can buy up to two ricks beginning Oct. 1. Each rick costs $60, and sales are handled with money orders only. Wood told The Town Talk the object isn’t to make a lot of money through the venture. Some of the proceeds will go toward the upkeep of chainsaws and log splitters, and some will go into the sheriff’s office Inmate Welfare Fund. Money from the fund is “used to purchase basketballs and other sports equipment and work clothes or work boots for those inmates who have an economic need,” according to a news release. Some inmates don’t have family to help them with things like shoes, he said. He said the fund can help provide that so inmates “can continue paying back their debts to society.” Residents interested in buying wood through the program can call (318) 709-8489 to check availability. The sheriff’s office also asks local tree surgeons or cutters to call them if they have hardwood trees needing disposal.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s wild blueberry growers had a bounce-back year this summer after struggling with low prices and small crops sizes in recent seasons. The only commercial-scale wild blueberry growers in the U.S. harvest the fruit in Maine, mostly in the rural Down East region. The 2020 crop was less than 48 million pounds, and that was the lowest number since 2004. But the 2021 season, which ended recently, appeared to be much better, said David Yarborough, emeritus professor of horticulture with the University of Maine. He said the crop was likely about 90 million pounds, which would be the most blueberries since 2016. Growers had a better year in part because of a cool, wet July, Yarborough said. Hot summers and droughts have hurt the crop in recent years. It was also a good season for pollinators, Yarborough said. Prices were also up to about 70 cents per pound to farmers, which would be an improvement of 10 cents from last year and more than twice the number from 2017, when prices cratered, he said. Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated blueberries, and they serve a slightly different niche in the market. Although many cultivated blueberries are sold fresh, the vast majority of the wild blueberry crop is frozen. The berries are also used extensively in processed food products.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials said two sewer discharges have released an unknown amount of sewage in residential neighborhoods. The City Department of Public Works issued a notice of the overflows Saturday. One occurred in the Reiserstown area northwest of downtown and affected the stream known as Gwynns Falls. The other happened in the Poplar Hill neighborhood north of downtown and impacted the stream known as Jones Falls. Officials urged people to avoid swimming or other contact with the impacted streams.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has won the endorsement of her former political rival and current office holder, Acting Mayor Kim Janey. Janey made the endorsement Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. In a statement, Janey said Wu has the record and values to protect and build upon the city’s progress in becoming more “equitable, just and resilient.” “Important policies like our housing agenda, equitable vaccine distribution, and how we handle mental health crises are on the line in this election,” said Janey. “Moreover, Black and brown residents who are most impacted by systemic inequities need a leader in City Hall who will center equity and inclusion in all her policies, and ensure they have a seat at the table when real decisions are made.” Wu was the top vote-getter in Sept. 14′s preliminary election. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George came in second and also advanced to the Nov. 2 general election, and three major contenders – City Councilor Andrea Campbell, Janey, and John Barros – were eliminated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said she will declare unenforceable a Republican-written budget provision that seeks to ban indoor mask requirements for children. The Democrat had been expected to block the language as unconstitutional since $55 billion in spending was unveiled and quickly passed by Michigan’s Legislature earlier this week. Spokesman Bobby Leddy confirmed this week’s move in a statement, calling the proposed restriction “dangerous.” The provision, which is not tied to spending, would prevent the state health director and local health officers from issuing or enforcing orders that require children under age 18 to wear a face covering. More than a dozen counties, including most of the state’s most populated ones, mandate masking in schools to curb COVID-19. Various K-12 districts in other counties also require face coverings. The governor and GOP legislators did negotiate other language related to coronavirus vaccine exemptions and reporting requirements for epidemic orders.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State regulators launched a court-ordered process for assessing the risks to clean water from waste from the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine in northeastern Minnesota. The Department of Natural Resources announced plans for a trial-like proceeding known as a contested case hearing, which was ordered by the Minnesota Supreme Court in April. The hearing will be confined to the narrow question of whether the bentonite clay lining planned for the mine’s waste basin would be sufficient to keep pollution contained. A prehearing conference has been set for Nov. 1. An administrative law judge will later schedule the hearing itself, which will be a potentially lengthy proceeding in which all sides can present evidence and call witnesses before the neutral judge, who will report his findings back to the agency. The open pit mine and processing plant near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes would be Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine. Environmentalists have fought it because of the potential for acid mine drainage.PolyMet said the mine will be safe and that the project has undergone more than a decade of thorough, public environmental reviews.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will soon start rebuilding a section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, the head of the state Department of Transportation said. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on Sept. 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days. White said the area had received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than a day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers who want to halt all public funds to Planned Parenthood are recommending the Legislature give Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration authority to cancel abortion providers’ Medicaid contracts based on behavior in other states deemed illegal or unethical. The Senate Interim Committee on Medicaid Accountability and Taxpayer Protection approved a report with that recommendation on Thursday. Planned Parenthood is Missouri’s only abortion provider. Abortion providers are prohibited from using Medicaid funds for abortion except when the mother’s life is in danger or in the cases of rape or incest. Some lawmakers want to pull all public funds, including those for birth control, sexually transmitted disease treatments, cancer screenings and other health care for low-income women. Democrats warned that the move would trigger a confrontation with the federal government that could threaten the overall Medicaid program.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A therapeutic boarding school in northwestern Montana, which state inspectors learned had once made boys sleep outside in winter conditions without proper clothing as punishment, closed Friday. Staffers confirmed to the Montana State News Bureau on Tuesday that the 16-bed Wood Creek Academy near Thompson Falls was shutting down. A message had also been posted on the program’s website, which had been pulled down by Friday. Wood Creek Academy, a residential boarding school for boys ages 13 to 18, had been the subject of two complaints filed with the state within the past year and inspections uncovered other infractions. The state health department sent inspectors to the boarding school in January in response to a complaint. The inspection found two boys ran away from the school one morning in January and Wood Creek Academy staff waited for more than an hour before calling law enforcement. As punishment for running away, staff prohibited the boys from having any interaction with their peers for three days. Such punishment is prohibited under state regulations. The inspector reported the boys also were sent to sleep in shorts and T-shirts in tents as nighttime temperatures dipped as low as 28 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Authorities in south-central Nebraska said a teenage girl survived after a car she was driving collided with a train. The collision was so violent that her car’s engine was ejected. The crash happened Wednesday at a rural railroad crossing west of Kearney, the Kearney Hub reported. Buffalo County Sheriff’s officials said Sydney Conner, 17, was traveling north on a county road about 7:45 a.m. when her car collided with a westbound Union Pacific train. Sheriff’s Sgt. Ramey Ristine said investigators believe Connor was blinded by the rising sun as she approached the crossing and didn’t see the train. There are no crossing arms at that railroad intersection, but it is marked with stop signs.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A hospital in rural northeastern Nevada is pleading with residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to take other precautions to help slow the spread of the coronavirus to “keep our health care system from being overrun.” The Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital in Elko said Friday the virus was “running rampant”” in the region and that the hospital’s intensive care and medical-surgical units were near capacity and that it had postponed elective surgeries and added beds. “As a hospital staff, we are pleading with you to practice the precautions we know are effective in stopping COVID-19,” the hospital said in a statement posted on social media. “Avoid large gatherings, wear a mask when around people from outside your household, observe physical distancing, and practice good hand hygiene. Most importantly, please get vaccinated against COVID-19.” The hospital said wait times were longer than normal but that it was still able to safely provide medical care. “Please help us slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our healthcare system from being overrun,” the hospital said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former high school teacher accused of soliciting sexually explicit videos from a student for money and making and possessing child pornography has pleaded guilty to human trafficking and manufacturing child sex abuse images. Joshua Harwood, 38, of Manchester entered his pleas to the two felony counts on Wednesday, the Concord Monitor reported. Harwood had taught business at the high school, where he was hired in July 2020. Police were notified of the allegations involving a minor in December and Harwood was placed on administrative leave. He was later arrested and has been in jail since February. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for Oct. 19. On the trafficking charge, attorneys are recommending a sentence of 31/ 2 to seven years in jail, which may be suspended if Harwood completes a sex offender program. They’re recommending a consecutive sentence of 71/2 to 15 years, a portion of which may be suspended, for the manufacturing charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCherry Hill:The New Jersey craft beer scene took home a few big honors at this year's Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Among the 265 breweries awarded 290 medals from the Brewers Association were Mechanical Brewery of Cherry Hill, which took home the gold in the English mild or bitter category for its Momentum. Departed Soles Brewing Co. of Jersey City and Spellbound Brewing of Mount Holly each took home silver medals. The Jersey City brewery was honored in a gluten-free beer category for None Shall PATH, and the Mount Holly brewery won for its wood- and barrel-aged beer for Porter Aged on Palo Santo. The Great American Beer Festival honored beers in 97 categories spanning 175 styles in the 35th edition of its competition, with judging held across 17 days and 34 sessions, according to a news release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham visited southern New Mexico on Friday to talk with fellow elected Democratic leaders and business groups about economic development and to tour a military base near the U.S.-Mexico border where Afghan refugees are being housed. The Democrat’s visit was not made public until late in the afternoon. Her office said she walked through the processing area at Fort Bliss Army base, spoke with volunteers about the need for winter coats and other items for those at the facility and saw how the refugees were screened for COVID-19. “Whenever the federal government tells us they need our help, New Mexico is ready to help these families on their way,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement after the tour. There was no indication that Lujan Grisham visited the U.S.-Mexico border while in the area. She has faced criticism in recent months for not doing more to address the concerns of residents along the border amid the latest influx of immigrants.\n\nNew York\n\nHolbrook: Mourners began arriving at a Long Island funeral home viewing Sunday for Gabby Petito, whose death on a cross-country trip has sparked a manhunt for her boyfriend. A line had formed outside the funeral home in Holbrook, about 35 miles east of New York City, by noon, and groups of firefighters were seen filing past. A fire truck sat on each side of the building, each with its ladder raised. Across the street from the funeral home, a chain link fence was adorned with posters featuring Petito’s image and messages such as, “She touched the world.” Petito was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she didn’t respond to calls and texts for several days while she and Brian Laundrie visited parks in the West. Her body was discovered Sept. 19 in a remote area in northwestern Wyoming. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island but in recent years moved to Florida. Petito’s death has been classified as homicide, meaning she was killed by another person, but medical examiners in Wyoming haven’t disclosed how she died pending further autopsy results. The couple posted online about their trip in a white Ford Transit van converted into a camper. They got into a physical altercation Aug. 12 in Moab, Utah, that led to a police stop for a possible domestic violence case. Ultimately, police there decided to separate the quarreling couple for the night. But no charges were filed, and no serious injuries were reported. Investigators have been searching for Laundrie in Florida, and searched his parents’ home in North Port, about 35 miles south of Sarasota.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Authorities said a bank robber was caught after they determined he had taken his getaway vehicle for a test drive from a car dealer. The Raleigh-based U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that 68-year-old Glenn Alin Martinoff was sentenced to more than four years in prison on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to bank robbery. The news release said Martinoff entered a Wilmington bank in January wearing a mask and gloves and brandishing a large screwdriver. He robbed the location of more than $6,000, authorities said. Investigators using surveillance video determined his getaway car was for sale at a nearby dealership. The news release said that authorities found out he had taken the car for a test drive to use as his getaway car. The news release said investigators found the cash and clothing worn during the robbery during a search of his apartment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMakoti: The first car jumping attempt in five years by North Dakota’s version of Evil Knievel ended in disaster when the car driven by the man known as the Flying Farmer corkscrewed off the ramp and rolled. Authorities said John Smith, 57, was alert after the crash Saturday at a rural gravel pit and that he even tried to pull himself out of the car while talking to rescuers. He was eventually cut out and taken by a medical helicopter to a hospital, according to firefighters. The extent of his injuries wasn’t known. The crowd of about 300 spectators went silent when Smith crashed. Family members, including his daughters and wife of 34 years, Melinda, reacted emotionally, running to the mangled car, The Bismarck Tribune reported. Smith’s previous jump was in 2016, when he rose over towering flames to clear a burning trailer. Smith, who farms near Makoti, in western North Dakota, said he was inspired by the motorcycle daredevil Knievel while growing up. He has gained notoriety for his jumps at fairs and other attractions across the state. He has performed more than 100 jumps, even jumping on a frozen lake.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine’s top lobbyist, a man linked to an ongoing federal bribery investigation but never charged, resigned Friday after three years on the job. Legislative Director Dan McCarthy cited “the pace and grind” of the job and referred to predecessors who warned him against serving more than two years. “I know I’ve run quite a bit over my two year commitment but I think now is the right time to resign as your Legislative Director,” McCarthy wrote in his letter to DeWine. Federal prosecutors charged five individuals last year, including the then-House speaker, with orchestrating a $60 million bribery scheme to assure the 2019 passage of a bill bailing out two nuclear power plants. Prosecutors said the scheme also involved killing efforts to put a petition on the ballot to overturn the bailout. The power plants were operated at the time by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp. McCarthy is a former FirstEnergy lobbyist who was president of one of the dark money groups, Partners for Progress, which has been implicated in the alleged bribery scheme. McCarthy has said his actions were legal and DeWine’s office has said it has no indication McCarthy is a target of the investigation, which continues.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOkmulgee: Muscogee Nation voters have approved press protections for their tribe’s news enterprise. Citizens voted 1,914-596 last week to amend the tribe’s constitution to include press protections and mandate funding for Mvskoke Media, Indian Country Today reported. Although freedom of the press is guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, many tribal nations lack such language in their constitutions. The Muscogee amendment allows the tribe’s news enterprise – which includes print, broadcast and digital operations – to operate “free from political interest or undue influence, harassment, censorship, control or restrictions from any department” of the tribe’s government. The effort traces to 2015, when the tribe passed the Free Press Act establishing independent media. Its governing body later repealed the law during an emergency meeting. Last year, tribal leaders unanimously restored the press freedoms by passing the Independent Muscogee (Creek) Press Act, which was viewed as a positive step.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: A school board has banned educators from displaying Black Lives Matter and gay pride symbols, prompting a torrent of recriminations and threats to boycott the town and its businesses. Newberg, a town of 25,000 residents situated 25 miles southwest of Portland in gorgeous wine country, has become an unlikely focal point of a fight between the left and right across the nation over schooling. The City Council has condemned the action by the Newberg School Board. So did members of color of the Oregon Legislature and House and Senate Democrats. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon is threatening to sue. The Oregon State Board of Education called on the school board to reverse course, saying student identities should be welcomed and affirmed. But the four conservative members of the seven-member board are digging in their heels. Member Brian Shannon, who proposed the ban, said lawmakers from Portland should keep out of the school district’s business and instead focus on Portland, where homelessness is an issue.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has joined a federal investigation of Pennsylvania’s largest pension fund and is seeking among other things records to determine whether improper “compensation and gifts” might have been offered staff, a newspaper reported. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the commission is also seeking records earlier sought by the U.S. attorney’s office about what officials of the $64 billion Public School Employees’ Retirement System have called a mistake in calculating the fund’s long-term investment performance. The newspaper reported that the subpoena given to the school pension plan Friday was the first indication that investigators are looking into possible presents or money from investment advisers and consultants. State employees are forbidden from accepting such gifts under a ban imposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. The Securities and Exchange Commission pursues civil rather than criminal complaints and has broad power to impose fines, discipline financial players and order changes. Pension fund system spokesperson Steve Esack said Saturday that the fund had no comment on the SEC action, the newspaper said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The man authorities sid leads the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club has turned down a plea deal that would have sent him to prison for five years, and will now take his chances at trial. Joseph Lancia, 30, of Smithfield told a judge Thursday that he would rather go to trial, WPRI-TV reported. He faces multiple criminal counts stemming from two incidents. In one case, he is charged with shooting at a truck in June 2019 being driven by a former Hells Angels prospect with whom he had a dispute. He is charged with felony assault and battery in that case. He is also charged with knocking someone unconscious with a punch outside a Providence strip club in March 2020. Prosecutors initially offered a deal that came with eight years in prison, but after speaking with the judge, the sentence was lowered to five. Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney said if Lancia is found guilty at trial on all counts, he faces 61 years behind bars. Lancia, who is out on bail, refused to comment outside of court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. George: State transportation officials want to hear from the public about a project to widen part of Interstate 26 and improve one of the state’s key interchanges. The state is spending $19 million on preliminary engineering work to widen 22 miles of I-26 in Orangeburg, Berkeley and Dorchester counties. The project also will modernize I-26’s interchange with Interstate 95. The tight, curving off ramps often cause backups. The Department of Transportation is accepting comments about the project until Oct. 10 on its website. The project from Exit 165 to Exit 187 on I-26 will also improve interchanges and take other steps to make the highway safer. It is also part of a larger plan to have three lanes in each direction on I-26 from Charleston to Columbia by the end of the decade.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A Missouri-based battery manufacturer has selected Rapid City for a factory complex that it said could employ up to 1,500 people. AEsir Technologies plans to construct four buildings. The first building will be a 150,000-square-foot manufacturing and distribution center capable of producing 1.2 million batteries annually. The company initially plans to hire 400 employees and expand to 1,200 to 1,500 employees. The first phase will cost about $90 million, with a total price tag of $300 million when all four phases of the development are finished, according to CEO Randy Moore. The company looked for an available labor force, an economic development incentive package and community support when searching for the ideal location for the new facility, Moore said. Twenty other communities were considered for the facility. Moore said easy access to rail, a state highway and Rapid City Regional Airport were also factors in the company’s decision to choose Rapid City. AEsir Technologies manufactures nickel zinc batteries that Moore said are two to three times more powerful than lithium ion batteries and last just as long. He said they use potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, an active ingredient in soaps and shampoos, which makes the batteries environmentally friendly.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Tennessee Supreme Court Justice Cornelia Clark has died at the age of 71, the court announced Friday. She had been diagnosed with cancer. According to a news release, Clark died overnight after 16 years in her role, serving the longest tenure of her counterparts on the court while she was on the bench for more than 1,100 Supreme Court cases. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who will select Clark’s replacement, called her a “trailblazer for women in the legal profession.” Clark was appointed to her seat in 2005 by former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and served as chief justice from 2010 to 2012. Chief Justice Roger Page said Clark, better known as Connie, “loved the Tennessee judicial system and has made it better in immeasurable ways.” All but one of the remaining justices – Sharon Lee, whom Bredesen also appointed – were appointees of former Gov. Bill Haslam, signaling a likely shift further rightward for the court with an appointment by Lee. The Governor’s Council for Judicial Appointments will recommend three candidates to the governor, who will make his pick. The Legislature must confirm the selection.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:A group of 14 Mexican soldiers was detained Saturday after inadvertently crossing the border at the Bridge of the Americas in El Paso, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said. The soldiers were returned to Mexico after being detained by CBP for about 5 hours. One of the soldiers was issued a civil fine for being in possession of a personal-use amount of marijuana, CBP said. The incident occurred shortly after midnight Saturday when CBP officers saw two Mexican military vehicles cross the international border line on the middle of the bridge, CBP said. The bridge is also known as Puente Internacional Córdova de las Américas and as the Puente Libre, or free bridge, because there is no bridge toll charge. CBP officers approached the military trucks and temporarily detained the soldiers and secured their weapons and equipment. Photos shared on social media showed soldiers sitting on the asphalt and a military pickup stopped near the CBP checkpoints at the foot of the bridge on the El Paso side. The soldiers told CBP that they did not realize they had entered U.S. territory. CBP contacted Mexican military leadership who soon arrived at the international bridge. Shortly before 5 a.m., all the soldiers, equipment and vehicles were returned to Mexico, CBP said. Similar border incidents have occurred over the years, often involving Mexican soldiers or federal police from other parts of Mexico who cross the borderline into the U.S. at the middle of the international bridges in El Paso.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The home arena of the NBA’s Utah Jazz announced Friday that it will require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test for all fans over the age of 12. Vivint Smart Home Arena, located in Salt Lake City, will require fans to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event to enter the venue. Employees who work at the arena are required to be fully vaccinated. “As a community gathering place, we have a responsibility to protect our guests by putting health and safety standards in place,” Jim Olson, president of Vivint Arena and the Utah Jazz, said in a statement. “We believe this is the path forward to shut down this pandemic.” Guests under the age of 12 will be allowed inside the arena if they wear a mask at all times. Other guests are strongly encouraged to wear a face mask, but it is not mandatory.\n\nVermont\n\nWilliston: Three people were sent to a hospital with nonlife-threatening complaints Friday after being exposed to bear spray at a local hotel, the Williston Fire Department said. Emergency crews were sent to a local inn about 10:30 a.m. Friday after receiving a report that four employees were having difficulty breathing. The investigation determined a can of bear attack deterrent was left in one of the second floor rooms where it was accidentally discharged by housekeeping staff. Bear spray is stronger than police pepper spray. Officials said 30 people in the hotel were evacuated. Three people were taken to a hospital and a fourth was treated at the hotel and released. The firefighters ventilated the building. Occupants and staff of the hotel were able to reoccupy the building shortly after noon.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has announced plans for a new performing arts center funded by a $50 million donation. University President Jim Ryan said the gift is being made by Tessa Ader. The news release said the new center for dance, concerts, theater and other performances will be in the area known as the Emmet-Ivy corridor. “My late husband, Richard, and I long felt that a state-of-the-art performing arts center was needed by the University of Virginia,” Ader said in a statement to The Daily Progress. “I believe this new facility will be a wonderful asset to our community and am hopeful my gift will encourage others to come forward as well to make it a reality.” Although designs haven’t been completed, the university said the center will include a concert hall with more than 1,000 seats, a 150-seat recital hall and rehearsal studios. The center will also hold national touring artists. “The performing arts center will be a place that celebrates the arts as fundamental to the human condition, a university education and a democratic society,” Ryan said in the news release.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An administrative law judge has recommended that a Native American tribe in Washington state once again be allowed to hunt gray whales – a major step in its decadeslong effort to resume the ancient practice. “This is a testament to what we’ve been saying all these years: that we’re doing everything we can to show we’re moving forward responsibly,” Patrick DePoe, vice chairman of the Makah Tribe on the remote northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula, said Friday. “We’re not doing this for commercial reasons. We’re doing it for spiritual and cultural reasons.” DePoe was in high school in the late 1990s when the Makah were last allowed to hunt whales – occasions that drew angry protests from animal rights activists, who sometimes threw smoke bombs at the whalers and sprayed fire extinguishers into their faces. Since then, the tribe’s attempts have been tied up in legal challenges and scientific review. A federal appeals court ruled in 2002 that the Makah needed a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act; the tribe applied for one in 2005 but still hasn’t received one. On Thursday, nearly two years after he presided over a hearing on NOAA Fisheries’ proposal to approve the waiver, administrative law Judge George Jordan issued his 156-page recommendation to the U.S. Department of Commerce, finding that the tribal hunts would have no effect on the healthy overall population of the whales. The recommendation, along with a public comment period and further environmental analysis, will inform the department’s final decision, though no timeline for that has been set. As proposed, the waiver would allow the tribe to land up to 20 Eastern North Pacific gray whales over 10 years, with hunts timed to minimize the low chances of the hunters accidentally harpooning an endangered Western North Pacific gray whale.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is urging residents who got the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to get their booster shot, citing the rising number of hospitalizations involving vaccinated people. There were 16,223 active COVID-19 cases reported statewide on Friday, with 1,008 people being treated in a hospital, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. The number of fully vaccinated people who have been hospitalized has increased 20%, Justice said. “That tells us there’s a growing need, more and more and more, for people that are fully vaccinated to get their booster shot,” he said. He said booster shots are available, for the most part, for people age 18 and over who had their second Pfizer shot at least six months ago. Booster shots are not yet available for other vaccines. Justice also pleaded again for the unvaccinated to get the vaccine. He said 3,700 doses have been given since the last update, but that’s not enough. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia ranks last among the states in doses administered per 100,000 population.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:North America’s oldest polar bear living in human care at the Milwaukee County Zoo has died, zoo officials said Saturday. The Journal Sentinel reported 36-year-old Snow Lilly was euthanized Friday because of her declining health and subsequent quality of life concerns. According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the median life expectancy for polar bears in human care is about 23 years. A recent wellness exam found Snow Lilly had heart disease and was undergoing other age-related changes, the release said. Snow Lilly came to the Milwaukee County Zoo in 2005 from the Bronx Zoo. “Snow Lilly was a visitor favorite at the Zoo and considered one of the iconic animals in the population,” said Zoo Director Amos Morris in a statement. “She will be sorely missed by both staff and visitors.” In recent years, the zoo called on Snow Lilly to stand in for a groundhog and usher in spring at a Groundhog’s Day celebration in 2018. She also shared a birthday with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich. A necropsy will be performed, as important information can continue to be collected from it and help other polar bears living in human care. Final necropsy results will be forthcoming in the upcoming months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Kristi Gabriel, 42, who survived a brush with death with COVID-19 but also lost her father and aunt to the disease, is pleading for the public to get vaccinated. “Even though I’ve gone through what I’ve gone through, some of my family still doesn’t agree with the vaccine,” she said. “And it’s shocking. It’s difficult to try to explain things to them. … I know there is a lot of misleading information out there and I know sources are trying to cut down on that, but you can’t eliminate them all. It’s unbelievable some of the fictitious stuff that’s out there and people are buying into.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/01/derby-goats-aubrey-plaza-penguin-protest-news-around-states/39428001/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A nonprofit organization has been formed to help support the state’s parks. Officials say the Alabama State Parks Foundation will raise money through donations to help improve park facilities and programs. The group’s website promotes contributions to help build cabins and trails, plus provide scholarships for youth campers. Most of the $40 million budget for the 22-park system comes from visitor fees, and donations will supplement funding for improvements. Voters three years ago approved a constitutional amendment to protect funding for the park system after money was shifted to other state agencies. Some parks had closed, and maintenance projects were delayed. Dan Hendricks of Florence is serving as president of the foundation.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Residents of the Aleutian Islands are planning to bring home indigenous remains removed from burial sites nearly a century ago. The Anchorage Daily News reports officials on the remote chain of islands stretching out from southwest Alaska are working on a three-year plan to recover the remains, held by the Smithsonian Institution, of more than 175 people from 11 islands. Researchers say some of the remains are up to 3,000 years old. Mark Snigaroff, president of the tribe on Atka, says officials plan to bury the first group of remains on Shemya this summer. They plan to bury the rest in 2020 and 2021. University of Kansas researchers also will collect genetic material from the bones before the remains are returned.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport set a new passenger-traffic record in March. The month is always extremely busy at Sky Harbor, as warm weather and spring training lure visitors to the Valley of the Sun. But more than 4.5 million passengers arrived at and departed from Sky Harbor this March, breaking the record set just a year ago. That figure represented growth of 3.3% over last year’s number of travelers. The airport reports it typically sees about 120,000 passengers daily. That number grew to 146,000 daily in March 2019. The increase also means that passenger traffic is up 3% year over year in the first three months of 2019. In a statement, Mayor Kate Gallego said the figures show the strong demand for travel to and from Phoenix.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Nearly three decades after the state became one of the first to cap how long someone can serve in the Legislature, lawmakers may find out next year just how far voters are willing to go to limit their time in office. Arkansas legislators are sending voters a proposal that would rework the term limits on House and Senate members for the second time in the past several years. It’s a pre-emptive strike against another proposal a group is trying to put on the 2020 ballot that would impose the strictest term limits in the U.S. Arkansas currently caps lawmakers’ time in office at 16 years under an amendment that voters approved in 2014 loosening limits that were imposed in the 1990s. It’s one of 15 states with legislative term limits.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former first lady Michelle Obama and a host of celebrities will join thousands of students to celebrate college signing day at UCLA this year. Obama, Conan O’Brien, Kelly Rowland, Bebe Rexha, Jesse Williams, Usher, Pentatonix, La La Anthony, Don Cheadle, and other entertainers and athletes are slated to gather on the UCLA campus Wednesday to commemorate the day that high school students choose to pursue higher education. This will mark Obama’s sixth college signing day that she has celebrated with Reach Higher. As first lady, Obama used the Reach Higher initiative to inspire high school students to continue their education by attending college or a training program or by joining the military.\n\nColorado\n\nGranada: A University of Denver team is using drone images to create a 3D reconstruction of a World War II-era Japanese internment camp in southern Colorado. Researchers last week used the drone from the Switzerland-based company senseFly as part of a mapping project to help future restoration work at Camp Amache in Granada. From 1942 to 1945, more than 7,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants were forcibly relocated to Camp Amache. They were among the 110,000 Japanese-Americans ordered to camps throughout the U.S. The Amache effort is part of a growing movement to identify and preserve U.S. historical sites connected to people of color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The entity overseeing distribution of state funds to help homeowners with crumbling foundations has ceased authorizing new foundation construction work until it receives a payment from the state Department of Housing. Michael Maglaras, superintendent of the Connecticut Foundation Solutions Indemnity Company Inc., announced the suspension Monday. Maglaras said the captive insurance company determined it “cannot in good faith approve any new Participation Agreements” without the funds, given its commitments. There are 80 homes in the construction pipeline. The State Bond Commission, chaired by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, released $20 million to the housing agency April 2.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: When Aubrey Plaza served lunch to those in need at Emmanuel Dining Room on Monday afternoon, none of the hungry men, women or children recognized the actress from her starring television and film roles. However, they clearly recognized her efforts, along with a team of 10 youth from Delaware 4-H, who served plates of baked ziti, string beans and cookies to 169 people seeking a hot meal. The “Parks and Rec” star, who was in town visiting her family over the weekend, is the national Service Ambassador for youth organization 4-H. As a young girl, she volunteered at the Ministry of Caring’s nearby child care center and the Mary Campbell Center, a home for adults and children with disabilities. “I really wanted to come back to the places where I used to go,” Plaza said, recalling dressing up as the Easter Bunny some years and taking photos with children.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the district and a police officer over the search of a yard belonging to a woman who made negative comments about police. The Washington Post reports the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit Monday against the District of Columbia and Officer Joseph Gupton. The lawsuit accuses officers of unlawfully searching Denise Price’s yard last May as retaliation for her critical comments about police. Price’s son was killed in a crash with a police car earlier that month. Police have said the officers were chasing a man and thought he threw a gun into Price’s yard, which they then searched without a warrant. Video shows them finding nothing. Police say the officers didn’t know Price owned the yard.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A bill that expands state anti-hazing law has been sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis by the Legislature on a unanimous vote. The House voted 114-0 on Tuesday for the measure making people who organize hazing culpable if someone is seriously injured or dies, even if the organizer didn’t participate in the event. It also prohibits hazing of former members of fraternities or other organizations. Current law addresses pledges and active members. The vote came after the parents of Andrew Coffey made a tearful plea in support of the bill. The 20-year-old Florida State University student died of alcohol poisoning in November 2017 at an off-campus fraternity party. The bill provides immunity for the first person who calls 911 to get help for a hazing victim or provides immediate aid.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A new historic marker honors a woman who helped maintain peace and fair trade between the Creek Indian nation and what was then the new colony of Georgia. The Savannah Morning News reports that the marker describes Mary Musgrove, interpreter for Gen. James Oglethorpe from 1733 to 1743. Musgrove’s mother was Creek and her father English. She established a trading post after marrying John Musgrove in 1717. The marker in Lafayette Square was dedicated Friday. Joy Daniel Schwartz of the Colonial Dames of America says Musgrove was a colony founder but until now didn’t have a marker in Savannah’s historic district. One erected in 1961 on Savannah Sugar Refining Co. grounds is about a mile from Musgrove’s trading post and notes that her Indian name was “Cousaponakeesa.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Hybrid electric planes will be put to the test by a Hawaii airline hoping to use them for short-haul commercial flights. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Mokulele Airlines and Los Angeles-based aircraft design firm Ampaire plan to test a model hybrid on Mokulele’s Maui route in September or October. The companies say a hybrid plane would provide lower operational costs as well as additional routes and more frequent flights. Hawaii is a good fit for the service because communities rely on short-haul flights to travel between islands. The collaboration will include the loan of Mokulele’s pilots and hangar space at Kahului Airport on Maui to Ampaire. Officials say Mokulele was acquired in February by Southern Airways, but the partnership with Ampaire will continue.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is seeking to intervene on the side of the federal government after four conservation groups asked a judge to immediately halt drilling, mining and other activities to protect sage grouse habitat in seven Western states. Idaho and Utah filed documents in U.S. District Court late last week seeking to defend a plan put forward by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The conservation groups in a lawsuit filed in March say the plan weakens an earlier version put forward by the Barack Obama administration in 2015. The conservation groups early last week asked a judge to block the Trump administration plan altogether in Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, California and Oregon. Idaho Gov. Brad Little says preserving sage grouse is best accomplished with a collaborative process.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The nation’s capital may be famous for its cherry blossom season, but the Windy City will have one of its own this year too. The Chicago Tribune reports about 160 young flowering cherry trees planted near the Museum of Science and Industry are mature enough to put on a show this spring. The trees were planted in 2013 in honor of the 120th anniversary of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The blooms are expected to be at their peak during the first or second week of May. The Chicago Park District plans to offer status updates on its website. Chicago Park District Operations Support Manager Karen Szyjka says the cherry trees in Jackson Park are the largest collection in the Chicago area and were planted for the Japanese practice of cherry blossom viewing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s court system has reached a new milestone with the creation of Indiana’s 100th problem-solving court. The recent certification of a veterans’ treatment court in Pulaski County means the state now has 100 courts that specialize in handling issues that include drug treatment, veterans, mental health and domestic violence. Pulaski County Judge Crystal Kocher says she’s proud that the new veterans’ court has been certified for her rural county. She says its creation “highlights the need and possibilities for rural communities around the state to provide comprehensive services.” Fifty Indiana counties are now served by a problem-solving court, and several more such courts are in the planning stages.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Half a dozen people dressed as penguins to ask Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang about climate change Sunday at a Franklin Junior High town hall event. The costumed questioners were there on behalf of Bold Iowa, a Democratic group founded by former state lawmaker Ed Fallon that organizes around climate change and environmental protection. The penguin outfits were a response to a Yang quote from another campaign event where he said that “people with financial struggles have the attitude that the penguins can wait in line.” Activists asked Yang to make climate change his top priority. Yang responded that climate change is important but that helping people with financial needs, through his plan to give all citizens a basic income, is the way to start fixing it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers have tightened the financial requirements for a license to operate nursing homes. The move comes after state regulators were forced to take over 22 struggling nursing homes last year. Officials with the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services told The Kansas City Star they had no choice to step in because nursing home managers had fallen behind on bills for basics like food and utilities, putting the health and safety of residents at risk. The Legislature passed a bill requested by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration requiring much more financial information from people applying for nursing home licenses. Under the new law, applicants must show they have enough working capital for the first 12 months of operations.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: All eyes are on the racehorses during Kentucky Derby Week. But in barns on the backside of Churchill Downs, you might find a behind-the-scenes animal napping in a horse’s stall – goats. There’s Lily, who gets in trouble for eating flowers and is known for head-butting people who stop scratching her. And there’s her pal Roxanne, whose horns get painted pink for the Kentucky Oaks and who has a sixth sense for knowing which horses are running. You might see Trevor, the ornery, one-horned goat, who some say likes to eat Doritos. And, if you’re lucky, you’ll spot Oliver and Max, the baby goat duo, sprinting around – maybe even with a stuffed jockey on one of their backs. Goats, their owners say, can serve as companions for a nervous thoroughbred, making for a soothing presence in the stall.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Army Corps of Engineers says the rising Mississippi River could result in the unprecedented reopening of a historic flood control structure. Spokesman Rickey Boyett tells WVUE-TV there’s a real chance the Corps might have to reopen the Bonnet Carre Spillway, which was closed April 11. Boyett says it’s never been opened twice in one year. The National Weather Service says the river is expected to reach 16.9 feet May 11 at a New Orleans gauge where 17 feet generally corresponds with a spillway opening. The spillway is opened to relieve stress on New Orleans levees when the Mississippi flows at 1.25 million cubic feet per second, fast enough to fill the Superdome in less than two minutes.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Fishing managers on the East Coast are beginning the daunting process of implementing new restrictions on lobster fishing that are designed to protect a vanishing species of whale. A team organization by the federal government recommended last week that the number of vertical trap lines in the water be reduced by about half. The lines can entrap and drown the North Atlantic right whale, which number a little more than 400 and have declined by dozens this decade. The interstate Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission met on Monday to discuss the implementation of the new rules, which are designed to reduce serious injuries and deaths for whales by 60%. Colleen Coogan, who coordinates the federal government team designed to protect the whales, says cooperating with Canadian authorities will be key.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The first black woman to serve as American University’s student government president is seeking more than $1.5million in court-ordered damages against a neo-Nazi website operator who orchestrated an online harassment campaign against her. In a court filing Monday, Salisbury native Taylor Dumpson’s attorneys asked a federal judge in Washington for a default judgment against The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower who racially harassed Dumpson on Twitter. Dumpson sued Anglin and the internet troll last April, but neither responded. Dumpson graduated from Wicomico High School. She seeks a total of more than $1.8 million in damages, including $1.5 million in punitive damages against Anglin and his company.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: Student pranksters at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have struck again, drawing inspiration from America’s hottest movie. MIT students over the weekend draped the university’s signature Great Dome with a giant cloth version of Captain America’s red, white and blue shield. Their efforts drew a Twitter “Very cool!” from actor Chris Evans, the Massachusetts native who plays Captain America in Marvel films including current smash hit “Avengers: Endgame.” The shield went up Saturday night and was taken down Monday morning. MIT students have for generations centered similar pranks, which they call “hacks,” on the dome. A realistic police cruiser was placed on the dome in 1994. In 1999, it was decked out to look like R2D2, the robot from “Star Wars.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Moose are thriving at Isle Royale National Park, but the trees on which they feast are paying a heavy price, scientists say. An estimated 2,060 of the lumbering beasts roam the island wilderness, according to a report by Michigan Technological University researchers who spend weeks there each winter observing the relationship between moose and the wolves that prey on them. The moose number is believed to be the highest since 1995, when the total exceeded 2,400, only to plummet to about 500 within two years because of harsh winters, a shortage of food and a drop-off of wolves that previously had culled the herd. Conditions are similar now, although it’s uncertain how the moose population will respond, scientists said. Its growth is likely to slow at least somewhat in the coming year, says Sarah Hoy, an assistant research professor.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A proposal to rename a state park on the St. Croix River after former Vice President Walter Mondale has been dropped after strong opposition from local residents. House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler proposed renaming Interstate Park after Mondale, who helped preserve the St. Croix and other waterways as a U.S. senator in the 1960s by sponsoring the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. When residents in the area pushed back, Winkler turned to St. Croix Park. But more than 1,800 people signed a petition opposing the name change. Rep. Nathan Nelson says many of his constituents admire and respect Mondale but don’t want to change the St. Croix name that was given in the 1930s. The Star Tribune says Winkler will instead focus on naming a trail, scenic overlook or visitor center in the parks after Mondale.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: If you’re over 50 and looking for love in the Magnolia State, you’re probably in the worst place possible. A recent study by TheSeniorList has ranked Mississippi dead last on “The Best States for Finding Love After 50” list using the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau on marital status and income. Baby boomers only have about a 44.5% chance of finding love here, according to the study. The ranking was determined based on three factors: How many 50+ singles exist in each state, including those divorced, widowed or never married? How many of those singles have a median income of at least $50,000, giving them financial means to date? And which way is the senior single scene trending – up or down? Mississippi only has 13.7% singles over 50; 43% have income over $50,000; and the change in singlehood has only increased 2% since 2012.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Hoax alert: The Missouri Department of Conservation says it is not planning to ban mushroom hunting on public lands and is not considering implementing a license for the activity. The department is responding to a social media post that includes the agency’s logo. It shows a fake statement attributed to the agency that claims the state is banning mushroom hunting on public hunting grounds, including those around lakes. And it says it’s legal to hunt for mushrooms on private land without a permit. It also says the state is considering implementing a $50 license for mushroom hunting, beginning Jan. 1. None of that is true. The wildlife department says the post is a hoax. In a post on Facebook, the agency asks the public to help dispel the rumor.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: This year’s state paddlefish season kicks off Wednesday with the opening of the Upper Missouri River section from Fort Benton downstream to Fort Peck Dam. Substantial flooding occurred around the Fred Robinson Bridge and in James Kipp Recreation Area this spring, so camping will be considered “primitive” for most of the paddlefish season as crews clean up and fix damaged infrastructure. The access road and public boat ramp at the James Kipp Recreation Area is fully operational. Access and camping areas on the north side of the river, including Slippery Ann, Jones Island and Rock Creek campground, are reportedly in good shape. The Rock Creek boat ramp is also fully functional. Anglers who did not participate in the paddlefish harvest tag drawing can still purchase an Upper Missouri River Paddlefish Snag and Release License online, at an FWP office or at any license provider.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Native American education advocates say the state’s proposed social studies standards fall short of teaching a comprehensive history of Native Americans. The Omaha World-Herald reports the newly formed Nebraska Indian Education Association is raising concerns about the statewide standards unveiled last month. The Nebraska Department of Education is seeking public input on the drafted education guidelines. The group wants the standards to better disprove misconceptions and emphasize local tribes. They say schools should teach about tribal sovereignty and Indian science and horticulture. They also want the state to teach about the centuries before European settlement when their civilization thrived. State Board of Education President John Witzel acknowledges the proposed approach to Native American topics is “pretty general” and says there’s time to make changes.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Some Clark County commissioners have voiced general support for considering firearm restrictions on the Las Vegas Strip if state lawmakers give them the power to create stricter gun laws. The county would be given such power under an omnibus gun bill moving through the Democrat-controlled Legislature despite widespread opposition from Republicans and gun rights groups. Some commissioners say state law prevented the body from enacting gun regulations following the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The gunman attacked a 2017 Las Vegas music festival and used bump stocks to mimic the firing rate of an automatic firearm. Nevada is one of the few states in which the Legislature meets every other year, so the move under consideration could extend the window for conversation about firearm issues.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHopkinton: The 130-year-old Contoocook Covered Railroad Bridge, believed to be the oldest surviving bridge of its type, is getting a face-lift. The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources said the bridge was to be stained and receive minor repairs starting Tuesday. The bridge spans the Contoocook River at the junction of Routes 103 and 127. The project is expected to last several weeks but not affect vehicle traffic. It was built for the Concord and Claremont railroad and served rail traffic until 1960. It was listed to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The project is funded through the Conservation and Heritage License Plate Program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMillburn: The Millburn High School robotics team didn’t start off strong, but after four days of competing, with a robot that shot balls at targets, the 11-member team took the top prize in the VEX Robotics World Championship. Bryan Levine, the senior captain of the Essex County school team, said his group lost the first two of the 11 rounds of competition but rallied to win eight of the next nine for the top spot. It’s the first New Jersey team to win the international competition. The 7405P Millburn Phreak Show team paired with a team from a school in Shanghai, China, to win two of three matches over a joint team composed of Shanghai and Beijing competitors. More than 30,000 competitors in 1,650 teams converged in Louisville, Kentucky, for the contest.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard has halted further oil and natural gas development on New Mexico trust lands near the Chaco Cultural National Historic Park that are considered sacred by many Native Americans. Confirmed Monday, the executive order places a drilling moratorium within a buffer zone surrounding Chaco Canyon and its ancient dwelling. The moratorium does not directly affect federal and private holdings. Garcia Richard visited the Navajo Nation to sign the moratorium. She calls it a huge step forward in safeguarding archaeological and cultural resources. Oil industry representatives say robust protections already are in place within the national park at Chaco Canyon and surrounding areas where archaeological surveys are required.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a ban of alcohol advertising on city property. The ban, which takes effect immediately, applies to bus shelters, newsstands, Wi-Fi kiosks and recycling kiosks. Venues currently permitted to sell alcohol, such as restaurants, stadiums and concerts halls, are exempt. Existing ads will also be allowed to remain until their contracts end. The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, says there are “far too many deaths related to alcohol.” The deputy mayor for health and human services, Dr. Herminia Palacio, says ads can influence how much people drink and how young they are when they start. A Metropolitan Transportation Authority ban on advertising alcohol beverages on all New York City buses and subway cars and in stations took effect in January 2018.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A bill heading to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk makes clear charities aren’t breaking the law by holding occasional casino “game nights” as fundraisers as long as they follow new restrictions. The House agreed 95-17 on Monday to changes the Senate made on legislation making legal what some nonprofits already have been doing. Bill supporters say enforcement of the current ban on these events has been uneven, and it would be better to allow nonprofits and some employers and trade associations to hold them, with alcoholic drinks permitted and prizes awarded by raffle. The bill still only applies east of Interstate 26 to comply with Cherokee casino agreements. Cooper vetoed a casino night measure in 2017, worried it could attract video poker. Lawmakers say those concerns have been addressed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a complex energy bill dealing with empty pockets in underground rock formations, though property rights advocates are likely to keep fighting. The cavities or voids are known as “pore space.” They belong to the surface owner, not the mineral owner. The Bismarck Tribune reports that certain landowners will no longer get compensated for the injection of oil-field wastewater into their pore spaces. Landowners also are barred from making claims that oil-field wastewater injected into a disposal well on adjacent land is migrating into their pore space. Burgum says the bill clarifies legal issues related to underground injection, which should boost the state’s energy industry. Opponents say it’s an unconstitutional taking of private property rights and will lead to lawsuits or a referral to voters.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s Department of Natural Resources says land that it’s purchasing to expand a nature preserve near Lake Erie will help protect more than 700,000 plants of the endangered Lakeside daisy species. The department says the purchase of 118 acres for $1,075,860 will increase Lakeside Daisy State Nature Preserve on the Marblehead Peninsula in Ottawa County to 137 acres. State officials say the preserve is home to the only natural population of the plant left in the state. The Lakeside daisy was listed as endangered in Ohio in 1980. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed it as federally threatened in 1988. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service grant will cover 75% of the cost, with the remainder coming from Ohioans’ donations from their state income tax refunds to state nature preserves.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEagletown: State alcohol regulators used modern technology in a recent investigation of an old-school illicit job: moonshining. The Oklahoman reports agents with Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission and the McCurtain County sheriff’s deputies busted a moonshine operation in Eagleton. Authorities say a man turned himself in last week on a felony charge of operating a whiskey still without a distiller’s license. ABLE Special Agent-in-charge Joe Daniels says the investigation started with a tip that an Eagleton-area convenience store was selling moonshine. Daniels said agents flew a drone over some nearby wooded property, where they spotted the illegal operation. Daniels says the Discovery Channel TV show “Moonshiners” has sparked a resurgence of the illegal enterprise.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in the city is plagued with long wait times for new patients. The average delay to see a primary care doctor is 67 days, according to agency data. It’s the second-worst in Oregon and much longer than most Portland-area VA clinics, where wait times average less than a month. For veterans who move to the Salem area after starting VA treatment elsewhere, the wait is far worse. It’s not uncommon for them to wait years for an appointment. More than 1,100 veterans are caught in this limbo – living in or near Salem and still waiting to see a Salem VA physician because they were assigned doctors elsewhere in the Northwest. VA officials acknowledge the long waits are embarrassing and attribute it to difficulty in recruiting doctors to the Salem clinic.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is getting an unexpected windfall, as internet sales tax revenues are coming in nearly four times above what had been projected for the current fiscal year. Revenue Department officials say the state estimated to collect $50 million from the tax on online transactions, but it’s looking like about $200 million will be remitted. The state two years ago imposed sales taxes on people who use online marketplaces to sell their wares. Pennsylvania is requiring businesses that don’t have a physical presence in the state to pay online sales taxes, under a divided U.S. Supreme Court decision issued last June. That ruling was considered a win for large retailers that maintain a presence in many states, as they generally had been collecting sales taxes on online purchases before the decision.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A report by the general treasurer finds that the state’s 35 locally run pension plans have close to $2.5 billion in unfunded obligations. The Providence Journal reports General Treasurer Seth Magaziner’s report found that almost two-thirds of the plans that provide retirement benefits to police, firefighters and other municipal employees are in “critical status,” meaning they have less than 60% of what they need to cover their liabilities. Providence leads the way with a $1 billion gap between its assets and its accumulated liabilities. The report also expresses concern about how much of some communities’ tax revenue is going to payments to pension plans, leading to the potential underfunding of other important budget priorities.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 4,000 educators and their supporters are planning to rally at the Statehouse on Wednesday under the banner of education reform. The event, organized by the network of teacher activists known as SC for Ed, is expected to be one of the largest teacher protests in South Carolina history. Teachers involved say the rally is necessary because their demands for a 10% salary increase, smaller class sizes and uninterrupted planning time have fallen on deaf ears. SC for Ed organized the protest after a 2019 education overhaul bill that would have provided better working conditions for teachers stalled last week in the state Senate. At least four school districts have canceled classes because so many teachers have requested to take the day off.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Students at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology have won two awards totaling $10,000 in prize money for an invention they say may improve vehicle fuel efficiency by up to 10%. The Rapid City Journal reports that sophomores Mark Rotert and John Parker Chandler IV won a combined $5,000 Friday after pitching their vortex generator, TwisTech, in the governor’s Giant Vision competition. They also won another $5,000 prize from the college last month for the invention to reduce drag on vehicles. The students used a 3D printer to manufacture prototypes of the pocket-sized device. They say they’ve tested it on their personal cars and used simulation software to test a digital model. They say the invention yielded a 10% improvement in fuel consumption on sedan-style cars and a 7% improvement on semi-trucks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Kid Rock is quite literally raising a middle finger in Music City. Rock, who lives in the White’s Creek neighborhood, commissioned an artist to install a giant middle finger sculpture on his property, Taste of Country reports. The outlet points to Ted Pelkey of Westford, Vermont, who installed a wooden sculpture shaped like a hand flipping the bird on his property. The finger caught the attention of Rock, who reportedly contacted Pelkey to see if he could help Rock get a similar statue. In turn, Pelkey reached out to the artist who made his, and the artist agreed to make a second. Rock also recently made headlines when the sign for his new Lower Broadway steakhouse and bar was approved in January. The soaring 20-foot-tall neon sign is a giant guitar, the base of which is intentionally shaped like a woman’s buttocks.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State prison officials say the last written words of condemned inmates will no longer be shared publicly, marking another fresh change to execution day procedures in the nation’s busiest death chamber. The new policy Tuesday follows outrage by a state lawmaker who in 2011 also put a halt to Texas death row inmates choosing their final meals. State Sen. John Whitmire had chastised prison officials for reading an avowed racist’s final written statement after he was executed last week for the 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr., a black man. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice now says the agency will only publicly relay verbal statements made in the execution chamber. Texas prison officials last month also stopped allowing clergy in the death chamber.\n\nUtah\n\nDuchesne: A state park in east-central Utah has been renamed in honor of a former director of the Division of Parks and Recreation. A ribbon-cutting ceremony will be held May 7 at Fred Hayes State Park at Starvation, formerly Starvation State Park. After beginning his career with Parks and Recreation in 1982 as a seasonal ranger, Hayes rose through the ranks and served as division director from 2012 until 2018, the year he died. The park in Duchesne is named after 3,495-acre Starvation Reservoir. According to the park’s website, the origin of the previous name has been attributed to various legends, two involving a food cache stolen either by mountain men or by American Indians and another about livestock that perished due to hunger.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: It appears unlikely that testing of water at the state’s schools and day care centers for lead will happen this academic year. Vermont Public Radio reports lawmakers are having a difficult time deciding what lead level triggers remediation and how much state money should go toward the work. The Vermont Department of Health tested water in 16 schools last year and found all had traces of lead, with five schools showing levels high enough to require immediate action. A bill was introduced early in the session in the House to set up a water testing protocol for all schools and day care centers. The Senate later passed legislation that requires any school with lead levels above three parts per billion to switch out pipes or fixtures to remove the lead.\n\nVirginia\n\nCroaker: Howard Hankins was disappointed when he realized one of the presidential busts was missing from the collection on his farm, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The crumbling, oversized busts of 42 presidents – and a much smaller bust of Barack Obama – are all that remains of Presidents Park, the defunct open-air museum near Williamsburg where visitors once walked among the presidential heads. The park closed in 2010, and Hankins, who helped build it, offered to take the 18- to 20-foot heads and move them to his farm about 12 miles away. After a recent tour, he discovered the 2-foot-tall bust of Obama was missing. After a public appeal for its return, a mysterious caller arranged to return Obama. “He didn’t know what it meant to everybody,” Hankins says. “There is hope for people in this country. ... Here we go. Let’s unite. Maybe the whole world can do this.” Reservations for tours can be made via Facebook, by visiting the “Presidents Heads Walking Tour” page.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state budget approved this week includes $750,000 to study the impacts of the possible breaching of four Snake River dams to help salmon recovery. The Seattle Times reports the legislation calls for a neutral third party to develop a process for local, state, tribal, federal and other stakeholders to weigh in on issues that would surround a decision to breach the four federal dams. Chinook salmon are prime food for the endangered orcas that frequent Puget Sound, and a statewide dialogue had been proposed last year by a task force that Gov. Jay Inslee established. The two Republican members of Congress from eastern Washington, where the dams are located, oppose the state-financed effort as wasteful, saying the decision to remove the dams is up to the federal government.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: An annual fundraiser involving Marshall University ceramics students has raised a record $18,000 to help feed needy families. Marshall says in a news release that bowls made by students and other volunteers brought in more than $15,000 at the Empty Bowls event last month, while nearly $2,500 was raised at a silent auction. The fundraiser benefited the Facing Hunger Foodbank. The purchase of each bowl covered the cost of more than 100 meals. The Facing Hunger Foodbank serves more than 115,000 people annually in 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern Ohio.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: This Is It! is the longest-running gay bar in the state, and it’s paying homage to the important role it has played by becoming home to the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display since the project began 25 years ago. In doing so, This Is It! will also be able to open its doors to an 18-and-older crowd on select nights. “My late business partner, my current business partner and myself are dedicated to our history,” says This Is It! co-owner George Schneider. “It’s a win-win. We’re able not only to showcase this fantastic exhibit of LGBT history, and we can open the doors on select nights to our 18- to 21-year-old LGBT community.” The venue can admit people under 21 with a permanent visual art display that has cultural or historical significance, according to city law.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A U.S. Department of Justice report shows the state’s prison population grew the third fastest in the country in 2017. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the government figures released last week show the population in state prisons increased by 4.2% by the end of 2017. Wyoming’s prison growth was outpaced by Utah at 4.3% and Idaho at 5.1%. In Wyoming, 429 people per 100,000 were incarcerated that year. The national rate of state prison incarceration was 390 per 100,000 people. According to the report, Wyoming had about seven times more men than women in prisons. State prisons across the country had about 12 times more men than women. Prison populations in 29 states decreased by the end of 2017.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/02/22/preaching-vaccines-bonnet-scheme-water-news-around-states/115492470/", "title": "Preaching vaccines, bonnet scheme: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state health officer said Friday that he is cautiously optimistic about improving COVID-19 numbers but urged people to maintain precautions such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds. “This is the most optimistic we’ve been, I think, maybe since this all began,” Dr. Scott Harris said. Three major barometers of the pandemic’s severity – hospitalizations, daily new cases and coronavirus test percent positivity – have fallen to levels the state last saw in fall or summer. “We are not out of the woods, but we see how to get out of the woods. Please don’t stop doing the things that you are doing. This is not the time to ease up wearing your mask. It’s not the time to go be in large groups of people,” Harris said. The number of COVID-19 patients in Alabama hospitals Friday dipped below 1,000 for the first time since October. Harris said there may be increased immunity both from vaccinations and from temporary natural immunity in people who have been exposed to the virus. The end of the holiday season and related large gatherings likely also plays a part, he said. “Frankly, it has been a breath of fresh air for all of us in health care. This has been a tremendous burden for all of us,” said Dr. Sarah Nafziger, vice president for clinical services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said his administration will no longer respond to or participate in hearings led by state Sen. Lora Reinbold, telling the fellow Republican in a withering letter that she has used her position to “misrepresent” the state’s COVID-19 response and that her demands for information have gone beyond checks and balances and are “not based in fact.” “It is lamentable that the good citizens of Eagle River and Chugiak are deprived of meaningful representation by the actions of the person holding the office of Senator,” Dunleavy wrote in the letter dated Thursday. “I will not continue to subject the public resources of the State of Alaska to the mockery of a charade, disguised as public purpose.” Reinbold has criticized the governor for issuing pandemic-related disaster declarations while the Legislature was not in session and taken aim at health restrictions imposed by local governments, airlines and the Legislature, including mask requirements. On social media, Reinbold has accused the Dunleavy administration of being “wild” about “these experimental” COVID-19 vaccines, “bragging over 100,000 have gotten them in Alaska,” and characterized the administration as seeking disaster declarations to get mass vaccination clinics. Health officials say the vaccines are safe and effective, and no steps were skipped during the clinical trials.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state on Friday announced it would provide $100 million of federal funding to counties for coronavirus testing and related work. The state Department of Health Services said the $100 million initial allocation is being provided for staffing, laboratory testing “and other activities critical to combating COVID-19.” The announcement followed Pima County officials’ recent declaration that they might have to suspend testing as of Monday because of a lack of funding. Arizona received $418.9 million in January from the federal government for virus testing and related work and must submit a budget by mid-March to detail how it will spend the money, the department said. In addition to allocations to counties, the state will use some of the money for statewide testing programs, including testing done by Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, the department said. Of the $100 million to counties, $60.6 million is being sent to Maricopa County and $14.4 million to Pima County, which include most of metro Phoenix and most of the Tucson area, respectively.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of coronavirus cases in the state rose by more than 500 on Saturday, and the death toll increased by 12, the Department of Health said, as the averages of both numbers continued to decline. According to the department, 5,348 Arkansans have died of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The number of people hospitalized in the state with the virus fell by 25 to 605. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases in Arkansas has decreased by nearly 75%, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Gov. Asa Hutchinson planned to visit vaccination clinics over the weekend, a senior citizen’s center in Lavaca and a pharmacy in Bryant, after urging vaccine providers on Friday to schedule extra weekend hours to make up for a slowdown because of last week’s snowstorms. “It is critical to get our vaccines out as quickly as possible, and we have to catch up on the missed appointments and slow vaccine distribution over the last week,” he said in a statement. Hutchinson has said the state needs to vaccinate more people age 70 and older before expanding the vaccine program to others.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state plans to set aside 10% of first vaccine doses for educators, school staff and child care providers starting in March to help get children back in classrooms, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday. The move is aimed at jump-starting in-person learning after nearly a year of distance learning for most of California’s 6 million K-12 students. The announcement came a day after legislative leaders announced a $6.5 billion proposal aimed at reopening schools this spring. Newsom said that’s not fast enough and suggested he could veto it. “I can’t support something that’s going to delay the safe reopening of schools for our youngest kids,” he said. Lawmakers didn’t appear deterred by Newsom’s comments and still planned to take up the school legislation Monday, said Nannette Miranda, a spokeswoman for Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat who heads the chamber’s budget committee. California on Friday also announced a more rapid return to athletic playing fields for youth sports, while Newsom recently said more counties will soon be able to allow various businesses to reopen and expand customer volume. But school districts in many areas of the state such as San Francisco and the city of Los Angeles remain closed to in-person learning.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Out-of-work residents are able to reopen and file new claims after a program distributing pandemic unemployment assistance ended in December, officials said. Colorado Department of Labor and Employment Director Joe Barela said residents could begin filing Saturday, marking the second launch of federal extended jobless benefits this year, Colorado Public Radio reports. The first phase began in February for people who still had money remaining on their account in December, when federal programs funded through the coronavirus relief bill ended. “They will be able to begin certifying their weeks or the payments filing new claims and reopening if they were moving into programs,” Barela said. “That’s really exciting.” The state does not know exactly how many people qualified over the weekend but said about 289,000 were contacted with information on how to sign up for the benefits. The state was delayed in revamping the benefits because it upgraded its system and needed to reprogram the benefit options. Phil Spesshardt, benefits services manager with the department, said the delay was caused in part by Congress, which waited until the program ended to take any action and then waited for additional information from the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is partnering with a Hartford-based nonprofit organization that advocates for health equity across the state to reach out to more than 10,000 minority residents over the next three months and dispel myths about the COVID-19 vaccine. The arrangement announced Friday is part of the state’s efforts to reach out to Black and Latino communities that have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus and may be reticent to get vaccinated. “We want to ensure that communities at highest risk have equitable access to the vaccines that will protect them and allow everyone to return to a sense of normalcy,” Dr. Deidre Gifford, the state’s acting public health commissioner, said in a statement. “The team at Health Equity Solutions will strengthen and enhance our outreach efforts in the Black and Latino communities.” The organization plans to focus on faith- and education-based networks to reach the widest audience possible with information about the vaccine. There will be a particular focus on issues concerning distrust of the medical system within the state’s Black community. Health Equity Solutions already hosted webinars that have reached more than 3,000 people, and more than 20 events have been scheduled, with more being planned.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: With coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continuing to plummet, Gov. John Carney on Friday announced a loosening of the restrictions for indoor gatherings at businesses and other indoor spaces. The new rules allow for a maximum of 25 people or 50% of the stated fire occupancy restrictions, whichever is lower, though organizers may submit a plan to the Division of Public Health to host larger events up to 150 people. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 50 people or up to 250 with an approved plan from DPH. “I don’t think anything else is imminent after today’s announcement,” said Jonathan Starkey, a spokesman for Carney. “We are continuing to see positive trends in the numbers – hospitalizations, percent positive and cases. That’s good news. We are also still moving down from the winter peaks, which is why the governor and the public health team are taking a cautious approach as we see sustained decreases in spread. We’ll continue to follow the numbers and ask everyone to do their part.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Rev. Wallace Charles Smith started his virtual Valentine’s Day sermon at Shiloh Baptist Church by talking about love and vaccinations. “When you get a vaccination, you are saying to everyone around you that you love them enough that you don’t want any hurt, harm or danger to befall them,” he said. “In the spirit of love, keep at it until you get your vaccination. That’s the only thing that’s going to erase this terrible scourge.” Health officials in the nation’s capital are hoping Smith and other Black religious leaders will serve as community influencers to overcome what officials say is a persistent vaccine reluctance in the Black community. Smith and several other local ministers recently received their first vaccine shots. Black residents make up a little under half of Washington’s population but constitute nearly three-fourths of the city’s COVID-19 deaths. D.C. is now offering vaccinations to residents over age 65, but numbers show seniors in the poorest and blackest parts of Washington are lagging behind. Officials partially blame historic distrust of the medical establishment, especially among Black seniors, who vividly remember medical exploitation horrors such as the Tuskegee syphilis study. The D.C. government is giving priority for vaccine registration to predominantly Black ZIP codes and running public information campaigns. “There’s distrust in our community. We can’t ignore that,” said the Rev. James Coleman of All Nations Baptist, who was vaccinated along with Smith. “The church, and particularly the Black church, is essential. … That’s what pastors do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Two women who dressed up to make themselves appear older to get COVID-19 vaccinations were turned away and issued trespass warnings, officials said. Dr. Raul Pino, state health officer in Orange County, said the women disguised themselves Wednesday with bonnets, gloves and glasses. Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Michelle Guido told the Orlando Sentinel the women altered their birth years on their vaccination registrations to bypass the state system, which prioritizes people 65 and older. It appeared the women had gotten the first shot, but it was unclear where. “Their names matched their registration but not their dates of birth,” she told the newspaper. The women were 35 and 45 years old, officials said in a news release. Health Department officials asked deputies to issue trespass warnings. In a video provided by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, a deputy could be heard saying, “You’ve stolen a vaccine from somebody that needs it more than you.” Guido said the warning means the women can’t return to the convention center for any reason – including a vaccine, coronavirus test, convention or show. If they do return, they could face arrest.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is renewing its request to again be exempted from federal requirements to administer standardized tests. State Superintendent Richard Woods announced Thursday that he and Gov. Brian Kemp had resubmitted a waiver request to the U.S. Department of Education. Former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in September that she would deny waiver requests for the 2020-2021 school year, after granting them last year. Woods argues that tests are useless because they’re supposed to measure instruction in a regular learning environment. “This unprecedented school year has been anything but traditional, and experts know tests cannot be completely redesigned and revamped overnight,” Woods said in a statement Thursday. Most Georgia school districts have been offering in-person instruction for most of the year, but a substantial portion of students have chosen to learn remotely from home. A handful of districts have offered no in-person instruction. It’s unclear how the Biden administration will receive renewed waiver requests, which are being submitted by a number of states. Miguel Cardona, Biden’s nominee for education secretary, has yet to get a confirmation vote in the U.S. Senate. Woods said it will be hard for all students to take tests in-person, as testing security rules required.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: More than 200 people gathered on Kauai last week to show support for reopening tourism on the island amid the pandemic. The group outside Vidinha Stadium on Wednesday primarily consisted of business owners, The Garden Island reports. Attendees said they wanted to express concerns to county and state officials about the continued economic impact of restrictions on tourism. Kauai requires visitors to take part in the Safe Travels Hawaii pre-travel testing program. Those who stay at a county-approved resort can bypass the state’s mandated 10-day quarantine with a negative coronavirus test taken after at least three days on the island. Cynthia Keener shared the struggles she and her husband have experienced under travel restrictions while trying to operate their business, Ohana Fishing Charters. “Just like many in the business community, we had a thriving growing business before COVID,” she said. “As a result of these policies, we have almost lost 100% of our revenue and acquired mountains of debt from government loans just to hang on.” Keener said there is “no transparency” from the Kauai County Council or the office of Mayor Derek Kawakami about future plans. “Keep me alive; (don’t) kill my dream. Don’t kill that,” said David Stewart, who owns a landscaping business he hopes to pass on to his children..\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill to outlaw demonstrating at a person’s residence headed to the full state House on Friday, after a series of demonstrations at the homes of officials and police officers spurred by frustration with restrictions on gatherings or mask-wearing mandates to slow coronavirus infections and deaths. The House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee voted 11-4 to approve the bill backers say is needed to prevent mobs from trying to intimidate and even terrorize families in their homes. Backers say allowing the demonstrations will tear the social fabric by causing people to avoid public service or join police agencies. “When we turn the volume up this high on political discourse, we crowd out anybody not willing to be equally as confrontational, angry, loud or violent,” Republican Rep. Greg Chaney said. He is a co-sponsor of the legislation with Rep. Brooke Green, a Democrat from Boise. In the past year, “a new playbook has been written, and several groups of individuals across the spectrum used it to terrify families in their homes,” Green said. The public hearing drew so many people wanting to testify that comments were taken Wednesday and Friday. After Wednesday’s raucous hearing, torch- and pitchfork-wielding protesters gathered outside Chaney’s house that evening.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s top doctor has vowed wide availability of the COVID-19 vaccine to residents but said it’ll take months for supply to meet demand. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike’s comments in a weekend Chicago Tribune opinion piece come amid complaints of shortages and difficulties in obtaining appointments. A recent blast of winter weather also delayed shipments, leading to canceled appointments. “It will be months before our supply comfortably outpaces demand – an obstacle we always expected, and the very reason we have devoted so much time and thought to the phases of prioritization,” Ezike wrote. “Everyone deserves their turn to get the vaccine, and it’s my promise to Illinois that we will get there – as efficiently, quickly and equitably as we can.” Currently, health care workers, residents 65 and older, and essential workers are eligible in Illinois. State officials announced an expansion starting later this month to include people with underlying health conditions, but Chicago and other areas are delaying, citing a vaccine shortage. More than 2.1 million doses have been administered in Illinois, according to state officials. Overall, Illinois has reported more than 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 20,000 deaths.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Legislators are supporting proposals that would permanently allow members of local government boards to participate virtually in public meetings. Similar bills approved by the state House and Senate would permit boards to adopt policies allowing members to vote virtually as long as they can be seen and heard. State and local government boards have generally been allowed to hold all-virtual meetings since Gov. Eric Holcomb issued an exemption to the current state law requiring in-person meetings last spring as part of COVID-19 public health measures. The proposals would require that at least half of board members attend public meetings in person and that members participate virtually in no more than half of the meetings except for limited reasons such as illness or military service. The House-passed version would require meetings with virtual participation to also allow the public to observe the meeting online starting in July, while the Senate version would delay that requirement until January 2023.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Seventy-six of the state’s 82 critical-access hospitals ended the last fiscal year with negative operating margins, an IowaWatch analysis of their most recently reported financial data shows. Only six critical-access hospitals – facilities with 25 or fewer beds and designated by Congress as essential for rural communities – brought in more revenue from patient care than what they spent on providing that care, the data shows. “If you were vulnerable before this, you’re more vulnerable now,” said Kirk Norris, the Iowa Hospital Association’s president and CEO. The new data includes the distribution of federal stimulus money to stem revenue losses after the onset of COVID-19. Stimulus money helped 37 of the 50 hospitals ending their fiscal year in June 2020 to report net income, IowaWatch’s analysis showed. But COVID-19 clearly disrupted hospitals forced to switch from offering their main revenue producer – outpatient services – to focusing on patients with COVID-19 last spring. The Iowa Hospital Association reported last year that 17 hospitals already were at financial risk more than a year before COVID-19 hit the state. The association reported in December that Iowa hospitals, overall, lost an estimated $433 million in March through October because of COVID-19.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Gov. Laura Kelly has announced plans to fix issues that have led the state to underreport the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19. Kansas’ vaccination rate consistently ranks among the lowest in the country, and Kelly has blamed technical problems with the tracking system, called KSWebIZ. As of Friday, 11.1% of the state’s population, or 456,093 people, had received at least the first of two required doses, state health data showed. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed the state had administered only 72% of 581,975 doses received, up from 60.2% a week ago. The state’s data showed that 78% of 581,975 doses had been administered. Dr. Lee Norman, the head of the state health department, said last week that 100,000 doses administered had not been registered as such because of system glitches. Kelly said in a statement released Thursday evening that the state is working on addressing underlying data transfer problems with KSWebIZ. In the meantime, providers are required starting Monday to report daily on the number of doses received, administered, in inventory and transferred.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state is relaxing coronavirus-related restrictions at some of its long-term care facilities. Indoor visitation will resume at non-Medicare-certified facilities that have been through the COVID-19 vaccination process, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Group activities, communal dining and visitations among vaccinated residents will resume, he said. Included in the updated protocols are assisted living facilities, personal care homes, intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities and independent living centers, Beshear said. “It’s been a long journey, and it’s exciting to be able to relax some restrictions,” said state Cabinet for Health and Family Services inspector general Adam Mather. People will be expected to schedule their visits with the facility, and up to two visitors from the same household can visit a resident at one time, state officials said. Visitors will need to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the visit. The new protocols took effect Saturday. Beshear said Friday that more than 550,000 Kentuckians had received at least one dose of the two-dose COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state is asking President Joe Biden’s administration to establish one of its planned federal COVID-19 vaccine sites at the New Orleans convention center, but state officials would like that site to come with extra doses of the shots rather than a reshuffling of current supply. Negotiations continue with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Key questions remain unanswered about how such a site could be financed and whether that would help Louisiana get new doses of the vaccine, said Dr. Joe Kanter, the top public health adviser to Gov. John Bel Edwards. Kanter said New Orleans is prepared to staff the vaccination site itself, working with LCMC Health, which operates six hospitals and urgent care centers in the region. But Kanter said the city “would like some financial reimbursement on it. And the doses would be important to all of us. So those are the two biggest things.” The Biden administration said it intends to open 100 federal vaccination sites by the end of the month in an effort to speed the immunizations. But governors and health officials around the country are mixed on the offer because they don’t necessarily need more places to administer the vaccine – just more doses overall.\n\nMaine\n\nManchester: Pediatricians are reminding parents to get their children caught up on routine immunizations, which many students have missed during the coronavirus pandemic. The Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said Thursday that a Blue Cross Blue Shield analysis found a 26% drop in vaccine doses last year. The analysis also found 40% of parents surveyed said their children missed shots because of the pandemic. The chapter called on parents to get in touch with their pediatricians to schedule visits to keep their children up to date. Data indicates adolescents in Maine are behind on vaccines for certain cancers, pertussis and meningitis, the organization said in a statement. The chapter said parents have delayed or skipped vaccination appointments because of fear of catching the coronavirus, economic hardship, and greater demands on their time and attention. Immunizations are required to attend school in Maine, and a new law goes into effect this year that takes away philosophical and religious exemptions.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate voted Friday to expand a tax credit for low-income workers to include immigrants, including those living in the country illegally, who work and pay taxes in the state in a measure that adds to a broader pandemic relief initiative already enacted last week. The measure, now in the hands of the House of Delegates, is a follow-up to more than $1 billion in relief that passed with bipartisan support this month and was signed into law last Monday by Gov. Larry Hogan. The House had added the provisions but withdrew them over the Republican governor’s opposition. Democrats, who control the General Assembly, are moving forward now in separate legislation. The measure, which extends the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income residents to people who use individual taxpayer individual numbers rather than Social Security numbers, was approved 32-15, largely along party lines. Sen. Justin Ready, R-Carroll County, noted that the measure would cost about $60 million in each of the next three years. But supporters say the workers covered under the measure pay more than $100 million in taxes annually without being eligible for most tax credits or public assistance programs.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The medical director of the city agency coordinating Boston’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been working remotely from Hawaii for several months, and even though she has permission to do so, some critics say it may hinder her effectiveness. Dr. Jennifer Lo relocated with her family in November with approval from Rita Nieves, the Boston Public Health Commission’s executive director, NBC10 Boston reports. Since then, the city has had to deal with a post-holiday surge in cases and the vaccine rollout. As medical director, Lo’s job is to advise the commission on medical policy issues. Lo, in an email to the station, said she and her husband made “the difficult decision” to temporarily relocate to Hawaii for personal reasons, including to take care of two sets of aging parents. She said plans on returning to Massachusetts this summer. She offered to resign, but the commission “determined I would be able to effectively continue my work remotely while maintaining the same level of responsibilities required in this role,” she wrote. Nieves said she consulted with other city leaders before approving Lo’s work arrangement. She said it took about a year to fill the position the last time it opened, and she didn’t want to risk being without a medical director during an emergency.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A $2.5 million federal grant will be used to address health care staffing shortages in the state’s rural communities. Michigan’s Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity said the grant will support the addition of more than 430 new health care workers over the next four years. The agency will lead MiREACH, a network of employer-led collaboratives, to identify targeted health care occupations based on employer demand and feedback. The grant program aims to help individuals gain the skills necessary to provide needed services, fill vacancies and allow employers to find skilled workers more readily. The coronavirus pandemic has increased the need for health care workers, particularly in rural areas, according to the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Public school enrollment in the state dropped by about 17,000 students as families turned to home schooling, private schools and delaying entry into kindergarten amid the coronavirus pandemic, education officials announced Friday. The enrollment figures from the Minnesota Department of Education represented a 2% drop from the previous year. The state allocates school funding based on enrollment, and districts stand to lose about $10,164 for every student they failed to keep. Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed education budget includes $25 million in one-time money to compensate. “COVID-19 has already robbed our students of so many milestones that make school memorable,” Education Commissioner Mary Cathryn Ricker said in a statement. “Now, our schools are potentially facing a huge loss in funding and resources, which will mean schools faced with eliminating learning opportunities and experiences for our students, especially students who need them most.” The “vast majority” of the decline in public school enrollment was among white students, the department said. It said the change was driven mostly by younger students, with public kindergarten enrollment dropping 9% even as private kindergarten enrollment rose 12.4%. And 49.5% more students were home-schooled.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: Neither rain, snow nor waterless pipes could prevent Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center from helping patients in need, as employees carried buckets of water drawn from a well to clean and sanitize during the city’s water crisis last week. The hospital’s clinics closed ahead of the winter weather and remained closed when the water shortage hit. “Water is for sure vital to the operation of the hospital,” hospital CEO?Charla Rowley said, noting that cleaning and sanitation is impossible without it and that many operations in the hospital could not function either. She said she was proud of the hard work of the maintenance staff for keeping the hospital operating during the storm and outage, noting that the dietary department also played a huge role in the hospital’s operations. With the closure of clinics and the cancellation of elective surgeries, Rowley said the hospital has taken a half-million-dollar hit a day, which could come back with some serious repercussions in the long run. “We have had tornadoes, hurricanes, COVID and now this freeze,”?she said. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kevin Richardson said the lack of water could not stop the hospital from serving the community. “Mother Nature’s challenges were not enough to dampen the grit of our front-line providers,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s NAACP chapter filed federal civil rights complaints against the state over the lack of COVID-19 vaccinations for prisoners. No Missouri prisoners had been inoculated, a state corrections department spokeswoman told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday. The St. Louis NAACP filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division over the lack of vaccinations, the chapter president said in a Thursday news release. “While we are well aware that the CDC makes recommendations with respect to who should be offered COVID-19 vaccine first, and each state has its own plan for deciding who will be vaccinated first and how they can receive vaccines; that ‘Does Not’ exempt the State from long-standing civil rights nondiscrimination requirements when utilizing Federal assistance,” St. Louis NAACP President Adolphus Pruitt said in a statement, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said about 8,000 Missouri inmates, or roughly a third of the total imprisoned population, now qualify for the vaccine. Of those, 6,000 said they would like to be vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County residents ages 16-69 with underlying health conditions are now eligible to sign up for COVID-19 vaccination appointments. People eligible for the vaccine in Phase 1B include people 70 and older, people 16-69 with qualifying health conditions, and Native Americans and other people of color. Qualifying health conditions in Phase 1B include cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, heart conditions, immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, severe obesity, sickle cell disease, diabetes and other conditions on a case-by-case basis determined by medical providers. Proof of medical conditions is not required to make an appointment. As of Friday, 12,749 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in Cascade County, and 3,514 residents had been fully immunized, meaning they had received both doses. For more information and to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, visit www.benefis.org/COVIDvaccine.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts on Friday defended the state’s decision to prioritize the elderly for vaccination shots over people with underlying health conditions, noting that most residents who have died so far were at least 65 years old. Ricketts’ administration amended its COVID-19 vaccination plan last week. People who have cancer, diabetes and other major health problems were previously eligible in the current phase of the state’s vaccination plan, but they were removed from their spot on the list so health officials could focus on older residents. Essential workers such as first responders, teachers and corrections employees also qualify, but state officials have ordered local public health districts and pharmacies to give at least 90% of their available doses to senior citizens. Approximately 82% of the 2,043 people who have died from the coronavirus in Nebraska were at least 65 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal. Age isn’t the only risk factor, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that people with ailments such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease or obesity are at greater risk of getting severely ill. Ricketts said giving too many of the state’s limited doses to people besides seniors is a “less efficient” approach.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus in the Legislature have changed the nature of lobbying and raised new questions about how to regulate it. Public access to the legislative building has been restricted since lawmakers reconvened Feb. 1, leaving the normally bustling corridors empty aside from staff and reporters. But that hasn’t stopped advocates from pursuing their usual work, lobbying for and against the hundreds of bills that have already been introduced. Unlike other states, Nevada’s Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act only requires lobbyists to register if they lobby in person. With the building closed, no lobbyists have registered since lawmakers reconvened three weeks ago. Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson and Assemblywoman Brittney Miller introduced a bill last week that would require lobbyists to register whether they advocate on behalf of their clients in person or remotely. Many lobbyists say they support the bill. But Melissa Clement of Nevada Right to Life and three other lobbyists for conservative groups and causes filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming the closure of the legislative building violates their First Amendment right to petition government.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A federal judge heard arguments Friday on whether medically vulnerable lawmakers should be given remote access to state House sessions this week or whether separate entrances for Democrats and Republicans and other safety measures would suffice. Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Republican House Speaker Sherm Packard last week, arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions. It also forces them to choose between risking their lives and not performing their duties as elected officials, attorney Paul Twomey said at a hearing Friday. If all 28 lawmakers with medical disabilities stayed home, nearly 100,000 residents across the state would lose representation, he said. Republican House leaders have said fully remote sessions are not possible because no rules exist to allow them, while blocking attempts to create such rules. But the Senate has been meeting remotely without an explicit rule, and the House has been holding “hybrid” committee hearings that allow for remote participation. Judge Landya McCafferty gave the parties more time to provide more background material.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: As debate mounts over how to reopen schools during the pandemic, some parents are taking to federal court, arguing that their children’s struggles with remote learning represent a violation of constitutional rights. The South Orange and Maplewood district joined the legal parade late last month, with parents asking a judge to end nearly a year of online-only instruction for its 7,000 students. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Newark stood out not only for its wrenching stories of students slipping behind as they study in isolation but also for the full-scale reversal it seeks: Parents asked the court to force the K-12 district for both towns, known locally as SOMA, to resume full-day classes, five days a week. The “arbitrary” closures during the pandemic violate students’ constitutional rights and have wreaked havoc on their psyches and academic performance, the lawsuit says. Two parents said their 7-year-old has struggled with digital lessons and “often says he is ‘stupid’ and ‘the dumbest kid in the class.’ ” But two Rutgers University law professors questioned whether the heartbreaking anecdotes will be enough to convince the courts that constitutional violations had occurred or that a judge should overrule local officials.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are sprinting amid the pandemic to come up with a framework for regulating and taxing recreational marijuana after voters ousted key opponents of pot legalization in 2020 elections. Four Democrat-backed proposals with a social-justice bent are competing for traction at the Legislature, along with a Republican proposal aimed at stamping out the illicit pot market. The Legislature has until March 20 to send a cannabis bill to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, an enthusiastic backer of marijuana as a tool of economic development and fiscal security for the state. The primary election in 2020 unseated several staunch legalization opponents, including the former top-ranked Senate Democrat. The New Mexico Constitution doesn’t allow for ballot initiatives, leaving cannabis legalization to the legislative process. A House panel last Monday advanced a bill that places an emphasis on economic and social issues by subsidizing medical marijuana for poor patients, underwriting grants for communities affected by drug criminalization, and expunging convictions for cannabis use and possession. Senate committees are poised to vet at least three separate proposals. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, an arbitration attorney by trade, said he’s eager to bring a compromise bill to the floor.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s restaurants will be allowed to serve more customers indoors starting this Friday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced late last week that New York City indoor dining will be able to expand from 25% capacity to 35% capacity – in line with New Jersey’s current limit. His announcement came as the state sees a continued drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations. The rate of New Yorkers testing positive for the coronavirus has fallen to the lowest mark since before Thanksgiving, state officials said Saturday. Cuomo said the state’s seven-day rolling average positivity rate had fallen 43 straight days, hitting 3.5% on Friday. The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, meanwhile, fell below 6,000 for the first time since Dec. 14. The state said 97 New Yorkers died of the coronavirus Friday, bringing the state’s official death total to 37,776. Cuomo asked New Yorkers to remain patient with vaccinations, as the state’s distribution network and population of eligible recipients – 10 million – continues to far exceed supply coming from the federal government. The state now has the resources to vaccinate up to 100,000 New Yorkers every day, he said, but not nearly enough vaccines to do so.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: President Joe Biden’s administration told the state Friday afternoon that it will see further delays in shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses. North Carolina public health officials said they now expect more deliveries of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to resume at the start of the week. The state health department also warned that some providers may choose not to go forward with plans to vaccinate teachers and school staff once eligibility opens up to that group Wednesday. Severe winter weather has fueled delays across the country, causing tens of thousands of North Carolinians scheduled to be vaccinated last week to have their appointments pushed back. “What we are being informed by Operation Warp Speed is that shipments are being held by the producers and distributors until they are sure shipments won’t be delayed,” the department said in a statement. “To our knowledge, operations are being planned to help ensure spoilage isn’t an issue.” The delay could affect North Carolina’s transition to its third phase of vaccine distribution, which expands eligibility Wednesday to child care workers, pre-K-12 educators and school staff. A far more expansive group of “front-line essential workers” ranging from mail carriers to elected officials is scheduled to become eligible starting March 10.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Visitation to the state’s No. 1 tourist attraction fell last year, but it wasn’t all because of the coronavirus pandemic. Theodore Roosevelt National Park saw about 558,000 visitors in 2020, the fewest since 2013. Visitation fell 20% from 2019, but some months last year spiked substantially over the previous year – including December, which saw a 173% jump. Visitation is measured in an algorithm counting people who stop in visitor centers combined with an average of people in vehicles. Park Superintendent Wendy Ross said she sees “so many variables, especially this past year.” “I don’t put much stock in the fact that we were down 20%; in fact, I’m a little surprised we weren’t down more, but it was a very busy year. It felt like a ‘normal’ year,” Ross said. Annual visitation averaged about 700,000 people from 2015 to 2019. The emerging pandemic and reduced oil and gas activity likely brought more people to the park in February, March and April, according to Ross. Visitation in February and March leapt 253% and 106%, respectively, over the same months in 2019, The Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legislative testimony made Wednesday in support of a GOP-backed effort to limit public health orders made by the governor was removed from YouTube after the service deemed it contained COVID-19 misinformation. The Google-owned platform said it removed content that was uploaded last week to the Ohio Advocates for Medical Freedom channel for violating the company’s terms of services. The video showed Thomas Renz, an attorney for Ohio Stands Up, a citizen group, making the opening testimony during a House committee hearing on a bill that would allow lawmakers to vote down public health orders during the pandemic. In the more than 30-minute testimony, Renz made a number of debunked or baseless claims, including that no Ohioans under the age of 19 have died from COVID-19 – a claim that has been debunked by state data. “We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” said Ivy Choi, a spokesperson for Google. “We removed this video in accordance with our COVID-19 misinformation policy, which prohibits content that claims a certain age group cannot transmit the virus.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 681,000 Oklahomans have now received COVID-19 vaccine shots, including more than 204,000 who have received both required doses, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The state ranked 12th in the nation Saturday with 14.3% of the population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control, and the state health department scheduled vaccination clinics over the weekend to replace those canceled because of a winter storm. There have been a reported 418,318 total coronavirus cases and 4,155 deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began, increases of 973 cases and 23 deaths since Friday, according to the health department. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state has fallen below 1,000 in the past two weeks, dropping from 2,215.7 per day to 932.4, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths declined from 34.1 per day to 24.7 during the same period.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Despite historic winter weather across the country causing shipment delays and forcing mass vaccination sites to reschedule appointments, health officials said Friday that the state’s vaccination timeline remains on schedule. While more than 10,000 vaccine appointments were canceled earlier this month, beginning Monday people 70 and older will be eligible to receive doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and people 65 and older will be eligible March 1. “I want to reassure every Oregon senior – nothing that’s happened in the past week will slow down our schedule,” Pat Allen, the director of the Oregon Health Authority, said during a news conference Friday. “It seems like every season brings a new test on top of the pandemic. Oregon’s vaccination clinics were no exception.” However, health officials said they do not expect that “these problems will have a long-term impact on our vaccination schedule.” During the past week, Oregon averaged more than 14,000 vaccinations per day. As of Thursday, 12% of the state’s population has been vaccinated with first doses, and 5% of residents had been fully vaccinated.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Department of Health announced a change Friday in its vaccine distribution plan that aims to ramp up the number of COVID-19 inoculations by distributing more doses to large hospitals and removing smaller physician practices and clinics from the provider list altogether. Tried-and-true distribution methods in Pennsylvania are insufficient for vaccines that require subzero transportation and storage temperatures and require people to come back for a second dose. Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said the four groups handling distribution going forward would be hospitals, federally qualified health centers, county health departments and pharmacies. Primary care doctors, long the mainstay of vaccination efforts, are being left out and left in the dark when it comes to battling the coronavirus, said Dr. Tracey Conti, a physician and president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Family Physicians. They have no information for the patients calling daily with pleas for the vaccine. Yet they believe their involvement is essential to counter the misinformation that could undermine the whole effort. “People would rather get vaccinated by their doctor,” Conti said. “It’s not clear they’ll accept it from anyone else.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: As part of the state’s plan to get vaccines to residents who cannot leave their homes, health officials on Friday launched a website to gather information about the housebound. The site does not allow people to sign up for a vaccination appointment – it is simply to collect information for planning purposes, the Department of Health said in a statement. The information in most cases is already being provided by cities and towns and home health agencies, but the state wants to make sure everyone limited to their homes is covered. Health care providers or family members can help fill out the form, the agency said. The state has been vaccinating residents 75 and older, and starting Monday, people 65 and older are eligible to make appointments. Also, the number of retail pharmacies in the state offering the vaccine will increase significantly by the end of the week, the agency said. CVS should be vaccinating at 14 locations, up from the current seven, while Walgreens should be vaccinating at 24 locations, up from the current 15. Nearly 127,000 people have received a vaccine first dose in Rhode Island, while 57,000 people have been fully vaccinated, according to health department data released Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The leader of the state agency that provides services for people with disabilities has been fired without explanation. After meeting privately and with no discussion Thursday, the board of the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs voted 5-1 to immediately fire Director Mary Poole, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. She had been at the agency for less than three years and made $171,400. Commissioner David Thomas of Greenville made the motion to dismiss Poole. A former state senator, Thomas told the newspaper he couldn’t say why she was fired because it was a personnel issue. He said Poole’s firing is for the good of the agency and hopefully will lead to the agency serving more people and serving them better. Poole said she has worked honestly and diligently for more than 30 years with people with disabilities and was not given an opportunity to discuss with the board any concerns with her work. “We found and corrected many long-standing and significant issues within the agency and provider network,” Poole said in a statement. “My only regret is that these efforts were cut short with so much work left to be done.” When Poole was hired in mid-2018, the department was suffering from years of abuse allegations with its providers, financial problems and long waiting lists.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials said Sunday that the number of hospitalizations due to the coronavirus continues to fall, although a virus research group ranks the state among the top 10 for the number of deaths relative to population. The state reported 140 new cases and four new deaths in the past day, raising the totals to 111,309 known cases and 1,863 fatalities since the start of the pandemic. The COVID Tracking Project ranks South Dakota seventh in the country in the number of deaths per capita. The update showed that the number of hospitalizations fell from 95 to 90. Of those patients, 17 were being treated in intensive care units, and nine required ventilators. There were about 230 new cases per 100,000 people in South Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks 38th in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. One in every 919 people in South Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents bought more guns in 2020 than ever before, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found. The state law enforcement agency found 740,580 gun transactions were performed last year, a 53% jump compared to 2019. Tennessee outpaced the national average in gun purchases, which saw about a 40% increase. TBI personnel track gun purchases and perform background checks on prospective gun buyers. Pam Beck, assistant director of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division, pointed to four main causes in the spike of firearms purchases: the coronavirus pandemic, talks of defunding the police, bouts of civil unrest and the 2020 election. “People feel like they have to protect themselves,” she said. According to data provided by TBI, the state saw the biggest jump in gun purchases in March, when residents purchased more than 77,000 firearms. This came at the start of the pandemic, when the first coronavirus case was discovered in Tennessee and when then-President Donald Trump declared a national emergency because of the virus. Some states began announcing lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, and grocery store shelves emptied as panic buying ensued.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of COVID-19 deaths across the state increased by more than 200 on Saturday, while the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus declined, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There were an additional 227 COVID-19 deaths, more than 4,900 new cases and 7,535 hospitalizations, a decline of 222 people hospitalized, the department reported. Texas has recorded more than 2.5 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and more than 42,000 deaths due to COVID-19, the third-highest death count in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of new cases has fallen from nearly 18,980 per day to nearly 5,041, and the average of daily deaths has dropped from 305.7 per day to 127.3, according to the Johns Hopkins data. During the past two weeks, the rolling average of daily new cases in Texas has fallen by 13,849.3, a decrease of 74.7%, according to the Johns Hopkins figures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah State Parks has reported park visitation increased by 2.6 million between 2019 and 2020 despite safety restrictions implemented during the coronavirus pandemic. “Our state parks saw elevated visitation numbers throughout the traditional summer season,” Utah Division of Parks and Recreation Director Jeff Rasmussen said. “Not only that, but record-breaking visitation continued into the fall and winter and has not tapered off like it normally does.” The agency reported that the 44 parks across the state recorded 10.6 million visitors combined last year compared to the 8 million recorded in 2019, according to KSTU-TV. Officials said popular boating and off-highway vehicle areas statewide also saw increase use. Park officials announced in April last year that many state parks would reopen after weeks of being restricted to in-county residents to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some stayed closed based on local public health orders. “We never closed our doors to the public. While there was a time when visitation was restricted due to local health orders, we were always open,” Rasmussen said. Utah State Parks expects visitation to remain high this year as people continue to find outdoor spaces to escape during the pandemic.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is easing travel restrictions for Vermonters and visitors who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 starting this week, Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday. Two weeks after receiving their second dose of the vaccine, Vermonters do not have to quarantine after travel starting Tuesday, Scott said during his twice-weekly virus briefing. Out-of-state visitors also are exempt from quarantining if they can prove they have been fully vaccinated. “Of course they’ll still need to comply with all our other health guidance like masking and distancing,” Scott said. The state is also easing restrictions for fully vaccinated residents of long-term care facilities in areas where there are no current outbreaks beginning this Friday. The state is encouraging full vaccination status as a factor in planning for activities, such as eating together and participating in other group activities, and for having indoor visitors, said Human Services Secretary Mike Smith. Residents of all skilled nursing facilities have received the second dose of the vaccine, Smith said. A total of 93% of residents of all skilled nursing, assisted living and residential care facilities have gotten their first dose, and 74% have received their second dose, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers have passed bills that allow certain first responders to file workers’ compensation benefits for being disabled from COVID-19, but legislators still need to reach agreement on some differences. The measures would make COVID-19 an occupational disease for firefighters, emergency medical services personnel, and law enforcement or correctional officers and allow these individuals to file for workers’ compensation benefits. The workers’ dependents also would be eligible for benefits if the workers die from COVID-19. Occupational diseases arise out of and in the course of employment, according to state law, and include hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, tuberculosis or HIV. Senate Bill 1375, sponsored by Sen. Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax, and House Bill 2207, introduced by Del. Jay Jones, D- Norfolk, had mostly unanimous support. The main difference is that the House bill would extend the compensation to regional jail officers. The Senate also rejected an amendment by the House that would allow compensation for cases going back to March 2020. The bills would apply to persons diagnosed with COVID-19 on or after July 1 whose death or disability from COVID-19 occurred on or after that same date, Del. Kaye Kory, D-Falls Church, said in an email.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: More than $2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funding will be allocated across the state under a measure signed into law Friday by Gov. Jay Inslee. The legislation, which received strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate this month, spends $2.2 billion on various efforts, including vaccine administration, rental assistance and money for school districts. “The focus this year is relief, recovery and resilience, and this legislation will make big progress in all three,” Inslee said before signing the bill. It stipulates that $714 million will be allocated to schools as they move toward welcoming students back to the classroom. An additional $618 million will go toward vaccine administration, contact tracing and testing, and $365 million will go toward rental assistance to help renters and landlords affected by the pandemic. The bill also allocates $240 million to small-business assistance grants that will be administered through the state Department of Commerce and $70 million to assist undocumented immigrants affected by the pandemic who do not qualify for federal or state assistance. An additional $50 million is for grants to help child care businesses stay open and expand capacity, and $26 million is for food assistance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice has ordered the loosening of pandemic restrictions on businesses after a decline in coronavirus deaths and cases, and he sought the return of all elementary and middle school students to in-person learning. In a flurry of announcements, the governor on Friday said small businesses and grocery stores can double their allowed capacity, and the limit on social gatherings will go up from 25 to 75 people. Bars and restaurants can allow 75% of seating capacity, up from 50%, if social distancing is possible. Hours later, the state health department announced that the first three cases of the coronavirus variant from the United Kingdom have been detected in West Virginia. It is among one of three variants already found in other states that researchers believe may spread more easily. “While the presence of this COVID-19 variant in West Virginia is not surprising, it’s a good motivator for us to double down on the prevention efforts we’ve had in place for many months now,” Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state health officer, said in a statement. Justice said all teachers and school workers over age 50 who accepted the offer for a vaccine will be given their second doses this week. He said he is asking the State Board of Education to bring all students from kindergarten to eighth grade back to classrooms.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison warned of a recent spike in coronavirus cases Friday, a day after a more contagious variant of the virus was detected in the county, and the university system’s president said he wanted students to attend nearly all classes in person this fall. The warning emailed to students, faculty and staff told of a “significant increase” in COVID-19 cases among students on and off campus. There were 112 newly confirmed cases reported Wednesday and 99 more Thursday, according to the email from Jake Baggott, the head of University Health Services. “Equally concerning, contact tracing suggests that many of the students who have tested positive had attended gatherings, sometimes without wearing masks,” Baggott said. The seven-day average of new cases both on and off campus was up 13.2%, according to the UW dashboard. Although no immediate mitigation steps were being taken on campus, Baggott said the university was preparing to take action if necessary. He said that could include limiting access to or temporarily closing recreational facilities; placing residence halls under quarantine; increasing testing frequency for students off campus; and directing students to stay at home except for attending class and work.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: National weather issues prevented some shipments of vaccines against COVID-19, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. WDH said last week that it was not expecting any Moderna vaccine doses to be delivered to Wyoming locations due to weather problems in other states. Wyoming was slated to receive 5,700 first doses and 3,700 second doses for its distribution process. Shipments to the Walmart locations involved in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program were also affected. “At this point, we are awaiting updates from our federal partners about next week’s shipments,” said Angie Van Houten, Community Health Section chief with WDH. More than 93,000 residents have received their first dose so far when state and special federal counts are combined. Each of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines requires two doses for maximum effectiveness. Because some of the affected vaccine shipments included second doses, Van Houten said individuals who are delayed in receiving their second dose can still receive the vaccine when it is available. “There will not be a need to ‘start over,’ ” she said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/19/pandemic-popcorn-doctors-notes-red-lantern-award-news-around-states/115577868/", "title": "Pandemic popcorn, doctor's notes: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Two Alabama National Guard-staffed mobile vaccination units will begin canvassing counties in the Black Belt and Wiregrass regions next week in an effort to expand COVID-19 inoculations to some of the state’s most rural communities. Vaccinations will begin Tuesday in Covington and Sumter counties. Gov. Kay Ivey announced the locations Thursday, saying in a statement that delivering vaccine to rural Alabama is important to her due to her own upbringing in rural Wilcox County. “I am proud that our guardsmen stand willing to help our great state in any way, especially as we look to put this virus in our rearview mirror,” Ivey said. “I encourage everyone eligible to take advantage of this great resource, and please remain patient as we continue working to get our hands on as many doses as we are able from the federal government. Be sure to help get the word out to your family, friends and neighbors!” The ALNG units will be able to issue “at least 1,000” doses per day, per site, in a Tuesday-through-Friday schedule. Alabama State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said last week the extra weekday will be used for planning and handling data. The clinics, open to all Alabamians free of charge, are expected to run between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The final musher has crossed the finish line in this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, nearly three days after the winner reached the finish line near the small community of Willow. Victoria Hardwick finished the race at 12:22 a.m. Thursday, claiming the race’s Red Lantern Award. The lantern is an Alaska tradition, awarded annually to the competition’s last-place finisher. Race officials say the award honors the final musher’s perseverance in not giving up. Hardwick, of Bethel, Alaska, finished the race 36th, completing the 850-mile race in 10 days, 9 hours, 22 minutes and 6 seconds. It’s her second Red Lantern Award. She got her first in the 2019 race, when she placed 39th. This year’s race started March 7 with 47 mushers. Nine quit the race, and one was withdrawn after testing positive for the coronavirus. Because of the pandemic, mushers didn’t follow the traditional route that travels across Alaska and ends at Nome at the Bering Sea. It was shortened to a loop with mushers starting and ending the race near Willow, about 50 miles north of Anchorage. It was the first time Nome was not the finish line for the world’s most famous sled dog race. Dallas Seavey won his fifth Iditarod championship, crossing the finish line early Monday morning. He’s now tied with Rick Swenson for the most-ever Iditarod wins.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers on Tuesday advanced legislation offering a broad shield from lawsuits related to COVID-19, saying businesses and health care providers deserve protection for doing their best during a challenging time. Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee backed the measure in a party-line vote over strong objections from trial lawyers and consumer advocates, who said the measure would reward bad actors who flouted health guidance. Very few lawsuits have been filed related to COVID-19, critics say. The bill, which has already passed the Senate, would raise the bar for successful pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses, health care providers, nursing homes, nonprofits, governments, churches and schools. Instead of proving negligence by a preponderance of the evidence, plaintiffs would have to prove “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” by clear and convincing evidence. That’s a “double whammy” requiring plaintiffs to both show more egregious conduct and meet a higher standard of proof, said Barry Aarons, a lobbyist for Arizona trial lawyers. The legislation effectively creates broad immunity for anyone who can claim some link to the pandemic, he said. A nursing home might claim, for example, it was unable to properly respond to a patient’s stroke or heart attack because of COVID-19.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court has said it will hear arguments in a lawsuit by a group of legislators challenging Arkansas’ coronavirus restrictions. Justices granted the request for oral arguments in the case late last week but did not immediately schedule the hearing. A Pulaski County judge last year dismissed the lawsuit, and the legislators appealed to the Supreme Court. The case is moving forward a week after Gov. Asa Hutchinson lifted most of the state’s virus restrictions but left the state’s mask mandate in place through at least the end of March. It also comes after the Senate passed a measure expanding the Legislature’s ability to terminate a disaster declaration during a public health emergency. The lawsuit argues that the restrictions put in place during the pandemic required legislative approval. Arkansas on Wednesday reported 14 more coronavirus deaths as the state saw a drop in its active virus cases. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began now total 5,507. The state’s active virus cases, which don’t include people who have recovered or died, dropped by 67 to 2,808. The state reported 325 new cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 327,781. Its COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by three to 260.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: AMC Theatres says it will have 98% of its U.S. movie theaters open Friday as a bunch of theaters reopen in California. Even more are expected to open by March 26. AMC said more than 40 of its locations in the Golden State are reopening Friday, and the state is expected to open 52 of its 54 locations by Monday. The company is preparing to resume operations at the rest of its California locations once the proper local approvals are in place. AMC’s announcement is welcomed by film fans not only because more of them will get to return to reclining seats and a stadium-style format but also because it means the company has hopefully put the worst behind it. It was only in June that AMC cautioned it may not survive the coronavirus pandemic, as its theaters closed and film studios started releasing more movies directly to viewers on streaming services. More theaters opening will also mean more jobs. AMC spokesman Ryan Noonan said the company is welcoming back employees from before theaters were shut down, as well as bringing in new workers. All will be trained on its cleaning and safety protocols, which include social distancing and automatic seat blocking in each theater, mandatory mask-wearing, hand sanitizing stations, upgraded air filtration, contactless ticketing, and mobile ordering for food and drinks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state Senate panel advanced a bill Wednesday that would grant minimum wage and overtime rights to thousands of farmworkers and allow them to organize and join labor unions. The bill, sponsored by three Democratic lawmakers, would regulate working hours for overtime, rest and eating breaks and would guarantee farmworkers living in cramped quarters space that conforms with distancing guidelines recommended by health authorities to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Several states allow farmworkers collective bargaining to some extent – among the many rights originally denied them on the basis of skin color under U.S. labor laws first adopted in the 1930s. “Generations of workers have been exploited for profit,” said Sen. Jessie Danielson, a bill co-sponsor who was raised on a family farm in northern Colorado. Danielson told the Senate Business, Labor, and Technology Committee that most farmers and ranchers treat their workers well. But she cited a litany of abuse, including relentless work hours in all weather conditions, substandard housing, lack of regular access to medical care, and the fear of retribution, including firing, for workers who complain about their labor and living conditions. “The pandemic brought the struggle of these essential workers to the forefront,” Danielson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state House of Representatives on Tuesday voted unanimously in favor of legislation that requires Gov. Ned Lamont to provide top legislative leaders with recommendations for spending the approximately $2.6 billion Connecticut expects to receive in state COVID-19 relief funds from the latest congressional package. The legislation creates an unusual process that ultimately gives the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee until May 16 to report its approval or modifications to Lamont’s proposal, if any, to the leaders. “I wanted to make sure that we as a group, we are a team addressing the Coronavirus American Rescue Fund and that all of us are participating in making the decisions and supporting what we need to do with these dollars,” said Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, the House chair of the Appropriations Committee. Rep. Mike France, R-Ledyard, the top House Republican on the committee, said he’s pleased the legislation also requires Lamont’s budget office to provide legislators with an accounting of how Connecticut spent earlier federal pandemic aid. The bill now awaits final legislative approval by the state Senate.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Wilmington have announced that all veterans enrolled in Veterans Affairs health care are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. The Delaware State News reports veterans must be enrolled in VA health care. And they should preferably receive care at the Wilmington VAMC or one of its five Community Based Outpatient Clinics in Delaware or southern New Jersey. “By expanding the eligibility criteria, we will be able to vaccinate all of our veterans more quickly and get closer to having staff return to their team assignments so we can offer more routine care to veterans at a pre-pandemic level,” Vince Kane, director of the Wilmington VAMC, said in a statement. The Wilmington VAMC has so far administered more than 22,000 vaccine doses to veterans and medical center staff.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than two dozen clergy members from the capital region rolled up their sleeves inside the Washington National Cathedral and got vaccinated against COVID-19 on Tuesday in a camera-friendly event designed to encourage others to get their own shots. The interfaith “vaccine confidence” event targeted in particular Black, Latino and other communities of color, with the aim of overcoming reluctance among populations disproportionately hit by a pandemic that has killed more than a half-million people in the country. “Over 50% of all cases and almost half of all deaths are in persons of African American, Latino or Hispanic background, American Indian and Pacific Islanders,” said Dr. Eliseo Perez-Stable, director of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. “Now, much has been said about, ‘Well, the risk is greater because there’s more disease, more diabetes, more obesity, more heart disease.’ But the reality is that the infections are more likely because people live in more crowded conditions. They work in jobs that do not allow the privilege of teleworking. They cannot self-isolate at home.” Following a moment of prayer for COVID-19 victims, the socially distanced attendees applauded when the Rev. Patricia Hailes Fears from Fellowship Baptist Church became the first one present to be inoculated.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Claes Bell repeatedly called his doctor, desperate to get a state form signed so he could get a COVID-19 vaccine before traveling to be at his father’s bedside after heart surgery. But the 39-year-old, who suffers from hypertension, said he couldn’t get through and eventually called a private, 24-hour emergency doctors network where he paid $45 for a virtual consult. “I’m privileged. I have the money to pay for that,” said Bell, a father of three. “It just sets up a scenario where your outcomes are going to be different depending on your income and employment.” Gov. Ron DeSantis recently opened up vaccine eligibility for younger people with health conditions to get the jab at pharmacies and community centers, but they’re required to have their doctor’s OK. The form requires little more than a signature and is aimed at preventing healthy younger people from jumping the line. But critics say it’s an onerous added barrier for minorities and low-income residents without health insurance or access to a doctor. The inequitable distribution of has been an ongoing challenge for the governor. Of the 3.2 million people who have received one or two doses, less than 6% have been Black – about a third of the corresponding share of the state’s population. Even those like Bell with insurance say they can’t reach their doctors because their offices have been flooded with requests.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Pulling the plug on the South’s largest St. Patrick’s Day parade didn’t stop the party in Savannah, where gaudy green-clad tourists kept bars, restaurants and hotels busy for days and had police handing out thousands of masks amid fears the revelry could brew a coronavirus outbreak. Tourism officials and business owners said the Irish holiday Wednesday and the weekend preceding it were the busiest they’ve seen since the pandemic began a year ago. They credited visitors weary of the virus and given hope by rising vaccinations. “The ’rona might not be done with us, but there are a lot of people who are done with the ’rona,” said Jessica Walden, co-owner of the bar Bay Street Blues near Savannah’s riverfront. St. Patrick’s Day is typically the most lucrative time of year in Savannah, whose parade dates to 1824. It has since ballooned into one of the South’s biggest street parties after Mardi Gras. The celebration Wednesday was notably more subdued. Still, a steady stream of people strolled downtown sidewalks and the riverfront promenade of bars and souvenir shops. Tables outside restaurants were mostly full, and a daiquiri bar had more than a dozen people lined up waiting to enter. Only about half the people celebrating outside wore masks, despite a large green banner hanging from City Hall urging revelers to “MASK UP.”\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: As the coronavirus ravaged other parts of the U.S., residents of this rural Pacific island watched safely from afar. Kauai, one of the world’s most sought-after vacation destinations, has been nearly impossible to visit for most of the past year, with officials bucking pressure to ease quarantine rules as the state’s economy tanked. As a result, Hawaii’s least populated county has been one of the safest places to be. Hair salons were open, kids went to school and played team sports, and residents enjoyed restaurants, bars and beaches without the typical hordes of visitors – or the fears of surging virus numbers. As of Wednesday, Kauai has recorded only 218 confirmed COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic, compared with more than 28,000 statewide. Now, local officials are loosening restrictions, saying early measures and the island’s departure from a state testing program that allowed in more people gave it time to build a strong foundation of public health. A unique “resort bubble” program also helped Kauai bring back some tourists and prepare to reopen more broadly. Next month, the island will rejoin the state’s Safe Travels program, which allows travelers to avoid quarantine with a single negative pre-flight coronavirus test.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A fourth lawmaker in the state House of Representatives has tested positive for the coronavirus in less than a week’s time – and just as the Legislature is debating a bill that would ban local governments from requiring that people wear masks. The increasing number of lawmakers out sick with the virus has legislative leaders in the conservative state worried they may not be able to finish business in a timely fashion. “Of course I’m concerned,” Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke said Wednesday, before the announcement of the fourth COVID-19 diagnosis among his colleagues. Bedke wasn’t wearing a face covering but put one on before getting in an elevator in the Statehouse. “We’re reemphasizing the safety protocols. We also want to be done by the end of the month. I guess we’ll just see how it goes,” he said. Republican Rep. Julie Yamamoto said Thursday that she tested positive Wednesday afternoon and immediately left the Statehouse. She had been on the House floor earlier in the day without a mask as lawmakers debated a huge tax-cut bill. All four lawmakers out with the illness are Republicans who rarely or never wear masks. “I actually feel fine,” Yamamoto said. “The coughing is the worst thing. And I was doing that before with just the asthma and allergies.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will expand COVID-19 vaccine eligibility this month to include people with underlying health conditions and more categories of workers, including in food service and construction, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Wednesday. The expansion to so-called Phase 1c is expected March 29. It’s the last category before vaccines are available to the wider public. Illinois has allowed people with some underlying health conditions to receive the shots since last month, but Chicago and its surrounding areas have largely held off because supplies are limited in the densely populated region. The expansion includes workers in finance, higher education and retail. Still, issues persist with snagging limited appointments and eligibility confusion. Criteria have changed several times at a federally backed mass vaccination site at the United Center, which has allowed people with underlying health conditions since it opened this month. Initially, it was supposed to be open to Illinois residents but then was narrowed to Chicagoans. Later, those in city ZIP codes hit hard by the pandemic were given priority, with officials saying suburban Cook County residents would be offered limited access. Also Wednesday, Chicago schools officials announced staff and vendors can sign up for vaccinations at four dedicated sites for educators.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state attorney general’s office vigorously defended Gov. Eric Holcomb’s emergency powers in response to a restaurant’s lawsuit challenging his order that masks must be worn inside restaurants – even though Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, who took office in January, previously called for curbing the governor’s authority. Yergy’s State Road BBQ in Bluffton filed a suit in December against the Wells County Health Department, Holcomb and the state after it was shut down for violating face-covering requirements and capacity limits amid the pandemic. The lawsuit contends that the county health order closing the restaurant was based on unconstitutional executive orders issued by the governor and that Holcomb didn’t have authority to mandate mask-wearing without backing from the Legislature. The restaurant in the town about 20 miles south of Fort Wayne maintains the order caused “unjust injury to Yergy’s fundamental civil rights, liberty interests and property rights.” The state attorney general’s office, however, argues that based on “broad, clear, and unambiguous language” of Indiana’s emergency powers law, the General Assembly “intended to grant the executive branch the authority to protect Hoosiers through an emergency declaration.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Zero Iowa nursing homes have active COVID-19 outbreaks as of Thursday, a milestone in the pandemic response nearly a year after the disease wound its way into the state. Nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to the disease and have accounted for nearly 40% of the state’s 5,600-plus deaths, despite making up less than 1% of the state’s population. Family visits to the facilities were strictly limited last spring as officials tried to keep the virus from finding a foothold in the facilities. That led to months of isolation for thousands of frail, elderly Iowans. “Without a doubt this has been probably the longest and most difficult journey for long-term care providers in their lifetimes,” Iowa Health Care Association Senior Vice President Lori Ristau said in an interview. “Residents are like a second family to them. So that was very traumatic and a lot to work through. That makes the progress we’re seeing even more meaningful and more joyful because of how long this road has been for them.” Nursing home residents, along with health care providers, were the top priority for immunization after vaccines arrived in the state in December. Gov. Kim Reynolds said during a Wednesday news conference that more than 90% of residents and 60% of staff have been vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are working to give prosecutors and courts time to clear a backlog of several thousand criminal cases that built up during the coronavirus pandemic, though they disagree about how much is enough time. The Senate approved a bill Wednesday night that would suspend until May 1, 2023, a law aimed at protecting defendants’ constitutional right to a speedy trial. The law requires cases to come to trial within five months of a defendant who has been jailed entering a plea and within six months if the defendant is free on bond. Lawmakers have said there’s a backlog of about 5,000 criminal cases, and prosecutors worry many of them will have to be dismissed if the deadlines are not suspended. “This is a serious public safety issue,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Kellie Warren, R-Leawood. “It’s a solution. It’s not ideal, but it’s that something that we still need.” The House approved its version of the measure three weeks ago, suspending the speedy trial deadlines for three years instead of two, until May 1, 2024. It can either accept the Senate’s version and send that to Gov. Laura Kelly or demand negotiations with senators. But some GOP conservatives and Democrats are nervous about suspending the deadlines, worried defendants will languish unnecessarily in jail.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Republican lawmakers have doubled down on demanding that the Democratic governor obtain their approval before spending the massive federal pandemic relief headed to the state. The lawmakers also started signaling their own priorities for allocating Kentucky’s share of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, passed by congressional Democrats over united Republican opposition. The state government is expected to receive about $2.4 billion. Friction between Gov. Andy Beshear and GOP lawmakers extended to the budget when the Legislature mostly held the line on spending, rejecting extra outlays Beshear wanted for education and other priorities. Now they’re trying to find a path forward on spending the federal relief. One potential place for common ground is broadband – a priority for Beshear and lawmakers alike. The GOP-dominated Legislature pushed through a bill Tuesday designating $250 million of the federal aid to extend broadband service to the hardest-to-reach regions of Kentucky. Meanwhile, Republicans tucked language into another spending bill Tuesday putting more restrictions on Beshear, saying the governor’s budget office would forfeit more than $900,000 into the state’s budget reserve fund if any of the federal funds are spent without the Legislature’s permission.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With states receiving steady supplies of vaccine, Gov. John Bel Edwards on Thursday further expanded eligibility to a long list of healthy essential workers who don’t have one of the two dozen medical conditions that already provided access to the shots. As the Democratic governor announced the widened eligibility, the state also kicked off an outreach campaign aimed at getting vaccines to people in underserved areas and persuading those who are skeptical, as the state continues to see available, unused appointments for its vaccine doses. The new immunization eligibility rules, which take effect Monday, will include workers at grocery stores, bars, restaurants and colleges. That’s expected to be the last expansion of access before Edwards throws open vaccinations to all adults around the state. Already, most of the adult population is expected to meet one of the eligibility criteria on the books. Those added to the list Monday will also include people who work at agricultural sites, post offices, manufacturing facilities, utility companies, construction sites, banks and veterinarian offices. Judges and their staff, public transit workers, river pilots, clergy, communications workers, people in the media and security staff all will be eligible.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Younger Mainers account for a growing number of COVID-19 infections in the state, raising concerns that they could fuel another spike. People in their 20s make up the highest percentage of new cases, about 18%, and those under 20 account for nearly 16%, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Together, those groups account for about a third of new infections, compared with residents over 70, who account for nearly 12% of cases but 85% of deaths. There are signs pointing to another wave of COVID-19 cases, and young people are most likely to facilitate that spike, Dr. James Jarvis, COVID-19 incident commander for Northern Light Health, told the Portland Press Herald. While younger people aren’t as likely to suffer from severe illness, they can still spread the coronavirus to others, including at-risk groups, often while having no symptoms themselves, Jarvis said. “If young people are infected and then go visit (others), that’s just one step away from an outbreak occurring.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Restaurants, retail outlets and gyms are among locations that will see a further loosening of COVID-19 restrictions just days after Mayor Brandon Scott pushed back against Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to reopen many businesses statewide. Beginning Friday, March 26, Baltimore will allow indoor dining at 50% of capacity and outdoor dining at 75% capacity, news outlets report. Religious facilities, retail, indoor and outdoor recreation, gyms and casinos will also be allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. Until now, indoor dining in Baltimore had been operating at 25% of capacity, as had gyms, retail, shopping malls and recreation. Outdoor dining was permitted at 50% of capacity. Scott’s order is still stricter than the reopening plan allowed under Hogan’s statewide order, announced last week, which allows for lifting capacity restrictions at restaurants and opening up large indoor and outdoor venues to 50% capacity. Scott weighed the city’s legal options for several days ahead of Hogan’s order becoming effective Friday and eventually announced the city would stick to its existing restrictions despite ambiguity about his power to do so under Hogan’s order. However, Scott, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the city will now begin reevaluating COVID-19 restrictions on a two-week basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Just in time for baseball season, ballparks, arenas, and indoor and outdoor stadiums will be allowed to open Monday with a strict 12% capacity limit after submitting a plan to the state Department of Public Health. The step is part of the state’s ongoing reopening efforts as Massachusetts continues to ramp up vaccination efforts and as hospitalizations associated with COVID-19 continue to drop, according to the Baker administration. Also Monday, gathering limits for event venues and in public settings will increase to 100 people indoors and 150 people outdoors. Outdoor gatherings at private residences and in private backyards will remain at a maximum of 25 people, with indoor house gatherings remaining at 10 people. Dance floors will be permitted at weddings and other events only, and overnight summer camps will be allowed to operate this summer. Exhibition and convention halls may also begin to operate, following gatherings limits and event protocols. Beginning Monday, Massachusetts will institute a new pandemic travel advisory that will urge everyone entering the state, including returning residents, to quarantine for 10 days after arriving if they’ve been out of state for 24 hours or more. An earlier advisory called for a 14-day quarantine and made it a mandate.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state had the country’s fifth-highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in the last week and is among 14 states where infections rose over the past two weeks, a trend that may be tied to the increasing prevalence of a more contagious coronavirus variant, health officials said Wednesday. The seven-day case average was 2,372, an increase of more than 1,000 from March 1. The average positivity rate, 6.4%, was 3.8% two weeks ago. Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive, said Michigan is in a “different place” than earlier in the pandemic because of vaccinations but warned that herd immunity is still quite some distance away. At least 25% of residents 16 and up have received at least one dose. State Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel said to achieve herd immunity and stop the uncontrolled spread of the virus, 90% to 95% of people will probably need to have immunity. Meanwhile, more than 220 Defense Department military and support personnel are expected at Ford Field in Detroit on Friday to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Shots are expected to start Wednesday and run for eight weeks. Lt. Gen. Laura J. Richardson, commander of U.S. Army North, said 6,000 vaccines can be administered each day at the site. “State government can’t tackle this pandemic and the vaccination drive alone,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Thursday during a news conference at Ford Field.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Officials at the Department of Natural Resources say sales of its statewide cross country ski pass have been the best in six years. The DNR says more than 17,900 people bought the Great Minnesota Ski Pass, which is required to access many trails in the state. The agency collected more than $510,000 from sales, which will go toward trail maintenance, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The Legislature in 2019 increased prices from $6 to $10 for the daily pass, from $20 to $25 for the annual pass and from $55 to $70 for the three-year pass. DNR spokeswoman Rachel Hopper said the trail maintenance fund saw decreasing revenue in recent years that forced a delayed payment to clubs in 2019, before the new prices were in effect. This winter’s boost, which she attributed in part to the COVID-19 pandemic steering people toward outdoor activity, has helped refill the fund. “Sales were so good that we were able to move the payments back to the normal timing,” Hopper said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A Millsaps College and Chism Strategies State of the State quarterly survey showed 63% of the more than 600 participants said they will “definitely or probably” get vaccinated against COVID-19. Another 25% noted they either would not get the shot or were unsure about it. That’s a significant leap from January, when the survey found almost 50% of people said they would refuse the vaccine or were uncertain. “We have seen a massive turnaround in just two months in the way Mississippians perceive the coronavirus vaccination program,” Nathan Shrader, Millsaps College Department of Government and Politics chair, said Thursday. He pointed to education about COVID-19 vaccines and encouragement from state officials and public health experts as the drivers that surged vaccination support. As of Thursday, more than 330,000 Mississippians were fully vaccinated, 11% of the state’s population. Among survey results, 55% of participants disagreed with Gov. Tate Reeves’ repeal of all county mask mandates, saying the decision was made too soon. Although Reeves rolled back mask mandates, state health officials continue to urge mask-wearing and social distancing.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: A new effort has begun in St. Louis County to help homebound residents and people with disabilities get vaccinations. The county health department is working with 15 fire and emergency management services districts to deliver COVID-19 vaccine to homes and independent living facilities, St. Louis Public Radio reports. “We’ve lined up a lot of partners, and we already have a lot of people who have been asking us for this for quite some time,” said Spring Schmidt, the county’s deputy director of public health. A pilot program began earlier this month with five fire districts. Schmidt said the county is expanding the effort to prioritize people who have no other choice than to have a vaccine delivered to their home. “Some homebound residents can rely on family members or loved ones to drive them to schedule appointments, but not everyone can immediately respond when a vaccine becomes available,” said Dawn Chapman, a member of the county’s disability commission who also is helping schedule vaccine appointments. Meanwhile, the Kansas City region is seeing a slight uptick in the rolling average for new coronavirus cases. The region, which includes Kansas City and its suburbs in both Missouri and Kansas, reported 160 new cases Wednesday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has a total of 19 confirmed cases of coronavirus variants in 11 counties, the state health department said Wednesday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the state this week of 11 tests that identified variants matching two California strains and another that originated in New York, along with three more cases of the United Kingdom variant already identified in Gallatin County. The California and New York variants involve specimens that were submitted for testing from January to early March in Beaverhead, Cascade, Glacier, Hill, Jefferson, Madison, Phillips, Roosevelt, Silver Bow and Valley counties. When these samples were initially submitted for testing, the California and New York versions had not yet been classified by CDC. Gallatin County has 11 known cases of the U.K. variant, including the three that were confirmed this week. “Montana continues to submit both random and suspect COVID-19 samples to the CDC for testing,” said Adam Meier, director of the Department of Public Health and Human Services. Meier stressed the best thing Montanans can do to protect themselves is get vaccinated and continue to follow CDC guidelines about wearing masks, social distancing, staying home if sick, washing hands often and avoiding large crowds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A variant of the coronavirus first found in Brazil has been found in the city, state health officials said. On Wednesday, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services confirmed two people in Douglas County had tested positive for the so-called Brazil P.1 variant, the Omaha World-Herald reports. That strain is believed to be responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in Brazil even though many people there had already developed COVID-19 and made antibodies against it. Investigations into the Douglas County cases are underway, state health officials said. As of Thursday, the state’s virus-tracking dashboard showed more than 205,500 people in Nebraska have tested positive for the virus, and 2,130 have died from COVID-19 since the outbreak began last year. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has decreased over the past two weeks, going from nearly 261 new cases per day March 2 to just over 232 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The city is making all residents 16 and older eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting April 5 as part of its efforts to inoculate the population as quickly as possible. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak on Wednesday said opening eligibility was made possible through the approval of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and increased production. But whether shots would be available, he said, depended on the supply delivered by the federal government. The timeline could mean appointments in the coming weeks open to hundreds of thousands more people in Nevada, where roughly 61% of the population is older than 18 and younger than 65. The state’s new timeline satisfies the goal that President Joe Biden announced last week, when he said he wanted everyone in the U.S. 18 and older to be eligible for vaccines by May 1. The timeline would not require Nevada to alter its vaccine playbook that prioritized and designated available doses for seniors and front-line workers. Throughout the state, teachers, health care workers, police officers and hospitality industry workers have already been made eligible to receive the vaccine, as have individuals ages 65 and older. Nevada also plans to make residents 16 and up with underlying health conditions eligible for shots Monday through partner pharmacies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: Keene State College is planning for a fully in-person fall semester. Currently, classes have been a mix of in-person, hybrid or online, with many campus activities curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic. But officials are planning to resume all in-person classes, athletic events, on-campus student activities and study-abroad opportunities in the fall. Keene State President Melinda Treadwell said officials expect to be in a better place by the end of the summer with the vaccine rollout underway. “Our students have told us loud and clear that they want to be together on campus in our community. We are having a successful spring semester, and are actively planning a shift to additional on-campus and in-person community experiences for the fall 2021 semester,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “Safety guided by science will remain a priority in the fall, and we will continue to carefully monitor the pandemic to make decisions accordingly.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson Township: Nothing, not even a global pandemic, can stop the team at Six Flags Great Adventure from entertaining guests year after year. The Jackson thrill park launches its 2021 season this month, with innovations necessitated by caution for COVID-19 still in place. “The pandemic required us to pivot and explore new ways to entertain, which included bringing back something from our past with a new twist,” said park marketing and public relations manager Kristin Fitzgerald. That something was the Six Flags Wild Safari Drive-Thru Adventure, which kicks off its season Saturday. The 4.5-mile trip across a 350-acre preserve housing approximately 1,200 animals resumed operation as a drive-thru experience in 2020 for the first time in nearly a decade. Across the park, COVID-19 safety measures remain in place, including a limit on daily attendance. All guests, including park members and season pass holders, must make advance reservations and are required to have been healthy for at least 14 days prior to visiting. All employees and guests older than 2 are required to wear masks covering their nose and mouth at all times, with the exception of designated mask break zones and in pools and waterpark attractions. Temperatures will be checked on arrival, and social distancing will be encouraged.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nKewa Pueblo: Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, made his first solo trip as the nation’s second gentleman Wednesday, stopping at a vaccination clinic in an Indigenous community in northern New Mexico and later meeting with a group of working mothers as part of an effort to promote the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. Looking east toward snowcapped mountains, Emhoff told tribal leaders it was an honor for Kewa Pueblo to be his first stop in the state as he and other top Democrats have spent the past few days traveling and talking about the funding that will be trickling down to families, businesses, tribes, cities and state governments over the coming months. He watched as Kylea Garcia got her vaccination and took the opportunity to encourage others to do the same. “Get the vaccine when it’s your turn,” he said, “because it will save your life, and it will save the lives of others. It’s the right thing to do. It’s safe, it’s painless, and it’s going to help us all get through this pandemic.” Kewa Pueblo, formerly known as Santo Domingo Pueblo, has vaccinated more than 4,300 people, including most of its tribal members. At the heart of its efforts to combat COVID-19 has been the pueblo’s health clinic, which has been transitioning from testing and contact tracing to vaccinations. It recently opened a drive-thru for second doses.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayor Bill de Blasio got his COVID-19 shot Thursday, then ripped embattled Gov. Andrew Cuomo, accusing the fellow Democrat of letting his personal political crisis influence important decisions on pandemic restrictions. The mayor’s ire revolved around Cuomo’s decision Wednesday to lift a ban on indoor fitness classes – just a day after de Blasio said it was still unsafe for groups of people to exercise together indoors. “The state of New York continues to make decisions without consulting the city of New York or our health experts or any locality, and this is why we need local control,” said de Blasio, who has long chafed under Cuomo’s broad power to set coronavirus policy. De Blasio implied that Cuomo, who is facing sexual harassment allegations from several women, is easing coronavirus restrictions to curry favor with a virus-weary public. “Is this being done because of what the data and science is telling us, or is this being done for political reasons?” de Blasio asked. “Because it sure as hell looks like a lot of these decisions are being made by the governor because of his political needs.” Reporters were barred from a news briefing Thursday at which Cuomo announced a plan to let fans return to Yankees and Mets games this season.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A sizable group of college students will be eligible for a vaccine in April, under guidance from the state Department of Health and Human Services. When North Carolina drafted its initial COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan in October 2020, college students were listed as a priority, just ahead of the general public. When schools reopened in August, the cohort proved it had the ability to rapidly contribute to community spread and fuel outbreaks through off-campus parties. But in January, North Carolina bumped the group from the priority list amid a backlash from state lawmakers and encouragement from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to give stronger preference to older adults and those working in certain job sectors. On Tuesday, health officials released a statement saying college students who live on campus or in other congregate settings will be able to receive starting April 7, regardless of their age, health condition or employment status. “We want to prioritize those in congregate settings,” state health department secretary Mandy Cohen said at a news conference Wednesday. “We know that’s where the virus spreads fastest, so that is why we’re doing that prioritization. I don’t think there’s going to be a huge time difference.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring has announced that applications are again being accepted for 2021 Specialty Crop Grants due to additional one-time funding from a coronavirus relief package passed by Congress late last year. “Projects that solely enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops in North Dakota are eligible for these grants,” Goehring said. “We encourage organizations, institutions and individuals to submit proposals on their own or in partnerships.” North Dakota has not yet received an allocation amount from USDA’s Agriculture Marketing Service but is expected to receive it in the next few weeks. The North Dakota Department of Agriculture will distribute the funds through a competitive grant program. Goehring said an information manual with application instructions, scoring criteria and an application template can be found on NDDA’s website. Applications must be submitted in electronic form by 4 p.m. CDT April 7. Applications will then be reviewed, scored, ranked and provided to Agriculture Commissioner Goehring to determine which will be forwarded to USDA for final approval in May. Projects funded by the grants start Oct. 1, 2021, and must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: High school juniors and seniors will be able to substitute their end-of-year grades for the statewide final exams as soon as the governor signs a bill passed nearly unanimously by the Ohio House and Senate on Wednesday. The legislation also waives the American history exam requirement, lets schools spend extra time administering all federally required tests and exempts home-schooled kids from yearly evaluations. “Our freshman and sophomore classes, though they were excluded, will still have time to meet the necessary requirements for graduation,” said Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond. The bill’s passage followed weeks of debate about how to modify state testing requirements for students during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to sign the bill. The original plan had been to let school districts choose whether they wanted to test kids at all. That idea became impossible in February when the Biden administration announced it wouldn’t be handing out waivers to federal testing requirements. So lawmakers quickly moved to determine how to test without harming students who’ve fallen behind during the pandemic. The exam results will be published by the Ohio Department of Education but won’t impact school rankings or eligibility for the EdChoice scholarship program.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Muscogee (Creek) Nation Department of Health and the federal Indian Health Service said Wednesday that they will provide 4,000 vaccinations to all Native Americans and members of their households during a two-day clinic next week. Any member of a federally recognized tribe and members of their households, Native American or not, are eligible for an appointment, said Muscogee (Creek) Health Secretary Shawn Terry. The March 26-27 clinic will be held at River Spirit Expo Center, the Tulsa World reports. About 21,000 of the tribal nation’s estimated 65,000 Oklahoma citizens have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and the clinic is an effort to reach out to a larger population of Native Americans, according to Terry. “It’s a way for us to do a large event in an urban setting and do it efficiently,” he said. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Wednesday reported a total of 433,516 coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and nearly 1.5 million vaccinations. The federal Centers for Disease Control has reported 7,610 deaths in Oklahoma due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the state health department.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: All adult residents will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine beginning May 1, state health officials confirmed Wednesday. Last week, following President Joe Biden’s pledge to make all adults eligible for vaccines by May 1, Gov. Kate Brown said she would not change the state’s eligibility schedule until she was sure Oregon would receive enough vaccines. Since then officials said they have received an order from the United States Department of Health and Human Services that directs vaccination sites to make the change with eligibility. “We are following up with the administration for more specifics about when vaccine shipments to states will increase, but in a briefing with governors earlier this week, it was clear the White House has worked hard to secure additional vaccine supplies for states in the coming weeks,” Charles Boyle, a spokesman from the governor’s office, said Wednesday. Those who can currently receive the vaccine include health care workers, first responders, teachers and residents over age 65. People who are 45 or older with a preexisting condition, seasonal and migrant farmworkers, food processors, the homeless and those affected by last summer’s wildfires are scheduled to become eligible March 29.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Health officials on Thursday announced changes to the state’s vaccine provider map to make finding appointments more accessible. The provider map will now allow the public to easily see what pharmacies and providers have received first doses of vaccine each week, Executive Deputy Secretary of Health Keara Klinepeter said. “It is also important to remember that doses do not equal appointments,” she said. “Even if a provider has received an allocation of doses, the provider is the best source of information as to whether they have appointments available.” Klinepeter said the state intends to centralize information on which providers have appointments available onto the map in the coming weeks. That will be important as the state moves toward opening vaccination appointments to more Pennsylvanians by May 1. Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said the department is currently working to restructure where vaccine doses are being sent to make sure the most Pennsylvanians possible are receiving shots. Beam said Pennsylvania is ranked second in the nation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for number of doses administered per 100,000 residents statewide. In total, 1.3 million Pennsylvanians are fully vaccinated, and 2.5 million have gotten a first dose.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: All residents ages 16 and older will be eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine starting April 19, Gov. Daniel McKee said Thursday. The change is possible because the state has learned it will be getting significantly more vaccine from the federal government in the near future, the Democratic governor said at a news conference. President Joe Biden promised last week that all the nation’s adults would be eligible by May 1. “If Rhode Island can get the vaccine supply we need, we can achieve and beat this goal,” he said. “We are confident the president will deliver.” He warned that it will likely take two weeks or so for everyone who wants an appointment to book one, but the goal is to provide a first dose of the vaccine to everyone who signs up by the end of May. The state has already given more than 282,000 vaccine first doses, while more than 136,000 people, or about 12% of the state population, have been fully vaccinated, state Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said. But she said mask-wearing is still important. If 70% of the state population is vaccinated, the state could lift COVID-19 emergency restrictions, McKee said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Clemson University is planning to have a mostly normal fall semester with more students in classrooms and more fans at football games. Thanks to weeks of low coronavirus spread on campus and the increased efforts of the state’s vaccine rollout, Clemson President Jim Clements announced the university would be almost all in-person next fall. “Almost all courses” will be offered completely in-person next semester, Clements said in a memo. This semester, about one-third of classes are completely in-person. Students and faculty will still be able to request virtual accommodations due to the coronavirus, but Clements said the school is banking on the community to be widely vaccinated by the time classes resume Aug. 18. Still, “we will continue to put the health of our staff, faculty, students, and community members first as we plan for the fall,” Clements said. Clemson spokesperson Joe Galbraith said the university will let employees and students continue to work from home only on a “case-by-case” basis. COVID-19 guidelines on capacity, masking and social distancing will remain in place until further notice, though, according to Galbraith.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has repealed an ordinance that required residents to put garbage containers curbside if their garbage hauler requested it. The ordinance, which was passed in April 2020 and repealed Tuesday evening in a 8-0 vote, was aimed at helping local garbage haulers facing workforce problems during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to save time during pickup. Its repeal means the city’s previous rules on garbage will once more be in effect, requiring garbage cans to be stored in an “inconspicuous place” and not put on the curb for pickup. Councilor Alex Jensen said he’d like to hear from Public Works at a future informational meeting about what they’d learned during that period and whether there were any changes that should or shouldn’t be considered.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Restaurant patrons can now sit eight to a table and dine until 1a.m., according to a new Shelby County health directive issued Wednesday. The directive, which goes into effect at midnight Saturday, still requires people seated together at restaurants to be from the same family or close contact group. Customers can stay until 1:30 a.m. to complete their meal or pay. Additionally, the Shelby County Health Department issued a new mask mandate, effective Wednesday, clarifying that people who cannot medically tolerate wearing a face covering do not have to wear a face shield. People declining to wear a face covering because of a medical condition are not required to show medical documentation. The mandate also clarifies that scarves, ski masks and balaclavas are not substitutes for masks, although coverings made of “suitable layered fabrics” are acceptable. Medical- or procedure-grade masks are recommended but not required.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: A woman who was recorded on police body camera video refusing to wear a mask at a bank last week was arrested Wednesday after declining to wear a mask inside another Texas business. Terry Wright, 65, already had a warrant out for her arrest after she refused to wear a mask in a Bank of America branch in Galveston last Thursday. On the video, she taunts the officer, asking if he’s going to arrest her. Police arrested Wright on Wednesday after she entered the Office Depot in Texas City and said she would not cover her nose and mouth to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, police spokesman Cpl. Allen Bjerke said. She was arrested on Galveston warrants for trespassing and resisting arrest, Bjerke said. Wright, of Grants Pass, Oregon, was taken into custody without incident, Bjerke said, noting that she was not charged for trespassing at the office supply store and that no additional charges were expected. Gov. Greg Abbott last week lifted statewide orders requiring people to wear face masks in public, declaring businesses should decide for themselves which COVID-19 precautions to take on their properties. Many businesses have kept their own mask rules in place.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All adults can begin signing up for a COVID-19 vaccine next Wednesday – one week earlier than previously planned because the state has unallocated doses, Gov. Spencer Cox said Thursday. About 15% of the state’s supply isn’t being claimed by eligible people making appointments, the Republican governor said. He acknowledged that opening up eligibility so widely means there won’t be enough vaccines for all residents over 18 at first but the goal is to prevent vaccines from going unused. “We always want to keep demand above availability,” Cox said during a televised news conference on PBS-Utah. Utah teenagers 16 and older may also have a chance to get the Pfizer vaccine in some parts of the state starting next week too, Cox said. New coronavirus cases have been decreasing since January. More than 714,000 of the state’s 3.2 million residents have been fully vaccinated, according to state data. More than 380,000 virus cases have been reported in Utah, along with 2,041 known deaths, according to state data.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A committee of more than two dozen health care providers and advocates is calling for the immediate vaccination of the state’s prison inmates. WCAX-TV reports the memo from the COVID-19 Vaccine Implementation Advisory Committee to Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine, dated Monday, says inmates have little or no ability to protect themselves or demand better conditions. The memo comes as the Department of Corrections continues to cope with an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport, the state’s largest prison. Gov. Phil Scott has said inmates are vaccinated when they fit within the state’s guidelines for age or high-risk medical conditions. All inmates will be eligible for vaccination by the end of April. “There are dozens and dozens of groups, sectors and populations who have requested prioritization. A case can be made for each,” said Scott spokesperson Jason Maulucci. “But with a limited supply, everyone can’t be at the front of the line, so preservation of life must be the top priority.” On Wednesday, the Department of Corrections reported 12 new cases of the coronavirus at the Newport prison, 10 among inmates and two among staff. There are currently 40 cases among inmates and six among staff at the prison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Schools and colleges can hold outdoor graduation ceremonies with as many as 5,000 attendees. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports Gov. Ralph Northam made the announcement Wednesday. The Democratic governor said Virginia will restrict capacity at outdoor ceremonies to 5,000 people or 30% of the venue’s capacity, whichever is lower. Indoor ceremonies will be capped at 500 people or 30% of the venue’s capacity. All attendees will need to wear masks and socially distance themselves. “While graduation and commencement ceremonies will still be different than they were in the past, this is a tremendous step forward for all of our schools, our graduates and their families,” Northam said in a statement. School districts and colleges across the state are still deciding how best to honor this year’s graduates, though Liberty University said Thursday that it will offer an outdoor, in-person ceremony and an online option. The University of Virginia is considering two proposals: holding an in-person graduation this spring with no guests or postponing graduation until guests can attend. Virginia Tech intends to host several in-person ceremonies with a restricted number of guests. It will also host an online ceremony.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal judge on Thursday dismissed an industry lawsuit that sought to block a $4-an-hour pay boost for Seattle grocery workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour issued the ruling after hearing oral arguments earlier in the day. “This is a big win for grocery store employees who have been critical and vulnerable frontline workers since the start of the pandemic,” City Attorney Pete Holmes said in a statement. The Seattle City Council in January approved the pay boost for workers at large grocery stores, to remain in effect as long as the city has a declared civil emergency related to the pandemic. Assistant City Attorney Jeremiah Miller told the judge the hazard pay was justified by the facts that the employees work among members of the public and are at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus and that grocery companies have made record profits during the pandemic. The judge rejected arguments by the Northwest Grocery Association and the Washington Food Industry Association that the pay increase interfered with collective bargaining and discriminated against large grocery stores. The industry warned that some stores would be unable to absorb the increased labor costs, especially those like Grocery Outlet that operate on smaller margins.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Supreme Court won’t be making its annual trip to the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown this year as a result of COVID-19, but the special docket of cases will be heard virtually. The school and the court have made arrangements to allow students and the public to watch the arguments online, Chief Justice Evan Jenkins said in a news release. “We will miss being on campus next week and the opportunity to meet in person with the students, but the justices are committed to continuing our outreach efforts even in a COVID environment,” Jenkins said. Documents for the cases have been posted online. The arguments will be streamed Tuesday on the court’s YouTube channel through a link on the West Virginia judiciary website. The court also will judge the finals of the Baker Cup Moot Court appellate advocacy competition at 1 p.m. The final competition will also be livestreamed.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Implementing a new call center to help unemployed people 24 hours a day, seven days a week is moving ahead with the signing of a $1.2 million contract, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced Thursday. The state Department of Workforce Development received a $2.4 million federal grant that it is using to begin overhauling the 50-year-old computer system that Evers has blamed for causing delays in helping customers and getting out unemployment benefits amid the coronavirus pandemic. Problems with the state’s call center, which was unable to handle the massive spike in calls particularly early on in the pandemic, will be the first target for improvements with the system. Republicans have blamed the Democratic governor for not doing more sooner to address the problem, and a state audit showed less than 1% of calls to the hotline were answered by state officials. Evers fired Caleb Frostman, the former secretary of the department that handles unemployment claims, and pushed the Legislature to approve new funding to upgrade the computer system. Lawmakers have known for years that the department’s computer system and software were out of date, but the pandemic laid bare the problems. The department hopes to have the new call center up and running within six months.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Shots of COVID-19 vaccine are now available or soon will be for anybody over 18 in almost one-third of the state’s counties. In the past few months, vaccines have been available to health care workers, first responders, residents of long-term care facilities and senior citizens, among others. Vaccines are now widely available or close to being in eight of Wyoming’s 23 counties: Campbell, Converse, Fremont, Hot Springs, Johnson, Sheridan, Washakie and Weston, Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman Kim Deti said Thursday. At the same time, anybody who qualified for a vaccine earlier can still get it, Campbell County Public Health Director Jane Glaser told the Gillette News Record. The department recently got almost $500,000 in federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act funding to help with vaccination clinic costs. “We were not getting complete supplies with the shipments of vaccines,” Glaser said. “We’ve had to use our own funds to purchase syringes and various things.” Campbell County Public Health has been doing three vaccination clinics per week, averaging between 260 and 300 vaccines per clinic. “We’re having a really good rollout with the vaccine so far, but it’s definitely not going to be over anytime soon,” Glaser said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/29/beggars-night-stranger-hotel-stays-haunted-history-news-around-states/49302057/", "title": "Beggars' Night, 'Stranger' hotel stays: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Special tours Friday at Old Alabama Town, an otherwise charming group of restored 19th- and 20th-century structures, aim to show the frightful side of history. “It’s interwoven with character stories, as well as the history of the buildings and the people,” said Ella Martin, special events coordinator for Landmarks Foundation of Montgomery, who will be one of the tour guides for the Haunting at Old Alabama Town. Tickets are $25 at landmarksfoundation.com. There is limited space, and no tickets will be sold at the door. Tours will go through 10 buildings in Old Alabama Town’s Living Block, starting in Lucas Tavern, where guests be greeted by the ghost of Eliza Lucas, who ran the establishment. From there, a guide will lead guests to the Yancey dogtrot home, where Southern secession leader William Lowndes Yancey – the man Abraham Lincoln held responsible for the Civil War – lived and died. One of the darker stops will be Dr. Duncan’s office. “People were dying. Death was prevalent,” Martin said. “It’ll be a little scary because he’ll have his amputation kit and tell what he had to do take care of people since there weren’t any antibiotics around.” There’s also a gruesome story of a teenage horse rider from the Martin-Barnes House, whose life ended after being impaled on a fence. “He didn’t come home for supper,” Martin said. “He’ll be around to give his story. We’ll have a real horse there with its ghostly rider.” The tours are family-friendly but rated PG-13.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: An impromptu fundraiser to allow a library to purchase books amid cries of censorship has twice surpassed its goal. The fund was established after the Kenai City Council delayed accepting a $1,500 grant until the library director provide a list of the books that would be purchased with the money. The grant was intended to buy library materials related to health and wellness, including mental health, suicide prevention, self-care, and reference books about Medicare and Medicaid, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The council asked Kenai Community Library Director Katja Wolfe to provide an inventory of proposed purchases to be funded by the Collection Equity Award grant, from Region 5 of the Network of the National Library of Medicine. Kenai Peninsula residents Sovala Kisena and Todd Smith said they organized the crowdsourcing page to raise funds for the library and act as a positive response to the council’s action. “It’s the definition of censorship … and it bothered me,” Smith said. Before the council voted to postpone action at its Oct. 20 meeting, one resident questioned whether any of the books would be about the coronavirus, the Clarion reports. Another said he took particular issue with the term “equity” in the name of the award and asked if the grant would be “enhancing some sort of a federal agenda … which would not necessarily represent the views of the people of Kenai.” “I think equity can create division,” Peck said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, which is facing a spike in COVID-19 cases, is prohibiting trick-or-treating and haunted houses on Halloween. COVID-19 cases are up 140% over this time last year, according to an emergency declaration signed by community President Martin Harvier and posted on the community’s Facebook page. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community has land adjacent to Scottsdale, Tempe, Fountain Hills and Mesa. The community was created in 1879 and represents two pre-American tribes: the Pima and Maricopa, according to the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community appears to be the first jurisdiction in Arizona to publicly ban trick-or-treating. Arizona health experts are advising that people who do go out on Halloween to take precautions. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, advises people who do choose to take part in the tradition this year to remain outside and avoid crowds, such as Halloween parties. Children should also use hand sanitizer or wash their hands with soap and water after they get home and before they eat any treats, Banner Health officials said. Also, they should try to keep 6 feet away from anyone who doesn’t live with them.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state filed a consumer protection lawsuit Wednesday against a medical supplier for nearly $11 million for failing to deliver supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said. Rutledge said Wednesday that Med-Care Healthlink LLC of Suffolk, Virginia, and its representatives failed to deliver gowns, ventilators and face shields ordered in March and April 2020 to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “This had been a company the state had worked with previously, and so therefore there was no reason to believe at that point that we would have something this significant occur,” Rutledge said. A phone call to the company rang unanswered. Deputy Attorney General Shannon Halijan said state officials were told at various times that the supplies had been bought by another entity, were held in China or were in other states. UAMS attorney Sherri Robinson said the company initially responded to questions about the supplies, then stopped after four to six months. UAMS ordered 1.5 million medical gowns and 60 ventilators, while the state ordered 2.5 million gowns, 500 ventilators and 1 million medical face shields, Rutledge said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTahoe City: Drought fueled by climate change has dropped Lake Tahoe below its natural rim and halted flows into the Truckee River, a historically cyclical event that’s occurring sooner and more often than in the past, raising fears about what might be in store for the famed alpine lake. Scientists are concerned that the growing frequency of low-water extremes may become the new normal. They point to seasonal shifts in weather patterns causing precipitation that historically falls as snow to arrive in the form of rain atop the Sierra along the California-Nevada state line. “Our summers are lasting longer. Springs are coming sooner,” said Gregory Schladow, a water resource and environmental engineering professor who is the founding director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center. Over the past century, the amount of precipitation falling as snow has declined from 52% in 1910 to 33% in 2020 and is projected to drop below 20% by the end of the century, according to experts at the research center. Rain runs off the mountains instead of piling up as snow on mountaintops for safe storage until it is most needed in late spring and summer – the high Sierra equivalent of leaving a freezer door open atop a refrigerator. Since summer, boat ramps have been closed. Docks sit precariously above the receding lake’s dry bottom. Boat and kayaking rentals have fallen, and river rafting operations on the Truckee River had to end early. “Our season was short, and we fear there may not be one next summer,” said Toni Rudnick of the Truckee River Raft Company.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has issued a restraining order against a suburban Denver county’s policy allowing parents to opt their children out of a mask mandate at school, finding that the rule violates the rights of students with disabilities who are vulnerable to COVID-19. U.S. District Judge John L. Kane on Tuesday called the Douglas County Board of Health order that allowed parents to opt their children out of mask-wearing a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to education for all. Kane’s order came in a hearing about a lawsuit filed by the Douglas County School District challenging the county Board of Health order. The school district, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of nine children with disabilities, argued that the board’s action allowed a relaxation of universal masking that placed those students at high risk of severe disease, The Denver Post reports. The school district also challenged the Board of Health’s relaxation of quarantine rules affecting students suspected of having the coronavirus. Kane’s order is not the end of the legal challenge, even though it sets aside the opt-out rule for now, and he set a Nov. 8 hearing about the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: An early 18th-century painting depicting Yale University’s namesake with an enslaved Black child has been returned to public display at one of its museums even as art experts investigate its origins and amid campus discussions about the school’s ties to slavery. The nearly life-size, oil-on-canvas portrait shows Elihu Yale and family members sitting at a table with tobacco pipes and wine glasses, while an enslaved boy with a metal collar locked around his neck looks on. In the background are playing children, believed to be Yale’s grandchildren. The Yale Center for British Art removed the painting from display in October 2020 to conduct a technical analysis, which continues and includes efforts to identify the boy, as well as to confirm the identities of the others. Over the years, some patrons expressed concerns about the depiction of an enslaved child, but that was not a reason for removing it, said Courtney Martin, the center’s director. For several months, the painting was replaced by a 2016 work of art by Titus Kaphar that included a portrait of just the enslaved boy, without the metal collar, on top of what appears to be a crumpled version of the original painting. There is no evidence Elihu Yale owned slaves. His papers, including financial records, have not been found. But experts believe Yale oversaw slave trading and other commerce in India. There are other paintings showing Yale with slaves, and his relatives in New Haven were slave owners, researchers say.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Delaware Art Museum is reprising an exhibition 50 years after its premiere, in the wake of a nearly yearlong occupation of the city by the National Guard. National Guardsmen focused primarily on West Center City, a mostly Black community, after rioting and unrest following Dr. Martin Luther King’s murder. The trauma of those nine months in 1968 left the community reeling, and Percy Ricks, an artist and longtime educator, had something he thought people needed to see: a momentous exhibition of drawings, paintings, prints and photographs created by 66 Black artists. Ricks, the first Black art instructor in Wilmington’s public schools, was a driving force behind the city’s art scene. He went on to found arts and humanities collective Aesthetic Dynamics Inc., which aimed to highlight Black artists and their contributions to the arts. Still, the organization’s inaugural exhibition struggled to find a home as Black artists were shut out of institutions and as segregation persisted across Delaware. It eventually premiered at the Wilmington Armory but has largely been forgotten and overlooked by historians and institutions. Now, the Delaware Art Museum – which at the time overlooked requests to stage the exhibition – is trying to reconcile its initial disregard and to illustrate the cultural legacy Ricks left behind.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Earlier this month, a federal judge held two top officials from the D.C. Department of Corrections in contempt over a delay in handing over medical records for a Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendant. Now, the Department of Justice says he appears to have “invented” the emergency that led to that decision, WUSA-TV reports. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth hauled D.C. Jail Warden Wanda Patten and D.C. Department of Corrections Director Quincy Booth into court Oct. 13 to explain why the jail hadn’t complied with his order the prior week to turn over an orthopedic specialist’s notes about a hand surgery for Christopher Worrell. The Florida man has been in D.C. Jail custody since his arrest in March on multiple felony charges in connection with the insurrection, accused of joining other members of the Proud Boys in storming the U.S. Capitol and assaulting federal officers with pepper gel spray. In May, Worrell fell in his cell and broke his pinky finger. In filings, he claimed officials didn’t get him the proper medical treatment, and he’d need surgery because of the delay. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said a Howard University Hospital doctor determined Worrell’s hand had already healed normally, and he was suffering no pain or loss of function. Prosecutors said his records show he was “primarily dissatisfied with the appearance of his pinky finger” and demanded surgery even after the doctor told him the risks could outweigh the benefits.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state has withheld funding from two school districts over their coronavirus mask mandates, flouting threats from White House officials who warned that such penalties would violate federal law. School officials in Alachua and Broward counties on Wednesday said the state docked school board salaries and overall funding in amounts equal to federal aid packages meant to blunt the state’s sanctions on mask requirements. This month, more than $164,000 was withheld from the Alachua school district, and more than $455,000 was withheld from Broward. The penalties are the latest development in an ongoing feud between the White House and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration over coronavirus regulations. The Florida State Board of Education earlier this month approved plans to withhold a month’s salary from school board members in districts with classroom mask requirements and reduce overall funding if those counties receive a federal grant intended to offset the state’s fines. The announcements come days after the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to Florida warning that deducting money from districts that received the grant would violate federal law. The letter added that the federal government “is prepared to initiate enforcement action to stop these impermissible state actions.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A high school is marking its new name and a larger building after students said the old name was offensive and pushed to remove it. Midtown High School hosted a ceremony this week to highlight the new name of the former Henry W. Grady High School, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Students had complained for years that their school was named after Grady, a newspaper editor who advocated for white supremacy after the Civil War. While credited by many with helping in the rebirth of Atlanta after the war, Grady also wrote editorials and gave speeches that ignored the plight of Black people in the region. Grady was an editor and part-owner of The Atlanta Constitution.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Starting next week, the city will allow outdoor and indoor entertainment venues to operate at full capacity with vaccinated attendees, the mayor said Wednesday as he announced the latest measures easing coronavirus restrictions. Patrons will have to wear masks, Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference. No food will be allowed, only water, he said. The change will take effect Nov. 3, in time for the next University of Hawaii football home game a few days later, when the Warriors host San Jose State. Blangiardi said the city plans to allow the Honolulu Marathon to go ahead Dec. 12, though the race will be required to stagger runners’ starting times. Competitors will leave the starting line in groups of no more than 200 people at a time, he said. He expressed confidence that the city was ready to relax its rules, noting Honolulu has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. As of Wednesday, 95% of the population 12 and older had received at least one shot. The mayor said the city still has public safety and public health at top of mind, and it will be ready to tighten restrictions again if COVID-19 hospitalization metrics deteriorate. “This is about going forward and living with it,” the mayor said of the virus.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The company that successfully brought genetically modified potatoes to the market announced an agreement Thursday to help a plant breeding company grow strawberries they say will stay fresh longer and have a longer growing season. J.R. Simplot Co. and California-based Plant Sciences Inc., both privately held companies, said they expect to launch the first commercially available, gene-edited strawberries within a few years. U.S. growers produced $2.2 billion in strawberries in 2020, mostly in California, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But consumers discarded an estimated 35% of the crop due to spoilage. Simplot and Plant Sciences officials said genetically modified strawberries will help reduce waste and make them available to consumers much of the year. The strawberries will only contain genes from strawberries, selecting desirable traits that have been cultivated over decades. “It’s the same technology we’re working on with potatoes,” said Doug Cole, director of Marketing and Biotech Affairs at Simplot. There is no evidence that genetically modified organisms, known as GMOs, are unsafe to eat, but changing the genetic code of foods presents an ethical issue for some. Federal agencies approved a previous gene-modifying technique on Simplot potatoes. Now, more than 1.1 billion pounds of the potatoes are sold in some 40 states and 4,000 supermarkets and 9,000 restaurants.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate on Thursday night approved a weakened and criticized plan to preserve ramifications for those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Democrats who control both houses of the General Assembly struggled through caustic debate all week in pushing a COVID-19 carve-out of the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act. The Senate endorsed the plan 31-24 on the last day of the Legislature’s fall session. Initially approved in the 1970s to protect physicians from repercussions for refusing, based on religious beliefs, to perform abortions, supporters argue the law was never intended to give similar protections to people who refuse to get a preventive shot in a worldwide pandemic. “Your right to exercise your religious belief is not always without consequence, and the Health Care Right of Conscience is not a defense in certain circumstances,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said during floor debate. “You’ve asked where we draw the line. The line of my personal liberty ends at the beginning of your nose.” Lawsuits have sprung up – nine alone in which Gov. J.B. Pritzker or other public agencies are defendants – in which repercussions, such as losing a job, are being contested based on the right of conscience law. The proposal, which now goes to Pritzker, doesn’t require anyone to be vaccinated. It targets the law’s language prohibiting retribution, such as dismissal from a job, in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A hotel offers guests a chance to enter the “Upside Down” with themed accommodations based on the Netflix series “Stranger Things,” set in the fictional Indiana town of Hawkins. Entering Graduate Bloomington yields a few subtle hints. The hotel’s ground floor mixes framed Eggo waffle art and a photo of the faded Starcourt Mall facade with older references to famous Hoosiers and pop culture. Its restaurant, Poindexter, offers an Upside Down burger and Demogorgon smoothie on the menu. And on the third floor, spaces once occupied by rooms 318 and 320 now house the “Upside Down Experience,” a suite with detailed recreations of two key settings from the sci-fi hit. The suite’s showstopper is an alphabet and Christmas light wall, like the one Winona Ryder’s character, Joyce Byers, uses to communicate with her captured son, Will. The Wheelers’ basement serves as the suite’s bedroom, complete with a Dungeons and Dragons game. General Manager Corey Parton said the suite, which opened to the public Tuesday, is meant to be an immersive experience. Guests are loaned Polaroid cameras for an ’80s documentation of their visits, as well as Eleven’s Eggo Extravaganza – a recreation of the main character’s iconic meal of three waffles doused in whipped cream and candy. A stay also includes two passes to the nearby WonderLab Science Museum, as a nod to the main characters’ love for science. Graduate also donates 11% of the suite’s profits to WonderLab.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Beggars’ Night is nearly here. Trick-or-treaters in the city go out Oct. 30, not Oct. 31, in a quirky tradition started about 80 years ago to curb the violence and vandalism that had become an annual problem. In the 1930s, a long list of teenage miscreants who’d spent the night soaping windows, setting fires and tossing bricks at homes was published every year in the Nov. 1 newspaper. Kathryn Krieg, then the director of recreation for the Des Moines Playground Commission (now the Parks and Recreation Department), proposed naming Oct. 30 “Beggars’ Night” and sending children out to perform for homeowners after saying “tricks-for-eats.” Children were to receive a treat “only if such a ‘trick’ as a song, a poem, a stunt or a musical number, either solo or in group participation, is presented.” The event reversed the conventional tradition of asking homeowners to provide a treat to avoid being tricked or pranked. Beggars’ Night gained traction and in 1942 was promoted as a way for children to play a part in the war effort. The rallying headline “Kids! - Don’t help the Axis on Halloween” topped an Oct. 29, 1942, Des Moines Register article. It also chided teenagers for soaping windows, saying that “soap wasted … means waste of an ingredient used in manufacture of high explosives.”\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Construction on a national laboratory to study diseases that can be spread from animals to humans has been delayed, federal officials said. Officials said earlier this year that the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan would be substantially completed by this October. Now, the construction is expected to finish next spring, with commission of the laboratory in the summer, The Manhattan Mercury reports. The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Agriculture are collaborating on opening the facility. A Homeland Security official said technology upgrades and equipment installation are taking longer than expected. “The technology efficacy of the building is of the utmost importance and is a critical aspect of standing up this facility,” Tim Barr, NBAF program manager for Homeland Security, said in a statement. “We are testing individual systems and testing again as systems are integrated with other systems, so it is very difficult to predict how long it will take to ensure each system is working as intended given the complexities of the facility.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture began managing operations and maintenance in the facility earlier this month.\n\nKentucky\n\nHazard: The superintendent of Hazard Independent Schools said that “appropriate disciplinary action has been taken” after photos surfaced showing students giving lap dances to staff and wearing scant clothing as part of Hazard High School’s homecoming week festivities. Students and staff took part in a “Man Pageant” and “Costume Day” on Tuesday, according to Hazard High School’s Facebook page. Photos that were subsequently taken down from the athletics department’s Facebook page showed students in underclothing giving lap dances to faculty and staff, including Principal Donald “Happy” Mobelini, who is also mayor of the Perry County city. Other photos on the athletics page that also were later taken down showed female students dressed up in “Hooters” outfits and students and staff appearing to paddle one another. Mobelini, the principal and mayor, did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. “Um. Exactly what is going on here, y’all? C’mon Hazard,” Nema Brewer, cofounder of education advocacy group KY 120 United, wrote Tuesday night in a tweet that showed the lap dance photos. “Get it together.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Violence at a high school has stopped since a group of fathers started patrolling the campus, and the dads are aiming to expand their initiative into a movement across the parish. “Dads on Duty” started in response to a series of fights at Southwood High School in September that led to the arrests of about two dozen students. Michael LaFitte gathered other parents after a Sept. 17 incident to form a strategy for combating violence at the school. Expected to meet for 45 minutes that weekend, the group solidified a plan four hours later. “At the end of the meeting, there was a group of fathers who decided to just go to the school and patrol and walk around and show a strong male presence on the campus,” LaFitte said. “I don’t care how old you are or what size you are – it’s something about seeing a man, a positive male figure, a father, your daddy or whatever you want to call them, at the school. It will make you straighten up and fly right.” On the Monday after the meeting, a group of fathers showed up before the 7:30 a.m. bell to usher students inside. Dads have been there every morning since, with about 40 now taking shifts to patrol during lunch and after school, too. They’ve tried to assume the roles of “cool uncles” to the students, according to LaFitte. He said there have not been any fights on campus since they started.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Forestry officials are asking residents who want to decorate for the fall and winter to be on the lookout for common invasive plants. The plants are sometimes used in wreaths and garlands and other decorations, according to the Maine Department of Agricultural, Conservation and Forestry. State law prohibits the import or sale of invasive plants in any form. The forestry department said the most common invasive plants in the decorations are Asiatic bittersweet and multiflora rose. The plants can cause environmental damage and overtake forests, wetlands and backyards. The state said the plants are also difficult to control and can re-sprout after being cut. It’s asking decorators to use native species, such as winterberry holly, red twig dogwood and American mountain ash.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: The city will move forward with its plans for a multimillion-dollar indoor sports facility, despite calls to slow down the project. The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to enter into an agreement with Eastern Sports Management to develop the structure, along with authorizing city staff members to prepare a demolition contract for Municipal Stadium, which sits on the property where the structure will be built. The money will come from the city’s fiscal year 2021 general fund surplus. Early estimates for the new indoor turf facility were around $7 million, but it is now estimated to cost between $10 million and $20 million, according to city officials. The city will be responsible for tearing down Municipal Stadium, which will cost about $100,000.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A hospital says someone hacked into its employee email system, potentially exposing the personal information of thousands of patients. UMass Memorial Health notified patients earlier this month if their information was involved in the breach, which occurred between June 2020 and January. The personal data included Social Security numbers, insurance information and medical information. More than 200,000 patients and health plan participants could have been affected by the breach, according to a federal database of cybersecurity incidents at medical facilities. The hospital said it had investigated the incident but couldn’t determine how much of the personal information might have been stolen. Affected patients will receive free credit monitoring and data protection assistance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state Supreme Court has agreed to take another look at a law that allows communities to collect millions of dollars from poor criminal defendants to pay salaries, keep lights on, and wax floors in courthouses up and down the state. The issue is whether it’s unconstitutional, especially when a judge knows a conviction will bring in cash and please local officials who count on the money to ease budget pressures. The Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday saying it would hear arguments in a case from Alpena County. Travis Johnson was ordered to pay $1,200 in local court costs for a pair of convictions. The court especially wants to hear whether the law “deprives criminal defendants of their right to appear before an impartial judge.” A judge can order people convicted of crimes to pay a portion of a court’s operating costs, such as salaries, utilities and other services. Someone who is acquitted doesn’t get a bill for overhead, nor do parties in a civil lawsuit. If prosecutors lose a case, money isn’t deducted from their budget. From 2016 through 2019, courts collected $172 million, nearly 75% of it in district courts, which handle traffic tickets, drunken driving cases and other misdemeanors mostly committed by people who can least afford it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A judge has denied a defense request to dismiss the most serious charge against a former suburban police officer who said she meant to use a Taser instead of a handgun when she fatally shot Black motorist Daunte Wright. Former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter will stand trial in Hennepin County on first- and second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of Wright, who was shot after being stopped April 11 for a traffic violation. Potter, who is white, was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter, which requires a finding that she acted with “culpable negligence” in Wright’s death. Prosecutors later added a first-degree manslaughter count against Potter, alleging she recklessly handled a firearm and endangered Wright’s safety when death or great bodily harm was reasonably foreseeable. In allowing the first-degree manslaughter charge, Hennepin County Judge Regina Chu said Wednesday that she only had to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and make a finding of “probable cause,” meaning it was more probable than not that a crime was committed. She noted the state will have a much higher burden of proving the crime beyond a reasonable doubt during a trial, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two new lawsuits claim hundreds of children have been exposed to dangerous lead levels through the drinking water in the capital city, which has been facing water system problems for years. One lawsuit represents one child, while the other has hundreds of children as plaintiffs. The suits, filed last week in federal court in Jackson, say the city and the state Health Department have made “conscience-shocking decisions and have shown deliberate indifference that have led to Plaintiffs’ exposure to toxic lead in Jackson’s drinking water.” One of the attorneys who filed the lawsuits, Corey M. Stern, has represented people who sued over tainted water in Flint, Michigan. Attorneys for Jackson are reviewing the lawsuits, and “the city will eventually have a response,” city spokesman Justin Vicory said. The lawsuits seek unspecified amounts of money for punitive damages and compensatory damages, plus attorneys’ fees and “other relief the Court deems appropriate.” Jackson has about 160,000 residents, and the city has long-standing problems with water quality and distribution. Since July 1, Jackson has been under a safe drinking water consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which sets a schedule for work on water treatment facilities and delivery systems.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark McCloskey said he does not support allowing abortions for young girls who become pregnant through rape or incest. McCloskey, a St. Louis personal injury lawyer who gained national attention after he and his wife waved guns at racial injustice protesters last summer, made the remarks last week at a forum in Osage Beach. “I’ve got a client who was raped by an uncle when she was 13 years old, had the child; she finished high school, finished college and got a master’s degree,” McCloskey said. “That child she would have aborted finished high school, finished college and now has a master’s degree. … I don’t believe in any exceptions.” McCloskey did not specifically address whether he would support an abortion to save the life of the mother, The Kansas City Star reports. He said it has always bothered him that people who oppose the death penalty often support abortion rights. “The justices of the Supreme Court in the most heinous crimes don’t have the right to decide who should live and die,” he said. “But every 13-year-old girl on the street should be able to decide the fate of the life of their child?” The subject of abortion exceptions famously sank the U.S. Senate campaign of another Missouri candidate in 2012. Asked if he supported abortions for women who were raped, Republican nominee Todd Akin, who died this month, responded: “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission created to allocate federal COVID-19 relief funding to help stabilize the state’s economy recommended Wednesday that the governor allocate $4 million to help recruit new medical workers to Montana. But members rejected a proposal to spend $13 million on retention bonuses for existing hospital workers. The health care worker recruitment program would allow health care providers to cover up to $12,500 in moving expenses for new hires, along with another up to $4,300 to cover the taxes on that payment, said Scott Mendenhall, the state’s new American Rescue Plan Act program director. The program could recruit another 238 medical employees to the state, which has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases since mid-July. New workers would have to remain in their jobs in Montana for at least a year, or they would have to repay the money, Mendenhall said. Democratic House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, a member of the committee, argued the proposal overlooked members of the existing health care workforce, who are stressed and frustrated by seeing traveling workers receiving more pay than they receive. Abbott proposed recommending that the state set aside $13 million in federal relief funding for retention bonuses for employees of inpatient hospitals who stuck with their jobs during the pandemic.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s largest and oldest prison lost running water because of a plumbing issue, forcing inmates and staffers to use bottled water and portable toilets and raising concerns about conditions at the facility. Officials at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln said they had to shut off the water Tuesday when they discovered numerous leaks in the facility’s old, brittle pipes. Laura Strimple, a spokeswoman for the state corrections department, said in an email Thursday that crews had restored water service to the prison. State Sen. Terrell McKinney visited the prison Wednesday and said he saw toilets filled with human waste. He said he was told prisoners were getting two water bottles a day, but some complained that they had only received one, and a few prisoners were using mop buckets to shower. “From what I saw, it was horrible,” McKinney said. “You could smell it when you walked in.” Prison officials said the problem demonstrates the need for a new, $230 million facility proposed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts. But some state lawmakers, including McKinney, an Omaha Democrat, argue that a new prison isn’t necessary, especially when other states are closing prisons to save money.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tourists are returning, events are expanding, and a wave of wagering is washing over the state, where a September casino winnings report showed gambling at pre-pandemic levels. Casinos statewide took in almost $1.2 billion in house winnings in September, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported Wednesday. The figure marked seven straight months of $1 billion or more – one short of a record eight-month streak set in late 2006 and early 2007, before the Great Recession. Tourism officials in Las Vegas reported separately that hotel occupancy increased to 73% last month and that more than 2.9 million people visited the region, down 15% from the same month in 2019 but up 72% from 1.7 million in September 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority characterized the month as a “stabilization” and noted that nightly hotel room rates have climbed to the highest during the “pandemic era,” to an average of $155. Increased vehicle traffic on Interstate 15 at the California-Nevada border reflected a return of domestic tourists, but regular international air travel has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Federal authorities have set vaccination requirements for foreign, non-immigrant adults flying to the U.S. beginning Nov. 8.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday approved using federal funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts in a vote that involved much less drama – and money – than previous requests. Two weeks ago, the Republican-led council that approves state contracts turned down $27 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. More than 100 vaccine-mandate opponents packed the room, and nine were arrested for interrupting the meeting. But protestors were absent Wednesday when the the council unanimously voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. “This will be an additional resource that is needed,” Republican Councilor Joe Kenney said. But Cinde Warmington, the lone Democrat on the council, noted that using the ARPA funds instead of the CDC money diverts money that could have been used for other programs. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette agreed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOceanport: Netflix has confirmed it will enter the bidding for a 289-acre tract of Fort Monmouth, where it hopes to create a mix of soundstages, post-production buildings and backlot sets. Gov. Phil Murphy supports Netflix’s bid, according to an account in The New York Times, the first to report on the development. In a statement to the Asbury Park Press on Tuesday, Netflix said: “America’s first movie studio was in New Jersey, and today it’s home to many talented people working in entertainment.” The world’s first film studio was part of Thomas Edison’s laboratories in West Orange – now part of the U.S. National Park Service. Years later, but before the motion picture industry moved to the warmer and stable climate of Los Angeles, the capital of American filmmaking was Fort Lee. Fort Monmouth was formerly the base for the U.S. Signal Corps and over its long, nearly 100-year history contributed to many technological advances. Radar was developed at the fort, and it was the first place to bounce an electronic signal off the moon. The fort closed in 2011 and has been undergoing redevelopment and a return to private hands. Prospective purchasers have until Jan. 12 to submit a proposal to buy what is called the Mega Parcel, which sits in parts of Eatontown and Oceanport.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: School bus drivers in the city have gone on strike, shutting down much of the public school transportation system that serves 3,500 students. Current drivers picketed the office of southern New Mexico district school bus contractor STS New Mexico on Thursday, demanding better pay and working conditions. Bus driver shortages have strained schools across the state as education officials struggle to hire and train more workers. Some offer free training, signing bonuses and other perks for new employees. The shortage has led the company to push mechanics into driving service, meaning there aren’t mechanics to fix buses when they break down, a bus driver union representative said. “We’re just going to do the best that we can do,” STS General Manager Van Wamel said. “This shift in focus is unfortunate, but we are confident that it is temporary,” Las Cruces Public Schools Superintendent Ralph Ramos said in a statement. District officials told parents by text message Thursday to “please make alternative transportation arrangements if possible.” District spokeswoman Kelly Jameson said special education students with transportation specified in their individualized learning plans won’t be affected by the strike.\n\nNew York\n\nMechanicville: A furry, four-legged scourge is wreaking havoc on a Hudson Valley town’s water supply, forcing local officials to scramble to keep up. The culprits are a family of beavers that has been building dams near Mechanicville, impeding the flow of water from the primary stream that empties into the small reservoir on which the town depends for drinking water. “I wouldn’t call it a fight. I call it a very challenging opponent, and we play a game of chess,” Mechanicville Public Works Commissioner Anthony Gotti told the Albany Times-Union. “I take his dam down. I’ve got to figure out where he goes next.” Towns like Mechanicville, about 20 miles up the Hudson River from Albany, don’t have the luxury of relying on large reservoirs fed by numerous tributaries. That has made the problem more pressing, as beavers are capable of building a dam in as little as two nights that can slow water flow and create algae in the reservoir. The challenge is complicated by the fact that the dams, which consist of tightly wound branches secured by mud and leaves, usually must be removed by hand, as work crews can’t bring heavy equipment into the forest without building a road, the Times-Union reports. The beaver, a protected species, became New York state’s official mammal in the 1970s and was once nearly extinct.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and his brother-in-law are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential insider trading – a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to recent federal court filings. Burr, a Republican, is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020, before the economic threat from the virus was widely known. That fueled accusations that the members of Congress were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially, which is illegal under a law known as the STOCK Act. Burr was previously investigated by the Trump administration’s Justice Department for offloading $1.6 million from his portfolio in January and February 2020. The department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later – on Jan. 19, Donald Trump’s last full day in office. But the SEC continued to investigate Burr, according to court documents filed in the Southern District of New York that were first made public last week. The agency enforces federal securities law. Attorneys for Burr as well as for Gerald Fauth, the brother of Burr’s wife, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Burr has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A lawmaker was barred from boarding a flight at Minot International Airport this week after a run-in with a security agent during a pat-down. Republican state Rep. Jeff Hoverson said he and his wife were planning to travel Monday for their anniversary. He said a Transportation Security Administration agent said he was going to give him a pat-down but did not ask permission. Hoverson said he moved the agent’s hand away. TSA said in a statement that the pat-down was initiated when Hoverson set off the alarm in the screening machine. The agency said Hoverson objected during the pat-down and called the police. He eventually complied, but the airline made the decision to deny boarding, TSA said. Hoverson said everyone overreacted, including himself. A pastor who’s among the most far-right legislators in the GOP-controlled Legislature, he introduced legislation last session to repeal mask mandates in the state. He also unsuccessfully sponsored legislation that would make it a felony to help women get abortions, including by giving them rides to abortion clinics. And as a freshman legislator two years ago, Hoverson protested a prayer by a Hindu cleric, saying he didn’t “want to be compelled to pray for a false god.”\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A roller derby team that has called itself the Cleveland Guardians since 2013 sued the city’s Major League Baseball team in federal court Wednesday, alleging that the switch from Indians to Guardians infringes on its trademark. “A Major League club cannot simply take a smaller team’s name and use it for itself,” the lawsuit said. “There cannot be two ‘Cleveland Guardians’ teams in Cleveland, and, to be blunt, Plaintiff was here first.” The Cleveland Indians announced in July that the team would assume the name Guardians for the 2022 season after years of criticism that the Indians name and Chief Wahoo logo were racist. The new name, the team has said, was influenced in part by the two large art deco statues that appear to stand guard on a bridge spanning the Cuyahoga River. The all-gender roller derby team is based in the Cleveland suburb of Parma. It formally registered the name Cleveland Guardians in 2017 with the Ohio secretary of state and has been selling team merchandise since 2014, the lawsuit said. The baseball team filed a trademark application for the Guardians name in the East African island nation of Mauritius, “effectively hiding the application unless one knew where to look,” it said. In a statement Wednesday, the Indians said officials “believe there is no conflict between the parties and their ability to operate in their respective business areas.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge has temporarily blocked parts of a new state law that makes it a misdemeanor for people to unlawfully obstruct a public street or highway during a protest. U.S. District Judge Robin Cauthron also put on hold Wednesday a provision that could result in fines of up $50,000 for groups or organizations “found to be a conspirator” with someone who violates any one of a number of state laws pertaining to riots and unlawful assemblies. The injunction temporarily prevents the enforcement of these parts of the law as the court weighs its constitutionality. A key provision of the new law that grants immunity to drivers who run people over is not being put on hold. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP sued Attorney General John O’Connor and Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, alleging parts of the law are unconstitutional because it will limit protests and have a chilling effect on free speech. The law was passed this year by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt shortly after an incident in July in which a pickup truck pulling a horse trailer drove through Black Lives Matter protesters on Interstate 244 in Tulsa. Three people were seriously injured, including a 33-year-old man who fell from an overpass and was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A lawsuit has been filed saying the residency requirements for the state’s assisted suicide law violate the U.S. Constitution. Oregon was the first state to legalize medical aid in dying in 1997, when it allowed adult residents with a terminal diagnosis and prognosis of no more than six months to live to end their lives by taking a lethal dose of prescribed medication. The national advocacy organization Compassion & Choices and an Oregon Health & Science University professor of family medicine filed the new lawsuit. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports experts believe the legal action could have broad implications as the first challenge in the nation to raise the question of whether such residency requirements are constitutional. Oregon’s law was the basis of the laws that have since been adopted in eight other states and Washington, D.C. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Vermont and Washington state allow aid in dying for residents of their states only. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Portland on Thursday asks the court to prohibit Oregon officials from enforcing the residency provision of the law. It says the residency requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the Constitution and the Commerce Clause in Article I.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that would bar municipalities in the nation’s No. 2 natural gas state from adopting building codes that prohibit gas hookups or otherwise restricting utility service based on the energy source. The Republican-penned bill passed 35-15 and heads to the state House of Representatives for consideration there. The chamber approved it without debate, with six Democrats joining all 29 Republicans in favor of it. The bill defends a homegrown energy source in Pennsylvania as some states, cities and counties elsewhere begin looking at all-electric building codes that exclude gas infrastructure as a way to fight climate change and accelerate progress toward a carbon-free electricity grid. The vast Marcellus Shale reservoir beneath Pennsylvania is the nation’s most prolific natural gas reservoir, and the state has helped subsidize the build-out of gas infrastructure to help the industry find new customers. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, said the legislation ensures the state controls any decision to restrict the use of an energy source in housing and commercial buildings. Combustion of natural gas emits carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, while natural gas contains methane, which is far more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, according to researchers.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The thousands of drivers who use the Route 37 highway on their way to work every day probably have no idea they are passing over the graves of some people who died in the late 1800s and early 1900s at state institutions. Route 37 was built between 1963 and 1969 over part of the institution cemetery called State Farm Cemetery #1, which has about 1,200 gravesites containing 3,000 people, WPRI-TV reports. A thousand of those graves should have been moved, said Charles St. Martin, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. “It was during a time when regulations were far more lax than they are now,” he wrote in an email. “This would never happen now.” There were no grave markers when the highway was built because the original grave markers were wooden stakes that had rotted away, St. Martin said. Some of the grave markers had been destroyed by fire too. The cemetery was near railroad tracks, and sparks from the steam engines set fires that consumed the markers, according to a description of the cemetery by the Rhode Island Historical Cemetery Commission. The cemetery deteriorated and became overgrown. In 2006, when dozens of coffins were exposed due to rain, the transportation department realized the graves were there, St. Martin said. The agency does not plan to move the graves that are under Route 37.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants to put $500 million of federal COVID-19 relief money toward fixing and improving water systems across the state, with priority given to rural and smaller systems. Gov. Henry McMaster announced his idea Thursday, saying a modern clean drinking water and sewer system is vital to citizens and to bring in businesses. “In rural South Carolina, water and sewer is the key to life,” McMaster said at a news conference in Great Falls. The $500 million is part of about $2.4 billion in pandemic relief money that the state can spend. The General Assembly will make the final decision on where the money goes. Senate and House committees discussing the relief money have brought up the idea of water system building and repair, but with a big difference: requiring local systems to also put up money for the effort. The state has more than 260 water systems and 200 wastewater systems, and their average age is approaching 50 years old, officials said. McMaster said a local match wasn’t in his plan. “Some of these communities just don’t have the money,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order Wednesday aimed at ensuring that state employees can easily obtain medical and religious exemptions from federal vaccine mandates. Noem said the move was necessary to ensure employees aren’t forced to get COVID-19 vaccinations under President Joe Biden’s initiative, which covers not only people directly paid by federal contracts but also anyone who works to support them. State lawmakers have said South Dakotans are being denied medical and religious exemptions from feds and have called for a special session to stop the order. Noem spokesman Jordan Overturf said Noem’s exemptions are “explicit and offer a clear path” for state workers to opt out of the shots. For medical exemptions, state employees need a note from a doctor stating that the vaccination is too risky because of health reasons. For religious exemptions, workers need to fill out and sign a form stating they object to the COVID-19 vaccine based “on religious grounds, which includes moral, ethical, and philosophical beliefs or principles.” Once either forms are submitted, the exemptions are automatic, Overturf said. Noem said she is talking to lawmakers about extending those protections to private employees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A new piece of legislation aims to grow and preserve the city’s beleaguered tree canopy by creating a dedicated stream of revenue to help fund the effort. Nashville’s continued growth and development has come at an environmental cost. Between 2008 and 2016, the city lost 918 acres of tree canopy to development – about 13% of its urban canopy, according to a 2018 report. More than 30,000 metric tons of carbon were released into Davidson County’s atmosphere as a result. The bill, drafted by Mayor John Cooper’s administration, would create a dedicated revenue stream for tree restoration by allocating 1% of annual revenue from each of three funding sources: building permits, grading permits and general obligation bond-funded construction projects. The tree restoration and maintenance fund would be capped at $2.5 million annually, and the legislation would “sunset” June 30, 2023, allowing an opportunity for future review and potential renewal if deemed necessary. The bill will go before the Metro Council for its first of three readings Tuesday. The majority of tree loss in Davidson County occurs on private property, according to the bill.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A museum dedicated to telling the history of Juneteenth with a national scope is set to be built in the city. The National Juneteenth Museum will be built as part of a mixed-use development, the city of Fort Worth said in a news release Tuesday. When President Joe Biden signed a bill into law over the summer making June 19 a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S., those by his side included Opal Lee, a 95-year-old Fort Worth woman who spent years rallying people to join her push to see the day get that recognition. The city said Lee has been leading the charge for the new museum, which will be built on land that currently houses her Fort Worth Juneteenth Museum. “To have lived long enough to see my walking and talking make an impact is one thing, but to know that a state-of-the-art museum that will house the actual pen that President Biden used to sign the bill, and many other exhibits, is coming to pass as well – I could do my holy dance again,” Lee said. The city said the museum will be led by a collaboration that includes activists, researchers and historians.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Southwest Symphony opens its 41st season Friday with the annual Halloween Spooktacular, featuring the music of John Williams. Maestro Lucas Darger returns for his sixth season as music director and conductor. Over the years, Darger and his predecessor Gary Caldwell have offered audiences an smorgasbord of Williams’ works. The composer best known for his film scores has received Academy Awards, Grammys, Golden Globes and Emmys. “Our ‘haunted’ orchestra will feature Williams’ music with selections from ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Jurassic Park,’ ‘Superman,’ ‘E.T.,’ ‘Saving Private Ryan’ and many more,” said Scott Raine, marketing director of the Southwest Symphony. The traditional Handel’s “Messiah” will be returning in early December. Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf” is slated to be presented in early February, followed by award-winning international flutist Demarre McGill in March.\n\nVermont\n\nRockingham: The town is planning to spend up to $20,000 to save the steeple and a stained glass window from an old church in the village of Bellows Falls that is slated for demolition. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the Rockingham Select Board voted unanimously to spend up to $15,000 to remove the steeple from the Methodist Meeting House and up to $5,000 to remove and crate the stained glass window of “The Parable of the Sower.” Town Manager Scott Pickup said what will happen to the historic items after they are removed has not been decided. The demolition date has been pushed back to December to allow more time to salvage the historic items, Pickup said. The board voted last month to demolish the 1835 building. It was extensively renovated in 1880. But while it was home to the local YMCA, the building fell into a state of serious disrepair. Efforts to save the building failed. The town took ownership of the dilapidated building this summer. Select Board member Elijah Zimmer, a member of the town’s Historic Preservation Commission, said the steeple is in excellent condition, unlike the rest of the building. “I’m sad to lose the building, but glad to see a commitment to historic preservation,” Zimmer said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Police are warning that an unlicensed tow truck is being used to quickly steal vehicles throughout the city. On Sunday, the tow truck was captured on surveillance video backing up toward a vehicle, lifting it with tow gear and towing it away seconds later, Richmond Police said in a news release. Police said the truck is black with no logo or lettering on it, as is required for tow trucks for hire. Detectives asked the public to call 911 if they see this tow truck or any tow truck without a company name, lettering or logo.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal jury has determined that The GEO Group must pay minimum wage – rather than $1 a day – to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for-profit detention center in the state. The verdict came Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma in a second trial over the issue. The first trial ended in June with a deadlocked jury. “This multi-billion dollar corporation illegally exploited the people it detains to line its own pockets,” Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “Today’s victory sends a clear message: Washington will not tolerate corporations that get rich violating the rights of the people.” The jury will now consider how much the immigrant detainees who worked at the facility are owed, and U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan on his own will determine what The GEO Group must pay the state for its claim that the company unjustly enriched itself. Ferguson, a Democrat, sued the Florida-based GEO Group in 2017, saying the company had unjustly profited by running the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma – now known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center – on the backs of captive workers. A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year, seeking back pay. The judge, who rejected several attempts by GEO to dismiss the lawsuits, consolidated the cases for trial.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new program enables owners of small forestlands to prosper from improving forest health while slowing climate change. The Family Forest Carbon Program, which pays family and individual small-forest owners to implement practices that increase the amount of carbon sequestered and stored on the land, is opening enrollment to West Virginia landowners. The program could pay significant financial and environmental dividends in the Mountain State, given that West Virginia is the third-most-forested state in the nation, with more than 12 million acres of forestland. The program, a product of the American Forest Foundation and the Nature Conservancy, enables the carbon sequestered by enrolled landowners to become part of a carbon market in the form of carbon credits to be verified by a third party. The program provides expert consultation from foresters to landowners and a forest management plan customized for the landowner’s property. “We built into (the program) a management plan, not to tell them what to do but to help them reach the goals and visions they have for their land, put it into a management plan so that their woods are producing timber, wildlife, carbon for the years to come,” American Forest Foundation CEO Tom Martin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A sheriff who supports former President Donald Trump accused the bipartisan state Elections Commission of breaking the law during last year’s election, taking the unusual step Thursday of detailing the allegations publicly even though no charges have been filed. Racine County Sheriff Charles Schamling called on the Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate the commission’s decision last year to tell local elections officials not to send poll workers into nursing homes to assist residents with voting during the pandemic. The move is the latest example of Trump supporters seeking to undermine confidence in the election in a critical battleground state that President Joe Biden carried last year. The state Department of Justice has already said it has no plans to pursue the case, the sheriff said. In a 75-minute presentation streamed on his Facebook page, Schmaling detailed what he said was evidence collected from the Ridgewood Care Center in Racine County. Trump issued a statement encouraging his supporters to watch the presentation. Schmaling said the families of eight residents told investigators they believed that their loved ones did not have the capacity to vote but that ballots were cast for them. “I don’t know how or who they voted for,” the sheriff said. “I didn’t ask because it doesn’t matter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Central High School’s theater program returned in full capacity with an intimate production of “Typhoid Mary.” The play tells the story of Mary Mallon, an Irish cook who immigrated to America in the early 1900s while unknowingly serving as a carrier of the disease typhoid. The story begins after Mary has already infected and killed several people with her cooking, but still she refuses to be vaccinated or studied by scientists who offer to help her. Choosing a play with such a relevant premise was entirely intentional, but director Jeremiah Kolkman wasn’t looking to take sides, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “If the audience walks out of here thinking that they were able to relate to this because of current events as they are, that’s great,” he said. “If audience members are walking out of here disgusted because they don’t like the differences of religion and science, that’s great. I just want them walking out of here thinking about it.” While the director chose the play for its relevance, the production remains bipartisan. It presents the situation from a variety of different perspectives. Mary and her husband struggle through religious reconciliation, while the two scientists throughout the production face conflict in their field. Prior to last weekend’s shows, the last time Cheyenne Central held a full production was fall 2019, before the contagious, deadly coronavirus reared its head.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/29"}]}

Gone were the meticulously manicured lawns and neatly kept streets.\n\n“I don’t believe my eyes,” she remembers thinking at the time. “It really, really wasn’t Wilmington.”\n\nToday, the one-square-mile neighborhood is the most violent area in one of the most violent cities in America. The News Journal has spent three months with residents and business owners, chronicling the challenges they face every day, to demonstrate what has happened to the community and show what crime has done.\n\nBounded by I-95, Delaware Avenue, Tatnall Street and Martin Luther King Boulevard, West Center City includes the Quaker Hill historic district, where Quakers first settled in 1735, and the Trinity Vicinity, a tiny, quaint neighborhood of Victorian-era homes at the northern end. Governed by separate neighborhood associations, residents of these somewhat wealthier enclaves have tried to distance themselves from the gunfire marring West Center City’s core.\n\n\"If you want to sell your house, you live in Trinity,\" said longtime resident Dwight Davis, who lives outside of Trinity. \"But if it’s a shooting it’s considered West Center City.\"\n\nTo go about their daily business, people here resort to self-imposed curfews, circuitous walking and driving routes that bypass hotspots, and they keep their heads down. They refer to once-entrenched businesses like grade-school friends – Serpe Bakery, Hanover Shoes, Cohen Brothers Furniture.\n\nThe National Guard no longer owns the streets. The dealers do.\n\nToday, in a neighborhood so close to Wilmington’s business and entertainment hubs, audacious gunmen locked in a campaign for respect will shoot before the sun goes down.\n\nCandles and teddy bears commemorate the dead. I-95 not only brings downtown workers in and out of the city, but also serves as a pipeline for illegal drugs and firearms. Burly peacekeepers, including former dealers, walk the streets while police officers mostly remain in their cars.\n\nRail-thin men swagger over to the corner liquor store, wearing crackled leather jackets, low-slung jeans and headphones. A school-age girl kicks wrappers off her front sidewalk near a dumpster overflowing with the soiled contents of somebody’s apartment.\n\nAt William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center at the corner of Fifth and Madison streets, near where 12 people have been shot in the last year, a teenager recently approached an officer on night duty.\n\n“That’s the same one I got. Is that a 9?” the boy said, referring to the cop’s pistol.\n\n“It’s sort of like the war on terrorism. You can’t live in fear,” observed Sister Christa Rowe, one of three nuns living at the Josephine Bakhita convent at Fourth and Washington streets.\n\nOf Wilmington’s 141 shooting victims this year, 38 were in West Center City. Six of those incidents occurred at just one intersection: North Jefferson and West Sixth streets.\n\nWith 26 total homicides this year, the city is three shy of shattering its 2013 record. Over the past five years, Wilmington has consistently ranked third among the most violent cities of comparable size, according to FBI statistics.\n\nWest Center City residents have lost count of the number of shootings and boarded-up homes, which have been painted over with tulips by neighborhood children to look less boarded-up.\n\nThey’ve also lost track of the number of multi-million-dollar vision plans aimed at transforming one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods into a decent place to live and raise a family.\n\nOver the last half-century – most recently in 2010 – the community has suffered from a patchwork of housing-related revitalization projects with no overarching vision, according to City Planner Leonard Sophrin. With much fanfare from politicians, episodic funding has poured into the community in response to “crisis” alarms.\n\nBut after the energy dissipates and the money runs out, the projects are shelved.\n\nWhile 68-year-old William Hill Jr. is happy living at Sacred Heart Village, an apartment complex housing low-income seniors, he wouldn't encourage any of his six children to live in the neighborhood.\n\nHill used to have seven kids, before his son was shot 22 times at a Wilmington apartment complex over an argument about a girl.\n\nA former drug addict, Hill must regularly sidestep dealers who label him \"old head.\" Before he moved to Sacred Heart, a bullet ripped through his kitchen wall while he was making spaghetti.\n\nThe former maintenance worker remembers hanging on street corners with groups of guys in their twenties to sing The Temptations a cappella.\n\nToday, he won't venture out at night and avoids Fifth and Sixth streets between Washington and Monroe altogether.\n\n\"The parents are out doing the same things their kids are doing,\" he said.\n\nBeyond the glass-paneled headquarters of WSFS Bank and the Sheraton Suites on Delaware Avenue is a community that has been surveyed and scrutinized by national violence experts from Ivy League universities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nBut even they can’t figure out how to keep the soon-to-be-relocated neighborhood daycare from getting caught in the crossfire.\n\nFrom 1969 to 2010, West Center City’s homeownership rate plummeted from 80 percent to roughly a quarter of owner-occupied homes, according to the most recent census data.\n\nForty-one percent of the neighborhood’s more than 4,200 residents live below the poverty line, nearly double the city’s poverty rate. Among neighborhood residents ages 16 and older, more than half are unemployed or not in the labor force because of school, retirement or other reasons.\n\nEighteen percent of housing units were vacant in 2010, the most recent year available, a 46 percent increase from 2000. African Americans comprise three-quarters of the population, followed by a dwindling white population and an increasing number of Latinos.\n\nAlternately called “Little Vietnam,” the “Wild West” and “Ground Zero,” West Center City has received more than $19 million in federal and state housing funds through the Delaware State Housing Authority since 1998, according to agency records provided under a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by The News Journal. The housing agency could not provide records before 1998 in time for publication.\n\nThe city of Wilmington, which received the same FOIA request last month, responded that staffers needed more time to research records. Assistant City Attorney Anthony J. Hill provided no timeline.\n\nDavis, who is trying to resurrect a neighborhood association to improve West Center City’s core, criticized government agencies’ grant monitoring efforts in the community.\n\n“Millions have been poured into nonprofits without any oversight, followup or evaluation to assess what, in fact, these dollars are doing, what they are proposed to do,” he said.\n\nWilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams agreed.\n\n“They can’t justify what they’re doing with the allocations being made into that neighborhood,” he said last week.\n\n“I’ve been hearing about West Center City since I was riding a two-wheel bike,” the 62-year-old Wilmington native continued.\n\n“What does that tell you?”\n\nSteeped in history, West Center City is home to the city’s first Quaker Meeting House, at Fourth and West streets, which evolved into the Wilmington Friends School. John Dickinson, the “penman of the Revolution,” is buried in the cemetery next door, along with abolitionist Thomas Garrett, who helped 2,700 slaves reach freedom as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the stable neighborhood attracted skilled workers, including Italian and Polish immigrants, to the foul-smelling leather factories clustered along Shipley Run Creek.\n\nThe area was bursting with schools and pocket parks until the middle of the last century. In 1953, federal-backed urban renewal came to Wilmington’s East Side, displacing 1,000 mostly black and low-income residents who were living without indoor toilets or central heating.\n\nTo raze the “slum,” the city dispersed residents to areas like West Center City, where the number of blacks and whites were almost evenly divided. At the same time, middle-class families were relocating to the budding suburbs, local historian Carol Hoffecker wrote in her 1983 book, “Corporate Capital: Wilmington in the Twentieth Century.”\n\nThe construction of I-95 again uprooted the newly settled residents of Wilmington’s west side.\n\nIn 1959, the federal government seized and demolished more than 350 homes, businesses and churches, paving over three blocks between Adams and Jackson streets. Residents stormed public meetings and filed a flurry of court motions, but were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nBefore the highway plowed through Wilmington, the city’s communities were connected from Market to Union streets by an east-west corridor serviced by trolleys, said Sophrin, the city planner.\n\n“The government bought everything and didn’t have an understanding that you can’t fabricate a community,” he said.\n\nIn 1968, smoke from West Center City could be seen for miles. Firefighters dodged bullets while battling the blaze. Packs of looters roamed the streets, overturning cars and holding city officials hostage.\n\nThe riots, sparked by the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., led to a nine-month, citywide occupation by the National Guard.\n\nBack then, former Wilmington Mayor James Baker was a 25-year-old social worker assigned to infiltrate gangs with names like Mountain Dew and Blackie Blacks.\n\n“If you looked up at the street lights as you walked, you could see a quick reflection off the bottles so you had time to duck,” he recalled.\n\nAmong the blocks of burned-out homes and storefronts in West Center City was Gus’ appliance store. The amiable owner offered customers payment plans if they were short on cash, longtime resident Linda Richardson remembered. Rioters still smashed Gus’ windows and stole his furnaces.\n\nNot surprisingly, local business owners, joined by families who had the means, abandoned the neighborhood after the riots.\n\nWorking as a gospel disc jockey at the time, Benjamin “Twin” B. Brown recalled how the violence had destroyed so much opportunity for the African American community, including black-owned grocery stores, dry cleaners and bars.\n\n“A lot of them lost their businesses and couldn’t rebuild,” he said.\n\nAfter the bayonets departed, urban renewal resumed.\n\nIn 1969, the city used federal housing funds to launch a $22 million, five-year project to rehabilitate 800 homes and build 400 new ones in West Center City, attracting interest from private developers.\n\nIt was supposed to be a “bed sheet” operation, Nathaniel Webb, then-director of the neighborhood association, told The News Journal in 1970. Just as a skilled nurse can put on a new bed sheet without removing the patient, new housing was to be slipped into West Center City without moving people out, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, another federally-funded program. Model Cities, promised a new daycare center, subsidized public transportation and home loans for low-income families in the area.\n\nBy the time both programs were defunded under President Richard Nixon’s administration, the Wilmington Housing Authority had helped to dismantle and demolish West Center City.\n\nFields recalled looking out her back window on Madison Street and seeing rows of nothing.\n\n“It was just a vacant field,” she said.\n\nHundreds of people were relocated out of the area, but there weren’t enough affordable homes to bring them back.\n\n“The federal government cuts the money and then the people in the community are up in arms because they are left standing with nothing,” Baker said.\n\n“It dwarfed the neighborhood into old standbys, the people who would never leave,” he said, “and speculators who were just buying up property cheap.”\n\nA different experiment netted more positive results in Trinity. Daniel Frawley, who would become the city’s mayor, and his wife, Bonita, were the first people in the nation to buy their home for a dollar in 1973 and renovate it under the federal Urban Homesteading program.\n\nWithin three years, fresh faces had breathed new life into 25 homes in and around 10th and North Monroe streets.\n\n“This will be the Society Hill of Wilmington,” contractor Joe Aceto told The News Journal at the time.\n\nA similar renaissance took place in Quaker Hill, where a red light district had invaded Seventh and Tatnall streets. In 1976, four area banks had committed to funding the $1.4 million first phase of a 120-unit townhouse development.\n\nBy that time, Fields’ sister, Trotter, had become a staunch defender of West Center City.\n\n“The neighborhood association didn’t allow you to put a nail in anything without meeting with the community first,” recalled Fields, 75.\n\nAs the edges of West Center City became less frayed, the core felt ignored.\n\n“Surely, it felt like us versus them,” said Fields. “We are never happy when you see things turn over and you are not a part of it or you don’t receive what the next person receives.”\n\n“You do what you can,” she continued. “You fight and you go to the table time after time and they give you a piece of the action. A little piece of it to shut you up.”\n\nOver the next three decades, developers in West Center City engaged in a cycle of tearing down, building up and tearing down, helped by federal and state housing grants, tax credits, rental subsidies, corporate donations and low-interest loans.\n\nWhile the neighborhood had a 31 percent vacancy rate in 1980, according to census records, home values began creeping up. A Washington Street home purchased for $500 in 1975 sold for $30,000 in 1981, according to a News Journal report at the time.\n\nIn 1983, the city announced that the only remaining school in the area, Mary C.I. Williams Elementary School, would be demolished and redeveloped into what is today the Adams Four Shopping Center.\n\nMeanwhile, residents complained that too many abandoned homes in the neighborhood had been subdivided into apartments. To get neighbors on board, the City Council formed the West Center City Planning Advisory Council to advise politicians on land-use development in the area and to administer federal funds.\n\nBut infighting led former board members to accuse others of illegally kicking them off the board and misappropriating funds. The case has languished in Delaware courts for more than a dozen years, according to Davis, one of the plaintiffs. He has asked Attorney General Matt Denn and the state’s Fraud and Consumer Protection Division to investigate further.\n\nIn 2005, Baker, then mayor, heralded the HOPE Commission as a comprehensive approach to revitalizing Wilmington’s underserved communities, including West Center City. Funding cuts meant that the commission never expanded beyond its pilot site in Southbridge.\n\nOne of the most ambitious plans for West Center City in recent memory was the West Center City Strategic Neighborhood Plan of 2010. Totaling more than 160 pages and enlisting more than 500 residents, the plan referenced six other plans that had been proposed for the area in the previous decade.\n\nBut for this strategy, consultants and the community recommended redesigning Adams Four to attract a different tenant mix, targeted code enforcement of derelict properties, bringing back an elementary school to the area and reclaiming vacant land as open space, among other suggestions.\n\nThe following year, the Wachovia Regional Foundation awarded a $650,000, five-year implementation grant to Interfaith Community Housing of Delaware. (The foundation had already paid $100,000 for the plan itself).\n\nThe grant funded the salaries of three staffers, including implementation manager Nnamdi Chukwuocha, a community activist and poet who was later elected to the city council representing another district.\n\nIt’s unclear how the rest of the money was spent.\n\n“We live in the neighborhood and we don’t even know what they’re doing,” said Davis, who co-chaired the plan.\n\nFields, the plan's other co-chair, praised it for creating a dialogue about West Center City’s challenges. She could not point to any specific plan accomplishments, referring questions to Chukwuocha.\n\nCouncilman Chukwuocha, who still works for Interfaith in West Center City, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the plan.\n\nLongtime resident Richardson said she was approved to receive a $1,500 grant from Interfaith to hold a block cleanup party and purchase flowers and planters. She is still waiting on the planters after the cleanup happened this summer.\n\n“They didn’t even buy me a broom,” she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wells Fargo Regional Foundation, which replaced the Wachovia Foundation, said Interfaith had submitted quarterly reports on its progress, but declined to release them.\n\nThe spokeswoman, Crystal Dundas, did release a list of accomplishments so far under the $650,000 grant in response to a reporter’s request last year. They included a monthly newsletter, a community mural, a youth council, community-building events, SAT prep courses, weatherization and landlord-tenant workshops, a walking club and construction training for youth to renovate local homes.\n\n\"We continue to fund them as scheduled as they continue to meet the targets set forth in the grant agreement,\" Dundas wrote in a 2014 email. She did not respond to a recent request for comment.\n\nFive years after the 2010 plan was released, the city still views it as a worthy road map, according to planner Sophrin. A city task force has suggested a $23.5 million project to renovate and rebuild the 1973 Hicks Center, after an earlier study found that 90 percent of community members don’t use it.\n\nMirroring previous urban renewal efforts that have unraveled the fabric of the neighborhood, Mayor Williams hopes a newly approved citywide land bank will reclaim problem properties and repackage them for development or improvements.\n\n“A few houses and a community center and a daycare – that is it,” Williams said of the area. “Violence hasn’t stopped there. It has just been a cesspool of mess.”\n\n“If I had my way, I’d bulldoze every vacant (property) there,\" he said in a later interview.\n\nMeanwhile, in Quaker Hill, Interfaith will rebuild as many as 50 housing units and sell them for below-market rates to creative professionals and others under a proposed $50 million Creative District. The plan, which includes several recommendations from the 2010 West Center City strategic plan, is designed to encourage stable homeownership through brighter streets, round-the-clock arts programming and public gathering spaces.\n\nNext year, Philadelphia-based NextFab is slated to open a 3,500-square-foot makerspace in the district. Helped by a $350,000 state grant, the building will allow members to share tools, expertise and skills.\n\nAt the top of Quaker Hill is Tabernacle Full Gospel Baptist Cathedral, where most of the 200-member congregation come from outside the immediate area.\n\nNeighborhood churches like this one provide literal sanctuary, but not everyone takes advantage.\n\n“Christians are kind of peculiar,” Bishop Aretha Morton explained. “Somehow we always believe that security is with us.”\n\nMorton remembers laughing and chatting with neighborhood police officers after the church moved to the area from the East Side in 1980.\n\n“If an officer came here now, I wouldn’t know them,” she said.\n\nOne of the neighborhood jewels is the $9.2 million Sacred Heart, housing 78 seniors. Sponsored by the nonprofit Ministry of Caring, the facility boasts a hair salon, fitness center, medical office, café, market, computer room and daycare next door.\n\nShootings have marred all four corners surrounding the complex. In July, one of the bullets tore through the window of a ground-floor apartment on Madison Street, landing on a resident’s bed. (Luckily, he was in another room at the time).\n\nTo negotiate daily tasks, residents agree that they must remain vigilant, but not paranoid.\n\nClarence Raynor, a 40-year veteran of the community, still rides his motorized chair down Monroe Street at least three times a week to pick up a sub at Adams Four. No one messes with the 82-year-old.\n\n“If you’re going to a place and act like a man, you leave like one,” he explained.\n\nSimilarly, Richardson, a Sacred Heart coordinator, avoids confrontation by acknowledging young men on the streets with a quick nod and complimenting them on their pitbulls. After living in the neighborhood for 15 years, she’ll proudly tell you she’s never had to duck from a shooter or dodge a mugger.\n\nAcross from Sacred Heart is the mostly white Trinity neighborhood where a café sells $6 almond smoothies and scarecrows – not drunks – hunker down on benches.\n\nHere, Rhonda Wright doesn’t mind the husband-and-wife team rooting through her trash for aluminum cans or the disheveled woman who occasionally comes to her door imploring, “Do you have anything for me today?”\n\nA clinician director, Wright has lived in the Bronx and worked in southeast, Washington, D.C. In 2006, she fell in love with the wide-plank pine floors, bay windows and wood-burning fireplace of Frawley's old house. She also found a neighborhood of like-minded urban pioneers, who raise foster children, patrol on Halloween and watch one another's cats.\n\nFleeing would only compound the problem, she said. \"I'm not going to let (shootings) keep me out of the city.\"\n\nDeborah Kraak, president of Trinity's neighborhood association, agreed but sticks to well-trodden routes.\n\nWhile trying to get on I-95 during Thanksgiving break, Kraak recalled that her husband turned down Washington Street.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she cried. \"We do not go down that way anywhere.\"\n\n“I’d rather risk merging than risk getting shot,\" she said in a later interview.\n\nKraak took a gamble on the neighborhood in 1994, back when the \"Delaware Memorial Bridge memorialized Wilmington after 5 p.m.\"\n\nAs investors have reinvigorated downtown, West Center City has fallen behind, she said.\n\nThe daughter of a pastor, she quoted from Corinthians.\n\n\"The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I don't need you.' And the head cannot say to the feet, 'I don't need you.'\"\n\n\"The city is also a body politic,\" Kraak continued. \"You can't have a wound that's going gangrenous in the foot or the arm without poisoning the body.\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882 or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

Just two inches of cardboard protected his back from the unforgiving concrete; a pair of sweat socks shielded him from frostbite.\n\nTall, rangy and all sharp angles, Gardner tried to ignore the wind whipping at the Kirkwood Park roundhouse, where he lay his head for the night. Straight ahead, a black \"RIP\" taunted him in spraypaint.\n\nAs a boy, Gardner raced through this green-topped pavilion on a clunker bike made of scrap, eager to meet his friends for a game of baseball. They took timeouts to pound on each other but made amends before nightfall.\n\nToday, neighborhood kids settle grudges with bullets not bats, the weatherworn 67-year-old knows. He can hear that world from his second-floor apartment window at Sacred Heart Village II, a new Ministry of Caring home for low-income seniors.\n\nThe 26-unit complex flung open its heavy, security-monitored doors at 625 E. 10th St. in May, the same year that four people were shot, one fatally, within a two-block radius. Last month, police found a 31-year-old woman stabbed to death in nearby Kirkwood Park, after a person walking his dog noticed feet dangling from a portable toilet.\n\nYet Gardner and others couldn't be more grateful to live in one of Wilmington's most dangerous neighborhoods. Entering their apartments for the first time, they've been known to hug the refrigerator, stop, drop and roll around on the plush carpet and wander all 540 square feet, slack-jawed.\n\n\"They think they've died and went to heaven,\" says Brother Ronald Giannone, who recently celebrated his 40th anniversary as Ministry of Caring's founder and executive director.\n\nThe community organization runs nearly 40 emergency shelters, dining halls, homes for those living with HIV/AIDs, daycare facilities, clothing and furniture distribution centers, and long-term apartment buildings for seniors across New Castle County.\n\nIts newest development, the $8 million Sacred Heart Village II, took seven years to complete after a pair of sisters who lived in the neighborhood sued the ministry, citing parking and zoning concerns. The action prompted the city of Wilmington to initially withhold nearly $400,000 in funding, even though state and federal taxpayer dollars had bankrolled the project.\n\nThe delays left area seniors scrambling. At the time, the Ministry of Caring's 78-unit Sacred Heart Village I, which serves a low-income elderly population in West Center City, counted 88 people on its waiting list.\n\nSTORY: Delaware Thanksgiving food drive gives away more than 5,000 turkeys\n\nSTORY: How to not overeat on Thanksgiving\n\nEight percent of Delaware seniors age 65 and older are living in poverty, according to 2016 data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Delaware State Housing Authority found that more than half of senior renters, accounting for 6,841 households statewide, pay more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs.\n\nNationally, more than 25 million Americans ages 60 and older are considered \"economically insecure,\" earning less than $30,000 a year for a one-person household, according to the National Council on Aging.\n\nIn exchange for living in a building equipped with a cafe, laundry facilities, a jumbo TV and an endless supply of 1,000-piece puzzles, residents of Sacred Heart Village II hand over one-third of their income, consisting mainly of Social Security and disability checks.\n\nThe rest is theirs to keep, with the goal of moving up the ladder to self-sufficiency, says Giannone. A Capuchin friar from the Bronx, he recently received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Wilmington Senior Center, recognizing his steadfast advocacy for Delaware's poor.\n\nSister Margaret Mary Graney, Sacred Heart Village II's manager, says there's a misconception that all of the building's residents are destitute because of a drug or alcohol addiction. Some were successful professionals – such as a former Hotel du Pont housekeeper and Millcroft nurse – who had to stop working after being diagnosed with cancer, multiple sclerosis or diabetes.\n\nOthers, like Gardner, worked their entire lives straddling the poverty line until one layoff pushed them over the edge.\n\n\"They do so well with what little they have,\" says Graney, who has seen residents arrive with only a trash bag of clothes.\n\nAfter raising four children, Venise Winchester had to move from her home on Van Buren Street to a boarding house last year. Sitting at a stoplight, she watched a bullet rip through a man, who crumpled to the ground. Winchester sped off, anger boiling over from another senseless shooting.\n\n\"I got my own again,\" explains the 63-year-old with close-cropped hair. \"I got something where I can have my family come and see me.\"\n\nToday, the former Head Start teacher hears the click of the lock, the latch of the bolt, and feels safe. Her cozy one-bedroom is decorated with her niece's Cabbage Patch dolls, a shrine to an enormous Elvis photo and \"There's No Place Like Home,\" stenciled above the TV.\n\nGardner similarly feels blessed to be steps away from his childhood home, down the street from the picnic dome that kept the bedlam at bay when he was alone, homeless and exhausted from working nearly 50 years of odd jobs at \"slave\" wages.\n\nBack then, nobody offered a hand as if to say, \"C'mon, I got you.\" Not that Gardner would've trusted them, anyway.\n\n\"I'm happier than I've ever been,\" he blurted out recently, wearing paint-splattered pants and chewing on a toothpick.\n\n\"I'm broke and happy.\"\n\nScaled-down expectations\n\nGrowing up in his grandmother's three-bedroom brick rowhome, stuffed with a family of seven, Gardner remembers his childhood as \"more sweet than bitter.\"\n\nHis mom, a darker shade than Rosie, riveted airplanes. Grandma fed the tannery workers, famished from stripping animals of their hides.\n\nBack then, Spruce Street ran both ways and you could hop the trolley with empty pockets, Gardner remembers. He learned early on that just because you wanted a red wagon for Christmas, didn't mean you were going get it.\n\nSo he grabbed a pile of wood and built his own. Building a stable life proved more difficult.\n\nHis brother was shoved off to Vietnam, never to be heard from again. Gardner dreamed of making it through life with a modicum of happiness. No more. No less.\n\n\"We had what they gave you,\" he recalled. \"It ain't what you needed. It's what you got.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Howard High School, Gardner moved to Texas to remodel houses. Work was about as regular as a pick-up basketball game. Some days you were picked; others you hung your head and made the long walk home.\n\nFor a time, he hauled garbage, back when you had to roll barrels through icy alleys. He caught double pneumonia while dumping frozen meat on a conveyor belt down at the South Philly waterfront.\n\nA North Philly loft was supposed to be his refuge, but he likened it to Beirut. So he scoped out the most fortified structure around, a towering church with sturdy stone columns.\n\nThere he prayed for two hours a day. \"Help me get out this mess,\" he begged.\n\nGardner returned to Wilmington in time for school desegregation. He drove a school bus for 13 years, reminding his passengers: \"You are one color. I am one color. We're all going to be on this thing.\"\n\nThat didn't stop some of the white kids from smuggling liquor on board. Gardner drove them straight to Penny Hill Police Station.\n\nDescribing himself as a \"weekend drinker,\" Gardner said he never bothered with his old school buddies who were going nowhere on the corner. He adopted the loner lifestyle out of necessity, keeping his distance from people who could hurt him, rob him or ruin him.\n\n\"I'm born by myself,\" he reasoned. \"I'll die by myself.\"\n\nWhen you're rich, he muttered recently, you need to hire someone to manage your money and another person to watch that the first person doesn't rip you off.\n\nGardner ended up homeless last year, he said, after he lost his job and a string of close relatives died in rapid succession. He was tired of working all the time, handing over money like a pass the ball relay.\n\nWhen the music stopped, he never caught the ball.\n\nHe recalls crossing the 11th Street bridge and spotting a red wooden sign: \"Welcome to Wilmington: A Place To Be Somebody.\"\n\n\"A place to be broke,\" he huffed.\n\nGardner spent a few months squatting in abandoned houses – \"the city boards up the front, but not the back\" – scooting off before daybreak to avoid police, nosy neighbors and strung-out intruders.\n\nHe learned to sleep bear-hugging a pile of belongings on his chest. Someone at the Salvation Army stole his clothes, anyway.\n\nThe roundhouse, with its view of the monkey bars, was the only roof he could tolerate. His adult daughter, who lives in California, was never informed of papa's new digs. His older sister was off on a cruise when he moved in.\n\nGardner made sure to arrive after 11 p.m. each night to prevent any scuffles. He watched other men get shot, stabbed and bludgeoned near the playground.\n\n\"It kept me alive,\" he said during a recent visit, casting a shadow on the hard concrete. \"Out there was chaos. In here was no chaos.\"\n\nWould love conquer all? The homeless lone wolf was willing to give it a shot.\n\nHe wed here one Friday the 13th. Gardner stood at the pavilion entrance wearing a three-piece suit. His brother – the cheapest preacher in town – pronounced him the husband of a McDonald's manager, whom Gardener said had a bossy streak.\n\nThey dined that night at the Radisson, but Gardner's steak wasn't well done enough.\n\nTwo days later, their union was torn asunder.\n\nSoon after, Gardner ran into a friend who told him about Sacred Heart Village. Both tossed their names into the hat. As usual, they expected nothing.\n\n'Is this for real?'\n\nBy that time, the Delaware Supreme Court had greenlighted the three-story apartment building and Giannone had convinced the city to release its grant.\n\n\"I told [then-Mayor Dennis P.] Williams to do penance for holding us up,\" the friar remembered. Williams ended up cutting a check for $411,000, more than the ministry had initially requested.\n\nCecilia Hoey, one of the sisters who sued to block the project, never came around.\n\nAsked this week if the tidy brick building with 24-hour security is an asset to the neighborhood, she demurred: \"We're learning to work with it.\"\n\nGiannone, a senior himself, is moving on. His next project is to convert the old Cathedral Church of St. John property in Brandywine Village into 53 one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments for low- to moderate-income seniors, financed with state tax credits. The groundbreaking is scheduled for Dec. 16, with construction expected to wrap up in the spring of 2019.\n\nThe latest development upholds Giannone's continuum of care mission, allowing the elderly to age in place with dignity, instead of being \"held hostage\" in rowhomes without first-floor toilets.\n\nIn a land of plenty, he doesn't understand why he's still in business.\n\n\"I don't want to be around for my 50th anniversary,\" he says.\n\nBack at Sacred Heart Village II, residents are treated to spacious elevators and New England landscapes donated by the family of late MBNA founder Charles Cawley.\n\nGardner remembers getting the call that he was in. \"Is this for real?\" he fired back.\n\nHe now pays less than $200 a month in rent subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and feels blessed to be \"above ground.\"\n\n\"The only way I leave here,\" he insists, \"is that the man upstairs is taking me out of here.\"\n\nMost days, Gardner hangs a left to catch the bus uptown. Crunching through desiccated leaves, he passes his aunt's former house, where the tree he planted as a boy crowns over the roofline.\n\nHe's careful not to take more than $20 in his wallet and to be back by 4 p.m.\n\nHome and locked up tight, he plays nonstop R&B on his donated radio, surveying the drab grey loveseat with matching chair and generic oak nightstands. The apartment is as bare and spotless as a doctor's office with no trace of Gardner's past.\n\nHe claims that he hasn't had time to decorate and he's not hosting Thanksgiving this year, anyway. Instead, he'll join his daughter, two grandchildren and older sister at a friend's house.\n\n\"I love everything,\" he says of his slice of heaven, even though the heat is on the fritz, making it feel like Arizona in July.\n\n\"All this is mine.\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at 302-324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nMinistry of Caring celebrates 40 years of service\n\nSince the late1970s, nearly 21,000 men, women and children have stayed at emergency shelters operated by the Ministry of Caring.

Market St. below the Residences at Rodney Square at the former home of the Exchange. The doors of the main restaurant could swing open as early as next month with the bakery/crêperie/coffee shop following a month or two later with a separate entrance.\n\nAfter years of eating and drinking in city establishments, Moroccan-born co-owner Soufiane Lailani says he has learned one thing not to do with a new restaurant: close early whenever business is slow.\n\n\"The thing about downtown that always irked me is when [restaurant owners] say we're not open because there are no people here at this time or that time,\" says Lailani, who moved to Delaware 24 years ago. \"My philosophy is different. The reason why no one is going there is because you're not open.\n\n\"Look at a place like Kid Shelleen's [near Trolley Square] — you don't have to even think about it. They are open until 1 every day. It's consistent. On some nights is it just you at the bar? Sure, but you know it's always open.\"\n\nThe focus at Margaux will be on classic French dishes and flavors, along with some new creations and a Moroccan dish here or there.\n\n\"I'm not Americanizing the French. It won't be watered down,\" he promises. A bar and lounge area will also be part of the space's new layout with small plates served.\n\nBeer, cider and iron skillets\n\nA few steps down the street you'll find another anticipated new business — and this one is for the beer nerds.\n\nStitch House Brewery (829 N. Market St.) is about to be only the second downtown Wilmington brewery to produce its own beer in more than six decades when it opens this fall, aiming for a November debut.\n\nThe beer tanks have already been delivered to the 160-seat Stitch House, which will also offer a lunchtime sandwich board, along with cast iron skillets served in three different sizes. An in-house smoker will be put to use, picking up from one of Sheridan's other businesses, Wilmington's Locale BBQ Post.\n\nWhen it comes to booze, there's one other craft alcohol-maker on Market's horizon.\n\nCivil Cider could open as soon as this winter at the corner of North Shipley and West Fifth streets, the former home of the 4W5 Cafe. Alex Sianni and Gretchen Brizendine — the couple behind De La Coeur Café et Pâtisserie in Wilmington's Forty Acres — are the ones bringing that corner of Shipley Street back to life after years of dormancy.\n\nThere are several more spots prepping for a Delaware debut in the city.\n\nItalian, Chinese and more\n\nThe Italian restaurant Arde Osteria at Seventh and North Market Street, which shares the same owners as Market Street's DiMeo's Pizza, should open by the new year, according to Sarah Lamb, director of design and marketing for developers Buccini/Pollin Group.\n\nOthers coming soon include Tom's Dim Sum at 625 N. Market St., 218 Grill at 218 N. Market St. and Mi Mi Teriyaki at 925 N. Orange St.\n\nAnd when it comes to what we don't know about Market Street's upcoming tenants, attention turns to the upstairs stage and restaurant at The Queen, now under Live Nation management after World Cafe Live left in May.\n\nUnlike World Cafe Live, which operated the upstairs space themselves, offering full meals at both stages, Live Nation's Queen doesn't do dinner.\n\nThe concert giant is looking for a restaurant partner to operate the upstairs space with it. No word yet on a confirmed deal.\n\n\"We're pretty close, but it's nothing that we could talk about yet,\" says The Queen General Manager Trenton Banks.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Crane thought that McKendell was the writer because it used the phrase “off the chain,\" which is a phrase only used by \"black people\" as a reference to slavery, the lawsuit says.\n\nThese allegations aren't new. In 2018, McKendell accused Navarro and his subordinates of racial and sexual discrimination and retaliation. She said the trouble started when Navarro was elected in 2016. McKendell has had the job since January of that year, according to data from the state budget office.\n\nNavarro and the deputy denied the allegations last year. At the time, Navarro said in an emailed statement to The News Journal that McKendell's allegations contained \"gross misstatements.\"\n\nThe law firms, Morgan & Morgan and Ben Crump Law, are filing the lawsuit on behalf of McKendell. Neither law firms have offices in Delaware, according to their websites.\n\nAngeli Murthy with Morgan & Morgan, an attorney representing McKendell, said Wednesday that McKendell found herself being treated differently than her peers when working under Navarro, and reported that treatment \"through the proper channels.\"\n\nIn 2017, state legislators and Gov. John Carney created a new Department of Human Resources to handle claims like McKendell's.\n\nBut the report didn't spark an investigation into McKendell's case, and instead she \"found herself the target of concerted efforts which appeared designed to affect her departure,\" Murthy said.\n\nOn top of remedies for McKendell, Murthy called for \"systemic\" changes in the state insurance department and budget office.\n\nWhen McKendell spoke to The News Journal in 2018, the state had already offered her up to a year of paid leave plus $15,000 to withdraw her claims and apply for another state job, according to an audio recording provided by McKendell of a conversation between her and a state human resources representative.\n\nMcKendell said that she wants to feel safe and respected at work.\n\n\"I do not think that that is too much to ask,\" she said.\n\nContact reporter Sarah Gamard at sgamard@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2281.\n\nSTATE EMPLOYEE SALARIES:21 Delaware employees made more than 200K last year — none were the governor\n\nDE TURF HOTEL TAX:Gov.

Last year, 10 percent fewer Delawareans signed up for health insurance through the marketplace than in 2016.\n\nHere are five things to know about the upcoming enrollment period.\n\nStart thinking about signing up now\n\nLike last year, the enrollment period for 2019 plans is from Nov.1 to Dec. 15.\n\nThe Trump administration made significant changes to the Affordable Care Act last year, including condensing the enrollment period by six weeks. Residents also can't enroll through HealthCare.gov on Sundays this year, except for the last week.\n\nThere will be fewer navigators in Delaware this year to help people choose plans.\n\nThe Trump administration cut funding for navigator groups across the country, including for Chatman LLC in Delaware.\n\nWestside Family Healthcare received $100,000, a third of what the organization received in previous years, said Maggie Norris-Bent, a Westside Family Healthcare spokeswoman.\n\nShe said the organization rearranged its budget so that there are the same number of navigators as last year.\n\n“We’re ready,\" she said. \"We’re willing to help consumers but people need to get in early.\"\n\nOnly one insurer in Delaware marketplace\n\nDelaware is one of eight states in the country to have a single insurer on the marketplace, and for the First State, it's Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware. This means there's no competition.\n\nAetna announced in May 2017 that it was pulling out of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces entirely. Officials said the company was losing too much money.\n\nThis summer, Highmark announced it will increase its rates by 3 percent. This was the first time in three years Highmark's request wasn't in the double digits.\n\nConsider looking at gold, bronze plans\n\nThe state and Highmark have agreed to apply the 3 percent rate increase to only the silver plans — which could reduce the cost of gold and bronze plans as a result.\n\nLast year, the 25 percent rate increase was applied to the gold, silver and bronze plans, said Vince Ryan, senior adviser to Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro.\n\nBy increasing the cost of the silver plans this year, officials expect more federal subsidies will be available to help curb expenses. This could mean the cost of gold plan premiums will likely lower and bronze plans could be cheap or free for some members.\n\n\"Re-evaluate your plan,\" Ryan said. \"The plan you had last year might not be more affordable this year.\"\n\nAutomatically re-enrolling in an insurance plan may not be wise\n\nAlthough there is an option for consumers to automatically re-enroll in the marketplace, this does not mean residents will get the same plan.\n\nCruz said the marketplace will automatically pick a plan that most resembles the one consumers previously had — but it won't be identical. This means the co-pays and premiums might be different.\n\nWhen in doubt, ask a navigator\n\nWading through insurance plans and enrollment questions can be tricky, even for those who considered themselves well-versed in healthcare.\n\n\"A lady I helped last year,\" said Cruz, the Westside Family Healthcare navigator, \"she was telling me she considers herself to be an educated women, but as we were going through the application there were certain questions she didn't know how to answer,\"\n\n\"Those are things we are trained to identify and understand the reason they're asking certain questions,\" she said.\n\nCruz said navigators can help people figure out if they qualify for subsidies, or even Medicaid. They also teach people how the plans work. Westside Family Healthcare accepts walk-ins and will spend as much time with residents as needed, she said.\n\nWhen meeting with a navigator, people need to the bring the birth dates and Social Security numbers of the people applying for coverage; pay stubs, W-2 forms or other information about your family’s income; policy member numbers for any current health coverage; information about health coverage from a job that might be available to you or your family; a list of medications. If you're re-enrolling, bring your Healthcare.gov information from last year.\n\nTo learn more about enrolling, go to www.choosehealthde.com.\n\nDELAWARE HEALTH\n\nState: First pediatric flu case seen in 5-year-old from Sussex County\n\nWhen oncologist told her not to prioritize having children during treatment, she refused\n\nFor some with breast cancer, 'pink October' can't end soon enough\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or mnewman@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @MereNewman.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/27/delaware-governors-16-cabinet-members-five-staffers-make-six-figures/4264524002/", "title": "Delaware governor's 16 Cabinet members, five staffers make six ...", "text": "A look at what people who work closely with Gov.

Kay Ivey. News outlets report Ivey appointed 79-year-old Rosie Lyles to the Hale County Board of Registrars on Friday. Lyles was charged with four counts of voter fraud in 2007 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of possession of a forged instrument. Ivey press secretary Gina Maiola says the governor didn’t know about the conviction and hadn’t done a background check before the appointment. She says background checks aren’t typical for such appointments. Secretary of State John Merrill, the state’s top election official, says his office is investigating the appointment. He says it appears Lyles can serve as registrar, however, as her conviction wasn’t a felony.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The state Department of Education has launched an online tool aimed at providing families the ability to assess data from public schools. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports the tool is called The Compass: A Guide to Alaska’s Public Schools. Education Commissioner Michael Johnson says its purpose is to present data to families in an engaging and helpful way. The online portal lets users select a school and view data points about it. Johnson says the site gives people an opportunity to compare schools across the state. “This is just the start. We want to continue working on the website,” Johnson says. The department will update data as it receives new information and will review feedback to determine how the portal will be shaped.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A baby javelina is recovering after a jaunt on a freeway. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says the young javelina was one of two that brought traffic on State Route 51 to a standstill Monday afternoon. DPS officials say several troopers tried to round up the animals, which were on the northbound lanes. Trooper Martin Sotelo managed to wrangle one javelina. The other ran off and eluded capture. The rescued javelina was transported to Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center in Scottsdale for medical treatment. Javelina, which look like wild boar, are native to desert environments.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: United States Steel Corp. is buying a minority stake in an Arkansas-based steel company for $700 million. Big River Steel announced Tuesday that it had entered into an agreement with the Pittsburgh-based corporation. Under the agreement, U.S. Steel will hold a 49.9% ownership interest in Big River Steel and will hold an option to acquire the remaining 50.1% within the next four years. Big River Steel began operations at its $1.3 billion mill in Osceola in 2017 and last year announced an expansion of the facility that will add 500 new jobs. The plant was Arkansas’ first “superproject” under a 2004 constitutional amendment that allowed the state to borrow money to help lure major employers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The mayor has told department heads they cannot investigate the possible ties of city contractors to the National Rifle Association, prompting the gun-rights group to declare victory in its ongoing fight with the liberal city. Mayor London Breed issued the advisory Sept. 23, a few weeks after the Board of Supervisors passed a resolution labeling the NRA a “domestic terrorist organization” and calling on the city to take steps to assess possible ties between its contractors and the organization. In a memo cowritten by the city attorney, Breed wrote that the board can only enact new contracting requirements by ordinance. Resolutions have no legal weight. William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, said Tuesday that the memo is a “clear concession” to a lawsuit filed in federal court against the city in response to the resolution.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A local man has agreed to settle with federal officials after convincing investors to give him tens of millions of dollars in a cattle and marijuana Ponzi scheme. The Denver Post reports that Mark Ray agreed to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end the agency’s fraud investigation. Authorities say Ray channeled more than $140 million to pay off prior investors and his own medical bills, private flights and herd of show cattle from 2014 to March. Federal authorities say Ray consented to having his assets frozen, but he didn’t acknowledge any wrongdoing in the settlement. Authorities say the business Universal Herbs was in deep debt, and detailed descriptions of the cattle and feedlots were mostly lies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWindsor Locks: A World War II-era plane with 13 people aboard crashed and burned at the Hartford airport after encountering mechanical trouble on takeoff Wednesday, killing seven. The four-engine, propeller-driven B-17 bomber struggled to get into the air and slammed into a maintenance building at Bradley International Airport as the pilots circled back for a landing, officials and witnesses said. Some of the survivors of the crash were critically injured, authorities said. One person on the ground was also hurt, and a firefighter involved in the response suffered a minor injury. The vintage bomber – also known as a Flying Fortress, one of the most celebrated Allied planes of World War II – was used to take history buffs and aircraft enthusiasts on short flights, during which they could get up and walk around the loud and windy interior.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware says it’ll decrease its rates on the Affordable Care Act marketplace by nearly 20%, marking the first time rates have dropped after years of steady increases. Reduced premiums will be funded by millions of state and federal dollars, including a small fee taken from all commercial insurers. The rate relief comes as a state report showed the cost of monthly marketplace premiums doubled from 2014 to 2018, causing thousands of residents to drop coverage and insurers to drop out. Highmark is the only insurer left. Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro also credits Delaware’s newly approved reinsurance program with helping reduce rates. The program will cover some expensive ACA enrollees’ medical claims.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Court records say Whole Foods customers helped detain a man accused of filming under the skirt of a 13-year-old girl standing in a store checkout line. Citing D.C. Superior Court records, news outlets report Daniel Izquierdo, 25, was spotted standing “usually close” to the girl in March. Records say a witness noticed Izquierdo appeared to be filming under the girl’s dress and began yelling, leading customers to detain him until police arrived. Records say he refused to let police view any video on his phone. Police Chief Peter Newsham said at a news conference Tuesday that officers obtained search warrants and, with the FBI’s assistance, found the upskirting video, along with videos of 34 other women. Izquierdo was arrested Monday on voyeurism charges.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A South Florida eco-adventure park is hosting a Chinese lantern festival for the rest of the year. A Jungle Island news release says it’s opening Luminosa to the public this Saturday. The 18-acre park, located on an island between downtown Miami and Miami Beach, has partnered with Zigong Lantern Group and China Lantern International to create a nighttime jungle filled with giant illuminated lanterns made from colorful silk by Chinese artisans. Luminosa features lanterns shaped into animals, flowers and iconic Miami destinations. More than 1 million LED lights are used in the attraction. Luminosa will run from 5 to 10 p.m. daily until Jan. 8. Regular adult admission is $35.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked Georgia’s restrictive new abortion law from taking effect, following the lead of other judges who have blocked similar measures in other states. The law signed in May by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp bans abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present, with some limited exceptions. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realize they’re expecting, according to a legal challenge. The law had been scheduled to become enforceable Jan. 1. Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights in June filed a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Georgia abortion providers and an advocacy group.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A park development project has been delayed following the discovery of a possible artifact on the grounds. Mayor Kirk Caldwell halted the project at Waimanalo Bay Beach Park on Tuesday while officials wait for further information from the State Historic Preservation Division and the Oahu Island Burial Council. The discovery of an artifact of historical value could hold up a $1.43 million development at the Oahu park, commonly known as Sherwood Forest. The planned construction of a multipurpose field, 11-stall parking lot and playground has sparked demonstrations and a lawsuit to block the development. Experts determined the object is “basalt of a lava dike.” The burial council is scheduled to discuss the object at its Oct. 9 meeting.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials plan to round up nearly all the wild horses in a south-central Idaho wild horse area so the population can be brought down and maintained at about 50 horses. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said Tuesday that it has approved an environmental analysis that includes using fertility control on 25 female horses that would be released back into the wild. The agency estimates the population at the Saylor Creek Herd Management Area, about 15 miles south of Glenns Ferry, will be about 170 horses by summer 2020. The agency says if the roundup occurs then, it expects to capture about 150 horses using a bait and water trap. Horses not returned to the wild would be prepared for the agency’s adoption program. It’s not clear when the roundup might occur.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will spend $2.7 million to make sure more residents are included in the 2020 census. It’s an effort Mayor Lori Lightfoot says is driven in large part by an effort to combat fear created by the Trump administration’s immigration raids. At a news conference Tuesday, Lightfoot announced what she says is the largest amount of funding Chicago has ever committed to the census. She says despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision to block the Trump administration’s push to add a citizenship question to the census form, concern linger among immigrants and refugees that it is not safe to come forward to be counted. Lightfoot also says an accurate census is important because for every person not counted, the city stands to lose $1,400 per person per year.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Zoo reached a deal last month with the owner of the former GM stamping plant site to acquire dozens of acres that will allow the zoo to expand in the coming years. Ambrose Property Group donated 10 acres of land, and the Indianapolis Zoo bought another 161/ 2 acres of space from the former GM plant site, according to a Wednesday news release from the zoo. Later Wednesday, the city sent a letter to Ambrose threatening to use eminent domain to take ownership of the rest of the development site unless Ambrose reaches a deal to sell to the city. In a move that shocked officials, Ambrose announced Friday that it plans to sell the site after more than a year of preparations and hundreds of thousands of dollars of infrastructure improvements made by the city.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will end its 2019 fiscal year with a surplus of more than $289 million in its general fund, but Republican political leaders have been cautious about discussing where the money might be spent. Gov. Kim Reynolds says it’s a reflection of a vibrant economy, adding in a statement Monday that the state must be “mindful of the economic headwinds in our agricultural economy and be prepared for whatever the future might hold.” Farmers are facing a tough year with trade disruptions due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs and policies that have hurt corn and soybean markets, potentially cutting into state income tax revenue. The fiscal year ended in June, but the state posted its final budget figures at the end of September.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly is discounting Republican calls to rescind a policy requiring out-of-state online businesses to collect sales taxes on transactions in Kansas and remit the tax to the state. On Monday, Attorney General Derek Schmidt issued a nonbinding opinion that Kelly’s administration did not have the legal authority to impose the policy, which some experts said is the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting state and local taxes on online sales. House and Senate GOP leaders then demanded Kelly drop the policy, which the Kansas Department of Revenue issued in August. The tax collections were scheduled to take effect Tuesday. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports Kelly says the policy reflects existing state law and would promote tax fairness.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Matt Bevin wants students to celebrate a holiday Oct. 3 – and he isn’t talking about Mean Girls Day. This Thursday, Bevin wants kids to bring the Holy Scripture to class and take part in “Bring Your Bible to School Day,” an annual event that encourages students of all ages to take the religious text into the classroom. “I would encourage you, please, don’t just bring your Bible to school, but read your Bible. Bring it, share it with others. If you have an extra Bible, bring it and share it with somebody who doesn’t have one, who maybe has never read this book,” Bevin said Tuesday in a video posted on social media. “Bring Your Bible to School Day” is sponsored by Focus on the Family, a national Christian organization that has frequently come under fire.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A planning committee in Caddo Parish has recommended setting aside up to $500,000 to move a Confederate monument. News outlets report the Long Range Planning/Special Projects Committee of the Caddo Parish Commission made the decision at a meeting Monday. The full commission is expected to vote on the proposal in early December. The monument stands outside the Caddo Parish Courthouse in Shreveport. Parish attorney Donna Frazier wrote to the United Daughters of the Confederacy in late August saying the group had 90 days to remove the monument. In a statement and letter released Monday, the UDC said Frazier hadn’t responded to a Sept. 5 letter from attorney Arthur Carmondy saying the 90-day notice is invalid. Frazier told the Shreveport Times she responded to the letter Monday.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The University of Maine System says it’s going to cover the full cost of tuition and fees for more than 1,200 members of the state’s graduating high school classes next year. The system made the announcement Wednesday as part of its “Maine Values You” outreach program. System Chancellor Dannel Malloy says the offer is evidence the state’s public universities “can proudly offer Maine students unmatched affordability” and access to higher education. System spokesman Daniel Demeritt says students will be chosen based on more than one metric and will first have to apply for financial aid. The state covered 1,142 students this year. Demeritt says the coverage of tuition will be available at UMaine campuses around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Property records show former Mayor Catherine Pugh, who resigned in May, has sold her home for less than half its assessed value. The Baltimore Sun reports records show she sold one of her two Ashburton homes for $75,000 to Boaz Alternative Energy and Technologies LLC in July. Property records list the home’s assessed value as $187,700. Pugh resigned in May under pressure amid a flurry of investigations into whether she arranged bulk sales of her self-published children’s books to disguise hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks. She’s still being investigated at the state and federal level. Pugh listed the home as her principal address but lived at a different Ashburton home.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge has cleared Harvard University of discriminating against Asian American applicants in a ruling that was seen as a major victory for supporters of affirmative action. In a closely watched lawsuit, a group called Students for Fair Admissions accused the Ivy League college of deliberately – and illegally – holding down the number of Asian Americans accepted in order to preserve a certain racial balance on campus. U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, however, ruled that Harvard’s admissions process is “not perfect” but passes constitutional muster. She said there is “no evidence of any racial animus whatsoever” and no evidence that any admission decision was “negatively affected by Asian American identity.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Police are looking into who demolished a house that a state lawmaker and her nonprofit group were planning to rehab for a needy family. Detroit police Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood said Tuesday that the case is being investigated as malicious destruction of property. Mayor Mike Duggan’s office said information shows the house on Minock in northwest Detroit was torn down on or around Sept. 20 but was not on a list of properties slated for demolition and was not in the pipeline in preparation to be razed. Democratic Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo has said the house was torn down without notice to her or her nonprofit group, Coalition to Integrate Technology and Education. The property was purchased last year for $1,000 from the Detroit Land Bank Authority.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Some midwives are warning that the state’s unregulated midwifery practices pose a danger to mothers and babies as home births rise. Minnesota Public Radio News reports that the state in 2000 recorded two planned home births. In 2018, that number jumped to 721. Minnesota and Utah are the sole states that don’t require midwives to obtain a license to deliver babies. Licensed home birth midwives must earn their Certified Professional Midwife credential from the state Board of Medical Practice. Tavniah Betts, a licensed midwife, says being licensed benefits families and midwives by providing access to filing complaints. Tracey Lapointe, an unlicensed midwife and the president of the Minnesota Midwifery Guild, says requiring licensing would diminish the supply of midwives while demand is rising.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Justice Department says a sheriff fired an employee because he had to be gone on military duty for extended periods. Coahoma County Sheriff Charles Jones says the employee was fired for “insubordination,” not for taking military leave. The department filed a civil lawsuit Monday against Coahoma County. It says Jason M. Sims Jr. of Batesville is in the Army Reserve and teaches leadership classes at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The suit says Sims started working for the sheriff’s department in 2014 and told his bosses he would need to take military leave. It says the sheriff’s office “demonstrated hostility” to that in 2016, then fired him in 2018. Jones says he’s “100% confident” the firing was unrelated to Sims’ military service.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: An inmate was executed Tuesday for killing a man in 1996 in a string of violence that included several other crimes, despite concerns that the prisoner’s rare medical condition would cause a gruesome lethal injection. Russell Bucklew was put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It was Missouri’s first execution since January 2017. Bucklew had twice previously been within hours of execution, only to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant last-minute reprieves over concerns that he might suffer during the execution process. He had a condition called cavernous hemangioma and had blood-filled tumors in his head, neck and throat. He breathed with help from a tracheostomy tube. His attorneys said a throat tumor could burst, causing him to choke and die painfully and in violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge is considering the U.S. government’s request to throw out a lawsuit by two women who say they were illegally questioned by border agents for 40 minutes for speaking Spanish in a convenience store. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris was scheduled to hear motions to dismiss the lawsuit filed by Ana Suda and Martha “Mimi” Hernandez on Wednesday. They say U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agent Paul O’Neill detained them in a parking lot in Havre last year in violation of constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizures. They are asking Morris to block the agency from detaining anyone based on race, accent or language alone and to award them an unspecified amount for damages. Attorneys for the agency say that it has sovereign immunity against damage claims and that the women are unlikely to be stopped again.\n\nNebraska\n\nBellevue: An Air Force colonel says he and other officials are paying close attention to resident complaints about living conditions and repairs at off-base, privatized housing for personnel at Offutt Air Force Base just south of Omaha. Col. Gavin Marks, commander of the 55th Wing at Offutt, told residents Tuesday at a town hall meeting at a Bellevue school that he’s set up a new hotline to handle complaints. The Omaha World-Herald reports local complaints about mold, shoddy construction, slow repairs and street problems at the Rising View neighborhood west of the base echo those from other bases. At Offutt, inspectors found 96 homes with what inspectors described as “health and safety” violations, such as mold or lead paint. The leasing manager says all the violations have been rectified.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State policymakers have announced plans to explore potential legislation that would follow California in allowing state university athletes to make money from endorsement deals. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the Legislature does not meet again until February 2021, and Democratic state Sen. Yvanna Cancela says a formal proposal has not yet been created and is still in the research process as she looks for “a proposal that fits Nevada.” Cancela says the California bill is forcing other states to figure out how to compete with its recruitment practices. The Mountain West Conference didn’t respond to requests for comment. A NCAA statement says laws from different states would not level the playing field.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has made another pick for the state’s poet laureate, a few months after he abandoned his last choice following growing criticism of the man’s work and how he was selected. Sununu planned to nominate Alexandria Peary, of Londonderry, to be the next poet laureate, at Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting. She’s written six books, including “Control Bird Alt Delete.” Her newest book, “The Water Draft,” is to be published this month. Though he never formally nominated him, Sununu initially chose Daniel Thomas Moran, a retired dentist and former poet laureate of Suffolk County, New York, whom some said wasn’t qualified. The surfacing of a sexually suggestive poem Moran wrote about former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice only intensified the criticism.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A federal judge has agreed to block the state’s recent political donor disclosure law in response to a lawsuit brought by a think tank founded by the Koch brothers. U.S. District Judge Brian Martinotti granted the injunction Wednesday. Americans for Prosperity challenged the new law, which required political organizations and some nonprofits to disclose all spending over $3,000, up from $1,600. The law also mandated that contributors giving more than $10,000 would be disclosed. The group said the law was unconstitutional on its face and could ruin organizations. The state argued the bill was aimed at showing who was “pulling the strings” in politics. A spokesman for Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said the state is reviewing the decision.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A small lizard found among the dunes straddling New Mexico and West Texas in one of the nation’s richest oil basins is at the center of a legal complaint filed Tuesday. Environmentalists want the U.S. government to add the dunes sagebrush lizard to the endangered species list as part of a fight that stretches back to the Bush and Obama administrations and could affect part of the multibillion-dollar energy industry in the Permian Basin. The Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife filed the complaint in federal court in Washington. It follows a listing petition that the groups submitted in May 2018. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had 90 days to consider the petition and initiate a review of the species if necessary, but the groups say the agency failed to take action.\n\nNew York\n\nWoodstock: The Woodstock Film Festival this year will feature an appearance by actor Matt Dillon. The 20-year-old annual festival runs Wednesday through Sunday in the Hudson Valley towns of Woodstock, Rhinebeck, Kingston, Saugerties and Rosendale. This year the event will showcase more than 50 features from around the world, short films, panels and live performances. Films being shown this week include Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story” and “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” which won best screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival. Dillon is to take part in a question-and-answer session Saturday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMount Holly: A truck assembly company has announced it will lay off 900 employees between two Freightliner plants in the state in the coming weeks. Daimler Trucks North America, the parent company of Freightliner, confirmed Tuesday that about 450 employees would lose their jobs at the manufacturing plant in Mount Holly, and another 450 would be laid off at Rowan County’s Cleveland plant by Oct. 14. Daimler said in a statement the layoffs come as the truck market returns to normal levels after a year of record sales. Mount Holly employee Robin Jenkins told the Gaston Gazette some employees are scared because they don’t think they’ll be receiving severance, though other employees said they’re used to the “cyclical nature” of truck building.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The proposed presidential library for Theodore Roosevelt in western North Dakota now has a CEO. The board of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum voted Tuesday to appoint Edward F. O’Keefe to lead the organization. Gov. Doug Burgum calls O’Keefe “the best person” to take the proposed library “to the next level.” O’Keefe is a North Dakota native who is writing a book on Roosevelt, who spent more than three years in the state in the 1880s. Burgum has made the library a top priority of his administration. State legislators in April approved $50 million to operate the library, but that must be matched by $100 million in private money. O’Keefe will join Burgum and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt along with Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer on a tour of Medora on Thursday.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: The federal government says it received no bids during a competitive lease sale for coal underneath about 430 acres of Wayne National Forest. The Bureau of Land Management-Eastern States released the results of last week’s offering on Tuesday. Leases involved seven tracts in Perry and Morgan counties that contain an estimated 1.4 million tons of subsurface mineable federal coal. The sale came in response to a lease application by CCU Coal and Construction, formerly Westmoreland Coal Co., which already operates an adjacent privately owned underground coal mine. But the bureau said no one bid on the leases. Officials said the public will be notified if an additional request is ever made to offer competitive leases for the tracts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A judge made a $107 million miscalculation when he ordered consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million to help clean up the state’s opioid crisis, attorneys for the company argue in a court filing. The company also is asking for a reduction in the judgment based on pretrial settlements totaling $355 million that the state reached with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The company has separately appealed the court’s ruling to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, arguing that Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman’s ruling was an unprecedented interpretation of the state’s public nuisance law. A spokesman for Attorney General Mike Hunter declined to comment on the filing.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities suspect the bizarre deaths and mutilations of five bulls were caused by humans, but they have no leads. The deaths of the bulls recall mutilations of livestock across the West and Midwest in the 1970s that struck fear in rural areas. A former FBI agent who headed an investigation said there was no indication that anything other than ordinary animal predators were behind the mutilations. In the weeks since the dead bulls were found over several days in July, the Harney County Sheriff’s Office has received calls and emails with speculation about what, or who, might be responsible. Colby Marshall, vice president of the ranch that owned the bulls, says he suspects a cult is behind the killings. Ranch hands have been advised to travel in pairs and to go armed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPottsville: Soon on tap: a new brew featuring Yuengling’s nearly 200-year-old porter recipe and Hershey’s chocolate. The two Pennsylvania companies are teaming up on a limited-edition beer called Yuengling Hershey’s Chocolate Porter. The chocolate-infused brew will be available on tap beginning in mid-October at bars, restaurants and other venues in 13 states. It’s the first collaboration for Pottsville-based Yuengling, America’s oldest operating brewery. The company says the beer will have “rich chocolate notes” and recommends pairing it with barbecued and smoked meats, cheeses and desserts. The brew was in development for nearly a year. Yuengling expects it to last until February.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Providence: The town has built a public safety complex using its share from a settlement with Google. The Providence Journal reports the $27 million, 58,000-square-foot building now houses the North Providence police and fire departments. Rhode Island’s share of the 2012 settlement, about $230 million, is being distributed to police departments, the attorney general’s office and the National Guard. An investigation exposed Google’s role in the online sale of non-FDA-approved prescription drugs. The complex includes a courtroom, offices, dispatch center, training area, bunk rooms, crime laboratory, emergency operations center and cell block.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A former member of the board that oversees state highways will spend seven months in prison for trying to hire a prostitute just hours after he received probation for admitting he tried to derail an FBI investigation by destroying evidence. John Hardee, 72, was sentenced Wednesday after a psychiatrist hired by his lawyer suggested a mild form of dementia might have led him to text what turned out to be an undercover deputy offering $40 for a sex act. Hardee also asked for mercy, saying he has been with terrible criminals and heard horrible language used during his time in jail since his August arrest, according to media outlets. As he handed down the sentence, U.S. Judge Terry Wooten told Hardee he hoped the former official learned his lesson this time and pointed out even with the dementia diagnosis, the psychiatrist still testified Hardee knew right from wrong.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A group of truckers plans a “slow roll” protest in the state Thursday. Organizer Jeremy Johnson says the demonstration of a line of semi-trucks driving at reduced speed will loop around Sioux Falls and continue on to Pierre. He says the group will have a “slow roll” on Interstates 29, 229 and 90. The protest is a local response to a trucker demonstration planned in Washington, D.C., to protest federal legislation including proposals to limit truck speed, increase the minimum personal liability that truckers must carry, and mandate safety equipment to keep cars from sliding under trucks. The line of trucks will drive about 50 mph within Sioux Falls city limits and drive about 60 mph outside city limits.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Agriculture says a disease that kills sassafras trees has been detected in Dickson and Montgomery counties. The department is advising residents to be on the lookout for signs of laurel wilt disease. They include browning of leaves, leaf loss and staining in the inner bark. Those who suspect their trees might be diseased should contact the state Division of Forestry. Laurel wilt is a fungal disease transmitted by the wood-boring redbay ambrosia beetle. It can affect a range of plants, including sassafras and spicebush. State Forester David Arnold says in a news release that sassafras and spicebush are important ecological species in Tennessee. He says the disease is “another unfortunate example of an invasive pest impacting our forests.”\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The U.S. government has awarded three contracts worth more than $812.6 million for construction of about 65 miles of new border wall along the lower Rio Grande in South Texas. In a statement issued Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the contracts were awarded Sunday to two contractors. The wall projects are to include steel bollard walls of 18 to 30 feet in height, all-weather roads, lighting, security cameras and other technology in 19 separate segments in Starr, Hidalgo and Cameron counties. The statement said the walls will go up, starting early next year, where none now exist but not in areas prohibited under the CBP’s 2019 appropriation. The sector is the CBP’s busiest, accounting for about 40% of its immigrant apprehensions.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Gov. Gary Herbert has rescinded an emergency drought order nearly a year after it went into effect. The Daily Herald reports that persistent rain and snowfall this year have gradually put an end to statewide severe drought conditions. Almost 99% of Utah was experiencing at least moderate drought last year when the governor declared a state of emergency in October 2018. Herbert said it was affecting agribusiness, livestock production and wildlife habitats. But with a change in the weather this year, no area of the state has severe drought conditions, and the U.S. Drought Monitor shows parts facing moderate drought have dropped to 15%. Much of that area is in the southern part of the state, which has had a relatively quiet monsoon season.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre: The state Agency of Transportation has launched a new tool that will help bus riders track the location of buses and their arrival times as well as search bus routes and stops. The agency announced Tuesday that the Transit app, which can be downloaded to cellphones for free, shows the real-time bus location on any transit route operating in Vermont. Barbara Donovan, the agency’s public transit program manager, says that “our riders deserve this predictability and real-time information.” The agency says the app also has features for trip planning, navigation, notifications for bus service disruptions, and departure and stop reminders.\n\nVirginia\n\nWest Point: A high school teacher who was fired for refusing to use a transgender student’s new pronouns has filed a lawsuit. The Washington Post reports Peter Vlaming is suing West Point Public Schools, outside Richmond. Vlaming says his rights to speak freely and exercise his religion were violated. The suit states that Vlaming “sincerely believes that referring to a female as a male by using an objectively male pronoun is telling a lie.” The French teacher was fired in December . He had told superiors at West Point High School that his religion prevented him from using male pronouns for a student who had informed the school of his transition during the summer.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: State land officials have approved a land transfer to help conservation groups protect recreation areas on Blanchard Mountain. The Skagit-Valley Herald reports that the state Board of Natural Resources granted the approval Tuesday for the 2.5-square-mile area known as the Blanchard Core, which includes popular trails, campgrounds and lakes. Land officials say the transfer would be paid for with $10 million allocated by the Legislature in 2018 to become a state natural area. The transfer would be completed by putting sections of the Blanchard Core into the Common School Trust program, then paying the program the $9.2 million value of timber on that land. Officials say the $626,000 value of the land would be used to purchase new forest lands elsewhere in the state.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded $5 million to the Water Research Institute at West Virginia University for its rare earth recovery project. The project includes building a facility at a new acid mine drainage treatment plant near Mount Storm. Rare earth elements come from acid mine drainage sludge and are used to power things such as smartphones and the U.S. missile guidance system. The institute will partner with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Office of Special Reclamation, Rockwell Automation and TenCate Corp. in the project. About 15,000 tons of rare earth elements are used annually in the U.S., which imports nearly all of them. A bench scale pilot plant was opened in 2018 on WVU’s campus to test the feasibility of extraction and refining technology.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A man convicted of rape and murder when he was a teenager whose story was documented in the 2015 Netflix series “Making a Murderer” asked the governor for a pardon or commutation of his life prison sentence Wednesday. The request from Brendan Dassey came as his advocates launched yet another attempt to free him, this time outside the court system. His latest appeal was not considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. Dassey’s chances of getting a pardon from Gov. Tony Evers appear remote. “I am writing to ask for a pardon because I am innocent and want to go home,” Dassey said in a handwritten note to Evers that accompanied his application. Dassey also listed things he enjoys, including Pokemon and hamburgers, and drew a pair of hearts with the word “hugs” in one and “love” in the other.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife officials have introduced a detailed plan for review to scale back elk and bison feeding days by 50%. Jackson Hole News & Guide reports the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officially released the draft “step-down” plan Monday. Wildlife officials say the plan was intended to reduce elk numbers and make the animals more reliant on native vegetation, including strategies to wean the animals off alfalfa. Officials say the plan details feeding the elk later and ending the alfalfa handouts earlier to draw fewer elk to feedgrounds on the National Elk Refuge north of Jackson. Officials say the plan is not open to being altered through the current public review process, but an accompanying environmental assessment is. Deadline for comments are due to the refuge by Oct. 30.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/27/subway-thanksgiving-high-horse-gift-wrap-wars-news-around-states/40714889/", "title": "A subway Thanksgiving, too-high horse: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A new statue of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks will be unveiled at Court Square downtown Sunday at 1 p.m. The unveiling Dec. 1 will coincide with the day in 1955 when Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a public bus to a white man. Along with the Parks memorial, the city will present two historic markers for Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses unconstitutional. The civil rights memorials are a partnership among the City of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency will decide by September how much ocean and coast will be designated as critical habitat for two ice seal species found in the state. The Center for Biological Diversity announced Monday that it had reached an agreement with the Commerce Department for the Trump administration to issue a critical habitat rule for ringed and bearded seals. Ringed and bearded seals live off Alaska’s northwest coast. Both are listed as threatened. Designation of critical habitat for threatened species is required by the Endangered Species Act a year after a listing. The Center for Biological Diversity sued in June because no critical habitat has been designated. Federal agencies that authorize activities such as oil drilling within critical habitat must consult with wildlife managers to determine if threatened species will be affected.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: For many elementary students, this time of year is filled with lessons about Thanksgiving, often arts and crafts or plays about the Pilgrims. That’s not the case for students at schools like Salt River Elementary and Puente de Hozho. Instead, these students get lessons that give insight into and strengthen their identity as indigenous people, focusing on fall harvest traditions and the importance of giving thanks. Teaching the myth of Thanksgiving is not required in the state’s standards for history and social studies. Salt River Elementary is a Bureau of Indian Education school located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and 100% of the student body is Native American. The school incorporates cultural and traditional learning within its curriculum. During November, many teachers increase those lessons for Native American Heritage Month. As for Thanksgiving, “we only talk about being thankful and being with family,” says Clarice Garcia, a fifth grade teacher. In the weeks leading up to the holiday, Garcia said she tries to talk about the positive and negative impacts explorers had on indigenous people, letting students form their own opinion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas is now the home of a photo archive containing nearly a million photos of historical figures and events. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the collection arrived at the campus in Fayetteville last month. The archive includes photos of Babe Ruth, Bonnie Parker, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King. There are also pictures documenting politics, wars, natural disasters and the civil rights movement. Dean of libraries Dennis T. Clark says the large trove is very significant in American journalism. He says it is the New York Post’s photo archive, which contains photos dating back to the 1860s. Lori Birrell, head of the special collections department at the UA library, says the collection will show the university is interested in having a national and international presence. Clark says the gift came from an anonymous donor in 2017.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has a pair of quirky new arrivals from Australia: platypuses. Last week the zoo publicly debuted an 8-year-old male named Birrarung and a 15-year-old female named Eve. The pair were flown to the park late last month. The zoo says it’s the first time in more than 50 years that platypuses – egg-laying mammals with furry bodies and ducklike bills – have been cared for outside of Australia. Safari Park’s lead keeper, Lori Hieber, says the pair have settled into their new, specially built habitat. She says they swim in the pools, play in the waterfalls and hunt live crayfish. An international conservation group lists the platypus as a “near threatened” species, mainly from habitat loss and the potential destruction from climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court has denied a request to reconsider a ruling declaring the sentences of hundreds of criminal defendants to be illegal. The Denver Post reports the justices refused to rethink whether criminal offenders could be sentenced to both prison and probation in the same case. Officials say the court ruled in September that defendants couldn’t be simultaneously sentenced. Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a petition this month challenging the decision, saying it could create extensive litigation affecting hundreds or even thousands of plea agreements and leading to numerous challenges. Officials say defendants convicted by a jury must be resentenced. Authorities say witnesses might have moved away, police investigators might have retired, and victims might not want to testify again, causing problems in the process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state will soon host its second inauguration of 2019. On Monday, West Hartford fifth grader Myra Stanfield will become the 2020 Kid Governor, succeeding 2019’s Ella Briggs. A ceremony is planned at the Old State House in Hartford. Like Ella, Myra was elected to the one-year position by fifth graders across Connecticut. She ran on a platform of preventing animal abuse. Her term begins in January. The civics education program was created in 2015 by the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, now known as the Connecticut Democracy Center. Participating students are given an opportunity to create a campaign platform around an issue, run for office and vote in the election. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose inauguration was 11 months ago, released a video online congratulating Myra.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Department of Insurance is warning residents about a new Medicare tool that state officials say causes confusion and conceals the total cost of coverage. In what he described as a rare consumer alert, Commissioner Trinidad Navarro said in a press release that the department has received numerous complaints about Medicare’s Prescription Plan Finder. The tool, created by the federal government and used by millions, is supposed to help find and compare Medicare coverage options for the current enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. Navarro said the tool’s “focus on premium costs can deflect focus from higher personal costs at the pharmacy counter.” The tool organizes responses, Navarro said, by showing lowest premium costs first. But previous versions of the tool showed it by total annual costs. And if residents enter multiple medications, they could receive search results for plans that don’t cover all those they entered, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district is joining several states in suing e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, saying the company’s online ads and promotions illegally targeted minors. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging that Juul’s viral marketing contributed to the surge in underage vaping by teens in the district and across the U.S. The move follows similar lawsuits filed by California, New York and North Carolina. Several other states are also investigating Juul, which dominates the U.S. vaping market. Under intense pressure, Juul has suspended its U.S. advertising and halted sales of all but two of its flavors. Additionally, the company closed its social media accounts and tightened age verification for online sales. Representatives for Juul did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: The local school district is bringing in a crack squad of four-legged experts to deal with an overgrown patch of rough terrain, where hidden gopher tortoises, snakes, steep banks and vertical drop-offs make it too hazardous for grounds crews to handle. About two dozen goats will descend into a fenced area around a pond next to Imperial Estates Elementary in Titusville next week. Grounds services supervisor Matt Nolle says the area is too dangerous for heavy equipment or even people on foot. Goats are better for the environment and can get into places humans can’t. “Somehow, four legs is an advantage,” Nolle says. The Brevard School District is paying about $4,500 to hire the goats from Rent-a-Ruminant, a landscaping livestock company.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia Southern University has officially opened a learning center in Ireland. Savannah Morning News reports university leaders traveled to Wexford last week for the ceremonial event. A news release from the university says the center stems from a longtime partnership between the town and Savannah, as well as Georgia Southern’s Center for Irish Research and Teaching. The school says many Savannah residents claim Irish ancestry and can trace ancestors specifically to Wexford. University President Kyle Marrero met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins during the visit. The school says it marked the first official meeting between a Georgia Southern president and a foreign head of state. The school says Georgia Southern is the first public university in the United States to open an outreach learning facility in Ireland.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Education plans to offer free Hawaiian language courses to its employees. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the department’s 22,000 salaried employees, including 13,000 teachers, will be able to take courses beginning in January. Officials say the program is a partnership between the education department’s Office of Hawaiian Education and the University of Hawaii’s community colleges. The education department has incorporated Hawaiian language, culture and history in its curriculum since an 80-year public education ban on the language was overturned at the 1978 state constitutional convention. Employees can enroll in scheduled courses at seven community colleges beginning in the spring semester or join customized courses for education department staff groups. Teachers completing courses will receive professional development credits, while other employees will be given college credit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Fisheries managers are optimistic a program to save imperiled Snake River sockeye salmon is heading in the right direction despite few of the ocean-going fish making it back to central Idaho this year. Of the 735,000 young sockeye released in the state in 2017, only 17 survived the 900-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean and then back again to arrive as adults in the Sawtooth Basin near Stanley. But John Powell of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said last week that fish raised to adults in hatcheries will keep the population going. Biologists also released 610 adults this fall into central Idaho lakes to spawn naturally. Powell also says biologists have solved problems that caused most of the young hatchery sockeye to die shortly after being released into the wild in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: There are full slates of special events and celebrations scheduled for the holiday season at two state historic sites in the city. Santa will be available regularly at the Old State Capitol to collect children’s Christmas wishes, and specially themed tours are scheduled for the Dana-Thomas House designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Children and families may visit with St. Nick and play holiday games at the Old State Capitol from 1 to 5 p.m. each Saturday from Nov. 30 to Dec. 21 and from 5 to 8 p.m. each Wednesday from Dec. 4 to 18. Each day will feature a different musical group as well. A dozen variously themed tours of the Dana-Thomas House are scheduled periodically from Nov. 29 through Dec. 20. Some require reservations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is facing calls from Democrats to explain his role in Amazon being cleared of responsibility for a warehouse worker’s death despite initial findings of major safety violations. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb denies any involvement in the state’s investigation of the 2017 death at Amazon’s Plainfield warehouse. The news outlet Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting reports a safety inspector ordered a $28,000 fine against Amazon, concluding it didn’t provide enough training before a forklift fatally crushed 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry. It cites a recording the inspector made in which his boss tells Amazon officials how to shift the blame to “employee misconduct.” The death investigation happened while the Holcomb administration was bidding on Amazon’s planned second headquarters project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has pardoned two tom turkeys, continuing a long-standing Thanksgiving tradition celebrating the state’s turkey industry. The male birds named Benjamin and Franklin will live at Living History Farms in Urbandale, a 500-acre, open-air history museum that demonstrates three centuries of Iowa farm life. Reynolds held the annual event Tuesday at Terrace Hill, the governor’s residence, where she says she’ll spend Thanksgiving cooking for her family. Several family members, including grandchildren, petted the turkeys after Reynolds read the proclamation freeing them from becoming a thanksgiving meal. Iowa ranks seventh in U.S. turkey production, turning out more than 12 million turkeys annually on 130 farms. The state is fifth in turkey processing with plants in Storm Lake and West Liberty.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly reveled in holiday spirit Tuesday for the annual horse-drawn delivery of a Christmas tree to Cedar Crest, the official governor’s residence. The first-year governor said for years she has watched the celebration on the news with the rest of the state, and it was a “treat” to preside over the event. Every year, a member of the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association donates a tree for the occasion. Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm near Lawrence donated this year’s model. Robin Dunn, of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville, guided percherons Bill and Bruce as they pulled a replica Wells Fargo stagecoach up the drive to the front of the governor’s mansion to deliver the tree. Dunn said she has now delivered trees to five Kansas governors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s politicos are getting all wrapped up in the Christmas wars this year. After the reelection campaign for Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., began selling gift wrap featuring the Senate majority leader’s face with a Santa hat and a green bow tie – reminiscent of an iconic image of Christmas crooner Bing Crosby – the Kentucky Democratic Party has shot back with its own bespoke present paper. A donation of $30 to the commonwealth’s blue party yields a roll of red “Moscow Mitch” wrapping paper, featuring yellow images of the Republican wearing a Cossack hat with the “hammer and sickle” symbol on top of the words “Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch,” referring to a nickname McConnell received over the summer. “Anything @Team_Mitch can do, we can do better,” the Kentucky Democratic Party wrote in a tweet.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state museum system is asking for feedback as it works to update its governance, operations and attendance at its properties. The museum system wants people to fill out a five- to 10-minute survey about their interest in the facilities and their experiences at them. The survey will be available online until Saturday. The Louisiana state museum system includes the Cabildo and the Presbytere in New Orleans, the New Orleans Jazz Museum, the Capitol Park Museum in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches, among other facilities. Survey participants can enter to win a membership through the Friends of the Cabildo that gives free admission for two people and any children to all public state museum properties.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: Officials say a new partnership with the state’s farmers markets has expanded the number of people who can use the markets by making food assistance easier to access. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry says it has partnered with the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets to help pay for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program processing equipment. The technology can cost hundreds of dollars, which prices many small markets out of the ability to buy it. About 1 in 8 Maine residents uses SNAP. The state says a half-dozen farmers markets have received new SNAP processing gear through the partnership since July. Maine has a total of about 35 farmers markets that accept SNAP.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore: The National Park Service will institute a modest increase for all parks that charge entrance fees next year, including on Assateague Island. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, entrance fees at Assateague Island National Seashore will be modified to align with standardized rates being implemented nationwide for similar national park areas at the rate of an extra $5 per category. A seven-day pass to the park will be $25 per vehicle or $20 per motorcycle. An annual park pass will cost $45, and individuals will be charged $15 per person when entering by commercial vehicle. An entrance pass provides seven consecutive days of access to the seashore and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. The additional funds will be used for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Native Americans are gathering for a 50th year in the seaside town where the Pilgrims settled – not to give thanks but to grieve. United American Indians of New England held its first National Day of Mourning in 1970. Since then, tribes have assembled at noon every Thanksgiving Day on a windswept hill overlooking Plymouth Rock. On Thursday, they’ll recall what organizers describe as “the genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture.” That’s an in-your-feast message, but co-leader Mahtowin Munro says the group is determined to get Americans to look beyond the Thanksgiving myth of European settlers and native people coexisting peacefully. Next year, Plymouth marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in 1620.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: Leaders with Flint Community Schools are considering closing four of the district’s 12 school buildings amid a $5.7 million budget deficit partly driven by rising special education costs not covered by the state. Superintendent Derrick Lopez presented the proposal at a special school board meeting last week. It also calls for the restructuring four other district buildings. The plan would decrease transportation, security, maintenance, administrative and other expenses. Lopez says the district’s special education student number has greatly risen from just under 15% in the 2014-15 school year, as Flint’s water crisis began, to now 24%. Flint’s water was lead-contaminated when officials used corrosive river water from April 2014 to October 2015. In children, lead exposure can result in serious effects on IQ, ability to focus and academic achievement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials have warned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that a proposal to streamline water quality laws would cripple their authority to protect drinking water, streams and wildlife from dozens of new projects each year. The EPA’s proposal targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which allows states to set their own conditions, conduct reviews, and approve or deny projects that could potentially pollute waterways. The change would give federal authorities power to dismiss conditions set by states or tribes and allow the EPA to overrule a state’s project denial. It would also prevent states from studying indirect sources of water pollution. But the Star Tribune reports that a Minnesota Chamber of Commerce official says some businesses welcome the changes. The EPA says states use their authority to impose conditions not related to water quality.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Magnolia State residents don’t have to leave the state to buy lottery tickets anymore. Tickets went on sale Monday at roughly 1,200 convenience stores and other sites. The Mississippi Lottery Corporation says people bought a total of $2.5 million in lottery tickets on the first day of sales, which translates into $570,000 for the state. Democratic state Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson has been pushing for years to bring a lottery to Mississippi. She bought a ceremonial first ticket at a RaceWay store and gas station in south Jackson. “It feels great. Finally, it becomes a reality. And it just goes to show you what happens if you don’t give up,” Clarke said. For decades Mississippi was one of only six states without a lottery amid strong opposition from politically powerful churches. People often drove to neighboring states such as Louisiana to buy tickets there.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Comedian Heidi Gardner is flipping the switch on an annual holiday lighting ceremony at the upscale Country Club Plaza shopping and dining district. The “Saturday Night Light” cast member says getting the starring role at the Thanksgiving night event once seemed “crazy” and “out of reach.” The Kansas City native was working on the Plaza in 1998 when actor Paul Rudd did the honors, lighting up several blocks of buildings. And she told The Kansas City Star that she has long had a picture of the Plaza lights on her refrigerator. The ceremony dates back to the 1930s. The only time the Plaza lights were not in operation occurred in 1973, when President Richard Nixon called upon all Americans to curtail the use of Christmas lights to reduce dependence on foreign oil imports.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Board of Regents has approved a $150,000 pay raise to retain Waded Cruzado as the president of Montana State University after she received an offer for a higher-paying job. Supporters say Cruzado’s vision and fundraising ability make her worth the $476,000 annual salary, while opponents note her raise is nearly three times the median household income in the state. Commissioner of Higher Education Clay Christian supported the raise, saying it would allow Cruzado to continue the momentum she has created on the Bozeman campus. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports two classified MSU employees noted some workers are paid less than $11 an hour, vacancies are hard to fill, and people have left because they can’t afford to live in Bozeman. Regents on Friday also approved a 2% or 50-cent-per-hour raise for university system employees, whichever is greater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is temporarily lifting weight restrictions on trucks carrying propane to address a shortage of heating fuels. State officials have suspended the 90,000-pound gross weight limit for motor carriers hauling critically needed heating fuels through Dec. 15. Lt. Gov. Mike Foley issued the order last week on behalf of Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is out of the state. Officials say drivers exceeding the normal weight limits must carry a copy of the executive order to document that they are providing direct support to the state. The order doesn’t apply to the interstate system. State officials say the shortage isn’t serious, but they’re monitoring it. They say more extreme shortages in surrounding states have increased the need to transport through Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A multibillion-dollar megaresort taking shape on the north end of the Strip is on track to become the most expensive hotel-casino project ever built. Malaysia-based Genting Group says the company’s Resorts World Las Vegas is expected to open in the summer of 2021. The cost of the project, initially targeted for a 2016 opening on the former site of the Stardust, was last estimated at $4 billion. Now it sits at $4.3 billion. That would make Resorts World Las Vegas more expensive than the development of the $4 billion Cosmopolitan. With the inflated price tag comes new features, according to the company, including a 5,000-capacity “state-of-the-art theater” scalable to host A-list residencies and corporate events; a 75,000-square-foot “nightlife and daylife concept”; and a 50-foot-diameter video globe to display over 6,000 square feet of LED content.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: Gov. Chris Sununu’s advisory board has voted to eliminate tolls on one of the state’s heavily traveled highways. The Executive Council voted Monday to get rid of the Merrimack tolls at the Everett Turnpike. The highway links Massachusetts and the New Hampshire cities of Manchester and Concord. Drivers currently pay 50 cents on the on and off ramps at the exits. The tolls bring in more than $1 million each year, but a transportation commission has decided that it puts Merrimack residents under an unfair burden. The tollbooths that were built 30 years ago will remain, but starting Jan. 1, motorists will be allowed to drive through without paying a toll.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Officials are hoping the return of redesigned holiday decorations will keep the season bright for commuters who travel through the Holland Tunnel. A slightly larger Christmas tree than the one used last year will be placed to cover the letter “A,” and a wreath will cover the letter “O.” A menorah will be positioned adjacent to the toll plaza on the New Jersey side of the tunnel. After complaints that the decades-old decorations over the New York-bound tunnel were distracting, more than 21,000 people last year voted in a poll commissioned by tunnel operator the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Voters wanted the tree moved from over the “N” in “Holland” to cover the “A” and the wreath moved from over the “U.” The decorations go up Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCimarron: One of the most spectacular properties owned by the Boy Scouts of America is being mortgaged to help secure the youth organization’s line of credit. The Boy Scouts say there is no plan to sell the Philmont Scout Ranch in Colfax County. It is being used as collateral to help meet financial needs that include rising insurance costs related to sex-abuse litigation. The move dismayed a member of Philmont’s oversight committee, who says it violates agreements made when the land was donated in 1938. The BSA disputed his assertion. The mortgage document was signed by top Boy Scout officials in March. But members of the Philmont Ranch Committee only recently learned of the development. The ranch is a popular destination for hiking and camping trips.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Thanksgiving came early for a group of New York City commuters who enjoyed a holiday feast on a subway train. Video footage shows riders standing behind a white-clothed table covered with plates of turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread in the middle of a Brooklyn-bound L train on Sunday. Stand-up comedian Jodell “Joe Show” Lewis tells the New York Post he organized the Thanksgiving dinner to “bring a little excitement to commuters” and feed any New Yorkers who might be hungry. Lewis says he chose the L train after he saw how “dreary and upset” riders were at the inconvenience of a construction project that has cut service on the line.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Students and employees at all University of North Carolina system campuses will be able to use their school identification cards for the state’s voter ID mandate starting in 2020. The State Board of Elections announced on Tuesday the approval of cards for students and employees at 12 of the 17 UNC schools. These IDs were rejected earlier this year because they didn’t meet standards set in a law implementing the photo ID requirement. The ID mandate was added to the state constitution in 2018. The General Assembly altered ID security rules last spring so schools with rejected cards could apply again for next year. The board says more than 150 types of photo ID are approved for use with the March primary. A driver’s license is the most common.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There will be a runoff election for a new state Supreme Court chief justice. None of the three justices running to lead the high court received the majority votes necessary on Monday to clinch the position. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jon Jensen were the top vote-getters, followed by Daniel Crothers. McEvers and Jensen are still in the running. The ballots were cast by the state’s 52 district court judges and each of the five justices on the high court. They will now recast their votes, to be tallied in early December. The chief justice position was left open after 86-year-old Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle announced in September that he would not seek reappointment to the top post when his term expires at the end of the year.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city’s zoo has welcomed a new baby giraffe shortly after losing the 12-year-old male giraffe that sired him. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden says 8-year-old Cece delivered the calf Saturday, and mom and baby are doing fine. Zoo officials say it’s too soon to determine the sex of the 6-foot-tall calf. The calf was the seventh sired by Kimba, who died earlier this month from complications following a surgical procedure on his hooves. The calf is the 17th giraffe born at the zoo. Giraffe populations in the wild are being affected by habitat loss, trophy hunting and illegal poaching, Zoo officials say up to 75% of calves in the wild die in their first few months of life, mainly due to predators.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new study has found that nearly 500 older, low-income Oklahomans died prematurely because the state did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The Oklahoman reports that a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis estimates 476 state residents between the ages of 55 and 64 died prematurely from 2014 to 2017 because the state declined to expand eligibility for the federal health care program. The left-leaning think tank says they are among 15,600 such deaths that could have been avoided nationally if all states had expanded Medicaid. The Washington, D.C.-based group says its estimates are based on mortality data and records and data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Social Security Administration. Republican leaders in the state dismissed the study as irresponsible and reckless.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians are being called to take pictures of the coast this week, for science. Coastwatch volunteer coordinator Jesse Jones says photos of extra high tides happening through Thursday can help scientists learn how different communities will be affected by climate change. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports photographs taken by citizen scientists and assembled by the Oregon King Tides Project can show where the water might be when the oceans rise. The Oregon King Tides project wants pictures from all along the coast to help figure out how to plan for rising seas. In particular, they need photographs of beaches as well as familiar landmarks like jetties, bridges, buildings, roads, seawall, shorelines, beach infrastructure and estuaries. Jones notes that the most helpful beach pictures are taken facing north or south so that it’s clear how far in or out the tide has come. Participants can upload the images to the Oregon King Tides website or post them to social media with the hashtags #orkingtides and #kingtides.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nReading: The state overhauled its child sexual abuse laws Tuesday, more than a year after a grand jury report showed the cover-up of hundreds of cases of abuse in most of Pennsylvania’s Roman Catholic dioceses over the past seven decades. The central bill signed by Gov. Tom Wolf gives future victims of child sex abuse more time to file lawsuits and ends time limits for police to file criminal charges. The grand jury report spurred several states to change their laws and other states to begin similar investigations. Wolf said the new laws will help repair “faults in our justice system that prevent frightened, abused children from seeking justice when they grow into courageous adults.” Wolf signed the bills at Muhlenberg High School in Reading, the home district of Democratic state Rep. Mark Rozzi, a champion of the legislation who has spoken publicly about being raped as a 13-year-old by a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The city is working with Brown University to create a digital map of one of the nation’s largest and most intact Colonial-era African burial grounds. The city wants a high-resolution map of God’s Little Acre to serve as the foundation for future site management and exploration. Doctoral students from the Ivy League university are working on the project. The Preservation Society of Newport County says the burial ground contains about 200 professionally carved headstones for enslaved and freed Africans from the 17th and 18th centuries, a time when African graves were typically left unmarked in the United States. City officials hope the map will be ready next summer so it can be made available to the public through a smartphone app and online. Tours currently rely on a printed map.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLoris: A farm animal with unbridled ambition has given new meaning to the phrase “get off your high horse.” Horry County Fire Rescue workers say they were called Sunday to a barn in Loris, where a horse somehow managed to leave its stall and climb into a hayloft. They had to bring in heavy equipment, and large-animal veterinarians helped sedate the horse before it was lowered to the ground on a makeshift platform. The horse has moved on to greener pastures, seemingly in good spirits in a grazing field. Rescue workers still haven’t figured out how the horse managed to climb a narrow set of stairs into the loft.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The last living worker who helped construct Mount Rushmore National Memorial has died. Donald “Nick” Clifford of Keystone, South Dakota, was 98. His wife, Carolyn Clifford, says he died Saturday at a hospice in Rapid City. At 17, Nick Clifford was the youngest worker hired to work at Mount Rushmore, in the state’s Black Hills. He operated a winch that carried workers up and down the mountain where the faces of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved, and he drilled holes for dynamite. The Rapid City Journal reports that Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln, decided in 1938 to field a baseball team and hired Clifford, who already was a veteran pitcher and right fielder. Clifford worked on Mount Rushmore from 1938 to 1940, earning 55 cents an hour.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal officials are proposing removing the Nashville crayfish from the endangered species list. A news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says a review has found the crayfish populations are “healthy, stable and robust.” The 7-inch crustacean lives only in the Mill Creek watershed in metropolitan Nashville. The last review of the crayfish by the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended listing the species as “threatened.” Tierra Curry says that would be a better option. The senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity says Nashville is developing rapidly, and giving the species threatened status would allow it some continued protection. The proposal for delisting was published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The agency will accept public comments through Jan. 27.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An English teacher who was fired after tweeting that her high school was full of students who are in the country illegally has won an appeal to get her job back. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath ruled Monday that Carter-Riverside High School teacher Georgia Clark’s tweet was protected by the First Amendment. Clark can either receive back pay and employment benefits, or the Fort Worth Independent School District can pay her a year’s salary. District spokeswoman Barbara Griffith says Morath’s ruling was a technicality, and the district is exploring its options. Clark’s attorney didn’t respond for a comment. The district board voted in June to fire Clark. She told a district investigator that her tweet was meant only for President Donald Trump and that she didn’t realize her postings were public.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Two of the state’s small cities tested an alternative method of voting that allows people to rank candidates from first to last during recent municipal elections. The Daily Herald reports six cities had planned to test the ranked-choice voting system, but four backed out over concerns about how to explain how it works to voters. Vineyard and Payson were the municipalities that tried out a method that allows voters to rank candidates from first to last. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated. The process continues for several rounds until a candidate gets the majority of votes. Vineyard City Recorder Pamela Spencer says she only received a few calls from confused voters and considered it a success.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Four local high school journalists have won an award for their victory over censorship. Last year, the Burlington High students broke a story in their school newspaper about a school employee facing unprofessional conduct charges. The interim principal asked the students’ adviser to take it down. The article was removed, but students kept up links to it on social media, saying it was censored. Students talked to legal experts, and the newspaper cited its rights under the “New Voices” law that protects First Amendment rights of student journalists. Last week the students were awarded the Courage in Student Journalism Award, sponsored by the Student Press Law Center, the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University and the National Scholastic Press Association.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials are reminding Virginians it’s not too late to get their flu vaccine. The Department of Health encourages everyone older than 6 months to receive the vaccine. State health officials gathered last week for an event in Richmond to highlight the importance of the vaccine and get a flu shot themselves. Flu season normally begins in October. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination by the end of October is preferred, vaccination in November and beyond can be beneficial. Influenza activity usually peaks in January or later. The CDC warns the flu is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. The CDC also says vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce a child’s risk of dying from influenza.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council is proceeding with a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides pitched by Mayor Jenny Durkan to help pay for affordable housing and the delayed downtown streetcar and to give new support to ride-hailing drivers. The Seattle Times reports council members unanimously approved the 57-cent tax Monday. Durkan and the council have also promised to ensure Uber and Lyft drivers make Seattle’s $16 minimum wage starting next summer, but the city first plans to study driver pay. The new tax stops short of a more widespread tolling scheme some say is necessary to truly address congestion choking downtown streets. Durkan’s administration has explored the concept of congestion pricing, in which all drivers downtown would pay a toll. Uber and Lyft back that type of widespread charge and decried the new tax, claiming it could stymie ridership and hurt drivers. Durkan’s office projects the new tax will raise about $25 million a year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It’s officially buck hunting season in the Mountain State. The annual buck firearms season kicked off this week and is expected to bring thousands of hunters to the state’s vast woodlands. Officials say starting the season toward the end of November increases the chances of hunting during snowfall, which makes it easier to spot and track deer. The season traditionally opens on the Monday before Thanksgiving. Hunters can harvest two deer on the same day, but only one can be an antlered buck. Anyone who wants an additional buck must buy a stamp from the state and have additional licensing. Gary Foster of the Division of Natural Resources says the state’s deer seasons help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state’s economy. Buck firearms season ends Dec. 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic lawmakers want more diaper-changing stations in the state. State Reps. Jonathan Brostoff and David Crowley and state Sen. Chris Larson have introduced a bill that would require public and commercial buildings built or renovated after the bill becomes law to have diaper-changing stations in every restroom. Owners of commercial buildings with public restrooms would have to post signs identifying bathrooms with changing stations. Brostoff says he’s a new father, and he’s constantly struck by how few businesses have changing stations and how many place them only in women’s restrooms. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately respond to emails inquiring about Republican support for the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The family of a man who was shot and killed by police officers is suing the city and the Casper Police Department. Daniel Wolosin alleges in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court that police officials failed to properly train officers in de-escalation techniques and failed to enforce policies that would have prevented the death of 38-year-old David Wolosin. Authorities say Wolosin opened fire first in the May 2018 shootout after two officers were called to check on a report of a man allowing children to drive a car on a dirt lot. Officer Jacob Carlson was shot multiple times by Wolosin and nearly died. City attorney John Henley told the Casper Star-Tribune he had not yet reviewed the lawsuit. Prosecutors previously determined the officers’ actions were justified.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/28/moon-rocks-misty-chincoteague-haiku-stairs-news-around-states/39635023/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDothan: A man has been reunited with the Auburn University class ring he lost most than 50 years ago. The Dothan Eagle reports 74-year-old Victor Voss got his ring back Monday. Voss says he was wearing the ring over his gloves on a cold day in 1966 because it was too large for his finger. He took the gloves off in a parking lot, and the ring went flying. Jimmy Kilgore says his father discovered the ring years ago but was unable to find the owner at the time. Kilgore says he recently had a dream about the ring, found it in a box and tracked down Voss, whose name was engraved inside the band. Voss says the ring is still too large, so he might not wear it on his hand again.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: The state government says it will not delay implementation of a new boat registration law. The Kodiak Daily Mirror reports that beginning this year, all vessels longer than 24 feet are required to be registered with the state Department of Motor Vehicles. A United Fishermen of Alaska official says very few fishermen are aware of the regulation and stand to be prosecuted for noncompliance. Earlier this month, UFA requested a delay in the implementation so state agencies are prepared and adequate public notice and education is given before the law goes into effect. Department of Administration Commissioner Kelley Tshibaka responded that the state would not delay implementation but intended “to help Alaskans, not penalize them.”\n\nArizona\n\nTuba City: The Navajo Nation has opened a cancer treatment center on the reservation that it says will significantly cut down on travel time for patients. The Tuba City Regional Health Care Corp. in northeastern Arizona recently welcomed its first patient. It is funding the new center with hospital profits, grants and donations. Cancer treatment is considered specialty care under the federal Indian Health Service, which partially funds the hospital. Patients previously had to get a referral to be seen elsewhere, often an hour or more from home. Hospital chief executive Lynette Bonar says the treatment center is the first of its kind on any Native American reservation, though some facilities offer screenings and other services. It will serve Navajos, Hopis and San Juan Southern Paiutes in its service area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman has been appointed to a full term on the commission that regulates hunting and fishing for the first time in state history. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday named Anne Marie Doramus of Little Rock to the state Game and Fish Commission. Doramus is replacing outgoing Commissioner Ford Overton and will begin her seven-year term on the panel in July. Doramus is vice president of special projects and sales for Arkansas Bolt Company and currently serves on the board of directors for the Arkansas State Fair and the Game and Fish Foundation. A press release says she is an avid duck hunter and bass angler on her family’s farm in southeast Arkansas. Hutchinson praised Doramus as committed to the conservation of natural resources.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThousand Oaks: Biologists at a national recreation area in Southern California have found a pair of golden eagle chicks – the first seen there in decades. The National Park Service announced Wednesday that a nest containing the pair of 12-week-old chicks was found in March in a cave in the Santa Monica Mountains. It’s the first golden eagle nest confirmed in the mountains since the late 1980s. Sightings of adult birds also have been vanishingly rare. The chicks, a male and a female, were given ankle bands to help scientists monitor them. Although the golden eagle is protected under the law, experts believe the population may be declining in the United States, especially in California. Researchers say loss of habitat is a major threat.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Drivers using Google Maps to get to the city’s airport last weekend and trying to avoid a traffic jam were sent on a detour that took them down a narrow, muddy dirt road. Connie Monsees told KMGH-TV about 100 cars were lined up on the road Sunday. She says some cars got stuck behind others that could not move, and other vehicles could not make it across several deep ditches. Monsees says she used her all-wheel drive vehicle to help two strangers get to the airport. Google told ABC News that it works to provide the best directions but that issues can arise due to factors such as weather, and it encourages drivers to be attentive and use their best judgment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new report shows the state’s homeless population has dropped to its lowest level since officials started tracking the population in 2007. The Hartford Courant reports that the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness counted 3,033 homeless people in its annual Point-in-Time Count on Jan. 22, a 10% drop from last year’s total. The coalition organizes the one-night census every year to track the number of people in Connecticut who live outdoors, in emergency shelters or in transitional housing. Despite the overall drop, there were marginal increases in the number of youth and veterans who were homeless during the count. Coalition CEO Richard Cho says the results show a coordinated response system can help reduce homelessness, but he said more needs to be done.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s insurance department says Social Security numbers and other personal data of almost 100,000 people may have been comprised over nearly a decade by a breach at a large vision and dental insurer. Someone may have obtained bank account and routing numbers, Social Security numbers, and insurance and tax information from Dominion National. The company says the information may have been compromised when a server was accessed by an “unauthorized third party” in 2010. Dominion National says there’s “no evidence that any information was in fact accessed.” The insurer said it discovered the breach in April and launched an investigation. Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro said the 95,000 people who could be affected make up roughly 10% of the state’s population.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Park Service has approved an application from a group of protesters to fly a “Baby Trump” balloon on the National Mall this Fourth of July in opposition to the president, WUSA-TV reports. People affiliated with the group Code Pink filed the permit application for July 4 from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., asking for access to an “open grassy area nearest to Lincoln Memorial.” NPS Chief Spokesperson Mike Litterst confirmed the application had been approved but said the agency hadn’t given the group a permit yet. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump tweeted his plan to host an event at the Lincoln Memorial on the holiday, with “an address by your favorite President, me!” The presidential event is slated to be called “A Salute to America,” administration officials told the Washington Post.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a bill that authorizes counties to establish programs that allow intravenous drug users to exchange used needles for clean ones. The measure is modeled after a Miami-based program that also provides HIV screening, access to social services, the opioid-overdose antidote Narcan and other medical supplies. The program steers willing addicts to rehabilitation and social services, as well. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Senate in early May after clearing the House with broad support. DeSantis signed the bill Wednesday, and it goes into effect July 1. Dr. Hansel Tookes, founder of the Miami program IDEA Exchange, has campaigned for years for statewide authorization of needle exchanges. He says many in Florida are dying preventable deaths, and he’s heartened that lawmakers have taken note.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: A University of Georgia researcher says life has gotten worse for people who remain in poverty in Clarke County. Grace Bagwell Adams, a professor in UGA’s School of Public Health, says the recent economic expansion helped some people in the county to escape poverty. And more people are employed now than two years ago. But she says more people lack health insurance now than two years ago. The Athens Banner-Herald reports Adams is partnering with the local school district, government and service agencies on the Athens Wellbeing Project. The project aims to gather information about families in the community and find ways to help them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A city agency has proposed removing the Haiku Stairs. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the Honolulu Board of Water Supply has proposed spending about $1 million to remove the popular hiking staircase. The 3,922-step metal staircase that is part of the Windward Oahu hike attracts nearly 4,000 people per year but has also been a cause of injuries and rescues. Officials say work to remove the stairs along the side of the Koolau Mountains in Kaneohe could begin next year and finish in mid-2022. The water board owns most of the property containing the stairs and says it spends $250,000 a year trying to deter trespassers from the climb. Honolulu’s Democratic Mayor Kirk Caldwell says he would like the city Department of Parks and Recreation to take possession.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A northern Idaho man says check stations set up by the state Department of Fish and Game requiring motorists to stop are violations of the Idaho and U.S. constitutions. Boundary County resident Steve Tanner, in documents filed last week in U.S. District Court as part of a lawsuit, asks that Idaho Fish and Game be prohibited from operating the stations. State officials say check stations are allowed under Idaho law to catch poachers, collect harvest information and check for diseases in game animals. Tanner is seeking more than $100,000 from the state agency. In the lawsuit he says he drove past a check station in November 2017 but was pulled over by officers with guns drawn and taken into custody.\n\nIllinois\n\nDecatur: For those kids looking to step inside a 7-foot eyeball, the Children’s Museum of Illinois is the place to go. The (Decatur) Herald & Review reports the display called “Peek Inside” that allows visitors to see the eye from the inside out will be open to the public within a few days. The exhibit is the idea of Dr. John Lee, a local ophthalmologist. He designed it hoping that if people know more about the eye and eye diseases, they would be better equipped to spot those diseases in time to protect their sight. The giant eyeball is largely the work of welding students at Richland Community College, who built a metal frame, then added 4,000 small squares of Styrofoam, two layers of fiberglass and six coats of paint.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Graduate students at Purdue University, strapped by a confusing change in their paychecks, have been filling social media with stories about trying to make ends meet with checks cut by as much as half since the end of the spring semester. In question – and appearing in a series of hard-luck stories under the hashtag #PurduePay – is a changeover from distributing checks monthly to every two weeks. In an attempt to ease the shift, Purdue delivered what it called “transition pay” starting in January. But that money was docked from paychecks once summer started. “It initially came off like it was some type of bonus,” says Brandon Allen, a fourth-year doctoral student. And it might have seemed that way: Purdue President Mitch Daniels had announced a $500 “appreciation payment” to all campus staff who made $75,000 or less. That bonus, by Purdue figures, went to 83% of all non-faculty staff members but didn’t include grad students.\n\nIowa\n\nFairfield: A utility’s plan to install smart meters on hundreds of thousands of homes in the state has some practitioners of transcendental meditation losing their cool. Hundreds have asked the Iowa Utilities Board to allow entire communities and neighborhoods to opt out of Alliant Energy’s program. Alliant says the meters meet federal regulations, are safe for consumers and will make it easier for the utility to detect power outages, among other benefits. Jonathan Lipman is an expert in Maharishi Vastu architecture, based on the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and says practitioners “stay alert to any environmental hazards.” The Maharishi developed the transcendental meditation technique and founded the Maharishi University of Management, a college in Fairfield with about 1,700 students. Practitioners incorporated Maharishi Vedic City, about 10 miles north of Fairfield, in 2001.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: An organization that sponsors an all-male student mock government apologized after this year’s teenage governor proposed eliminating the constitutional amendment that gave women the right to vote. The teenager from Leavenworth made the proposal in the final moments of his term during the annual Boys State gathering at Kansas State University on June 2-7, The Kansas City Star reports. The American Legion sponsors Boys State programs in most states, and the American Legion Auxiliary sponsors a separate Girls State program. The programs are aimed at teaching teenagers about government. This year’s Kansas student governor ignored Boys State staff who advised him not to suggest the executive order to repeal the 19th Amendment, said spokesman Brad Biles. When brought to the mock state Senate and House, both chambers voted it down.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In archives across the state, Kentucky State University associate history professor Erin Wiggins Gilliam is on a search for the faces and names of slaves who worked in America’s first whiskey distilleries. She and others working on the effort know for a fact that slaves helped create what is now one of the country’s most iconic industries. They’ve seen tax records that list slaves as property alongside distillery owners’ horses and homes. Auction rolls that note slaves’ whiskey-making capabilities. And photos of black faces behind some of the bourbon world’s most celebrated pioneers. What Wiggins Gilliam and others don’t yet know is who the slaves were – and whether they might actually deserve credit for some distilling processes that are still used today. Wiggins Gilliam is now part of a small but growing group of Kentuckians who are dedicated to learning the true history of an industry that’s long taken pride in telling stories of its past.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: For years, the state offered hepatitis C treatment to only the most severe cases in its Medicaid program and prisons, unable to afford broader access to high-priced medications. That will change in July, when the state rolls out a new treatment model it says can cure tens of thousands with the infectious disease. Louisiana’s health department announced what it’s calling a “subscription model” deal with Asegua Therapeutics on Wednesday. Louisiana will pay a flat fee for unlimited access to hepatitis C medication for five years, able to treat as many people as it can. Health Secretary Rebekah Gee says Louisiana hopes to treat 31,000 of the estimated 39,000 Medicaid patients and prisoners with the disease. The health department says Louisiana will pay $58 million annually for the drug access.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Authors Stephen and Tabitha King and others have donated to a fund for asylum-seekers in the state, pushing the total available to more than half a million dollars. Mayor Ethan Strimling and city spokeswoman Jessica Grondin told the Portland Press Herald city administrators received a check from the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation on Monday. The donations go to the Community Support Fund, which is set up to help hundreds of asylum-seekers who have arrived in Portland in recent weeks. Portland also received a $22,000 donation from the Karina Foundation, a Massachusetts-based charity, putting the fund over $500,000. Portland is currently housing about 600 people each night, with about 400 being recently arrived asylum-seekers. Most are fleeing from political, economic and military problems in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Induction Day has come for new recruits at the U.S. Naval Academy. About 1,200 men and women in the incoming Class of 2023 reported early Thursday morning to the academy’s campus in Annapolis. First-day activities include receiving uniforms, medical exams and haircuts, as well as learning how to salute. Students in their first year at the academy are known as plebes. After taking an oath of office at 6 p.m., they met with their families for the last time until parents weekend, beginning Aug. 8. Then they officially begin what’s known as Plebe Summer, when they will learn about the traditions of the Naval Service and the academy. They also will learn about basic military skills and prepare for the upcoming academic year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston College has announced that its new indoor baseball and softball training facility will be named after the alumnus who helped popularize the ice bucket challenge. BC on Wednesday unveiled plans for the 31,000-square-foot Pete Frates Center during a ceremony attended by Frates and his family. The 34-year-old Frates is a former Eagles baseball captain who in 2012 was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, commonly called Lou Gehrig’s disease. He and his family helped the ice bucket challenge spread wildly on social media in 2014, raising hundreds of millions of dollars for research into the degenerative disease that destroys nerve cells and has no cure. BC athletic director Martin Jarmond says there’s no better person to name the facility after. It is expected to open next year.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Institute of Arts is back with another baseball exhibition that includes collectibles, art and items commemorating two championship teams in the Motor City. “Play Ball! Transforming the Game, 1876-2019” allows visitors to explore the history of baseball. It’s the second round of the “Play Ball!” exhibition series and is scheduled to be on view through Sept. 15. This year’s exhibit celebrates the championships of the 1887 Detroit Wolverines and the 1984 Detroit Tigers. The first round of the exhibit was on display last year. The exhibit also traces the evolution of baseball cards from vending machine and candy cards of the 1920s through the cards of the mid-century to the present. Other highlights include William Morris Hunt’s 1877 painting, “The Ball Players,” from the museum’s permanent collection.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Swiss-based global commodities giant Glencore AG says it’s taking a 72% stake in PolyMet Mining, gaining majority control over what’s slated to become the state’s first copper-nickel mine. PolyMet announced Thursday that Glencore’s stake will rise from 29% after the completion of a stock offering to shareholders that cleared its balance sheet of debt. Glencore has long been the largest investor in the planned open-pit mine near Babbitt in northeastern Minnesota. PolyMet is formally based in Toronto but is run from St. Paul, with operational headquarters at the processing plant site near Hoyt Lakes. The company received the last federal permit it needed in March, after securing its state permits last year, and is now raising close to $1 billion in construction financing. Environmental groups are challenging the project in court.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonprofit group is working to revitalize a subdivision built in the 1950s for veterans who had returned from World War II. Habitat for Humanity Mississippi Capital Area is starting a five-year project to improve 100 houses in the Broadmoor neighborhood of north Jackson. The first two rehabilitated houses were dedicated Thursday. The group’s executive director, Merrill McKewen, says the goal is to get houses back into good shape for first-time homebuyers. If a house cannot be repaired, it will be demolished through the city’s blight elimination program. Streets in Broadmoor are named after major campaigns and people associated with World War II. The neighborhood had high rates of foreclosure after the housing crash of 2008.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: The Harry S. Truman Library and Museum will close for about a year starting at the end of next month to undergo a $22 million renovation and expansion. The museum announced in a news release that its last day open to the public will be July 22. The project will include a new entrance and lobby, a larger store, and expanded exhibition galleries. Besides the renovation, another $3 million is being raised for education, public programs and the library’s endowment. The museum’s fundraising arm, the Truman Library Institute, has already raised $23 million for the project. The upgrade coincides with the upcoming 75th anniversary of the start of Truman’s presidency, which began in 1945.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A new report says while the number of out-of-state visitors to Big Sky Country fell slightly in 2018, their $3.58 billion in spending was a 10% increase over the previous year. Montana’s Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research says it’s seeing visitors spend more on experiences rather than on items to take home. The institute previously estimated about 12.4 million people visited the state in 2018, down 1% from 2017. Institute director Norma Nickerson says Glacier and Yellowstone national parks are the biggest draws. The Yellowstone region saw a 20% increase in nonresident spending, while the Glacier region saw a 12% increase. Nonresidents spent an estimated $812 million on fuel, $674 million in restaurants and bars, $454 million on hotels, $396 million on outfitters and guides, and $323 million at retailers.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials say deer ticks that can carry Lyme disease have turned up for the first time in eastern Nebraska. State health officials said this week that lab tests are being done to determine whether the deer ticks collected carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The ticks were found in Douglas, Sarpy and Saunders counties. Lyme disease can cause fever, headache, fatigue and a skin rash. Health officials say most people recover completely, although some may be left with joint pain that can be treated with medication. Nebraska health officials have yet to confirm any cases of Lyme disease originating in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 1,000 members of a powerful casino workers union and other hospitality workers picketed Wednesday evening outside the Palms casino-resort, where owners have refused to bargain with the union. The workers, chanting and carrying signs that said, “No contract. No peace,” called for Palms owner Station Casinos to negotiate with employees, who voted in April 2018 to unionize. The company challenged the election’s result, but the National Labor Relations Board determined the company has been “failing and refusing to bargain collectively and in good faith” with the Culinary Union. The Palms, west of the Las Vegas Strip, is one of six Station Casinos-owned properties in Las Vegas where workers have voted to unionize in recent years. The Culinary Union represents about 900 workers at the Palms, which is undergoing a $690 million renovation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A $13 billion, two-year state budget is on its way to Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who is likely to veto it because it includes a rollback of planned business tax cuts. Democrats control both the House and Senate, and the budget and the enabling policy bill passed both chambers Thursday along strict party lines. Lawmakers also approved a continuing resolution to maintain current spending for three months starting July 1 if the budget is vetoed. Democrats say the budget addresses the state’s most pressing problems, including mental health care and the opioid crisis. Republicans argue it relies on one-time surplus funds for ongoing expenses and will drive the state toward an income tax. In 2015, it took three months to strike a deal after Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan vetoed the budget.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Nearly a year after lawmakers approved tax credits to draw movie and television production back to the state, revenue from the industry is expected to more than double and could mean hundreds of millions of dollars for New Jersey businesses, experts say. “We’re going to see a tremendous jump in revenue,” says Steven Gorelick, executive director of the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission. “It’s impossible to say exactly (how much) because we’re in uncharted territory.” Credits were approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy last July. It was a reversal from nearly a decade before, when Gov. Chris Christie suspended them and let them expire in an effort to curb the budget. Movies such as the upcoming “Joker” and “The Many Saints of Newark,” the 1960s-set prequel to the iconic HBO mob series “The Sopranos,” have already been shot in the state.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Monthly gatherings in the city focused on creative stimulus for those living with Alzheimer’s or dementia are helping a growing trend nationwide. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports the city hosts an initiative called Alzheimer’s Cafe as part of a movement to accommodate the growing number of patients with forms of dementia. The two-hour meeting focuses on snacking together and creating crafts as a way to stimulate the mind. Founded in Santa Fe by Alzheimer’s specialist and Denmark native Jytte Lokvig in 2008, Alzheimer’s Cafe grew out of a concept introduced more than a decade earlier in the Netherlands by a psychiatrist. The National Alzheimer’s Cafe Alliance says the concept caught on quickly throughout Europe, but the Santa Fe gathering was the first official Memory Cafe in North America.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: One of the biggest celebrations of LGBT pride in city history will culminate Sunday with not one but two processions through Manhattan, after dissidents who believe the annual parade has become too commercialized and heavily policed decided to split off with their own march. Both parades cap a month of events marking the 50th anniversary Friday of the Stonewall uprising, when patrons of a Greenwich Village gay bar fought back against a police raid and sparked a new era of gay activism and visibility. Some 150,000 people are expected to participate in the NYC Pride March, with hundreds of thousands more lining the streets to watch as New York hosts WorldPride for the first time. Organizers of the insurgent Queer Liberation March say they expect 10,000 or more at their event earlier in the day, which they say will have a protest vibe.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBeulaville: Singer Barry Manilow gifted $100,000 worth of new band gear to a high school in an area still recovering from Hurricane Florence. News outlets report the band at East Duplin High School couldn’t afford new instruments and uniforms, so they entered a national contest by the Manilow Music Project for help. In a video of the announcement at a Las Vegas show Wednesday, Manilow takes a pause from dancing and singing to crown East Duplin as the winner. Manilow says he had been “bombarded” with video entries from high schools across the country saying why they think they deserved the funds before giving East Duplin the $100,000 for new instruments and uniforms. The school’s band director says words can’t describe his gratitude.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Backers of a Red River diversion channel around flood-prone Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, say their lawyers are figuring out the next step after a watershed district board denied a permit for the project. KFGO radio reports that board members of the Buffalo-Red River Watershed District voted this week against a permit for the $2.75 billion project, which has faced several hurdles since it was authorized by Congress five years ago. Fargo-Moorhead Diversion Authority Chairwoman Mary Scherling says the group doesn’t believe the watershed district followed its own rules on the vote, and authority attorneys are reviewing that process. Scherling says she hopes the two sides can work out a compromise and says that “the diversion will be built.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A state agency has awarded a total of more than $28 million in tax credits for the rehabilitation of 49 historic buildings in the state. The Ohio Development Services Agency announced the Ohio Historic Preservation Tax Credits on Wednesday. The agency’s release says the projects are expected to leverage approximately $280 million in private investments in 13 communities. The awards will assist private developers in rehabilitating historic buildings in downtowns and neighborhoods. The tax credits are not issued to developers until project construction is complete and all program requirements are verified. Agency director Lydia Mihalik says the credits help preserve historic sites and create new opportunities for small businesses and housing.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court says a lower court should first consider a case brought by a group of liquor wholesalers who are challenging a change in the state’s alcohol laws. The court rejected the request to immediately take the lawsuit and issue an injunction blocking the law signed last month by Gov. Kevin Stitt. The court sent the case to Oklahoma County District Court. The law requires top brands of wine and spirits to be sold to all Oklahoma alcohol wholesalers. Currently, manufacturers can designate a single wholesaler to distribute their products. The group contends the law unconstitutionally changes the amendment passed by voters in 2016 that also allows the sale of strong beer in grocery and convenience stores and the sale of cold, strong beer in liquor stores.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A dive team recovered dozens of electric scooters and bicycles while cleaning the Willamette River sea wall downtown. KATU-TV reports the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office River Patrol Dive Team removed 57 electric scooters and bicycles this week. The five companies participating in Portland’s electric scooter trial program have 1,975 scooters on the streets, which is slightly below the total allowed by the city. This spring, Portland began a second, yearlong phase of a pilot program intended to help the city introduce the devices while avoiding pitfalls experienced by other U.S. metropolises. A four-month experiment with the e-scooters last year was successful but also generated 6,000 complaints and raised questions about pedestrian safety and the impact of the devices on public spaces like parks. The city said the scooters also led to 176 medical center visits.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A college music department has helped resurrect the music of a largely forgotten local funk band and is hoping to discover more gems in its archives. Going through thousands of donated tapes, a band called the Nat Turner Rebellion – named after the 1831 slave revolt – jumped out to listeners at Drexel University. They worked with others to assemble “Laugh to Keep From Crying,” the band’s debut album. It was recently released some 50 years after it was recorded at Sigma Sound, the studio that helped create “The Sound of Philadelphia” – the funky soul sound characterized by lush instrumental arrangements often featuring strings and horns. Students have listened to and digitized only about 10% of the music in the Sigma Sound collection and are eager to discover more gems.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers have approved legislation that requires signs at all pharmacies to warn customers about the dangers of opioids. The signs would be similar to warning signs at stores about tobacco products. The bill, passed Wednesday, heads to Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo’s desk. Raimondo’s spokesman says the governor hasn’t reviewed the specifics yet but supports the intent. If signed, the legislation would take effect Sept. 1. It would require the health department to compile a list of the 10 most commonly prescribed drugs containing opioids or certain other controlled substances and distribute it to the Board of Pharmacy. That board would then distribute the list to every Rhode Island pharmacy, to be posted near where prescriptions are filled. Pharmacists would also have to inform patients about their option to partially fill their prescription.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An order that would have prevented the distribution of law enforcement body-camera footage has been struck down by state Supreme Court Chief Justice Donald Beatty. He vacated the original order issued May 13 by circuit judges in Greenville and Pickens counties that would have prevented lawyers in the 13th Circuit from sharing body camera footage they received for a case. The judges said in the original order that sharing bodycam footage raised privacy concerns for victims and witnesses who appeared in the videos. The order stated that attorneys disobeying the order could be found in contempt of court. Some attorneys and public records advocates said the order potentially violated constitutional rights. Some said the order goes against the General Assembly’s intent to promote transparency and accountability when statutes were created to mandate bodycam use.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s public universities and schools are asking the South Dakota Board of Regents for nearly $91.2million to complete projects they say are high-priority. The institutions’ requests for 2021 were made during informal budget hearings Wednesday. Seven public schools and universities want to build projects research and tech centers. Some requested funds for technology to enhance learning for blind and visually impaired people. An outreach program to prepare Native American high school students for college success is also proposed. The board is expected to consider the projects then approve the budget requests at its August meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican leaders in the state House say their caucus will meet July 24 to vote for a new leader as members prepare for Speaker Glen Casada to resign later this summer following a series of scandals. Majority Leader William Lamberth announced Wednesday that House Republicans will meet in Nashville in late July to nominate a speaker ahead of a planned special legislative session. Gov. Bill Lee has said he’ll set a date soon on when he’ll call lawmakers back to the Capitol in order to allow the full GOP-controlled House to formally vote on a new speaker. Casada has been dogged by calls to resign since it was revealed he exchanged text messages containing sexually explicit language about women with his former chief of staff several years ago, among other controversies.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Inside a locked vault at Johnson Space Center is treasure few have seen and fewer have touched. The restricted lab is home to hundreds of pounds of moon rocks collected by Apollo astronauts close to a half-century ago. And for the first time in decades, NASA is about to open some of the pristine samples and let geologists take a crack at them with 21st-century technology – all as this summer’s 50th anniversary of humanity’s first footsteps on the moon approaches. “It’s sort of a coincidence that we’re opening them in the year of the anniversary,” says NASA’s Apollo sample curator, Ryan Zeigler. Some of the soil and bits of rock were vacuum-packed on the moon – and never exposed to Earth’s atmosphere – or frozen or stored in gaseous helium following splashdown and then left untouched.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Officials say Utah County has underfunded the retirement system for its sheriff’s office for more than 20 years. The Daily Herald reports the county government had not made contributions to the Utah Retirement Systems for the scheduled hours that sheriff’s office personnel worked above the 80 hours for two-week pay periods. The sheriff’s office and the Utah County attorney’s office say they don’t know how much the retirement system is missing. The sheriff’s office says the error did not affect deputies’ pay before retirement. An attorney for the Utah County Commission did not immediately respond to the newspaper’s request for comment. The sheriff’s office says the county contributions have been correct going forward to reflect the actual hours scheduled.\n\nVermont\n\nFranklin: The state is trying a new treatment to address algae in a northern Vermont lake. Mynbc5.com reports that Republican Gov. Phil Scott is launching a $1 million aeration project at Lake Carmi this week. The lake near the Canadian border has been plagued by outbreaks of blue-green algae in recent years. It’s surrounded by dairy farms and is home to about 300 summer camp residences and a state park. Runoff from farms and storm water and septic system failures over the years are blamed for contributing to the increase in phosphorus in the lake, leading to the algae blooms. Residents are angry and asked the Legislature to step in. A Michigan-based firm has just completed the installation of the $1 million system to oxygenate the lake and recirculate the water.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: Flames have destroyed a famous horse barn on Chincoteague Island. Firefighters were called Tuesday night to the Misty barn at the Beebe Ranch. Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company spokeswoman Denise Bowden says flames were shooting 30 feet in the air when firefighters arrived. Four horses, a goat and a cat made it out of the barn safely. No injuries were reported. Officials say the barn is a total loss. The barn was once home to Misty, a pony immortalized in Marguerite Henry’s 1947 novel, “Misty of Chincoteague.” Bowden says some of the horses who survived the fire are Misty’s descendants. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state intends to move ahead with a new voter-registration system ahead of the Aug. 6 primary despite concerns from election officials in a handful of counties about problems they’ve encountered. The Seattle Times reports that concerns stem from the transition from the previous system to the new $9.5 million project, called VoteWA. In addition to shutting down the state’s online voter-registration system for roughly a month – about two weeks longer than planned – some counties said they encountered issues when they made the switch. Those issues included apartment numbers for voter addresses not appearing, address formatting and problems with translating materials in various languages. The Secretary of State’s Office has said those problems have been fixed, and the system is ready to go.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Patients and caregivers waiting for the state’s medical cannabis program to officially start in July shouldn’t expect their program cards or physicians certificates anytime soon. The Dominion Post reports the state has had little time to prepare because the enabling legislation only passed in March and May. One bill addressed a banking issue, as cannabis money is still federally illegal. The other will allow growers, processers and dispensaries to profit as singular companies. Department of Health and Human Resources spokeswoman Allison Adler says it will take two to three years before patients can procure medical cannabis. Meanwhile, terminally ill cancer patients can get medical cannabis through reciprocity agreements with other states. Other patients will have to wait.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: It’s time to bring the heat – literally. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have determined heat can kill the cocoons of jumping worms, the invasive earthworms that have spread dramatically throughout the state in recent years. While the full ecological impact of these wriggly invaders is not fully known, research suggests they can significantly alter the soil structure in an infested area – and potentially all that grows there. The new UW study offers a potential new way to slow their spread. “These are a nonnative, invasive species that’s spreading, and we don’t know what the ecological and economic impacts are,” said Bradley Herrick, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. “It’s important that we do our best to learn what the consequences are.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Workers have discovered oil paintings hidden on six vault doors in the Capitol. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the discovery of the artworks uncovered during renovations in late May was announced Tuesday. Officials say EverGreene Architectural Arts workers removed several layers of brown paint over the paintings on the historic vault doors. The process took between one and two days for each door in the lower level of the building.

To be sure, it's a good season for the Chesapeake icon. But it also represents a lucrative payoff after eight years of grudging sacrifice.\n\nSince 2008, Maryland and Virginia have put themselves on a strict diet, lowering the limit on the number of female crabs that could be harvested and ending the winter dredge fishery, among other actions.\n\nFor the first time since that watershed year, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, which manages the commonwealth's crab fishery, is considering loosening some restrictions, such as reopening winter dredging. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources isn't there yet, but it may be open to making some mid-year changes that would allow more crabs to be harvested, officials say.\n\nThe regulations, painful as they have been, are a big reason that Wivell and other watermen are so busy now, scientists say.\n\nThe bay-wide crab population, according to last winter's survey, is estimated at 553 million, almost double the total abundance from 2008. While the 194 million females is slightly below the 215 million target, it does come in above the minimum threshold of 70 million.\n\n“To me, this is a real success story,\" said Rom Lipcius, a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. \"What was implemented in 2008 is truly effective fishery management.”\n\nStaving off disaster\n\nLipcius contrasts the plight of the blue crab with the rockfish, also known as the striped bass. Its stocks were so depleted that Maryland imposed an all-out ban on catching the fish in 1985 and didn't lift it until the population had recovered — nearly six years later.\n\n“I’m familiar with a lot of fishery failures,\" Lipcius said.\n\nFor years, crabs seemed relatively immune to the stressors in the bay that had decimated rockfish and oysters. But by 2008, their abundance had fallen to less than one-third of 1993 levels.\n\nCONTEXT: This year's winter dredge survey revealed further gains in Chesapeake crabs.\n\nIn a historic action, three jurisdictions — Maryland, Virginia and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission — acted to save one of the bay's most-prized species.\n\n“It was really needed in terms of crab management in Chesapeake Bay,\" said Chris Moore, senior Virginia scientist for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.\n\nThe crab population hasn't grown steadily — harsh winters and an eating spree on juveniles by red drum and other predators fueled severe dips in 2013 and 2014 — but the general trend has been an upswing.\n\nScientists credit this year's mild winter, in part, with the current resurgence. If it had been as cold as it was last year, the population increase would have been cut in half, said Brenda Davis, Maryland's blue crab program manager.\n\nCrucially, after years of harvesting females above the sustainable threshold of 34 percent of the entire stock, watermen have been consistently staying at or below the bay-wide goal of 25 percent, she said.\n\nOPINION: Why the winter crab survey is so crucial.\n\nThe new regulations left the seafood industry with fewer crabs — and fewer dollars — to go around. Wivell, for one, saw his daily bushel limit slashed from 51 to 29. Assuming a modest dock price of $25 per bushel, that was $550 a day no longer going into his pocket.\n\nWorse, in an effort to reduce the overall catch of females by up to 40 percent, officials shut down the winter dredge. That protected females from being scooped up from their muddy burrows, but it marked an end to the year-round fishery. As a result, several processing plants in the region shut their doors.\n\n\"That, in essence, killed our industry,\" Wivell said.\n\nTangier Island used to have one of the most bustling dredging fleets along with the York River, said Daniel Dise, a waterman who lives on the island. Many have switched to oysters, putting more pressure on that fragile fishery.\n\nPopulation strong\n\nSome relief may be on the way.\n\nVirginia's crab managers are considering moving up the opening date of the crab pot season from March 17 to March 1, Lipcius said. Global warming trends appear to be heating up the bay earlier, putting crabs on the move. A change in the calendar would almost certainly be offset by a reduction in bushel limits, he added.\n\nYear after year, the Marine Resources Commission had declined to reopen the winter dredge, but 2017 may put an end to that streak, Lipcius said. Maybe.\n\n“We’re at a time at which the population is strong, when management has provided a buffer to manage disturbances. We need to be cautiously optimistic,\" he said. But \"you don’t want to make drastic changes at this point.”\n\nAnother move in the works: possibly extending the peeler season from Sept. 25 to Oct. 31, which would be a particular boon to Tangier-area crabbers.\n\nSome tweaks are possible to this season in Maryland, Davis said. When abundance is up, the harvest can be raised without threatening proportion-based targets. The state Blue Crab Industry Advisory Committee is expected to discuss possible changes soon. The changes, if any are made, would go into effect by July 1.\n\nWhatever happens, managers should proceed with caution, said Moore of the Bay Foundation.\n\n“We’re still not at the target for female abundance yet. A few tweaks are what we’ve done as they population has moved up and down. We don’t have a survey that gives us information that allows us to make big wholesale changes in the fishery,\" he said.\n\nTIDES: The spectacular life cycle of a crab\n\nContact reporter Jeremy Cox at 410-845-4630 or on Twitter @Jeremy_Cox.\n\n\n\nWhoa, what?

Monty Hawkins, moves east from the Ocean City Fishing Center.\n\nIts cargo is a modest group of volunteers, a couple bags of Royal Farms fried chicken and six and a half tons of cement blocks.\n\nHawkins, of the nonprofit Ocean City Reef Foundation, and his crew are dedicated to rebuilding the reefs off the coast of Ocean City, dropping off tons of cement blocks that plant the seeds for healthy fish populations. Formerly abundant with vibrant fisheries, oyster reefs and, further off the shore, corals, the coastal reefs were decimated by large scale trawling in the mid-20th century.\n\n\"This kind of rock that builds these reefs, you can pick it up and crush it in your hand,\" Hawkins said. \"It's so fragile, and what they would do is drag these massive pieces of machinery across the bottom, which would destroy these reefs.\"\n\nSince the passage of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery and Conservation Act in 1976, and ensuing revisions through the 1990s which further regulated trawl fishing in federal waters, overfishing in the mid-Atlantic has been significantly reduced. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2015 report on fishing stocks, only two mid-Atlantic stocks are subjects of overfishing: summer flounder and yellowtail flounder.\n\nDespite strides in regulating fishing, Hawkins said the devastation to the habitats is already done, making the work of the Ocean City fisherman and other environmental groups even more important to ocean protection as new threats arise.\n\nResearchers say climate change continues to endanger the ocean's health, and as President Donald Trump has taken office, his executive orders have threatened previous administration's protection orders that could lead to oil drilling and other actions previously considered dangerous to the environment.\n\n\"Back in the 1960s, you'd hear about people catching white marlin seven or eight miles off the coast,\" Hawkins said. \"Now, it's 30 or 40 miles, and that's because these fisheries have just been ruined.\"\n\nHawkins' work, bringing out either large hauls of cement in one go or dropping a few blocks during routine fishing, aims to bring back these fisheries by promoting the resurgence of crucial marine life habitats — oyster reefs being a major component.\n\nThe importance of oysters\n\nOysters play a crucial part in the fragile oceanic ecosystem, one which Hawkins said is invaluable in keeping the ocean water clean.\n\n\"If you look at the ocean now, the water is green,\" Hawkins said. \"Sometimes it gets so bad that it almost looks like paste. That's phytoplankton.\"\n\nPhytoplankton are microscopic, single-celled plants that serve as the basis for the oceanic food chain. While crucial to the overall survival of marine life and the primary diet for oysters, left to grow unchecked, phytoplankton pose a threat of algal blooms.\n\n\"When you have a lot of algae, what that can lead to is low dissolved oxygen levels, which are harmful to marine life,\" said Bo Lusk, a coastal scientist with the Nature Conservancy in Virginia.\n\nThe death and subsequent decay of the phytoplankton effectively drains the habitat of oxygen, leading to large scale marine deaths known as fish kills. An algal bloom in 2016 is suspected to have been a contributing factor in a large scale horseshoe and blue crab kill in July. In this incident, an estimated 300 crabs washed ashore in the Assawoman Bay.\n\nRELATED: Canyon sanctuary proposal off Ocean City dropped\n\nPAST COLUMN: Macro algae now a major problem in our coastal bays\n\nLusk said the rapid decline in oyster populations since the 1950s is a product of disease and overfishing.\n\n\"What happened was there were a number of different oyster diseases that popped up that were killing off oysters, and we just kept fishing as if there weren't,\" Lusk said. \"So, a lot of the oysters that held the disease-resistant traits they could've passed on were just fished out.\"\n\nOysters function essentially as natural filtration systems, sucking up water and pulling out potentially harmful nutrients. Their faltering populations have been notably seen in the Chesapeake Bay where, according to NOAA, oyster populations number less than 1 percent of what they were prior to bottom trawling's heyday.\n\nHowever, the Chesapeake Bay's oyster decimation is not unique to the region, a point which Hawkins stresses adamantly.\n\n\"Everyone thinks of oysters as a Chesapeake Bay problem,\" Hawkins said. \"But this is something that has happened across the coast, and is an ocean problem, too.\"\n\nWhile commercial oyster dredging was banned by the state of Maryland in 2008, much of the damage had already been done, and the impacts were already well underway.\n\nSandi Smith of the Maryland Coastal Bays Program said the effect of oyster loss has become apparent in the northern bays, such as Assawoman.\n\n\"We, of course, don't have the pollution factors that the Chesapeake has,\" Smith said. \"But there are still a very clear loss of oyster populations in the northern bays.\"\n\nA murky future\n\nWhile the rebuilding efforts, from volunteer services like the Ocean City Reef Foundation to state-funded projects, are becoming more commonplace, the delicate future of the coastal reefs is ambiguous. In tandem with efforts to rebuild, new threats arise in the forms of climate change and possible drilling endeavors.\n\n\"What oysters need right now is substrate,\" Lusk said. \"Whether that be in the form of shells or oyster castles, these habitats for the oysters to grow off of need to be rebuilt in order for the populations to rebound back to what they once were.\"\n\nHowever, the looming threat of climate change offers the possibility of throwing a wrench into the population rebuild plans. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, as carbon dioxide becomes more and more prevalent in the atmosphere, dissolved carbon dioxide in oceanic waters has the potential to devastate marine life, by way of making water more acidic.\n\nREAD MORE: Oyster reefs protect Assateague Bay from storms\n\nREAD MORE: Chesapeake Bay takes leap in health, report shows\n\nThe effect of higher acidity in marine environments has been demonstrated in the Chesapeake Bay, where low pH levels contributed to by sewage and other forms of pollution led to the erosion of oyster shells and substrate, according to a study by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. For cold water corals, a higher surface water temperature can lead to \"bleaching,\" and inevitable death, further causing habitat losses for fish populations, according to the EPA.\n\nAn additional threat to deep sea corals rears its head in the form of the potential for oil drilling in the coastal deep sea canyons, such as the Baltimore Canyon off the coast of Maryland and the Norfolk Canyon off the Virginia coast. These canyons, two of 13 in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Region, have been considered for oil excavation. On Dec. 20, former President Obama signed an executive order that would bar oil excavation in any of these canyons across the Atlantic and Arctic.\n\nHowever, President Trump has already reversed other oil policies on which Obama had formerly signed off. Specifically, the Keystone XL, formerly disapproved of by the past administration, now has now been expedited by the Trump administration. Additionally, another Trump executive order calls for expedited review of environmental impact on \"high priority infrastructure projects,\" which can be presented by any senator or secretary, if the White House Council on Environmental Quality approves.\n\nREAD MORE: What will become of Chesapeake restoration under Trump?\n\nREAD MORE: Climate change funds: what will Trump admin do?\n\nLusk said that, while oyster populations may not be harmed by oil drilling, deep sea corals would be threatened.\n\n\"I would hope that if there were any oil drilling done out there, that they would follow a plan to be as safe as possible,\" Lusk said. \"Oysters would probably be fine, but those cold water corals could really be hurt, especially if there's a spill. I would be really concerned for the loss of habitat.\"\n\nExploratory drilling in the Mid-Atlantic Bight Region was first conducted in the mid-1980s, but was later abandoned due to economic concerns. There are currently no active leases in the canyon.\n\nHope for the future\n\nThese concerns, though a fear for Hawkins, are not paramount. Instead, he aims to rebuild what he can — bringing back ocean habitats, one block at a time.\n\n\"He should be sainted for what he does,\" Ocean City Reef Foundation volunteer Beau Lyons said. \"There's just not enough people out there who really want to make a difference.\"\n\nHawkins, with passionate fervor, holds up photos of pyramids he has built off the coast of Ocean City — once bare cement now teeming with life. He cites the specifics, from the Latin names of vibrant corals to a 1970s-borne project to curb mosquito populations by using discarded tires to build reefs.\n\nDespite the complexity of his endeavor and the innumerable ecological, economical and historical factors that it carries along as baggage, Hawkins's ultimate goal is simple.\n\n\"I just want to make the ocean blue again,\" Hawkins said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/05/rockfish-chesapeake-bay-health-score-2020/4140767001/", "title": "Rock-bottom rockfish numbers drag down Chesapeake Bay health ...", "text": "Despite progress on pollution and habitats, the Chesapeake Bay has received another low health grade from the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, this time due to issues with fisheries.\n\nResults of the bi-annual State of the Bay report released Tuesday say the bay's health scored a D+ in 2020.\n\nThough most water quality measurements are showing improvement, the bay's overall score was sunk by abysmal ratings on critical fisheries, including rockfish, oysters and shad.\n\nRockfish scored a 49 out of 100 on CBF's scale, which on its own qualifies as a C+ grade. But that score represents a decrease of 17 points since 2018, the largest decline in any single indicator CBF has recorded in over a decade, said Chris Moore, senior regional ecosystem scientist with CBF.\n\n\"Rockfish, often called striped bass here in the Chesapeake Bay region, are arguably the most important recreational and commercial fin fish we have in the Chesapeake Bay,\" Moore said in an interview.\n\nFisheries can be hurt by overfishing, habitat loss and pollution. In 2019, an assessment by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission showed rockfish were over-fished, and noted that the over-fishing was ongoing.\n\n\"One of the things that really concerned us about that (ASMFC) report is that the adult female striped bass, which are obviously most important to producing new populations of striped bass in any given year, had dropped approximately 40% between 2013 and 2017,\" Moore said.\n\nMore:'Historic' change to menhaden fishery management will consider ecological importance\n\nIn the next year, the commission plans to write a more comprehensive rockfish conservation plan, which will be key to restoring the population over the long term, Moore said. In the interim, states have responded to an ASMFC demand that rockfish catches decrease by almost 20%, including in Maryland and Virginia.\n\nIn August, the ASMFC enacted \"historic\" changes to the management strategy of Atlantic menhaden, a food source for many species, including rockfish. Revitalizing Atlantic menhaden populations will help restore not only rockfish, but also larger mammals and birds that like to eat them, Moore said.\n\nThough efforts are underway to halt the decline, bold action is needed to ensure the species recovers because there is risk that states may simply settle for the status quo, CBF wrote in statement.\n\nHealth scores for oysters and blue crabs improved slightly since 2019, with blue crabs scoring a respectable B+ and oysters lagging behind with an F, according to the report.\n\nScoring the lowest of all, shad continued to decline with just 7 health points out of 100, a decrease of three points since 2018. The troubled fishery has been closed to fishing since the 1980s, and habitat restoration projects and efforts to facilitate fish passage to spawning sites have failed to help the population rebound.\n\nFlagging fisheries will be helped by improvements to water quality and habitats.\n\nIn 2020, as nitrogen and phosphorus pollution to the bay improved, water clarity and dissolved oxygen numbers followed. Monitoring data indicated the 2020 dead zone — the annually appearing area of ultra-low dissolved oxygen that kills aquatic life — was one of the smallest on record.\n\nMore:2020 Chesapeake Bay dead zone second smallest on record\n\nProgress on these issues has largely relied on pollution reductions at wastewater treatment plants and was aided in 2020 by favorable weather, the report states. To meet the goals of the Chesapeake Bay Clean Water Blueprint — a plan created in 2010 that aims to make all bay waters suitable for aquatic life by 2025 — more needs to be done, CBF says.\n\nTo meet the Blueprint's goals, efforts to reduce urban and agricultural pollution and suburban runoff need to accelerate, especially in Pennsylvania, which lags behind other states on this issue, the report states.\n\nThere is hope among Chesapeake Bay advocates that the incoming Biden administration will offer some solutions to the bay's restoration struggles through funding prioritization.\n\n\"The Biden administration can, as past presidents have done, utilize the bully pulpuit to put saving the Chesapeake Bay back on the national priority list, a list it was taken off of by President Trump,\" said CBF President Will Baker in an interview.\n\n\"Specifically, we'd like to see the Biden administration be a champion for allocating more federal Farm Bill conservation money to the bay in total, and to Pennsylvania specifically,\" Baker said. \"But beyond that, it's critical that this administration undo the across-the-board environmental rollbacks — specifically to Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act provisions — that have literally pulled the rug out from underneath the states.\"\n\nMore action by individual states is also needed, the report concludes. Though Pennsylvania is most behind, other states like Maryland and Virginia must keep bay health a state priority, it said.\n\nMaryland needs to take more effective measures to support striped bass and reduce its pollution from agriculture and stormwater through the addition of natural forest buffers, said Alison Prost, CBF's vice president for environmental protection and restoration.\n\n“After decades of failed promises and missed goals, this year’s State of the Bay shows that the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint is working,\" Baker said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, the stagnating score shows that we are witnessing apathy take hold and political will wane. We can still save the bay and deliver the promise of clean water to the next generation, but only if our elected officials redouble their clean water commitments and invest in finishing the job.”\n\nEnvironmental watchdog reporter Julia Rentsch can be reached at jrentsch@delmarvanow.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/outdoors/2015/10/15/nanticoke-aquaculture-comeback/73914844/", "title": "Oyster aquaculture rebounding in the Nanticoke", "text": "Rachael Pacella\n\nrpacella@dmg.gannett.com\n\nBefore oyster disease hit the Nanticoke, a shucking house by the harbor was full of life and the shells that came from the factory went right back into the river.\n\nJust like today's aquaculture, the shells went onto leases which watermen cared for and harvested from.\n\nThat was more than 60 years ago, and as the once packed harbor faded that shell stayed on the bottom, waiting and growing.\n\nWhen Eric Wisner came to work at Nanticoke Harbor about seven years ago, he talked with the old-timers to find out where the old leases were.\n\n\"It was like searching for gold almost,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was younger he spent his summers crabbing and working the water with his grandfather and uncle on the Magothy River in Anne Arundel County.\n\n\"Working on the water has always kind of been in the back of my mind,\" he said. \"An enjoyable way to make a living.\"\n\nThere's no traffic on the water, and fewer phone calls. Wisner now leases about 1,000 acres of bottom on the Nanticoke River from the state. He made the boat he works off nearly from scratch, turning an old houseboat into a working oystering vessel.\n\nTo find the old piles of oysters on his leases he taps the bottom with a bamboo shoot.\n\n\"Tap, tap, tap. If you've got shell, that's half the battle right there,\" he said.\n\nAnd if you don't have shell already on your lease, you can bring some in and start to build. Working with the state and nonprofits, Wisner is able to get spat - baby oysters - attached to shell, which he puts in the water to grow for harvest.\n\nIn addition to providing a source of fresh seafood for restaurants, the oysters filter and clean the water. The oysters Wisner uses are also reproducing, so they are helping to grow the Chesapeake Bay's oyster population as well.\n\nA curse or a cure?\n\nAssistance from state and nonprofit programs helped him grow his business, he said. He harvests oysters from the leases in the summertime, when prices are high, and uses the wild harvest season, which started a few weeks ago, as a time to take care of things on land, like painting boats.\n\nIn 2010, the state of Maryland passed a regulatory reform package which allowed the resurgence of aquaculture in the Nanticoke, and if the Army Corps of Engineers grants the latest round of permit requests — 63 additional acres for Wisner and 579 acres for Phillip Harrington — a patchwork quilt of leases along the Nanticoke would fill in.\n\nWisner said he thinks the resurgence of aquaculture in the river has created economic activity, from people who haul shell down to the river to the small store up the road selling gas and drinks.\n\n\"It's creating a product to harvest, and putting more people to work on the retail end,\" he said.\n\nWhile oyster aquaculture in the Nanticoke is making a return, Keith Bradley of the Wicomico County Commercial Oyster Committee said it isn't a cure all.\n\n\"I don't see it replacing the public fishery,\" he said.\n\nThe public fishery employs more people, he said, and leasing public space for aquaculture could impact the wild harvest.\n\nIf you would like to comment on the 649 additional acres of aquaculture leases currently proposed for the Nanticoke, the comment period is open until Nov.1.

Daily Times\n\nTroubles with the U.S. Department of Labor's visa program are causing ripple effects along the shores of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nMany seafood processors in Maryland and Virginia say they depend on foreign workers, mostly from Mexico, for seasonal labor. They pick crabs and shuck oysters, working under the agency's H-2B visa program.\n\nBut those processing facilities have been experiencing five- and six-week delays in bringing this season's workers on board because of holdups at the Department of Labor, they say. The issue has ramped up criticism of a program facing an uncertain future.\n\nAt the J.M. Clayton Seafood Co. in Cambridge, the 60 or so seasonal workers were supposed to arrive in time for the April 1 start of the crab season. When they didn't, Jack Brooks, one of the crab-picking house's owners, said he was lucky to find a few domestic workers to cover the work that had to be done.\n\nHouse moves to tighten visa security\n\nThe company was dealt another stroke of luck when the chilly, inclement weather kept many watermen off the water. Still, the bureaucratic mess was exasperating, Brooks said.\n\n“This is basically costing American jobs,\" he said, pointing to the statistic often cited by H-2B supporters that each visa granted supports four local jobs.\n\nJ.M. Clayton received its foreign workers about five weeks late. Since then, it has found itself taking on shipments of crabs from at least one rival that was unable to get them picked for a lack of workers, Brooks said.\n\nThe Obama administration only has itself to blame for the problems, said U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, who represents Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\n\"Unfortunately this administration continues to try to kneecap this critical program by taking actions that hurt businesses across the Eastern Shore,\" he said.\n\nA Department of Labor spokesman responded to an inquiry by pointing to a February press release.\n\nA congressional spending bill last year increased the number of workers who could theoretically participate in the program, allowing visa recipients from each of the past three years not to be counted toward the 66,000-worker cap.\n\nThe Department of Labor implemented a 17-day \"certification processing pause\" to grapple with the changes, the release said. In the meantime, the number of applications it received during a three-week period in December and January doubled from the same span from the previous year.\n\nTo make matters worse, technical glitches with the agency's electronic filing system cropped up, lengthening the backlog.\n\nThe delays reverberated throughout the prized Chesapeake fishery. Watermen, particularly in Virginia, had no one to buy their freshly caught bushels. So, they simply stayed home.\n\n“There’s plenty of crabs. You just can’t give them away,\" said Scott Wivell, a Cape Charles-based fisherman.\n\nHe reserves some of the blame for Virginia's crabbing regulations. The 2008 changes shortened the formerly year-round harvest, making the surviving crab houses dependent on foreign labor, Wivell said.\n\nThe visa program finds itself at a crossroads. Its biggest congressional benefactor, Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, is retiring soon.

Hogan's veto on Friday and the Senate followed suit Monday morning.\n\nEastern Shore lawmakers voiced strong opposition to the bill, saying it would harm local watermen whose livelihoods depend on the oyster harvest.\n\n\"Of course we need oysters in the bay, it's the best filtration device there is,\" said Delegate Carl Anderton, R-38B-Wicomico. \"But for us on the Lower Shore, we have our watermen, that’s our heritage. That's our way of life.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups have pushed for the bill, saying that the sanctuary program is necessary and working.\n\n\"To save oysters we must use sound science to restore their habitat and protect them,\" said Alison Prost, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland executive director, in a statement. \"That’s what this legislation will do.\"\n\nThe oyster population across the bay has plummeted far below historic highs. A 2018 stock assessment showedthe number of market-size oysters in Maryland had dropped by more than half since 1999, to about 300 million.\n\nIt also showed that oysters had been harvested over the established threshold for the past three seasons in many lower shore regions.\n\n\"We’ve been watching the annual decline of the public fishery,\" said Don Webster, senior agent at the University of Maryland extension center. \"I don’t see it really rebounding.\"\n\nFive sanctuaries across the state — Somerset County's Manokin River, along with Harris Creek, Little Choptank River, Tred Avon River and St. Mary's River — would be permanently protected through the bill.\n\nMillions in state and federal money has been invested in developing these oyster sanctuaries.\n\nThe legislation passed the House and Senate without the support of any members of the Eastern Shore delegation.\n\nHogan vetoed the bill late Thursday night.\n\n\"This bill is bad policy, is bad for our watermen — and worst of all — is bad for the Chesapeake Bay,\" Hogan wrote in a veto letter.\n\nWatermen and scientists disagree on best policy\n\nFor decades watermen, environmentalists, politicians and scientists have butted heads over the state's oyster policy.\n\nAt the root is disagreement over how to best promote the growth of the oyster population.\n\nMany scientists say that sanctuaries are necessary for oysters to reproduce on their own.\n\n\"It’s part of their survival strategy, you need dense aggregations of them to be able to spawn effectively,\" said Webster. \"That’s what these sanctuaries were designed to do — they’ve done a very good job.\"\n\nA recent study at the Harris Creek sanctuary found that the oyster reef established is able to filter the creek's total volume in 10 days during the summer months.\n\nHowever, watermen argue that sanctuaries aren't effective. They say that periodical dredging would clear silt and sediment from the reefs and encourage oyster growth.\n\nDorchester County's Larry Powley pointed to the management strategy in Virginia as an alternative option.\n\nVirginia allows watermen in the Chesapeake Bay to harvest oysters on public grounds on a limited basis every few years, in a program referred to as rotational harvest.\n\n\"They are increasing every year and in Maryland we are decreasing,\" said Powley, a captain who's been working on the water for 45 years. \"What we’re doing is not working.\"\n\nMore:Oysters: Summer rain puts damper on harvest\n\nMore:Chesapeake Bay funding gutted in Trump budget: Eastern Shore leaders oppose cuts\n\nSen. Adelaide Eckardt, R-37-Dorchester, proposed an amendment to the oyster sanctuary bill in the Senate that would have required the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to develop a public fishery rotational harvest pilot program.\n\nBut the amendment didn't make it into the final bill.\n\n\"I offered multiple amendments to make the bill better but I do not think the bill is necessary,\" said Eckardt in a text message.\n\nScientists and environmentalists say studies don't support the theory that periodical harvests help oyster populations to grow.\n\n\"Many watermen are good environmental observers,\" said Webster. \"They make observations and they form opinions. And opinions are not science.\"\n\nEastern Shore delegation strong support of veto\n\nThe Eastern Shore delegation unanimously voted to sustain Gov. Hogan's veto in the House and Senate.\n\nFrom the floor of the House, they framed the issue as a case of urban Democrats disregarding the views of rural Maryland.\n\n\"They’ve basically ignored the will of the Eastern Shore representatives,\" said Delegate Chis Adams, R-37B-Wicomico. \"At what point will the legislature really mean it when they say that we support local control?\"\n\nThe Shore's sole statehouse democrat, Delegate Sheree Sample-Hughes, D-37A-Wicomico, broke ranks with the Democratic party to vote against the bill and to sustain the veto.\n\n\"The watermen have voiced their concerns to us,\" she said. \"I'm from the Eastern Shore, I've always said that I have to maintain a stance for my convictions.\"\n\nBut she said she disagrees that the General Assembly neglects the needs of the Eastern Shore, citing other issues like education.\n\n\"We can't get everything our way,\" she said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers said that they felt the bill ignored the input of their constituents through a collaborative consensus building processes, called OysterFutures.\n\nThe Cambridge-based stakeholder meetings lasted for two years and produced a series of recommendations for oyster management on the Choptank and Little Choptank rivers, including allowing hand tonging in some sanctuary areas.\n\nDelegate Johnny Mautz, R-37B-Talbot, said he has heard from watermen in his district that they will be wary of participating in future discussions after the General Assembly acted against the OysterFutures recommendations.\n\nBut proponents of the bill said on the House floor that the some of the group's recommendations have already been ignored by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\nBoth Lower Shore senators, Eckardt and Mary Beth Carozza, R-38-Worcester, voted to sustain the veto in the Senate on Monday.\n\n\"We as the State of Maryland can meet and exceed our goals under the Chesapeake Bay Agreement without sacrificing the livelihood and way of life of our commercial watermen and their families,” said Carozza in a statement.\n\nDo you work with oysters on the Eastern Shore?

Restrictions on campfires and cooking fires could be expanded to other parks on short notice, depending on local conditions.\n\nTwo wildfires are now burning inside state parks in Western North Carolina, including the Rumbling Bald area of Chimney Rock State Park in Rutherford County, and in South Mountains State Park in Burke County.\n\nThe Chimney Rock fire broke out Saturday night and is affecting the popular rock climbing area, which is closed to climbing and will be for the duration of the fire. The routes, bolts and structures should be mostly OK, McElhone said. The climbing area is about a mile from Lake Lure, where another wildfire is burning.\n\n“Our goal is to protect the local community and then we’ll go in and do a full inspection after the fire is contained,” he said.\n\nThere is also an active fire burning in South Mountain State Park, which broke out Sunday night. The area burning is 150 acres and the park is closed, McElhone said.\n\n“It is in the Chestnut Knob area of park, which includes the main access area of the park and the main trailheads. No structures or facilities are damaged, the park is closed for the safety of public, and will give our staff and N.C. Forest Service the chance to really attack and contain this fire.”\n\nMcElhone stressed that the burning ban pertains not just to campgrounds, but picnic areas and grills.\n\n“We need to eliminate all fires. One of the biggest issues is people coming to visit our parks from other places and might not know about the fires. Our resources and those of the N.C. Forest Service are so strained. We’ve had crews from the mountain region, the Piedmont and the coastal regions. And many of these crews are just returning from the hurricane.”\n\nCampfire bans are in effect at the following parks: Chimney Rock, Crowders Mountain, Elk Knob, Gorges, Grandfather Mountain, Hanging Rock, Lake James, Lake Norman, Mount Mitchell, Morrow Mountain, New River (including Mount Jefferson State Natural Area), Pilot Mountain, South Mountains and Stone Mountain state parks.\n\nCooking fires using propane and other approved camp stove fuels are allowed in designated areas.\n\nAmber White, spokeswoman for Chimney Rock LLC at Chimney Rock State Park, said on Wednesday the attraction is completely open, including trails and amenities.\n\nCampers and picnickers throughout the state parks system should be extremely careful with campfires and cooking fires. Use only designated areas for fires, do not leave fires unattended and use extra care to extinguish fires before leaving a campsite or picnic area.\n\nBefore visiting a state park for camping or picnicking, visit www.ncparks.gov for fire restrictions.\n\nFire near Lake Lure grows to 400 acres; evacuations underway", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/desert-magazine/2016/05/29/parks-recreation/84992846/", "title": "Parks & Recreation", "text": "​Words by Ashley Breeding, Mona de Crinis, Joan Page McKenna and Dana Nichols\n\nDesert Magazine\n\nAs the Joshua tree fronds begin to slump and the desert toad and its fellow critter friends go digging for shade, it’s a sign that summer is coming into full swing. While we’re fortunate to have such beautiful retreats as Joshua Tree National Park, Big Bear and Anza–Borrego State Park close by the rest of the year, this is the season to escape to cooler parks and other outdoor playgrounds. Here, we take you to some of the best recreation areas that our pocket of the country — well, Mother Nature in general — has to offer.\n\nCruising north on California’s Highway 1 — “PCH” among locals — from Laguna Beach to Newport Beach, you’ll pass a deep, craggy cove speckled with colorful beach cottages at one end, its 3-mile shoreline overlapped by aqua-green seas (or moody blue-gray waves, depending on the day). To the right, a verdant canyon juts from the roadside, its landscape traversed by sandy trails, its edge anchoring a cluster of ocean-view homes.\n\nThis is Crystal Cove State Park — a 2,791-acre swath of prime O.C. property, a cattle ranch back in the day, purchased from the Irvine Company in 1979.\n\nUp close, the cluster of 46 cottages, with their palm-thatched roofs and vernacular makings, look like something from the past, and in a way, they are: A secluded spot that once went unnoticed to passers-by on the highway above, Crystal Cove first became a popular among Irvine Co. workers seeking respite, local plein-air painters (William Wendt is the first known to paint here) and silent movie–era Hollywood filmmakers scouting “island” locations. Eventually, the cove evolved into a small but eclectic community of settlers.\n\nCrystal Cove Alliance, a nonprofit for California State Parks, has tirelessly raised funds for more than a decade to rebuild the ramshackle bungalows — all assembled between the 1920s and ’50s — replicating the materials used by the very “Covites” that fashioned them from found parts: lumber from a shuttered warehouse in Los Angeles, discarded interiors from the Hotel del Coronado, window panels from abandoned railway cars and even a wooden schooner that washed ashore in an angry storm in 1927.\n\nThe cottage restoration project called for three phases: The first two, finished in 2006 and 2011, included 29 of the historic cottages. The third is under way. Today, many of the charming structures are overnight rentals (plan to book far in advance, as the area’s endless summers put them in high demand year-round). A few serve as marine research facilities and educational exhibits for science lovers. You’ll also find The Beachcomber Café, Bootlegger Bar and Shake Shack here, all great places to dive into a tasty meal (or Prohibition-era cocktail) with an epic view.\n\nExplorers of all ages will delight in the diverse species that dwell in Crystal Cove’s underwater park, observing the coastal tide pools and trekking the 17 miles of scenic trails. If you’re not able to reserve a cottage in time, or sleeping under the stars is more your vibe, two campgrounds are also available for tent camping. crystalcovestatepark.org\n\n*The nearby Pacific Marine Mammal Center, which rescues and rehabilitates injured marine mammals, regularly releases them along the stretch of coast. If you’re lucky, you’ll catch a release on your visit. But you can also visit the facility for a tour and up-close look at these cute creatures.pacificmmc.org\n\nJutting out of the Pacific Ocean, within sight of the bustling Southern California coastline on clear days, Santa Catalina Island (popularly referred to as Catalina Island or simply Catalina) invites languid relaxation or non-stop action, depending on your mood.\n\nLocated only 22 miles southwest of Los Angeles, the island is the ideal weekend getaway for suburbanites and anyone else who needs some time away from the city scene. Part of the Channel Islands archipelago, Catalina offers ocean and land adventures including kayaking, parasailing, sea-trekking, biking, camping, zip lines and general meandering. Hiking the island is a popular pastime, from languid walks to strenuous jaunts for experienced hikers, such as the 37-mile Trans–Catalina Trail.\n\nIf you want to experience the fascinating world under the waves, get wet and explore the abundant marine life with a snorkel or scuba tank, or stay dry on a glass-bottom boat or undersea semi-submersible tour.\n\nEnjoy a slice of California history and learn about the island’s colorful past, from serving as a stop for smugglers, pirates and other ne’er-do-wells to the eventual purchase in 1919 by the Wrigley gum dynasty of almost every share of the Santa Catalina Island Company in 1919 from the Banning brothers, original owners of the resort enterprise. The island’s storied past includes mining, stagecoaches, the Green Pleasure Pier, Chicago Cubs spring training, WWII military preparation site, Hollywood films, the creation of the Catalina Island Conservancy to protect the land and resources, and the art deco Catalina Casino perched at the water’s edge, which today holds a movie theater, ballroom and museum.\n\nAvalon’s palm-tree lined main boulevard against the backdrop of the blue Pacific invites strolling, and bars and restaurants cater to the easygoing beach ambiance with open-air patios and terraces. Shop along the promenade for clothing, accessories and gifts, purchase island-style art at one of several galleries or succumb to the skilled hands of a masseuse at an Avalon day spa.\n\nParanormal enthusiasts will love a guided ghost tour through Avalon, built upon an ancient Tongva Indian burial ground. Learn about rumors of ghostly sightings, tales of scandal and unsolved mysteries and why the town remains haunted to this day.\n\nGetting to this Southern California island paradise is easy: It’s approximately one hour by boat from ports in San Pedro, Long Beach, Newport Beach or Dana Point, or 15 minutes via helicopter. Staying there is easier still. Choose a charming bed and breakfast, beachfront hotel, cozy cottage or luxurious four-star country inn. For longer stays, or to get a feel for what it might be like to live on Catalina, try renting a fully functional condo and make meals at “home.” Whatever your goals or desires are in visiting Catalina Island, with so many options in activities, dining and lodging, you’re certain to find the mix that works for you. Just remember to bring your bathing suit or board shorts, tennies or hiking boots, and leave your worries on the mainland. visitcatalinaisland.com\n\n*Engage your playful side on Catalina.

Eons of erosion forced by frost wedging and the steady gnaw of rainwater since time immemorial have molded limestone into a brilliantly hued maze of slot canyons, windows and elaborate spires called hoodoos.\n\nStretching out, labyrinth-like, over more than 55 square miles, this sprawling reserve’s unique geology consists of a tangle of horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters carved along the eastern edge of Utah’s Paunsaugunt Plateau. Ponderosa pines, meadows and fir-spruce forests rich with wildlife skirt the plateau’s edge. At an elevation between 8,000 and 9,000 feet, the rim of Bryce Canyon offers panoramic views boasting some 200 miles of visibility. Crisp, pristine air and the welcome absence of large artificial light sources elevate stargazing from an activity to a spiritual experience.\n\nHiking trails wind through and above the almost otherworldly landscape, where color and light dance in step with the canyon’s rhythm. Travel the park’s main road at daybreak or sundown past the expansive Bryce Amphitheater, a hoodoo-rich depression lying below the popular Rim Trail hiking path, and stop at one or all of several overlooks: Sunrise Point, Sunset Point, Inspiration Point and Bryce Point. During the summer, the Bryce Canyon shuttle provides optional transportation to and from all of the points.\n\nFrom Sunset Point, invest an hour and a half and walk the 1-mile, round-trip path along the rim of Bryce Amphitheater. Seasoned hikers who crave solitude can venture out on backcountry treks, such as the ambitious 22.9-mile Under-the-Rim Trail from Bryce Point to Rainbow Point. Stretch it out over a few days and pitch your tent at one of eight campsites along the trail. Find the hike that’s right for you: Pick up the park’s trail guide, determine your level and route your course. Exploring the park on horseback is another option during summer; inquire at the Bryce Canyon Lodge.\n\nTwo Bryce Canyon campgrounds offer sites for general camping. Traditional lodging is available at the Bryce Canyon Lodge throughout the season.\n\nCheck out the park’s visitors center and immerse yourself in the experience with ranger-led walks, tours and programs. It’s a great way to embrace the beauty while expanding your knowledge of this magical wonderland. nps.gov; utah.com/bryce-canyon-national-park\n\n*If your idea of being star-struck has nothing to do with Hollywood, Bryce Canyon National Park offers stargazing programs, full-moon guided walks and an annual astronomy festival perfect for celestial-chasing paparazzi.\n\nLong before Mormon pioneer John Wesley Powell first visited Zion in the 1860s during a scientific exploration of southern Utah, before white settlers discovered that the desert-like area’s rare geology and perennial river supported farming, indigenous tribes were hunting and foraging along the broad expanse of Utah’s Great Basin and western Colorado Plateau. Although sparse, evidence of these nomadic First People — baskets, flaked stone knives and and yucca fiber sandals — recovered from caves and unearthed sites dates back to at least 6000 B.C.\n\nToday, Zion is federally protected as Zion National Park. The congressional bill designating the park was signed into law in 1919, making it the oldest national park in the state. Since then, park attendance has increased exponentially due to its distinctive rock formations, comfortable climate, a wide variety of flora and fauna, and a wealth of outdoor activities.\n\nWild sandstone canyons as narrow as they are deep, impressive plateaus, colossal sandstone cliffs in shades of pink, red and cream set against a sky of brilliant blue, lush hanging gardens and waterfalls courtesy of the plucky Virgin River, and attendant slopes laden with pine and juniper have earned Zion National Park a devoted following. Visiting only once in a lifetime is like sampling a single jellybean from a bowl brimming with limitless flavors.\n\nStraddling three counties in southwestern Utah, the park boasts 229 square miles of unparalleled canyon country. With an elevation change of about 5,000 feet from the park’s highest point (8,726 feet) to its lowest point (3,666 feet), Zion’s diverse climate and topography nurtures an array of species and habitats, including 67 species of mammals, 200-plus birds and more than 1,000 types of trees and plants.\n\nWhile Zion is truly beautiful to behold, it’s also built for outdoor adventure. Blessed with more than 90 miles of trails, 37 designated backpacking sites plus several at-large backpacking areas, and 124,400 acres of designated wilderness, the park is a backpacker’s paradise. Advanced planning and training are essential, and the study of the National Park Service’s Wilderness Guide is strongly advised prior to trekking into the backcountry. Wilderness permits are required for all overnight trips.\n\nBicycles are permitted on all park roadways and designated trails. A shuttle bus equipped with a rack that can accommodate two bicycles makes the journey that much easier, if you so desire.\n\nThe burgeoning sport of canyoneering has deep roots in Zion National Park. This adrenaline-spiking, synapse-sparking activity combines route finding, rappelling, swimming, hiking and problem solving. Zion has dozens of canyons ripe for exploring and slot canyons barely wide enough to accommodate a human body. The Narrows will give you a taste of what it takes to navigate a slot canyon. Fortunately, there are enough options to satisfy both beginners and those with advanced technical skills. Camping is allowed in three designated campgrounds: South and Watchman campgrounds are located in Zion Canyon and Lava Point Campground is about an hour’s drive from the canyon.\n\nIf it’s comfort you seek when retiring from the day’s activities, Zion Lodge on Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is open year-round and offers standard rooms, cabins and suites, as well as a gift shop and post office (888-297-2757 for reservations). While there, dine at Red Rock Grill or Castle Dome Café. Become a repeat visitor, and don’t deny yourself the chance to experience the many activities and nuances of Zion National Park. nps.gov\n\n*Want to try your hand at canyoneering? Think “miner” and invest in a quality headlamp for those forays into tight spaces characteristic of slot canyons where the sun doesn’t shine. And prepare to get wet. Seasoned canyoneerers swear by moisture-wicking clothing (long sleeves are advised) and neoprene socks for optimal comfort.\n\nCalifornia’s Sierra Nevada range brims with scenic beauty. Those looking to immerse themselves in it but not give up the vibrancy that humans contribute to the outdoor landscape — breweries, festivals, outdoor concerts, golf tournaments and organized mountain bike races — will find their paradise in Mammoth Lakes. About six hours north of Palm Springs, Mammoth is a happening mountain town that also boasts access points to the John Muir and Ansel Adams wildernesses. Crystalline lakes at upwards of 8,500 feet are recreational playgrounds for hikers and fishermen on cool summer days that rarely exceed 76 degrees.\n\nMajor highlights include the columnar basalt rock formation Devils Postpile National Monument, a 798-acre monument established in 1911 near the impressive Rainbow Falls, as well as Mammoth Mountain Bike Park, Sierra Star Golf Course (open to the public), June Lake fishing village and the country’s longest continuously running motocross race, which takes place every June. Grab a seat on a shuttle or drive 30 minutes to the eastern entrance of Yosemite National Park, where the picturesque Tuolumne Meadows are located. Before doing so, get your bearings on the region by riding Mammoth’s gondola to the 11,053-foot summit. The 360-degree view is a must-see, and you can opt to ride, hike or mountain bike down.\n\nAdventurers will delight in making their own paths in and around Mammoth by both land and water. Choose from hundreds of hiking trails, varying in difficulty from easy nature paths to near-vertical ascents. Similarly, bike riders’ choice in trails range from gentle paved paths around town to road bike–worthy roads (south of town off Highway 395), to Mammoth Mountain Bike Park’s downhill and cross-country trails primed for the most fearless of fat tires. Interested in canoeing, paddleboarding or kayaking? Rentals are available around Mammoth Lakes Basin all the way up to June Lake. With campgrounds lining the border of most lakes here, it’s the ideal locale to pitch a tent — just a few steps from the cool waters.\n\nAn increasingly popular pastime in Mammoth Lakes is the showcase of outdoor live music, which can now be found almost daily in one of the village or lakeshore eatery settings. Festival-minded folks won’t want to miss the annual Mammoth Festival of Beers and Bluesapalooza every August, when bands and breweries gather under the pines for an entire boozy and bluesy weekend. Follow the festivities with a soak in one of the local natural hot spring tubs and you’ll feel like you wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.\n\n*To a hiker perched atop the summit of Mammoth Mountain — or any other high point the eastern Sierras — Mono Lake is visible as the largest body of water in the region. This 760,000-year-old inland sea is a worthwhile stop for those driving Highway 395; while it looks stunning from afar, it’s even better up close. That’s because large tufa formations — limestone towers that loom overhead — line the shore, making the setting feel otherworldly. Walking trails are located at the South Tufa grove. Guided morning canoe tours are available on weekends in summer from the Mono Lake Committee, which also runs a gift shop and information center in the neighboring town of Lee Vining.\n\nWhile the lake doesn’t have any fish, it is abundant with migratory birds, brine shrimp and alkali flies. Stop by the Forest Service’s nearby visitors center to see exhibits and learn more. Afterward, don’t miss the opportunity to try a hand-dipped chocolate soft-serve cone at Mono Cone.\n\nStand near the General Grant tree — a towering sequoia known as “the nation’s Christmas tree,” which holds court in a grove of other mammoth redwoods — and marvel at the majesty of nature. If the novelty of being dwarfed by the super-sized coniferous inhabitants of Grants Grove wears thin (and it won’t), there are natural wonders aplenty to keep the “wow” factor heightened. Arresting rocky vistas, deep valleys, vast caverns, fragrant forests and icy lakes carved from glacier bowls define the California wilderness duo of Kings Canyon and Sequoia national parks. Stretching across the southern Sierra Nevada range east of the San Joaquin Valley in elevations ranging from 1,370 to 14,494 feet, the tandem parks provide habitats for hundreds of species of wildlife, including skunks, black bears, bobcats, gopher, California king snakes, gray fox and the California newt.\n\nWith more than 800 miles of maintained trails in varying degrees of difficulty that traverse 800,000-plus acres of designated wilderness, hiking, camping and backpacking are among the most popular visitor activities. Wander through redwood groves on paved trails ideal for strollers and wheelchairs; learn about the diverse flora and fauna via guided ranger walks and programs offered by the Sequoia Parks Conservancy, as well as the parks’ visitor centers and museums; break bread with friends and family in one of the many picnic areas; or go Bonanza on horseback with your own steed or visit one of the pack stations. You can also submerge into the underground world of Sequoia National Park’s Crystal Cave (purchase tickets online at least 48 hours in advance) or, if you’re an experienced climber, scale the granite cliffs and domes; or venture deep into the wild with all you need for survival strapped to your back (wilderness permits are required for overnight adventures).\n\nDrive one or all three segments of Generals Highway, from the Sequoia Park entrance to Cedar Grove and Kings Canyon, and absorb the parks’ remarkable scenery. Allow enough time to fully enjoy traveling the winding road from foothills to sequoia groves (vehicles longer than 22 feet are not advised on some sections due to road width). Stops might include Grizzly Falls, Roaring River Falls, Boyden Cave and Eleven Range Overlook, where on a clear day you can see California’s Coast Range on the other side of the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nFor optimum comfort, four lodges offer an alternative to sleeping in tents or under a canopy of stars. Wuksachi Lodge, in the Giant Forest area of Sequoia National Park, is a modern facility with 102 rooms, full-service dining, a cocktail lounge, and retail and ski shops (888-252-5757); John Muir Lodge is in the Grant Grove area of Kings Canyon National Park and offers 36 rooms and a restaurant. Or choose from six styles of cabins at nearby Grant Grove Cabins. Both facilities are approximately .5 miles from a sequoia grove, visitor center, market, restaurant, gift shop and post office (888-436-9615). Cedar Grove Lodge, open throughout the summer and fall, is in the Cedar Grove section of Kings Canyon National Park and offers 21 rooms, a counter-service restaurant, market and gift shop. The lodge is also within walking distance of Cedar Grove’s visitor center (888-436-9615). nps.gov\n\n*Budding biologist must-do: Spread your wings working on a small animal project, such as surveying peregrine falcons for a week during the summer. Volunteer opportunities exist throughout the year.\n\nStanding sentry over Morro Bay like a stoic guard at Buckingham Palace whose unflinching presence signals strength, safety and a sense of order in a chaotic world, Morro Rock is largely considered central California’s most prominent coastal landmark. Rising 576 feet above the waves and whitecaps of the Pacific Ocean, the rock is as environmentally and historically significant as it is an aesthetic natural phenomenon.\n\nFor centuries, mariners looked to Morro Rock, a 23-million-year-old volcanic plug, as a guidepost directing them on their journey. And American peregrine falcons make their homes high above the surf away from land-dwelling predators and curious humans, as the area is designated a natural preserve within Morro Bay State Park in San Luis Obispo County.\n\nMorro Bay State Park features the Heron Rookery Nature Preserve, a lagoon and natural bay habitat that is a critical point along the Pacific Flyway stretching from Alaska to South America. More than 100 species of migratory birds stop here for seasonal roosting and feeding. Bird watching is one of the area’s most engaging pastimes; visit the Central Coast Birding Trail website (ca-ccbt.info) for birding locations, species information, resources and events. A nearby butterfly grove often hosts roosting monarchs from November through February.\n\nOther popular activities in Morro Bay State Park include camping, picnicking, hiking, biking, geocaching, fishing and boating. If you’re a sailor at heart, you can rent canoes and kayaks from a small boat marina and grab a bite at the marina’s café after your seafaring adventure. The park is also home to the celebrated Morro Bay Golf Course, featuring a pro shop, café and driving range, all of which are open to the public.\n\nLocated approximately 150 miles south of San Jose and 175 miles north of Los Angeles, Morro Bay and surrounding areas enjoy mild summers and cool, often wet winters. Visitors are encouraged to keep sweaters and rain gear handy regardless of the season. morrobay.org\n\n*Want to surf the waters near Morro Bay? Bring your wetsuit and maybe even booties, gloves and hoodies, as the temps are a far cry from Southern California’s endless summer.\n\nRelaxing with great food and drink and enjoying the romantic vibe of California’s stunning central coast defines the charming seaside burg of Cambria. Galleries, boutiques, wineries, beachfront trails, ocean-view cottages, tide pools flush with marine life, preserves and Hearst San Simeon State Park 2 miles away make this area a truly remarkable getaway.\n\nNestled between Ventura and San Luis Obispo along iconic Highway 1, Cambria is an athlete’s Eden, a naturalist’s Shangri- La and an epicurean’s nirvana. Cyclists from around the world flock here for miles of renowned riding routes for all levels. Add breathtaking views, and even the most arduous training session becomes a sightseeing excursion.\n\nKayakers paddling in San Simeon Cove, directly across from the renowned Hearst Castle, might spot sea otters, elephant seals and possibly whales in the distance. Afterword, refuel with a deli sandwich from Sebastian’s, a favorite local eatery. Land trekkers find miles of trails and paths, most notably along the bluffs of Leffingwell Landing or at Fiscalini Ranch Preserve — 430 acres spanning across a mile of coastline. Bring your dog and your horse to the preserve: Both are welcome.\n\nAnimal-lovers won’t want to leave Piedras Blancas rookery, where elephant seals frolic year-round, mating and giving birth to their young during late winter and early spring. Other marine mammals that frequent the rookery include sea otters, dolphins and whales.\n\nKeep love in the air with a visit to Moonstone Beach — Cambria’s most romantic stretch of coastline — where gentle, cool breezes refresh the soul and soft sand between your toes tickles all your senses. Find a moonstone for your beloved and keep the memory alive until your next visit.\n\nCambria also offers some of the finest accommodations and dining along the central coast, from elegant restaurants, family wineries and authentic delis to four-star hotels and estates-turned-bed-and-breakfasts. One of the area’s most popular events is the Annual Art & Wine Festival, where locals and visitors can win raffle prizes, watch artists hone their craft and, naturally, sample fabulous wine and food.\n\nEasy to get to and impossible to forget, Cambria and adjacent Hearst San Simeon State Park are a magical vacation combination. parks.ca.gov\n\n*Step into the past and glimpse the grandeur and romance of 1930s Hollywood with an evening tour of Hearst Castle and Hearst’s world-famous art collections. Docents clad in period attire lead you through 165 rooms and 127 acres of gardens, terraces, walkways and pools.\n\nYosemite captivates; it’s not a place you struggle to remember years after your family vacation. The rugged granite monoliths Half Dome and El Capitan, the bend of early morning light as it skips from rock to tree to water to earth, the deep solitude of Yosemite Valley, and the wild tumble of river water over Yosemite Falls seize your soul, and you are forever grateful for the hook.\n\nSet in California’s scenic eastern Sierra Nevada mountains, many of Yosemite’s iconic vistas have been captured or reimagined by artists and photographers (most notably Ansel Adams), Hollywood directors and even tech mogul Apple, which named the two most recent Mac computer operating systems Yosemite and El Capitan, respectively.\n\nYosemite National Park’s inherent riches include towering ancient sequoias, expansive meadows, diverse animal and plant life, dramatic geology and abundant waterfalls. The tallest of its kind in North America, Yosemite Falls roars down 2,425 feet of mountainside in a chain of powerful cascades, one link mightier than the next.\n\nA popular stop while visiting Yosemite is Tuolumne Meadows, a vast subalpine meadow ringed by rugged mountain peaks and glacially carved domes through which Tuolumne River quietly meanders.\n\nFor unparalleled sunsets, travel 16 miles of twisting road as it snakes up to Glacier Point. At this elevation, you can look Half Dome “in the eye” as the last rays of sun bathe the surface in soft hues of orange and pink. It’s also an excellent vantage point for viewing Yosemite Falls from above.\n\nWith more than 1,000 miles of designated wilderness in Yosemite National Park, there’s really not a bad seat in the house. Tunnel View is largely considered the most scenic and photographed spot in the park. Divinely inspired topography opens to the grandeur of Yosemite Valley with El Capitan rising tall on the left, Bridalveil Fall to the right and, appropriately, Half Dome commanding center stage.\n\nPopular activities within the park include hiking on 800 miles of trails, biking 12-plus miles of paved bike paths, horseback riding (stock sites are available at some campgrounds), mountaineering, rock climbing, backpacking (wilderness permit required) and camping at one — or all — of Yosemite’s 13 campgrounds. In the summer, rafting along the Merced River is a popular pastime if the water level allows. Rent a raft or bring your own. Kayaks and other non-motorized vessels are also permitted.\n\nThere are a variety of lodging options in Yosemite National Park, from simple tent cabins at the High Sierra Camps to deluxe rooms at The Majestic Yosemite Hotel (formerly The Ahwahnee). Lodging is also available in surrounding communities. Learn about the area’s rich history and landscape at Valley Visitor Center, staffed by knowledgeable rangers, and Yosemite Museum, which highlights the cultural history of the native Miwok and Paiute people. Or immerse yourself in art at the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite Valley near the visitor center and post office.\n\nWhether you’re an artist seeking inspiration, a world-class climber and mountaineer, or a middle-class family on vacation, Yosemite National Park should be on every nature lover’s bucket list. travelyosemite.com\n\n*Have a little Ansel in you? The Yosemite Art Center in Yosemite Valley offers art and photography classes and workshops all summer.yosemiteconservancy.org/yosemite-art-center\n\nSnaking across the Sierra Nevada mountain passes, through fragrant ponderosa pines and past bubbling brooks, you might believe for a moment that the best part of a road trip to South Lake Tahoe is the journey there. But then you arrive: Coarse sandy beaches enveloped by towering Douglas firs run into rocky shorelines, breaking the tide of this majestic alpine lake (at a massive 191 square miles, it’s the largest in North America). Translucent green water flows into deeper … and deeper … and deeper hues of blue. Humbling mountains rise high from the distant shores, reflecting peachy pink light at sunrise and glowing golden in the evening hours. From dawn till dusk, this place is truly a spellbinding sight.\n\nTo experience the south end of Lake Tahoe — which straddles the California-Nevada state line — is even more arresting. Water lovers will revel in the many forms of exploration: kayaking, stand-up paddleboarding and boating are all common ways to cruise these waters. In some places, you can see as far as 70 feet below the surface. What you’ll find: wild fish like rainbow and brown trout, lake mackinaw and kokanee salmon. California gulls sweep overhead while the Canada goose is known to paddle alongside smaller boats in shallower waters. Low tide offers an expanse of sand wide enough for a leisurely stroll or to roll out a beach towel and relax with a good book. Pack a picnic and make a day of it; just be prepared to ward off the winged beggars.\n\nThose who are thirsty for some fresh mountain air and an athletic excursion around the alpine wilderness have options aplenty: Desolation Wilderness features nearly 64,000 acres of pure beauty, from glacial valleys to Cathedral and Fallen Leaf lakes to grand granite peaks. Avid outdoorsmen who crave a challenge can hit the famous Tahoe Rim Trail (on foot or by mountain bike) for 165 miles of dirt along the ridge of the Lake Tahoe Basin. If you’d prefer to hit the path on four hooves, a few local stables will lead the way. Also consider a ride up the Heavenly Gondola (“limo to the sky”) and pull, swing and zip line your way across the breathtaking views. Keep an eye out for the region’s beloved black bear; mostly nocturnal, they have been spotted in the day.\n\nWhen you need a rest, relax at your campsite — Camp Richardson and Zephyr Cove Resort are comfortable, traditional camping options — or hike to the 1920s for a tour of the Valhalla Historic Site or Vikingsholm castle, a 38-room mansion assembled mostly of materials found right here in Lake Tahoe. If you need a break from beef jerky and s’mores, local restaurants and pubs serve up a hot and tasty bite along with the wild ambiance. visitinglaketahoe.com\n\n*The Lake Tahoe Outdoor Arena at Henley’s heats up this summer with performances by Sting and Peter Gabriel, Keith Urban, James Taylor and Steve Miller Band.tahoesouth.com\n\n\n\nTo dog lovers’ delight, most national and state parks — and some beaches — welcome your four-legged pals. If you’re road tripping with Fido this summer, be sure to check out these travel tips.\n\nAlways call ahead and go to individual destination websites for pet policies, rules and restrictions. Dogs might be required to be on a 6-foot leash or shorter, for example, and cannot be left unattended, especially in vehicles, which can overheat quickly and be deadly. Campsites may allow pets, but they must stay inside your tent/RV with you at night for their safety. (Remember to bear-proof pet food too!) Some park trails are off-limits, so plan accordingly.\n\n» Bring your pet to the vet for a pre-travel checkup. Tell your doctor your destination and ask whether you’ll need to start your pet on heartworm or flea/tick prevention medications if s/he is not already taking them.\n\n» Pack copies of your dog’s license, microchip number and vaccination records, including rabies, as well as photos and a physical description in case he or she gets lost. Keep them with you in a waterproof bag.\n\n» Write your cell phone number in permanent marker on your pet’s collar.\n\n» Carry a pet first aid kit and extra medications if needed. Download the American Red Cross’ Pet First Aid app at redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/mobile-apps or by texting “GETPET” to 90999. Look up the closest emergency vet clinic and store the number in your phone.\n\n» Invest in a dog harness/seatbelt or crate your dog during the trip. Pets should ride in the back seat, as airbags can be dangerous for them. Don’t let Fluffy hang her head out the window when you’re on the road; debris can kick up and cause injury.\n\n» Once you’re there, avoid any contact with local wildlife. Keep your dog on a sturdy leash or inside your vehicle with you at all times for his or her safety. Risks include animal attacks, snakebites, insect stings, disease transmission, falls and ingestion of poisonous plants/carcasses. If you’re not sure you can closely monitor your companion 24/7, it might be best to find a sitter and leave Fido safely at home.\n\n» Know your pet’s physical limits. A full day at the beach or hiking in the heat may be too much. If so, leave her at home or at a nearby kennel for the day. (Some parks’ pet policy pages list local kennels.)\n\n» Pack plenty of water and carry dog food with you. Consider purchasing a cooling vest, such as a Ruffwear Swamp Cooler, and cooling gel mats for warmer destinations.\n\n» Be a good guardian and clean up pet waste.\n\n» Schedule a post-trip vet visit to make sure your companion is healthy and parasite-free.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/01/31/delaware-water-gap-national-recreation-area-national-park-nj/9257595002/", "title": "Delaware Water Gap National Recreation area a national park ...", "text": "A longtime effort to change the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area into a national park is stepping out of the shadows again and has picked up its first endorsement by a public body.\n\nThe Warren County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a resolution last week endorsing the idea of Congress re-designating the nearly 70,000 acres of the recreation area as a national park and preserve.\n\nAs a \"national recreation area,\" known by its National Park Service designation \"DEWA,\" it would remain under the jurisdiction of the park service but move into the category of \"national park.\"\n\nThe National Park System includes 423 individual units, with several in New Jersey, among them the Paterson Great Falls, Edison's workshops and the Morristown National Historical Park, with its four Revolution-era sites. Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are also on the list and are shared with New York.\n\nThe system features two sections of the Delaware River and the Great Egg Harbor River.\n\nStory continues below gallery\n\nAmong the 65 units that bear the designation of national park, there are just nine east of the Mississippi River, with just one, Acadia in Maine, in the Northeast. The two nearest to the region are the Cuyahoga Valley in Ohio and Shenandoah in Virginia.\n\nIn West Virginia, the New River Gorge National River, created as a National Park Service unit in 1978, was re-designated the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.\n\nThe Warren County resolution said designating the recreation area as a national park \"is to place this jewel of our national heritage into the crown of the national park system, where it has always belonged.\"\n\nThe resolution also said \"upgrading the Delaware Water Gap would create greater awareness and prestige for our region. This could also mean more funding for maintenance, visitor amenities and other improvements as well as support the local economy.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, Commissioner James Kern III said he met recently with Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Knowlton Township Mayor Adele Starrs, Committeeman Kevin Duffy of Hardwick Township and former Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Superintendent John Donahue.\n\nOutdoors:NJ is home to dozens of peaks above 1,000 feet, and they are all in North Jersey\n\nMore:Delaware Water Gap wants feedback on what to do with 500 historic buildings\n\nInfrastructure:Delaware Water Gap roads to be renovated in spring as part of $21.5 million project\n\nContacted Friday, park spokeswoman Kathleen Sandt said DEWA officials, by federal law, cannot make any statements regarding the park designation movement.\n\nHowever, she did write that a \"change in designation alone may not impact these factors, but if the change includes additional lands and facilities, or results in a demonstrated change in visitation, that would be taken into account in future fiscal cycles.\"\n\nShe said the National Park Service unit's base funding \"is provided through regular appropriations and is determined by the number of visitors, mission-essential activities, number and historic designation of facilities, acreage, road and trail mileage, if applicable, and other factors.\"\n\nSandt provided visitor numbers dating back to 1978, with a 2020 figure of 4.1 million, which would put the recreation area 10th on the list of most-visited units in the National Park System.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2013, visitation was on either side of 5 million each year, but it dropped to a low of 3.2 million in 2018.\n\nVisitation jumped in 2020 and 2021 because of the pandemic as people flocked to outdoor activities, such as kayaking, hiking and picnicking.\n\nSandt said there are 55 million people within a five-hour or less drive of the park.\n\nIn 2020, the park released numbers that show the 4.1 million visitors spent $144 million in local communities. That visitation and spending supported 1,970 jobs and contributed toward a total economic output of $212 million in communities within 60 miles of the recreation area.\n\nThe designation of the 70,000 acres as a \"recreation area\" is an artifact of the Tocks Island Dam project. Designed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the dam across the Delaware River at the head of Tocks Island would have created a lake that filled much of the valley northward to near the New Jersey-New York-Pennsylvania area.\n\nThe government bought and/or forced out the residents of what would have been underwater and around the shores of the proposed lake.\n\nHowever, the 1960s project also birthed the environmental movement, as citizen activists fought the idea and eventually the federal government gave up the dam plans and gave the property to the National Park Service.\n\nNational parks, recreation areas, preserves, battlefields or historic parks must be approved by Congress.\n\nOver the past couple of decades, there have been different efforts to make the water gap area into a national park. However, those efforts failed to gain much traction because, as a general rule, a designated \"national park\" prohibits hunting and fishing.\n\nAny possible ban on hunting and fishing brought out most sportsmen and outdoors groups and tamped down support for a name change.\n\nMany areas of Alaska and some areas in the western mainland U.S. carry the designation of \"preserve,\" which allows for hunting and fishing, and last year, the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve was approved in West Virginia, marking the river itself as the national park and the lands beside the river as a preserve.\n\nDonahue, the public face of the Delaware Water Gap effort, spent 38 years in the National Park Service, the last 13 years as superintendent at DEWA.\n\nAmong supporters of re-designation are the Sierra Clubs of both New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the Highlands Coalition. The organizers this week launched their own website.\n\nDonahue described the effort as \"a grassroots group of citizens\" who believe the time is right to revisit the designation.\n\nTravel:It's national 'Plan for Vacation' Day!

There's 12,000 years of humans living here.\"\n\nHe said there is public prestige attached to the designation as a national park, but also, \"We want to do this because it's the right thing to do.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/how-we-live/2020/05/22/nj-beach-restrictions/5198233002/", "title": "NJ beaches: Guide to rules, restrictions on Monmouth, Ocean beaches", "text": "Asbury Park Press\n\nOn May 14, Governor Phil Murphy announced that New Jersey beaches could re-open on May 22, just in time for Memorial Day Weekend - the unofficial start of summer at the Jersey Shore.\n\nWith Murphy's announcement though, came a set of rules for beaches, boardwalks and lakefronts to follow including limited capacity, restrictions on the number of beach badges sold, maintaining social distancing guidelines, and more.\n\nEach beach town may also out their own specific rules and restrictions in place as well.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about each town before making a trip to the Shore.\n\nAllenhurst\n\nRestrictions: The Allenhurst Beach Club offers nonmembers access to the beach with the purchase of a daily pass.\n\nBeach badge price:\n\nAdults: $10.\n\nChildren 12 and under: Free.\n\nBathroom facilities:\n\nA daily pass also grants guests access to bathrooms and showers.\n\nAll children must be accompanied by an adult.\n\nOther info:\n\nDaily passes do not grant access to cabanas, cabana bathrooms, or pool area.\n\nAsbury Park\n\nRestrictions:\n\nFace coverings or masks will need to be worn\n\nGroups of beach patrons must sit at least six feet apart from others.\n\nThe Boardwalk will be set up for one-way travel in each direction\n\nSocial distancing will be required on the boardwalk\n\nDaily beach passes will be available for purchase exclusively through Viply each day at 5 p.m. for the following day only.\n\nBeach badge price:\n\nSeason beach badge rates: $70 for adults; $20 for seniors; $20 for teens.\n\nSeason daily rates: Monday to Friday: $5; Weekends and holidays: $7\n\nMDW: Beach towns wrap up last minute preparations\n\nBathroom facilities:\n\nAccess to restroom facilities will be limited to one person at a time.\n\nFace coverings or masks will need to be worn when using restroom facilities.\n\nBeach showers, water fountains and new water bottle refilling stations will be unavailable until further notice.\n\nOther info:\n\nRestrooms will be available at the following locations: First Avenue, Fourth Avenue, Asbury Park Convention Hall (entrance from beach), Sixth Avenue\n\nBenches will be removed from the boardwalk\n\nFace coverings/masks do not need to be worn when swimming or sunbathing\n\nThe playgrounds at 2nd and 7th Avenue are closed\n\nContact sports, organized events, and summer camps are prohibited until further notice.\n\nAvon\n\nRestrictions:\n\nAnyone buying a beach badge at the tag booth, walking on the boardwalk or entering or exiting the beach is asked to wear a face covering or mask.\n\nThe beach will be open for swimming with lifeguards on the weekends of May 23, May 30, June 6, and June 13; open daily starting June 15.\n\nThe beach and boardwalk will close at 8 p.m.\n\nNo parking on Ocean Avenue with the exception of the handicap spots.\n\nSitting or congregating on the boardwalk is prohibited.\n\nWalking or running is allowed and bicycle riding will be allowed before 9 AM.\n\nBeach badge price: Daily Badges only sold on line starting on May 23 with a limited number available.\n\nSeason Badges $95\n\nSenior Citizens Badges (65 & over) $50\n\nYoung Adult (ages 12 through 18) $50\n\nDaily Badges $10\n\nAge 11 and under; no charge\n\nBadges can only be paid for with cash or by check; to pay by check, valid driver's license required.

Mike Dunleavy’s plans for $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid. Many Legislative Budget and Audit Committee members said Monday that getting the money out was more important than haggling over legal authority for the spending, KTOO Public Media reports. The committee, made up of House and Senate members, previously agreed to Dunleavy’s plans for about $125 million, a fraction of his total request, while working through remaining items. Big-ticket items addressed Monday involved $586.6 million for communities, $290 million for small-business assistance and $100 million for fisheries. State law allows a governor to submit to the committee plans to accept and spend additional federal or other program funds on a budget item. It delays for 45 days use of the funds unless the committee earlier agrees.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey said Tuesday that he’ll let gyms and public swimming pools reopen and will allow his stay-at-home order to expire this Friday as he continues easing the painful restrictions he imposed on businesses and individuals to tamp down the coronavirus outbreak. Gyms and pools, among the last remaining facilities that have not been allowed to operate, were permitted to open their doors Wednesday if they follow recommendations from health officials. The governor also invited professional sports to resume without fans. He warned, however, that lifting the restrictions does not mean a return to a normal way of life from before the pandemic, and he said social distancing is still important. “This is not a green light to speed,” Ducey said. “This is a green light to proceed, and we’re going to proceed with caution.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state has ordered a large theater to abandon its plans to defy coronavirus restrictions on gatherings by holding what could be the nation’s first major concert this far into the pandemic. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday that the state Health Department was sending a cease-and-desist letter to the Fort Smith venue, TempleLive, to postpone or cancel a concert Friday night by country rock singer Travis McCready. The event, expected to draw more than 200 people, would be held three days before Arkansas allows large indoor entertainment venues to reopen. “You can’t just arbitrarily decide when the restrictions are lifted. That is something that is done based upon a public health requirement,” Hutchinson told reporters. The state is allowing theaters, arenas and other entertainment venues to open Monday, but with audience limits. TempleLive did not immediately respond to messages Tuesday afternoon.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County reopened its beaches Wednesday in the latest cautious easing of coronavirus restrictions that have closed most of the state’s public spaces and businesses for nearly two months. County beaches and many city-owned beaches along the 75 miles of coastline are open only for “active recreation,” such as walking, swimming and surfing. Sunbathing, picnicking and group sports such as volleyball are still banned, and strangers must stay well apart. Visitors also must wear masks when they’re out of the water. Some mayors warned that the state or county could close the beaches again if people disobey the restrictions and crowd the shoreline. “Please, hit the beach, do your thing, and leave. No hanging out for this first phase,” Redondo Beach Mayor Bill Brand urged in a Facebook post.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: The Weld County jail violated inmates’ constitutional rights in the way it handled the coronavirus, a judge ruled. Judge Philip Brimmer found Monday that Sheriff Steve Reams failed to take adequate measures to protect inmates and that they are entitled to a limited preliminary injunction so the jail can “ameliorate those conditions,” the Greeley Tribune reports. The American Civil Liberties Union had filed a lawsuit on behalf of several inmates who considered themselves to be in the high-risk category for COVID-19. The coronavirus first reached inside the jail in mid-March, court officials said. Reams has not instituted any specific precautions to protect medically vulnerable inmates, Brimmer concluded. He ordered Reams to take several steps, including instituting new policies inside the jail to curtail the spread of the coronavirus and compiling a list of medically vulnerable inmates currently held at the jail.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont made an example of himself Tuesday, getting screened for the coronavirus as the state looks to significantly increase testing before it begins the planned reopening of the economy May 20. The governor, who did not immediately receive his test results, said the state has increased testing from about 18,000 per week two weeks ago to about 29,000 per week. He expects more than 42,000 tests will be conducted next week, giving the state a much better idea of how the virus has spread in the community. “I am out there encouraging people to get tested right now,” Lamont said. “I don’t want to see this hesitancy. I don’t want to hear people say, ‘Not for me; I’m worried about the possibility of a quarantine. I don’t want to hear what is going on.’ ” He said the state is moving to quickly test all residents and workers at nursing homes and significantly ramp up testing in prisons and among first responders.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state plans to hire about 200 workers to help trace the contacts of those who test positive for the coronavirus, state officials announced. Delaware was set to partner with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago to build the new statewide contact tracing program, Gov. John Carney said in a statement Tuesday. “This contact tracing program brings us one step closer to returning Delaware to a new normal,” he said. Those who test positive for the virus would receive a call from a case investigator who would ask the patient for a list of their known contacts, according to the plan. Tracers would then then reach out to those contacts to help them quarantine and arrange resources, as well as get tested for the virus in some cases. The National Opinion Research Center also partnered with Maryland, and the two states agreed to share information to monitor the virus’s spread across state lines, officials said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser has extended D.C.’s stay-at-home order for an additional three weeks until June 8, WUSA-TV reports. Originally, the order was set to expire May 15. Nonessential businesses are to remain closed until June 8, and mass gatherings are still banned in D.C. Bowser said infections have not declined enough to start officially reopening the capital, although new cases in the district have declined over the past four days. In order for the first phase of reopening to start, two weeks of that decline is expected. DC’s doubling time – the time it takes for total cases to double – has also slowed to more than a month for the first time. It’s a sign of the spread of infection slowing. “Our message remains the same: Stay home,” Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: After being shuttered for almost two months, Universal Orlando plans to allow the reopening of some restaurants and shops on a limited basis in the theme park resort’s entertainment district this week, company officials said Tuesday. About a half-dozen restaurants and eateries, as well as two retail shops and some merchandise carts, will reopen at Universal Orlando Citywalk on Thursday in a sign of the baby steps the city’s theme parks are taking to get back to business after they closed in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Next week, Walt Disney World will allow some third-party shops and restaurants in its Disney Springs entertainment district to reopen. Workers and guests will be required to wear face masks. Per state rules, indoor capacity will be limited to 25%, and dining tables outside must be more than 6 feet apart. Neither Disney World nor Universal officials have said when theme parks and hotels will reopen.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgians may be spending a lot of time at home, but it’s not stopping them from playing the state lottery. Lottery sales set a monthly record in April after dropping in March, said Brad Bohannon, the Georgia Lottery Corp.’s vice president for government relations. “While most other forms of entertainment were limited, April sales rebounded extremely well,” Bohannon told the state House Higher Education Committee on Tuesday. That’s continuing in May, with Bohannon saying two of the five highest sales weeks in lottery history have come this month. He credited much of the increase to a 50% jump in use of the lottery’s online options, which allow people to buy tickets and play dozens of online gambling games at home. Proceeds from the lottery finance college aid called Hope Scholarships and preschool classes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Health on Tuesday asked lawmakers to appropriate about $2.5 million to fund a program at the University of Hawaii that would train workers to track contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19. State epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park said the department hopes this training will begin in the next month. She said the goal was to have the program train a total of 200 workers in two phases. With the help of a cellphone app that people can use to report their health condition to contact tracers and the more traditional method of making phone calls, each worker would be capable of tracking about 20 people per day. Altogether they would be able to track 4,000 people. Graduates of the program would join the Medical Reserve Corps and be available to augment staff contact tracers as the need arises.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Authorities have approved a plan to prevent giant rangeland wildfires in southwestern Idaho by clearing vegetation along 435 miles of roads to create fuel breaks. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the work for the Idaho portion of the Tri-state Fuel Breaks Project that also includes breaks in southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada. The area contains sagebrush steppe that is key habitat for sage grouse and other wildlife on land also used by cattle ranchers and outdoor enthusiasts. The Idaho fuel breaks protect 2,500 square miles by creating 200-foot buffers on each side of roads. That adds up to about 32 square miles of cleared vegetation in Idaho. The two-phase plan is to put in fuel breaks on more heavily traveled Idaho routes and follow that up with breaks on interior routes, giving the area a jigsaw puzzle appearance. In theory, one piece of the puzzle might burn, but the fuel breaks would aid firefighters in preventing an adjacent piece from catching fire.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state reported a one-day record high in COVID-19 cases Tuesday and its next-to-highest death toll, just a day after Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced that the peak in coronavirus infections originally projected for late April has been pushed into mid-June. The governor noted that the 4,014 new cases reported – nearly 900 more than the previous high May 1 – should come as no surprise given that the state received test results on more than 29,000 people in 24 hours, which is thousands more than in previous days. Testing availability, which continues to grow in Illinois, is key to tracking the disease and resuming a sidelined economy. The Democrat called on lawmakers – who have been kept from the Capitol by coronavirus restrictions since early March – to act “expeditiously” to put together a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and compile aid packages for those struggling financially. The Illinois House will convene for three days next week.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s gas and electric companies are asking regulators to allow them to recover lost revenue from customers due to the pandemic, but critics argue that it would burden struggling consumers even more. Ten companies, including Indianapolis Power & Light Co. and Duke Energy Inc., filed the request Friday with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. They want to charge customers for all “bad debt expense incurred” associated with an executive order that has suspended disconnections for nonpayment through June 4. Building closures across the state have caused an overall downturn in energy use, thus putting a financial strain on energy companies, the petitioners said. Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, a consumer group, called the request “unprecedented utility greed.” Essentially, utilities want to charge customers for energy that they did not sell, said Kerwin Olson, the group’s executive director.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Restaurants, salons, barbershops and gyms will be allowed to reopen Friday under new restrictions intended to slow the coronavirus, the governor announced. Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday that she would lift an order closing restaurants in 22 counties, including the state’s largest metropolitan areas. Reynolds said she would also allow fitness centers, salons, barbershops, tattoo parlors and massage therapists to reopen in all 99 counties. The move came as deaths from the virus in Iowa surged for the second straight day, surpassing 300 since the beginning of the pandemic. It also came as Reynolds and the state’s medical director self-isolated after potentially being exposed to the virus at the White House last week. Reynolds said she felt confident reopening more of Iowa’s economy because the state has enough hospital beds and ventilators to treat patients, and its testing capacity has increased.\n\nKansas\n\nHolton: A meatpacking plant has shut down after five employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The shutdown at the Johnsonville plant in Holton took effect Wednesday, WIBW reports. “It’s a tough decision to halt production, but we appreciate Johnsonville for doing this to help us stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Angie Reith, Jackson County Health Officer. Johnsonville said all employees will continue to get paid, and downtime will be used to implement even more aggressive safety protocols before reopening. Some new safety protocols include placing additional barriers between workstations where social distancing is not possible. Meanwhile, counties in southwest Kansas with plants continue to deal with outbreaks among employees. Ford, Seward and Finney counties together had more than 2,700 cases as of Monday, or 38% of the state’s total. They had the highest rates of cases per 1,000 residents in the state.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky Derby Museum announced it will donate more than $10,000 of its proceeds from online merchandise sales to coronavirus relief efforts in the state. The donations will go toward Gov. Andy Beshear’s Team Kentucky Fund and the One Louisville COVID-19 Response Fund, the museum said Tuesday in a Facebook post. After the 146th Kentucky Derby was postponed from May 2 to Labor Day weekend, the museum pledged last month to donate 20% of online sales from collectible merchandise with the original race date of May 2 to funds that help people who have been financially affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “Customers realized it was a great opportunity to purchase collectible Derby 146 merchandise while supporting a great cause,” Patrick Armstrong, president and CEO of the museum, said in a statement. The museum’s gift shop will reopen May 20 under state health guidelines, museum officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Dining in restaurants can resume in the city beginning Saturday – with reservations. Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Tuesday announced a loosening of restrictions on businesses adopted to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. Restaurants, which have been limited to take-out orders in New Orleans, will be able to provide outside table service, as well as dine-in service at 25% capacity. But diners will have to make reservations. Walk-in diners will be allowed to enter, but they will have to provide a name and number for an on-the-spot reservation. The information will have to be kept by the restaurant for 21 days to aid in contact tracing if needed. “We know keeping the data will matter,” Cantrell said. Zoos, museums and aquariums will also be limited to 25% capacity and will have to stagger admission by using a reservation system. Retailers can open if they have exterior entrances and maintain social distancing.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state Department of Health and Human Services is promoting affordable insurance options for residents who’ve lost health care coverage during the pandemic. Maine residents who’ve lost a job may also have lost their employer-provided health insurance. Many may qualify for a free or low-cost plan through MaineCare or the federal marketplace, the DHHS said. A state website, CoverME.gov, provides a resource for health insurance options. Eligible Maine people may enroll in MaineCare at any time of year. Maine DHHS is also collaborating with the Maine Department of Labor to inform those applying for unemployment insurance that they may be eligible for affordable health insurance options.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Residents used words like “soul-crushing” and “hell” to describe their experiences seeking unemployment benefits via a state website, testifying Tuesday during an online hearing with state lawmakers. More than 1,100 people signed up to testify before leaders of two Maryland Senate committees, which scheduled hours to hear from the first 270 who signed up to testify. A common complaint was the inability to reach someone for help using the website. “You can call thousands and thousands of times and be unable to get through,” said Beth Bell, who was laid off in mid-March. “If you do get through to one of them, you’ll end up in a circle and then get disconnected. It’s soul-crushing.” Others spoke of spending hours over several weeks trying to get through to someone for help. Bliss Martin said someone finally got back to her to help Monday, after she started sending emails about two weeks ago.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterans home that’s been the site of one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the nation will undergo a management overhaul, and going forward it will operate with fewer residents and new safety protocols, according to state officials. About $2 million in improvements are also being made to the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke to make it safer, Daniel Tsai, deputy secretary of the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said Tuesday at a meeting of the home’s trustees. “We have been in quite a bit of a gauntlet, but we are not in the clear,” Tsai told Masslive.com. As of Tuesday, 74 residents of the long-term care facility for elderly and ill veterans who have recently died tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to state officials. Another 87 residents have tested positive. Several state and federal investigations into the deaths are underway.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Officials said Wednesday that 31,000, or nearly two-thirds, of state employees will take temporary layoff days through late July as the state confronts a budget shortfall amid the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the state will participate in a federal “work-share” program, allowing employees to work fewer hours but collect partial unemployment benefits to make up a portion of their lost wages. The furloughs – two layoff days per two-week pay period for non-managers – will start this Sunday and go through July 25. Higher-level managers will not be part of the work-share program but will take one layoff day every other pay period – a 5% pay cut. The move will save the state up to $80 million. The layoffs will not affect state troopers, prison guards and others working on the front lines.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has signed six bills into law as the regular session of the Legislature winds down toward its adjournment date Monday. One of the bills he signed Tuesday extended a state COVID-19 relief fund that expired this week. Another allows the state to tap $17 million in federal election security funds. A third requires prescription drug manufacturers to make information public for large price increases. The elections bill includes preparations for increased absentee voting, switching some polling places to safer locations, and public outreach for implementing social distancing guidelines related to voting. But it doesn’t include a wholesale switch to mail-in voting for the August primary and November general elections, as Walz and other Democrats had sought. Republicans blocked that idea. Walz spokesman Teddy Tschann told the Star Tribune the governor is still looking at other options to make it easier to vote by mail, given that a second wave of COVID-19 could hit during the fall election season.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he is tightening regulations in parts of the state seeing the fastest spread of the new coronavirus. The target area is seven largely rural counties in the east-central part of the state: Attala, Leake, Scott, Jasper, Neshoba, Newton and Lauderdale. While Reeves previously suggested people wear masks in public, his new executive order makes that mandatory in some situations in the seven counties. In addition, businesses are required to screen employees for COVID-19 symptoms at the start of each shift, to provide hand sanitizer and to ensure employees remain at least 6 feet apart wherever possible. Reeves announced the new restrictions even as he has spent the past several days lifting some statewide limits by allowing the reopening of restaurants, barbershops, hair salons and gyms; those establishments must limit customers and take other precautions.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The numbers of confirmed cases and deaths from the coronavirus in the state both reached somber milestones Tuesday: Cases topped 10,000, and the number of deaths exceeded 500. The state health department reported 88 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 10,006. Thirty-six new deaths were reported. Since March, 524 people in Missouri have died from the virus. St. Louis continues to be the hardest-hit region. State data shows that 53.4% of confirmed cases and 70.4% of deaths have occurred in St. Louis city and county combined. Nearly three dozen inmates at an eastern Missouri jail have tested positive for the coronavirus, along with five members of the jail staff. And the Southeast Correctional Center in Charleston has reported 43 prisoners and 14 staff have tested positive for the virus.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Actor Jeff Bridges is starring in a COVID-19 public service campaign urging Montanans to remain vigilant against the coronavirus threat as the state eases restrictions, the Montana Hospital Association said Tuesday. The association launched “Stay the Course, Montana,” in which Bridges, a part-time Montana resident, encourages residents to keep up social distancing and to wear a face cloth covering whenever in public. It is sponsored in part by the Murdock Charitable Trust. Bridges makes a brief reference to his character “The Dude” from the 1998 film “The Big Lebowski” when he says, “We can abide with this thing, man. We’ll get through this.” The commercials will be seen on TV, radio and digital media and will direct people to a new website, StaytheCourseMontana.com, which has tips on staying healthy, what to do if you’re sick, information about testing, how the public can help through donations and volunteer efforts, and more.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: Nebraska State Fair officials are still planning to hold the 11-day event in Grand Island later this summer, according to a release from the fair’s interim director. Interim director Jaime Parr said the event starting Aug. 28 and running through Sept. 7 is still on, as is its Aksarben Stock Show set to rup from Sept. 24-27. “State Fair staff and Board are mindful of and monitoring the current COVID-19 impact to events and social gatherings,” Parr said. But plans to hold the fair could still change if the outbreak worsens, she said. Parr said that officials are assessing options should they become necessary and that staff recently met to begin looking at contingency scenarios.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The casino workers’ Culinary Union held a protest drive up the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday evening to call for casino companies to release their reopening plans and to adopt the union’s recommended safety protocols. The union has called for casinos to publicly release the detailed plans they are submitting to gambling regulators laying out how they plan to safely reopen when Nevada allows it. Gov. Steve Sisolak shuttered the properties in mid-March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The governor said he’s allowing the Nevada Gaming Control Board to have the final say on when casinos can reopen. The union wants more extensive proposals, including testing staff for COVID-19 and screening people, including guests, with temperature checks upon entry. And the group has called for the regulators or elected officials to release all other casino plans and to include the union’s proposed rules as part of any reopening plan.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A panel tasked with reopening the state’s economy amid the easing threat from the coronavirus pandemic agreed Tuesday on proposals for seven sectors, among them lodging, outdoor attractions and gyms. The recommendations won’t be final until public health officials and Gov. Chris Sununu give their OK. The task force unanimously recommended that hotels be limited to half their capacity, though the limit would not apply to motels with outdoor access to rooms or to inns and bed-and-breakfasts with 10 or fewer rooms. Face masks would be required for staffers and are recommended for guests, who would be asked at check-in about any possible exposure to the coronavirus. A reopening date of May 22 is recommended for lodging, but target dates for other sectors were not included.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nonessential businesses, shuttered because of the coronavirus outbreak, will open next week for curbside pickup, as will nonessential construction, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. Curbside pickup at businesses – like retail stores – and nonessential construction can start at 6 a.m. Monday under an executive order Murphy said he will sign. The state’s COVID-19 trends are headed in the right direction, he said, leading him to relax the nearly two-month-old business shutdown. Over the past two weeks, newly hospitalized people are down 28%, patients in hospitals are down 34%, and people in intensive care and on ventilators are down about 30%. Still, the state has higher hospitalization rates, positive cases and deaths per 100,000 people than any other state right now, Murphy said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is giving the green light for nonessential businesses including retailers and many services to reopen Saturday at limited capacity, while ordering that face masks be worn in public with few exceptions to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a news videoconference Wednesday that a new public health order will allow businesses to reopen at 25% of building occupancy limits. Large retailers can attend to 20% of maximum capacity set under fire safety regulations. New Mexico health officials cautioned that infections among children are surging, complicating efforts to reopen the economy and provide summer recreation programs. Lujan Grisham referred to children as potential “super-spreaders” of COVID-19. Strict limits on nonessential business will remain in place in northwestern New Mexico, which includes a portion of the vast Navajo Nation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A fourth region of upstate New York has met the criteria to gradually restart its economic activity as the state prepares to slowly relax its pandemic-induced social restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. The North Country, a sprawling, rural swath that includes the Adirondack Mountains, met all seven benchmarks the state requires before selected businesses can be approved for reopening, according to the administration. New York’s Southern Tier, the Mohawk Valley and the Finger Lakes previously met the standards, and regions are preparing to reopen in phases as early as Friday. New York’s 10 regions can start reopening once they demonstrate that COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalizations are down; that there are enough hospital beds to meet any new surge in cases; and that there is sufficient local testing and contact-tracing efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Hundreds of state prisoners with COVID-19 are now deemed to have recovered based on government health guidelines. The state Department of Public Safety calculated that more than 500 of the over 640 offenders testing positive for the new coronavirus meet criteria to be released from medical isolation. Most of the prisoners presumed recovered are housed at the Neuse Correctional Institution, which underwent prisonwide testing four weeks ago. There have been 467 positive tests among inmates at Neuse. Five prisoners statewide have died from COVID-19-related illness. “We are not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot,” Commissioner of Prisons Todd Ishee said in a news release this week, pointing to efforts to clean prisons, isolate the sick and limit prisoner movement. “We must remain vigilant.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s most populous county has recorded a daily high number of positive tests for the coronavirus, state health officials said Wednesday. Testing from Tuesday showed 69 cases in of COVID-19 in Cass County, which includes Fargo. The county reported two deaths, both women in their 90s with with underlying health conditions. Cass County reported 60 positive cases in the two previous days combined. There were a total of 76 cases reported statewide from Tuesday, the highest number since a mass testing event last month for LM Wind Power employees and others in Grand Forks. It increased the total number of positive tests in North Dakota to 1,647. The state tested about 1,100 people Tuesday, for a daily positive test rate of about 7%. That compares to 6.5% from Monday, when more than 2,100 people were tested. There have been 40 deaths in North Dakota; 37 people are currently hospitalized.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: After weeks of waiting, self-employed workers can apply for unemployment approved by the federal stimulus package. Ohio Department of Job and Family Services started accepting applications from self-employed workers, 1099 tax filers and part-time workers Tuesday. The first payments will go out this weekend, Director Kimberly Hall said Wednesday. About 210,000 Ohioans who preregistered for benefits received an email Tuesday informing them that they could apply for benefits. As of Wednesday morning, 84,000 people had submitted claims, and 15,000 had been approved for payment, Hall said. All benefits are retroactive to the date a person lost their job because of the novel coronavirus, as far back as Feb. 2. The additional $600 per week is available from March 29 through July 25.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Collections to the state’s main government operating fund missed projections by 44% last month, the biggest shortfall in modern history, state finance officials said Tuesday. Postponing the income tax deadline from April to July, plummeting energy prices and the coronavirus-related shutdown of businesses across the state amounted to a “threefold economic gut punch,” said Office of Management and Enterprise Services Director Steve Harpe. “Missing this month’s estimate is not a surprise, but the magnitude is notable,” he said. Overall collections to the state’s general fund in April totaled $529 million, which is 44% below the monthly estimate. Total collections to the fund through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year were about 8.5% below the estimate, Harpe reported. April is historically the month with the largest revenue collections.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland Parks and Recreation will not open seasonal public swimming pools this summer and is canceling all camps and activities because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Tuesday. Parks, trails and nature areas remain open, and park greeters will be there “to make sure people know how to use their park system safely during the pandemic,” The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. But other programs on which families rely – including outdoor camps, Summer Free For All and the Portland World Soccer Tournament – are canceled. Portland Parks and Recreation Director Adena Long said in a statement Tuesday that the department will focus its efforts this summer on urgent community needs, including the Lunch + Play program, which provides free lunch to Portland kids all summer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Beaver County is among the counties planning to defy Gov. Tom Wolf, advising residents that it will operate under the looser coronavirus restrictions being allowed elsewhere in the state, an official said Wednesday. Beaver County, home to a severe outbreak in a large nursing home, is the only western Pennsylvania county where the Democratic governor has not lifted his tightest restrictions on residents leaving their homes and businesses that can operate. Wolf tapped 13 counties in the region, including the Pittsburgh area, to see relief from his tightest pandemic restrictions starting Friday, joining 24 other counties across northern Pennsylvania that began emerging last week. Dissatisfied, a growing number of Republican-controlled counties have vowed in recent days to join them, leading Wolf to threaten to block them from receiving pandemic aid.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has canceled all its study abroad programs for the upcoming fall semester in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the school announced Wednesday. “Given the uncertain nature of the global health crisis’s continued effects on both public health and on travel between countries, Brown has made the difficult decision to cancel all university-sponsored undergraduate study abroad for fall 2020,” the Ivy League university’s Office of International Programs posted on the school website. The office said it remains optimistic about its ability to offer study abroad programs in the spring 2021 semester, but the final decision has not been made. The Providence-based school is working on a plan to bring students back to campus this fall and expects to announce a decision by July 15.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate rebuked Gov. Henry McMaster for part of his coronavirus response, saying he should have gotten permission from lawmakers to continue the state of emergency for the pandemic over two months. The resolution rapping McMaster’s knuckles Tuesday was the last order of business on what appeared to be the last day of a regular session during which lawmakers had only met two days in the past two months. Every Democrat in the chamber sided with the Republican governor, and McMaster signed another 15-day state-of-emergency order Tuesday as the Senate met. None of the senators directly criticized McMaster’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. They did reject a proposal to call for the governor to immediately end any restrictions on businesses because of the coronavirus and not issue any more stay-at-home orders or rules closing businesses.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday held off her threat to sue Native American tribes that have set up highway checkpoints intended to keep the coronavirus away from their reservations, saying instead that she would like to work out an agreement. The Republican governor gave two tribes – the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux Tribe – 48 hours from Friday afternoon to remove checkpoints from state and federal highways or face a lawsuit. She said her office has been getting complaints that the checkpoints have caused a headache for people trying to enter the reservations for ranching or store deliveries. But the tribes kept the checkpoints, citing the threat of the virus, combined with their vulnerable populations and poor medical facilities, as urgent reasons to control access. Noem described the conflict as a “sticky situation” among federal, state and tribal authorities.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Fear of contracting the coronavirus doesn’t meet medical criteria for voting by mail, state officials said Tuesday. The determination comes as the state recommends preparations as though all 1.4 million registered voters 60 and older will cast mail-in ballots in the August primary within its pandemic election contingency plan. The document was prepared by the state Division of Elections, dated April 23, and obtained by the Associated Press. “In consultation with the Attorney General’s office the fear of getting ill does not fall under the definition of ill,” Elections Coordinator Mark Goins told the AP in a statement Tuesday about the viral outbreak. Republican Gov. Bill Lee swiftly backed the interpretation of the state elections coordinator, telling reporters that “what we want to do in this state is remove a reason to have fear about going to the polling booths.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state will begin widespread coronavirus testing in prisons where at least 30 people have died, officials announced Tuesday, and Houston will furlough about 3,000 workers as the economic shutdown and unsteady oil prices wallop the nation’s fourth-largest city. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also said he tested negative for the virus after his visit last week to the White House came on the same day that a valet to President Donald Trump tested positive. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced that tens of thousands of COVID-19 tests are on the way to the state’s prisons, where inmates have tested positive at a dramatically higher rate than the rest of Texas. The tests are designed to be self-administered, and a dozen “strike teams” are receiving training this week, agency spokesman Jeremy Desel said. More than 1,700 prison inmates have tested positive, according to the agency.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Zion National Park reopened its gates Wednesday after an extended closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a set of restrictions in place to encourage social distancing. Limited operations were scheduled at the park, with the gates only open during daylight hours and the usual visitor shuttle system still closed. Multiple trail closures remained in effect, including popular attractions like The Narrows and the top section of Angels Landing. The park was closed for more than a month after Utah implemented restrictions limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer people. Tourism-reliant businesses in the gateway town of Springdale struggled with the steep drop in visitors. A reported 75% of Springdale hotel room reservations being canceled in April and May, according to a presentation from the county’s tourism office earlier this month.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is now offering free testing for the virus that causes COVID-19 to anyone who wants one, even people without symptoms, the Vermont Health Department announced. No referral from a health care provider is needed, although people are asked to make appointments in advance, the state said in a news release issued late Tuesday. State officials are scheduling a series of pop-up clinics where people can be tested as part of a broader effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Vermont officials say the state has one of the lowest rates of growth in people infected with the virus, and few people are showing symptoms, which means they are not requesting tests. Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine has said the state has ample testing supplies, and there is not a lot of demand for testing.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam rejected a call Tuesday from several top GOP lawmakers to institute a moratorium on the release of certain inmates by the Virginia Parole Board, which has come under criticism for some recent decisions. The request from the lawmakers, including the House and Senate minority leaders, came a day after state officials disclosed that Virginia’s government watchdog is conducting an administrative investigation into the board’s decision to grant parole to a man who has served decades of a life sentence for the killing of an on-duty Richmond police officer. Northam’s spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky, said in a statement that the governor “rejects” the Republicans’ proposal. “The Governor and his administration have worked tirelessly to create a fairer and more equitable criminal justice system, and safe parole is an important part of that work,” she wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: More than 1,300 people in the state have been trained and are ready to work with local health departments to do contact tracing once a case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in a county. At a news conference Tuesday, Gov. Jay Inslee said that of those already trained, 351 are from the National Guard, 390 are from the Department of Licensing, and 630 are state or local health professionals. He said that number could be expanded even more in the coming weeks. Inslee said that while the social distancing efforts that have been in place since March have been frustrating, they have been “significantly effective.” “Now as we attempt to transition to open back up our economy, we are simultaneously moving to this second initiative of testing, contact tracing and isolation,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Wednesday widened the most aggressive phase of his coronavirus reopening strategy to allow tanning salons to open just before Memorial Day weekend. The Republican governor said he has been overwhelmed with requests from tanning businesses to be included among the restaurants, big-box stores and recreational services reopening next week. “I never dreamed in all my life that we’ve gotten all these calls in regard to the tanning businesses or tanning beds. We continue to get all kinds of calls,” he said, adding that health officials now think it’s safe for people to tan. Justice has picked May 21, the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend, to stage the biggest step in his reopening plan, while warning that a second wave of the virus could cause catastrophic damage to the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The owner of a Christian-based children’s hair salon has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order that closed nonessential businesses is a violation of free speech and religious rights. The lawsuit filed Tuesday is the third legal challenge to the order issued by the Democratic governor that runs until May 26. Two other lawsuits are pending in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. One was brought by Republican lawmakers alleging that Evers’ health secretary exceeded her authority in issuing the order. The other was brought by two men who argue Evers’ policies interfere with their free speech and religious rights. The third lawsuit was filed by Jessica Netzel, the owner of Kingdom Kuts in Appleton. Netzel asked U.S. District Judge William Griesbach to lift the order and allow her hair salon to be treated like businesses that Evers has deemed essential.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Access to the southern half of Yellowstone National Park will resume Monday by way of Wyoming, but park officials continue to talk with Montana officials about reopening the rest of the park after a seven-week closure due to the coronavirus, Superintendent Cam Sholly said Wednesday. The partial reopening comes as other national parks begin or prepare to raise their gates at the urging of President Donald Trump. Complicating Yellowstone’s reopening, Wyoming recently lifted a 14-day self-quarantine order for out-of-state visitors on nonessential business, but one remains in Montana. Sholly nonetheless described Yellowstone’s split approach as a good way to help rangers get ready for a new visitor experience that will discourage shoulder-to-shoulder crowding at thermal features – summer scenes common in Yellowstone. “I would prefer it’s not just a light switch and the park is open and we get inundated and overwhelmed and aren’t able to handle it,” Sholly said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/01/mink-worries-rumor-patrol-paused-reopenings-news-around-states/112048654/", "title": "Mink worries, rumor patrol: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Space Camp has resumed at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center after shutting down because of the coronavirus pandemic. A scaled-back version of the popular program resumed Sunday as students arrived for a week of hands-on lessons and activities related to space travel, WHNT-TV reports. Fewer campers than normal will be present, and workers have adjusted some of the activities to reduce the chance of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. The state-owned space museum that operates Space Camp also has reopened with limited attendance rules, physical distancing and additional cleaning procedures. The museum closed some activities where it wasn’t possible for visitors to stay apart.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city attorney said Monday that a memo from Alaska Attorney General Kevin Clarkson, exempting state buildings from a city mask order meant to guard against the coronavirus, “unnecessarily risks” the health of residents who work for or do business with state agencies. Clarkson’s memo “sows confusion” and provides “inaccurate legal advice,” Kate Vogel, municipal attorney for Anchorage, said in a statement. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz signed an order Friday requiring face coverings in certain indoor public settings, such as stores, restaurants, public transit and communal office areas where people from multiple households are present. Vogel said under state law, a home rule municipality “possesses all legislative authority not withheld by the legislature.” The Alaska Legislature hasn’t restricted Anchorage from issuing mask mandates and hasn’t exempted state buildings “from generally applicable local health and safety rules,” she said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The governor ordered bars, nightclubs and water parks to close again for at least a month starting Monday night – a dramatic about-face as coronavirus cases surge in the Sunbelt. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey also ordered public schools to delay the start of the classes at least until Aug. 17. Many districts planned to start the school year in late July or early August. Both orders can be extended. Arizona emerged from a stay-at-home order in mid-May, but infections have since begun spiking. On Sunday, it reported 3,858 more confirmed coronavirus cases, the most in a single day for state and the seventh time in recent days that the daily toll surpassed the 3,000 mark. While Ducey has urged Arizonans to keep their distance from one another in public, he refused to issue a statewide order to wear masks and until recently resisted calls by some cities to allow them to require masks.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s confirmed coronavirus cases now exceed 20,000 people, health officials said Monday as they announced an additional death from the illness caused by the virus. Arkansas’ confirmed virus cases have been steadily increasing since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen. The number of active cases in the state have increased more than 256% since Memorial Day, while the number of people hospitalized has tripled in that same time period. Monday’s increase in confirmed cases was lower than what Arkansas has seen in recent days, but Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was concerned by images shared on social media of people not following social distancing or mask guidelines. “Not everyone behaved well over the weekend,” he said. “It’ll take a few days to see if there’s any result from that. We hope not.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Nearly three-quarters of the state’s 40 million residents live in counties experiencing concerning coronavirus trends, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday in vowing stepped-up enforcement of health orders and, if things don’t improve, more restrictions. His comments came a day after he ordered bars to close in Los Angeles and six other counties and suggested eight other counties do the same on their own. By Monday afternoon, three of the state’s largest – San Diego, Riverside and Sacramento – said they would voluntarily close bars to slow the spread of the virus. San Diego, California’s second-most-populous county, acted even though unlike the others it is not on a state watch list for counties with the most concerning COVID-19 trends. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County, home to 10 million people, hit a one-day record of 2,903 confirmed cases and more than 100,000 overall.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Despite the state’s go-ahead for outdoor swimming pools to reopen, Fort Collins’ City Park Pool will remain closed for the rest of the summer, according to a Monday announcement. City Park Pool, Mulberry Pool and the Senior Center Pool will not reopen in the summer months because of “current operational, financial and public health considerations,” a city news release said. Under state guidance released last month, outdoor swimming pools were allowed to reopen at 50% capacity or up to 50 people, whichever is fewer. Splash pads at Spring Canyon Park and Fossil Creek Park will reopen next week, however, joining the Old Town Square splash pad that reopened last week. They will remain open through Labor Day. Signage at the splash pads will indicate how many people will be allowed to play there at a time.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday that he’s watching the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in other parts of the country and considering whether to possibly delay Connecticut’s third phase of reopening. Indoor private gatherings capped at 50 people, outdoor private gatherings up to 250 people and outdoor event venues, such as amphitheaters and race tracks at 50% capacity, are all scheduled to be allowed sometime in mid-July. Meanwhile, bars and nightclubs remain shuttered, as well as large indoor event spaces. The governor said Connecticut’s ultimate decision on what to reopen this month will likely be in cooperation with surrounding states. “Overwhelmingly, our state tends to walk in parallel with some of our neighbors,” Lamont said. “So I think you’ll find them aligned.” The administration has been considering allowing bars to reopen in mid-July, said Lamont, who acknowledged he’s now “rethinking that.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: Three Rehoboth Beach lifeguards have tested positive for the coronavirus, the town’s Police Department said Monday afternoon. “We believe at this time there was very little contact with the public,” Rehoboth Police Chief Keith Banks said. “We immediately executed our COVID response protocol and contacted the local health department. All lifeguards were notified of the exposure and will be tested within the next 24 hours.” The lifeguards were asymptomatic, according to the statement, and “are staying home until medically cleared to return to work.” The development should not come as a surprise, given the recent spike in coronavirus cases at the Delaware beaches. Some beach restaurants are limiting and even closing their operations due to an outbreak of new coronavirus cases in the resort area.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is urging residents to stay safe, stay at home and “choose activities wisely” during the Fourth of July as the district remains in a public health emergency, WUSA-TV reports. Large gatherings are still considered a high-risk activity, and leaders are encouraging residents to seek guidance for hosting gatherings and attending events on the city website. For people hosting gatherings, they should enforce social distancing and not invite more people than they have space for, Bowser said. People need to be responsible and tell their guests that if they are not feeling well, they should not attend the event. City guidance suggests that people hosting gatherings should have a guest list in case of contact tracing, limit the use of shared items, use proper hygiene and consider providing cleaning supplies for guests. Bowser said outdoor activities are preferred over indoor ones.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis slashed $1 billion from the state budget lawmakers approved in March, including some of his own priorities. He said after signing the spending plan Monday that the drop in revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic forced him to make difficult choices. The state budget for the fiscal year that begins Wednesday will now total $92.2 billion. DeSantis mostly talked about what was preserved in the budget, including $500 million in pay raises for teachers, a 3% raise for state workers, $625 million for Everglades restoration and other water quality projects, and a boost in spending for child welfare. He said he vetoed $550 million of his own priorities, including $20 million for a job growth grant fund. “I want it, but at the same time, sometimes things need to be put on pause,” DeSantis said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The mayor said Tuesday that he’s ordering people to wear masks inside retail shops, grocery stores and other public places – and those who refuse could face $500 fines. “Frankly and honestly, I do not believe that we have any other choice,” Mayor Van Johnson told a news conference, warning that “COVID-19 cases are spiking in our community.” A city of 145,000 that depends on tourism, Savannah appears to be the first city in Georgia to make wearing masks mandatory. Some Georgia cities have moved to require face coverings inside government buildings, said Larry Hanson, executive director of the Georgia Municipal Association. But Savannah is the first of which he’s aware to extend that requirement to public businesses, he said. Gov. Brian Kemp’s executive orders have largely prohibited local governments from setting coronavirus restrictions that go beyond those imposed by the state, which has aggressively reopened its economy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As other counties in the state prepare to loosen restrictions on vacation rentals in anticipation of the reopening of trans-Pacific tourism, Oahu rentals remain under health restrictions imposed at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell’s emergency orders prohibit Oahu’s vacation rentals from operating as essential businesses, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Illegal rentals remain a problem on Oahu,” said Caldwell, who wants to determine the impact of modifying quarantine rules for visitors from outside the state before agreeing to lift the rental restriction. The mayors of Kauai, the Big Island and Maui temporarily shuttered vacation rentals because of the pandemic. But they began allowing legal vacation rentals to reopen June 16 for guests who no longer have to undergo quarantine. The timing coincided with Democratic Gov. David Ige lifting a mandatory 14-day quarantine for interisland passengers.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State residents may vote in person during elections in August and November despite the continuing spread of the coronavirus, officials said. Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said Idaho plans to operate standard elections rather than exclusively using absentee ballots, The Idaho Statesman reports. Idaho’s May 19 primary was the first statewide election held by mail only. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a proclamation in April allowing the change that resulted in record voter turnout across the state. Little said last week that he may request a special session of the Legislature to address the November election. The Idaho Secretary of State’s office said the decision to implement social distancing or other protective measures will be left to county clerks. The office and health officials will also issue guidelines. Idaho’s decision to go to an all-absentee election in May was prompted by concerns about a lack of available poll workers, Houck said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of the Bud Billiken Parade, a traditional African American back-to-school event for about 90 years, organizers announced Monday. Tens of thousands of spectators yearly attend the parade, in which similar numbers march through Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood to Washington Park, where picnicking and a music festival take place. Bud Billiken is a fictional character considered a guardian of children and was created in 1923. The parade was originally organized in 1929 by the Chicago Defender newspaper. In the past, the floats and marching bands have been accompanied by such celebrities as Spike Lee and Michael Jordan. Chicago Defender Charities CEO Myiti Sengstacke-Rice said although the parade won’t take place Aug. 8, as planned, the charity will continue its support of scholarships for graduating high school students.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: Two adjacent northern Indiana counties have implemented or extended orders requiring people to wear face masks to impede the spread of the coronavirus. Elkhart County’s health officer, Dr. Lydia Mertz, announced a new open-ended order beginning Tuesday requiring masks when 6-foot social distancing can’t be maintained indoors and in outdoor public areas. Also, all employees and customers in local businesses must wear masks, the South Bend Tribune reports. The county has had nearly 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 42 deaths. Meanwhile, St. Joseph County’s public health officer, Dr. Robert Einterz, extended that county’s mask order through Sept. 7. “Given that there is no vaccine or medication available to prevent or treat COVID-19, measures such as hand hygiene, physical distancing and wearing face coverings are the most effective strategies to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets,” the county’s new mask order says.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Confirmed cases of the coronavirus continued to climb in counties that are home to the state’s largest public universities, according to statistics released Monday. State public health data showed Johnson County, home to the University of Iowa, had 1,096 known positive cases as of Monday, a 38% increase in a week. The number of cases began spiking around June 15, with 40 to 50 new confirmed positive cases on most days. In Story County, home to Iowa State University, known positive cases reached 677, a 44% increase since June 22. Johnson and Story counties were among the 136 counties the White House included in a list last week showing counties with rising case numbers. The increase in cases has led some owners of bars and restaurants near the universities in Iowa City and Ames to close only weeks after Gov. Kim Reynolds allowed them to reopen.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: Gov. Laura Kelly says she will issue an executive order mandating the use of masks in public spaces starting Friday to stop the spread of COVID-19. “The evidence could not be clearer – wearing a mask is not only safe, but it is necessary to avoid another shutdown,” the Democratic governor told reporters Monday. Kelly’s executive order would require people to wear a mask when they are around others. She said her administration will issue specific guidance Thursday when the executive order is released and will work with the attorney general’s office to implement the policy. Under the order, masks will be required in stores, restaurants and any situation where social distancing of 6 feet cannot be maintained, including outside. Local officials would enforce the policy. “This is all we’ve got right now to fight this virus, and it is up to each one of us to do our part,” Kelly said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s largest school district may delay the first day of school this fall amid concerns about the coronavirus. Jefferson County Public Schools’ calendar committee scheduled a special meeting for Wednesday afternoon to consider moving the upcoming start date to Aug. 26. If cleared by the committee, the calendar change will move to the JCPS school board for final approval. JCPS students are currently expected to restart classes Aug. 12, although it is unclear if kids will start their year virtually or in schools. The potential delay comes as multiple Kentucky districts push their start dates into late August to have more time to develop reopening plans. Hardin County Schools announced Tuesday that it would ask its school board to delay its start by two weeks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nGretna: Jefferson Parish will require face masks inside businesses and public places starting Wednesday to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Officials announced the measure Monday, saying they were reacting to a rising number of cases in the area, especially among younger people. Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng said no one will go to jail over the rule, but violations will carry fines of as much as $500. The new rule comes as the number of COVID-19 cases in the parish has been climbing steadily. Jefferson had the most cases in the state as of Monday, nola.com reports. Lee Sheng said she hoped the proclamation will convince the parish’s roughly 430,000 residents to follow the rules for wearing masks because it is the best way to prevent the spread of coronavirus, especially indoors. Jefferson Parish includes much of metro New Orleans. Neighboring Orleans Parish has a rule that masks are supposed to be worn in indoor, public spaces.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The University of Maine System has entered into partnerships with the nonprofit biomedical research institution The Jackson Laboratory and ConvenientMD to provide comprehensive coronavirus testing. Under the agreement, ConvenientMD will establish testing sites on each campus, and samples will be tested by The Jackson Laboratory, Chancellor Dannel Malloy and University of Maine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy announced Tuesday. The laboratory at Jackson Lab focused on complex tumor profiling assays to help cancer patients and their clinicians learn but has adapted during the pandemic to handle testing for COVID-19. While a vaccine may be months away, the university system can take scientifically proven steps to protect campus communities, said UMaine professor Melissa Maginnis, a virologist who leads the UMS Scientific Advisory Board.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will receive $210 million for remote learning and tutoring to help schools and students most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Larry Hogan and State Superintendent Karen Salmon made the announcement Monday. The money is being allocated through federal coronavirus relief funding. So far, the governor’s office says more than $255 million in federal aid has been set aside to help students affected by the impact of the virus on education. The announcement includes $100 million to help local school systems have access to the most up-to-date devices and connectivity. Another $100 million will go toward implementing tutoring. The other $10 million will go toward rural broadband.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A committee made up of members of the state House and Senate has agreed on a final compromise bill aimed at safeguarding elections during the coronavirus pandemic. Backers said Monday that the bill’s goal is to expand voter access and safety during the remaining 2020 elections, including the Sept. 1 state primary and Nov. 3 general election. The latest version of the bill resolves differences between earlier House and Senate versions. The bill – if approved – would for the first time in state history give all eligible residents the opportunity to vote early in both the state primary and general election while also letting residents vote by mail and expanding absentee ballot access. All registered voters in Massachusetts would receive applications in the mail to vote early. Cities and towns would also be required to take a public vote and provide 20 days’ notice before changing the location of a polling place.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Science Gallery Detroit is piloting a program designed to inspire responses to current social challenges affecting city residents. The five-week, virtual Rapid Residency program is open to writers, artists, musicians, photographers, videographers, dancers, designers and others. Science Gallery Detroit says the goal is to inspire innovation and creativity as events and opportunities for local artists have been postponed or canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, ensuing shutdowns and stay-home orders. Five people will be chosen and receive $1,000 stipends. Participants will be paired with mentors connected to Science Gallery Detroit and Michigan State University. By the end of the program, awardees will be required to produce a publishable summary in written, audio or video format that responds to current social challenges. Finalized works are not mandatory, only comprehensive think pieces. Applications will be accepted through July 22.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State officials said Monday that they had reached their goal of being able to test as many as 20,000 people a day for the coronavirus. Gov. Tim Walz set the daily testing goal two months ago, calling it at the time a key for the state to successfully manage the pandemic. Walz touted a partnership between the state, Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota to build out the capacity. Meanwhile, the University of Minnesota as well as the cities of Edina and Rochester have new requirements on wearing face masks in public places as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continue to climb in Minnesota. University officials sent an email to students Monday announcing that beginning Wednesday, all faculty, students and visitors to the campuses will be required to wear a face covering in any enclosed indoor space. The university had previously recommended but not required face masks.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The mayor announced last week that masks would be required in public buildings and businesses starting Monday because of the COVID-19 pandemic – and he used the opportunity to debunk an array of rumors. “Please listen to our health care professionals regarding covid-19. My job as mayor is do to my best to keep our community safe, not make easy or politically popular decisions,” Mayor Jason Shelton wrote on Facebook. “ANTIFA is not coming to Tupelo, Elvis statues are not being removed, you are not the target of some type of global conspiracy, it is impossible to erase history and no one has attempted to do so, covid is not a hoax, you shouldn’t believe and share posts that are obviously false or used as political propaganda, and there is nothing ‘liberal’ about any of the actions that have been taken by our administration regarding these matters.” Shelton said Monday that people seemed, by and large, to be following the mask requirement, though City Hall was getting complaints about businesses not requiring employees to wear masks.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri will require students, faculty and staff to wear masks in classrooms when on-campus classes resume in the fall, though those plans could change depending on the state’s coronavirus situation. The university, which moved all classes online in March because of the pandemic, announced plans Monday for returning to campus but said preparations were also being made to return to remote instruction if public health conditions require it. Some housing has been set aside to isolate people who test positive for COVID-19 and quarantine people who were in contact with them. Columbia Public Schools announced Monday that the district will join the university in requiring faces masks when classes resume, with some exceptions. And the Columbia City Council is considering an ordinance requiring that most residents use masks outdoors, The Columbia Daily Tribune reports.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state reported another 49 cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, including 20 in Missoula County, as health officials urged people to wear face coverings when social distancing isn’t practical. The new cases confirmed from among more than 2,000 tests run Monday bring the state’s total known cases to 967, including 303 people who are currently known to be infected. Twelve people are hospitalized, and 22 people have died. The state has confirmed 225 cases of COVID-19 from June 23 to 29. Due to the high volume of cases and close contacts discovered over the past week, the Missoula County testing clinic is prioritizing the testing of symptomatic cases and their close contacts, health officer Ellen Leahy said Monday. Eleven of the cases reported Tuesday are in Gallatin County, where health officials recently issued warnings to four downtown bars for overcrowding and not maintaining social distancing, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s largest school district has announced it will open up in-person classes a week earlier than planned and require all students, staff and others to wear masks on school grounds to try to fight the spread of the new coronavirus. The Omaha Public Schools board on Monday approved changes to the upcoming school year, including a new start date of Aug. 11 and an extension of the winter break by one week, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Last week, school district officials announced plans to have students attend school part time. The plan divides students into two groups who would each attend school in person during different days of the week. Students whose names start with A through K would attend every Monday and Tuesday. Those starting with L through Z would attend every Thursday and Friday. Wednesdays would alternate between the groups. On days students aren’t in school, they will participate in remote learning from home.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casinos that were closed through May due to the coronavirus pandemic yielded nearly no tax revenue for Nevada, state regulators reported Tuesday. Gambling establishments statewide reported a 99.4% decrease in house winnings compared with the same month a year ago, the state Gaming Control Board reported. The near-zero numbers followed similar results in April, the first full month after casinos and many businesses were closed in mid-March to prevent people from gathering and spreading the COVID-19 illness. Casinos were allowed to reopen June 4. The state collected just $56,000 in taxes based on May revenues, down 99.9% compared with a year ago. A small amount of revenue came from mobile sports betting and interactive poker that weren’t suspended. The numbers are more dramatic compared with February, when casinos on a hot streak reported a third straight month of $1 billion in house winnings.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House passed legislation Tuesday aimed at protecting workers and voters during the coronavirus pandemic. The House voted 178-154 in favor of a bill that would permanently implement changes made to the state’s unemployment system during the state of emergency and would extend the federal Family Medical Leave Act to allow workers to take time off for virus-related reasons. It also would require paid leave for virus testing and state-provided personal protective equipment for small businesses. The House also passed a bill to streamline the absentee voting process amid concerns about the coronavirus. Based on the recommendations of a recent task force, the bill would create a new box to check that specifies the virus as a reason for not voting in person. It also would allow voters to use one application to receive absentee ballots for both the Sept. 8 state primary and the Nov. 3 general election.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy said he’s postponing the restarting of indoor dining, possibly for weeks, because of a lack of compliance on face masks and social distancing. “Compliance is not a polite suggestion. It is a requirement,” he said at a news conference Monday. Murphy cited the spike in other states as well as reports in New Jersey of people not correctly wearing or failing to wear face masks as well as maintain distance. “Unfortunately the national scene compounded by instances of knucklehead behavior here at home are requiring us to hit pause on the restart of indoor dining for the foreseeable future,” he said. Asked about a time frame, he said, “I don’t think it’s a matter of days but a matter of weeks. We have enormous sympathy, but the alternative here is worse and unacceptable.” Indoor dining was to begin again Thursday at 25% capacity. Casinos are also set to reopen Thursday, also at 25% capacity. Murphy said that can go forward.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: School districts are preparing their plans for resuming classes in the fall amid the coronavirus pandemic. In Las Cruces, district officials are reminding parents that all school-age children must be up to date on immunizations or have the proper exemption from the state Health Department. The Carlsbad school district is hopeful the overall lower number of COVID-19 positive cases in that community could mean a normal school year for students as administrators consider a later start among other measures. The state Public Education Department has proposed a hybrid schedule with students in class for part of the week and learning from home for the rest. Carlsbad officials have said implementing a hybrid instruction model would create challenges for the district’s two high schools, sixth grade academy and intermediary schools, and 10 elementary schools.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo acted constitutionally by temporarily banning evictions because of the coronavirus, a judge ruled Monday. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon said in a written decision that the eviction moratorium issued in a series of orders beginning in March does not violate the First Amendment rights of three Westchester County landlords who sued the state. “At bottom, provisions ensure that landlords will be made whole while their tenants are facing extraordinary financial hardships,” McMahon said. The judge noted that Cuomo’s order, which blocks evictions until Aug. 19, occurred as the United States suffered more than any other country in a world confronting the deadliest pandemic in over a century. Cuomo, a Democrat, issued orders blocking evictions for three months and allowed tenants to use security deposits toward rent. McMahon said the order preserves the right of landlords to evict or sue tenants for back rent.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court is extending various emergency directives in the state’s courts in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Chief Justice Cheri Beasley said in a statement Monday that directives would continue to allow increased use of remote technology and limit foot traffic in courthouses. The directives include restricting entry into courthouses for anyone who was likely exposed to the coronavirus. Only people with business in courthouses will be allowed inside. Other directives include increased use of teleconferencing for remote court hearings and allowing certain documents to be served by email. “The extension of these emergency directives are absolutely crucial to ensuring that our court system continues to administer justice while protecting the health and safety of court officials, court personnel, and the public,” Beasley said in a statement.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials said Tuesday that they are expanding visitation at long-term care facilities to include residents who are showing symptoms of declining health. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the state has allowed people to visit patients who are dying. The rules have been expanded to include residents showing “documented signs and symptoms of sharp psychosocial or medical decline, which is above and beyond normal parameters,” health officials said in a release. Officials said those patients may benefit from social interaction. The guidelines state that those situations should only be allowed on a limited basis, must not be considered routine and may be granted only after careful consideration by a facility’s clinical team.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Outdoor visits will be allowed again at nursing homes beginning July 20, a calculated risk that Gov. Mike DeWine said he weighed against the importance of family visits to people’s mental well-being. The Republican governor announced the relaxed restriction Monday, even as he continued to raise warnings about spikes in reported COVID-19 cases in two southwest Ohio counties, Hamilton and Montgomery. DeWine pleaded with Ohioans to remain diligent in washing their hands, socially distancing and wearing masks. He directly addressed criticism that wearing masks infringes on people’s personal liberty. “If we want to go out and live our lives, this mask is a symbol of freedom,” he said. “It’s a symbol of freedom because if we get 75% to 80% of the people who are out in public who are wearing this mask, we are going to see these numbers get better.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state set a record one-day high for newly reported cases of the coronavirus Tuesday with 585, in addition to reporting two more deaths due to COVID-19, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said. The department reported at least 13,757 newly confirmed cases and 387 deaths statewide, up from a reported 13,172 cases and 385 deaths Monday. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the virus. The previous statewide record increase of 482 cases was reported last Wednesday. The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can carry the virus and not feel sick. The state health department reported that 10,085 people have recovered from the illness and that 315 are currently hospitalized either with the virus or under investigation for the virus.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown announced Monday that people throughout the state will be required to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces starting Wednesday to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The guidance applies to businesses and members of the public, she said in a news release. Face covering requirements were mandated in eight counties last week. Over the past month, Brown said, the disease has spread at an alarming rate in both urban and rural counties. “Modeling from the Oregon Health Authority shows that if we don’t take further action to reduce the spread of the disease, our hospitals could be overwhelmed by new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations within weeks,” Brown said. “The upcoming July 4th holiday weekend is a critical point for Oregon in this pandemic, and we can all make a difference.” She said she did not want to close businesses again, as has happened in other states that are seeing a spike in cases.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is halting its plans to allow indoor dining, bars, gyms and fitness centers to reopen, with officials saying Tuesday that the city is seeing rising COVID-19 case counts and could be affected by increases elsewhere in the country. The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Tom Farley, broke the bad news during a news conference ahead of its Friday target to lift more restrictions. Farley pointed out that he had warned last week that if the city didn’t meet its targets for reductions in new infections, it would not lift some restrictions. Hospitalizations are not seeing a corresponding increase, but Farley said that is a lagging indicator. Across the state, Allegheny County recorded another single-day record high of new cases reported Tuesday. Over the weekend, local officials ordered a halt to drinking alcohol in bars and restaurants due to what they call an “alarming” spike in COVID-19 cases.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s two casinos started offering some table games again Tuesday. The Twin River Casino Hotel in Lincoln and the Tiverton Casino Hotel, which both closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, entered the third phase of the state’s economic restart by opening fully to the public at a capped capacity, expanding hours, and offering table games on a socially distanced basis. Under the plan, a maximum of three players per table will be allowed, and all players and the dealer must wear masks. Roulette, poker and craps will not immediately be offered. Guests and employees will have their temperatures checked. The casinos had reopened earlier in June for video slots and electronic games only, and by invitation to rewards program members and one guest.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: As the state approaches a holiday weekend often an anchor for its typically booming tourism industry, and its numbers of positive coronavirus tests continue to rise, public health officials are encouraging people to just stay home. Dr. Joan Duwve, public health director for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, said Tuesday that some of the largest increases in virus cases were popping up along South Carolina’s coastline, the heart of its multibillion-dollar annual tourism industry. Instead of taking part in traditional July Fourth events as they perhaps typically would, DHEC recommended that people across South Carolina “instead celebrate the Fourth of July by planning home-based festivities and watching fireworks shows while remaining in their vehicles or tuning into celebrations virtually.” Officials said 1,021 people were hospitalized for COVID-19 as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem has suspended a teen driving law that was set to take effect Wednesday. Noem said the legislative bill was suspended because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and the impact the new law would have on licensing. The suspension of the law, which was to have taken effect July 1, will help relieve the backlog on driver’s license officers across the state, according to the governor. The bill changes the required length of time to hold a car or motorcycle instruction permit from 180 days to 275 days. It changes the age for a mandatory restricted minor’s permit from 16 to 18, and it prohibits passengers outside the immediate family or household for the first six months of driving on a restricted permit and limits a non-family member during the second six-month period to one person. Noem’s executive order says the temporary suspension “shall continue for the duration of the COVID-19 State of Emergency.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Monday extended the state of emergency for another two months as Tennessee continues to see large jumps in people testing positive for COVID-19. Lee, a Republican, initially imposed the state of emergency March 12 in order to free up funding and relax rules regarding the treatment and containment of COVID-19. It was set to expire June 30 after he first extended the declaration in May. The state of emergency urges – but does not require – limited activity, maintaining social distancing and staying home whenever possible. It also limits social and recreational gatherings of 50 or more people – though places of worship are exempt, as well as weddings, funerals and related events. It also includes many other sweeping provisions, such as expanding access to telehealth services, continuing delivery of alcohol services and allowing prescriptions to be available in 90-day supplies.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A group of bar owners filed lawsuits Monday seeking to overturn Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s order that closed their businesses to help contain the spread of the coronavirus in Texas. Abbott has pinpointed the reopening of bars in May as one of the sources behind a dramatic spike in new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and hospitalizations that has made Texas a national hot spot in the virus’s resurgence. On Monday, Texas reported it had a record-high number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The lawsuits filed in Austin, Houston and Galveston allege that Abbott doesn’t have the authority under the state constitution to make such an order and that it targets bars while allowing other establishments, such as hair and nail salons and tattoo studios, to remain open. “Gov. Abbott continues to act like a king,” said Jared Woodfill, attorney for the bar owners. “Abbott is unilaterally destroying our economy and trampling on our constitutional rights.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Prospective students at the University of Utah will no longer be required to submit ACT or SAT scores for the next two years in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which is causing colleges to rethink their application processes. Steve Robinson, senior associate vice president for enrollment management, announced the decision Thursday after high school students have faced limited access to testing centers amid the pandemic. Some of the scheduled tests were canceled earlier this year, and those that were rescheduled have limited the number of students to maintain social distancing, leaving some booked through November. “It’s really creating a lot of disruption in the availability of the test,” Robinson said. “And it’s increasing the anxiety of high school students trying to apply to college.” Other students have raised concerns about the cost of the test amid an economic downturn.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The head of the state Senate is calling on the Agency of Education to create a task force to study the best ways to reopen in-person schools this fall. Vermont schools closed in March in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Afterward, all instruction was done remotely. In a Monday statement, Senate President Pro Tem Tim Ashe said he’s worried that any further delay in developing reopening plans will make it more difficult for local school leaders and increase the anxiety levels of students and families. “Working parents have struggled to take on the partial role of educating their kids, all while doing their normal jobs,” said Ashe, a Democrat and Progressive. Rebecca Kelley, a spokeswoman for Gov. Phil Scott, said state education officials are already studying the issue.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The Virginia Department of Health is warning residents that scammers might call them posing as COVID-19 contact tracers in order to take their money. A news release from the department Monday said its contact tracers will not ask for money or for a Social Security number, bank account details, credit card numbers or payment of any form. Their services are covered by tax dollars, not individual fees, the department said. The health department said legitimate contact tracers let people know when they have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19 and then educate them on what to do next and advise them about testing, quarantines and monitoring for symptoms. When they call, your phone will identify the caller as “VDH COVID Team,” the release said.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state could make a request for a federal loan as soon as August or September to secure funds by the end of the year in order to keep its unemployment trust fund solvent as it continues to pay out benefits to those affected by the coronavirus shutdowns, Employment Security Department Commissioner Suzi LeVine said Monday. The state’s unemployment trust fund – which had more than $4.7 billion at the start of March – is currently down to $2.8 billion, according to the latest numbers from the agency. LeVine said the state’s unemployment trust fund has been strong over the years, and she noted that Washington was one of the few states that did not require a federal loan to bolster the system during the Great Recession. Nearly 1.2 million people in the state have filed claims for unemployment since early March, when the pandemic job losses began.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice is done talking about why he pushed out a top health official during the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor deflected multiple questions Monday about the forced resignation of former public health commissioner Cathy Slemp as he continued to doubt the accuracy of the state’s virus caseload numbers. Justice has said he thinks the state’s active caseload may have been overstated, floating the idea that the tally could be exaggerated by about 300 cases, while providing little detail. He has blamed Slemp, who has worked for decades in public health, and suggested she was responsible for the discrepancy before having her removed from her post last week. “There’s no point in continuing to debate my decision or my lack of confidence in Dr. Slemp,” he told reporters Monday, adding that a “culmination of a lot of different things” prompted his decision. He did not elaborate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Animal health officials are cautioning the state’s mink producers about the dangers of the coronavirus following outbreaks among animals on several farms in Europe, spurring renewed calls from animal rights activists to ban the fur trade. There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within the state’s $223 million mink industry, the largest in America. Still, producers say they’re taking precautions to protect their herds, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Kevin Hoffman, spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, said the agency released guidance last month from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control that revealed that research has shown ferrets, a close relative of mink, can catch and spread the disease in lab settings. It noted there is no evidence suggesting animals “play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans,” though it cautioned that further study was needed.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state will keep current public health orders to contain the coronavirus in place for two more weeks amid a surge in reported cases, Gov. Mark Gordon said Monday. State officials had been gradually easing up on restrictions in a process that began May 1. They have allowed dining-in at restaurants to resume and bars to reopen, for example. The recent increase in known cases makes clear the threat of COVID-19 to Wyoming’s health and economy isn’t going away, Gordon said in a statement. “No one wants to see the progress we have made vanish, but that requires each of us to make a concerted effort to slow the spread of the virus,” Gordon said. He urged Wyoming residents to practice good hygiene and social distancing and to wear a mask in public where keeping at least 6 feet apart isn’t possible.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/01"}]}

The office was presented with an award recognizing its marketing campaign for the U.S. Civil Rights Trail during an industry trade show in London last week. The trail promotes museums, churches and other African American landmarks across the South. Promotional materials include video interviews with civil rights participants from the 1960s and photos of landmarks. Alabama oversaw the project in partnership with the Atlanta-based TravelSouth USA and the National Park Service. The trail includes sites from Kansas to Delaware, including all of the Deep South. The state won an award for best regional destination.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Warm temperatures and an abundance of food are keeping bears out of their dens in south-central Alaska. KTVA-TV reports the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is warning people to be aware of bears that have not begun to hibernate. Anchorage area biologist Dave Battle says the department has received regular reports of sightings of both brown and black bears. Battle says most black bears enter dens by October, but brown bears are sometimes still up in November. Battle says denning is a response to both cold weather and food availability, but it’s not cold enough, and bears still have food available. Battle says bears are trying to pack in every calorie they can.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Sikh Community has donated 550 trees to low-income Phoenix neighborhoods. Local Sikh leaders gathered Sunday with Mayor Kate Gallego and other officials for a tree dedication ceremony. Planting of elm, Arizona ash and other drought-resistant trees has already started in some downtown neighborhoods. The gift worth about $68,000 is part of a worldwide observance of the anniversary of Sikh religion founder Guru Nanak’s birth in 1469. There were similar tree-planting campaigns in countries including Germany, Canada and Myanmar earlier this year. More trees are especially welcome in Phoenix, which suffers from an urban heat island effect that raises already high temperatures in areas covered by heat-retaining asphalt and concrete. Phoenix has planted thousands of trees in recent years in hopes of offsetting the effects.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: Mold contamination is so high at an election office that officials are considering moving. Jefferson County Election Commissioner Stuart Soffer says air quality technicians found an election room with small mold spores measuring 73,300 particles per cubic foot, exceeding the acceptable levels of 2,500 particles per cubic foot. Technicians found large mold spores measuring 16,800 particles per cubic foot; the acceptable level is 200 particles per cubic foot. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the mold is a health hazard and puts 150 voting machines at risk. Soffer said the county could be liable if it knowingly exposed people to mold. Mold can cause a stuffy nose, coughing or wheezing. Technicians recommended a $1,500 dehumidifier. County Judge Gerald Robinson, the CEO for the county government, says he’s exploring alternative buildings.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The head of a commuter train system apologized to a black rider who was detained and cited by police for eating a breakfast sandwich on a train platform after an outcry from people who assailed enforcement of a no-food rule as racist. More than two dozen people staged an “eat-in” at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station over the weekend, and others continue to protest the Nov. 4 encounter, which ended with a 31-year-old man, who was headed to work, in handcuffs and unable to leave until he had told BART police his name. BART officials said Monday that an independent auditor is investigating. Eating is not allowed in paid portions of stations to maintain cleanliness, but it shouldn’t be used to prevent people from getting to work on time, they said. Steve Foster says he knew eating was not allowed on trains but did not realize it was banned on platforms.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state law banning the sale and transfer of large-capacity gun magazines has not stopped the sale and transfer of magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition. An undercover investigation by 9Wants to Know found examples of gun stores in Colorado either ignoring the law altogether or finding a loophole to get around the law. “It’s shocking to see that people are doing this,” said state Sen. Rhonda Fields, D-Aurora. In 2013, a Democrat-controlled Legislature passed four comprehensive bills dealing with guns, including the bill sponsored by Fields banning magazines that hold more than 15 bullets. The bill, signed into law by then-Gov. John Hickenlooper, banned the sale, transfer and possession of a large-capacity magazine as of July 1, 2013.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterford: Environmental groups are planning to remove a 1970s dam that has blocked alewife herring from returning from the ocean to freshwater spawning grounds. The Day reports a recently announced $187,000 grant from the Long Island Sound Futures Fund will help pay for the removal of the dam in Alewife Cove along the Waterford-New London line. The grant was awarded to the Connecticut Fund for the Environment and Save the Sound, which are working on the project with the Alewife Cove Conservancy. The groups will be required to provide $128,000 in matching funds. The groups say the project will restore 3 miles of a migratory corridor that benefits alewife as well as sea lamprey and American eel. A timeline for the project has not been announced.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Central YMCA downtown will end its housing program for the homeless next spring, cutting 41 guaranteed beds in the city and potentially relocating dozens of men. The beds are reserved for the chronically homeless, a group advocates consider to be the most vulnerable among homeless adults and the most challenging to help. Those who qualify can stay indefinitely. Their rooms are paid for by a $264,000 federal grant that the YMCA of Delaware this year declined to apply to renew. The current grant lasts until May. The YMCA and Housing Alliance Delaware, the nonprofit that coordinates shelter placements statewide, is finding ways for the current residents to stay in their rooms with other funding such as vouchers, to move toward paying rent like the YMCA’s other tenants or to be relocated to other housing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Authorities say a man was walking his 4-month-old pit bull when he was robbed of the puppy at gunpoint. News outlets report the dog named “L.A.” was stolen Saturday. A D.C. police statement says the man and L.A. were walking that afternoon when a vehicle slowed next to them, and the driver asked about buying L.A. The man refused, and the driver followed the pair. It says the driver then stopped the car and got out with a passenger, who pulled a handgun and told L.A.’s owner that “it’s our dog now.” The driver grabbed L.A. and fled in a burgundy Kia Forte. L.A. was wearing a blue collar at the time. A $1,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest.\n\nFlorida\n\nInverness: Controversy over a county commission blocking a library system from having a digital subscription to the New York Times has spilled over into the local tourism realm. The Citrus County Chronicle reports that people are canceling trips to Citrus County, and the repercussions are being felt as far abroad as London. John Pricher, director of the Citrus County Visitors Bureau, said as of Wednesday afternoon he’s received 10 anonymous and signed emails from tourists who all oppose county commissioners’ actions. In late October, commissioners discussed whether to buy the digital subscription but didn’t make a final decision. On Nov. 19, Citrus County Commissioners will decide whether to take the advice of library officials and spend $2,700 annually for a digital subscription to the paper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Enrollment at the state’s public colleges and universities is rising again, led by its largest schools. The University System of Georgia reported Tuesday that total enrollment rose 1.5% in fall 2019 from fall 2018. More than 333,000 students are enrolled across the state’s 26 institutions. Among those schools, 11 showed growth, and 15 showed declines. The fastest-growing institution, proportionally, was Georgia Tech, where enrollment went up nearly 12% to 36,000. The Atlanta’s school 3,800-student gain made up more than three-quarters of all student gains statewide. Other schools showing large gains were Kennesaw State University, Middle Georgia State University and Georgia Gwinnett College. Atlanta Metropolitan State College saw enrollment drop the most, falling 16% to 1,844.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A public health study says Native Hawaiians experience fewer years of good health compared with other ethnic groups in the state. The study by University of Hawaii researchers published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health found Native Hawaiians have 14 fewer years of healthy life than other groups. The study based on a self-reported survey calculates the number of healthy years among the state’s indigenous people and those with white, Filipino, Japanese and Chinese heritages. The study finds Native Hawaiians have 62.2 years of healthy life expectancy, compared with 75.9 years for Chinese, 74.8 for Japanese, 73.3 for Filipinos, and 72.1 years for white Hawaii residents. The authors say the analysis provides a more complete estimate of population health than life expectancy studies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have released a final plan for five open-pit phosphate mines and reclamation work in eastern Idaho proposed by J.R. Simplot Co. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service released the jointly prepared final environmental impact statement Friday for the Dairy Syncline Mine Project about 14 miles east of Soda Springs. The five mines, disposal areas, tailing ponds and other mine workings would cover about 4.3 square miles. The two federal agencies are taking comments before making decisions. The area contains one of the nation’s most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that’s turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. The area also contains more than a dozen federal Superfund sites needing cleanup from past phosphate mining activities.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is giving a legal aid group $30,000 to educate farmworkers about and to do research on pesticides. The EPA said in a statement that the money going to Legal Aid Chicago will, among other things, help it survey corn-detasseling workers and fruit harvesters in Illinois on their knowledge of pesticide use. It says the goal is to improve the health of migrant farmworkers. Legal Aid Chicago says the state Department of Agriculture has received a record number of nearly 1,000 complaints in 2019 on alleged misuse of pesticides. It says that’s 10 times recent averages and illustrates the need for better education. The money going to Legal Aid Chicago is part of a series of grants nationwide for groups working on similar measures.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is bringing an exhibition exploring the opioid crisis to its official museum early next year. The Indiana State Museum says “Fix: Heartbreak and Hope Inside our Opioid Crisis” aims to remove the shame and isolation surrounding opioid addiction. It will feature displays on the biology behind addiction, the history of health crises in America, and personal stories from addicts and their families. The Indiana Business Journal reports more than 1,700 people in Indiana died from drug overdoses in 2017. Most of those deaths were linked to opioid abuse. The exhibit will feature multimedia displays, hands-on installations and interactive artwork. One display will allow a visitor to enter a giant brain and watch how substance abuse affects it. The 7,000-square-foot exhibit will run for a year starting Feb. 1.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Madison: A monument marking a battlefield where 23 soldiers died has been installed in Fort Madison. The granite monument put in place last week includes a history of the military post on one side and the soldiers’ names on another side. Andy Andrews of the North Lee County Historical Society and Friends of the Old Fort says the $14,000 cost was underwritten by donations through Friends of Old Fort Madison. A flagpole will be installed nearby. The Fort Madison Daily Democrat reports that Fort Madison, originally known as Fort Bellevue, was built by the U.S. Army in 1808 and abandoned in 1813. It was the location of the only War of 1812 battle west of the Mississippi.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A cold front that froze much of the state set at least six records for low temperatures. The National Weather Service reports Wichita, Salina, Russell, Dodge City, Garden City and Medicine Lodge set low temperature records early Tuesday. The lowest temperature was in Garden City, which dropped to minus 1, breaking the record of 7 set in 2018. The highest temperature of the six cities was 8 in Wichita, which breaking the former record of 9. Wichita, Salina, Dodge City and Medicine Lodge broke records set in 1911. Much of Kansas experienced below-freezing temperatures after an arctic air mass moved from the Rocky Mountains to northern New England on Monday, with forecasters saying much of the affected region would see record-breaking cold temperatures Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLand Between the Lakes National Recreation Area: The war on feral hogs at Land Between the Lakes has escalated, with plans announced this week to shoot them on sight from helicopters. The winter campaign to eradicate feral hogs at the site also includes bait trapping and euthanasia, managed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the U.S. Forest Service. Feral hogs are non-native and threaten visitor safety, cultural sites, and native plant and wildlife species, Land Between the Lakes officials say. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service began assisting the Forest Service with trapping in 2014 with success but not at a rate that keeps up with the hogs’ rapid growth. Feral hogs can have two litters per year averaging five-10 piglets. Those offspring can give birth to a new generation in less than a year, according to a release.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s social services agency says 893 children in foster care were adopted over the past year. The Department of Children and Family Services says that’s the second-highest number of adoptions from foster care in a single year in state history, falling just below last year’s record of 912. The latest numbers are from the federal budget year that ran from Oct. 1, 2018, through Sept. 30. The department says the 893 children were adopted into 661 families. Of those families, 27% adopted more than one child, including 164 families who adopted siblings. First lady Donna Edwards hosted an adoption celebration with the families Thursday at the governor’s mansion.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: A company that intends to create a salmon farm at a former mill site is altering the plan to avoid a 19th-century farm identified during an archaeological survey. Arthur Spiess from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission said Whole Oceans will change the planned locations of an auxiliary building and an access road in Bucksport. He told the Bangor Daily News that the historical significance of the farmstead “is undetermined.” Whole Oceans plans to start building the $180 million salmon farm next spring. It’ll be located on the former site of a paper mill. Spiess declined to identify the contractor who performed the archaeological survey or release the contractor’s report, saying the exact location of historical sites, which the report identifies, is confidential under state law.\n\nMaryland\n\nWestover: Officials gathered over the weekend to celebrate Somerset County’s new technical high school that allows students to explore a whole host of career fields in a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility. Somerset County Technical High School opened its doors to students in September, but officials from the county, state legislators and Congressman Andy Harris’ office gathered Saturday for a ribbon-cutting ceremony and to tour the facility, according to a press release. The new $42 million building serves about 400 students from grades 8-12 and teaches them about a number of career fields including automotive technology, biomedical scienes, information technology and more, the release says. The funds for the building were provided by the state and loans from the federal government. The building is also eco-friendly and energy efficient, including a “vegetated roof” in some areas to provide insulation.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Medical marijuana products are set to become exempt from the state’s four-month vaping materials ban. Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled a week ago that marijuana cultivated for medical use must be exempted from Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s ban starting Tuesday. Wilkins ruled that the ban can’t apply to marijuana card holders seeking to purchase cannabis vaping products. He said the ban as written undermines the state’s medical marijuana law. Officials said patients will be able to resume making purchases at noon Tuesday. A group representing medical marijuana patients argued that only the state Cannabis Control Commission can regulate marijuana products. Baker issued the emergency ban in September in response to lung illnesses attributed to use of e-cigarette products.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: A new Michigan State University exhibit is built around a 20th-century guidebook that a generation of black motorists used during the segregation era to find places where they could safely sleep, eat, shop or find services while traveling. The exhibit for “The Negro Motorists’ Green Book” runs at the East Lansing school until the end of November. It will also introduce the guide’s creator, Victor H. Green. Green’s book listed 86 black-friendly Detroit businesses and five in Lansing from 1936 to 1966. The exhibit presents before-and-after pictures of the businesses, showing how they looked 50 to 80 years ago and today. The historical display follows the 2018 release of “Green Book,” an Oscar-winning film highlighting the guide that African Americans consulted when traveling in the South during the Jim Crow era.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: After completing coursework for her hectic senior year, statistics major Emilia Janik has an additional responsibility: sorting through multiple data sets to determine what more than 30,000 students at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities care most about on campus. As the solo research and data coordinator for the Minnesota Student Association, it is Janik’s job to work with student government to create surveys for the student body every semester. Usually, the work is completed by more than one person, but Janik is a one-woman show. The survey results help discover the issues students want to see changed or advocated for at the University, the Minnesota Daily reports. The latest survey, which MSA says is its best yet, received more than 3,000 responses on questions about grocery stores, off-campus living, environmental justice issues and freedom of speech, among others.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi says a lecture by a conservative journalist is back on after initially being canceled. The Oxford Eagle reports Daily Wire contributor Elisha Krauss will speak in the university’s student union Wednesday. The talk was originally set to be inside the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics, but Krauss said she was told by a professor that a policy mandated no ideological groups could host speakers there. The event is hosted by the school’s Young Americans for Freedom chapter, a conservative youth activism organization. Krauss tweeted about the cancellation last week. Hours later, the university responded on Twitter saying the decision to cancel was made by two individuals and wasn’t authorized by the administration. The school rescheduled it and affirmed its commitment to free speech.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A 12-year-old girl has died from injuries suffered last month when a St. Louis County patrol vehicle struck her. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Akeelah “Ke Ke” Jackson had been in critical condition since she was hit Oct. 14 while crossing a street in Jennings. Her family’s attorney, Robert Merlin, says she died about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. County Police Sgt. Benjamin Granda has said the officer told police he was trying to get closer to a suspicious car to make a traffic stop and wasn’t using lights and sirens. The patrol vehicle reached a top speed of 59 mph on a stretch of road with a limit of 30 mph, although the exact speed at the time of impact wasn’t known.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Park officials in the state have closed public comment on a road management plan intended to help officials better handle increased visitation. The Flathead Beacon reports Glacier National Park officials will begin weighing comments as they attempt to mitigate crowds and congestion on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Park officials say the alpine highway plan was released in September after receiving more than 3 million visitors this year. Officials say the plan suggests expanding the shuttle service, implementing a partial parking permit system, improving and adding trails and bathrooms, and extending visitor hours in some locations. Some comments say the plan omits determining a carrying capacity for the Sun Road, raising concerns about the long-term solutions to crowding. A former park official says a plan limiting use would be a better-suited first step.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is planning construction of a reflection area for its Veterans’ Tribute project. The university said in a news release Monday that the area will run from the steps of the Military and Naval Science Building to the Coliseum. The $3.75 million project is part of an upgrade of the mall just east of Memorial Stadium. The fundraising goal through the University of Nebraska Foundation is $4.5 million, which will cover construction and create an endowment for maintenance. Words on steps in the reconfigured space will honor career moments and personal sacrifices of veterans. The tentative design will embody the concept of glass panels featured in the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, D.C. Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in spring 2020.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Federal land managers have withdrawn more than 500 square miles of public land from a swath of eastern Nevada where oil and gas drilling leases go to auction this week after a judge blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to ease protection of sage grouse habitat. The acreage pulled from Tuesday’s scheduled sale covers more than half the lease area the Bureau of Land Management originally planned to auction. It roughly corresponds to priority habitat designated in a 2015 federal sage grouse plan completed under President Barack Obama for Nevada and northeastern California. The Trump land-use plans finalized in March had removed the most protective habitat designations across millions of acres. A federal judge temporarily blocked the rules last month because they could allow activity likely to harm the struggling bird species in seven Western states.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A bridge has been replaced and rededicated to a World War II submarine crew member who died when the vessel sank in August 1944. George Laderbush, of Portsmouth, was a torpedoman’s mate about the USS Flier when it sank after striking a Japanese mine. Seascoastonline.com reports the Woodbury Avenue bridge over the Route 1 Bypass in the city was originally dedicated to Laderbush when it was built in 1949. But the plaque wasn’t in a prominent location. The bridge was closed two years ago and was replaced. The plaque was removed and refurbished and is being featured in a more visible area. Laderbush’s niece and nephew, Marga Coulp and George Laderbush, were guests of honor at the Veteran’s Day bridge rededication.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Police say a convertible traveling at high speed went airborne and crashed into the second floor of a commercial building, killing both of the car’s occupants. Toms River police say the red Porsche Boxster went out of control just after 6:30 a.m. Sunday. The car hit the center median, struck an embankment and went airborne into the building. Police said two Toms River men, 22-year-old Braden DeMartin and 23-year-old Daniel Foley, were deceased when emergency responders arrived at the scene. Police said the structure, which was unoccupied at the time, had been deemed unsafe by a building inspector. Sgt. Vincent Padalino said the building, which is across from Hooper Avenue Elementary School, houses four businesses, including a counseling service and a real estate company.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Clara Pueblo: Federal officials say a tribe will see an increase in federal disaster aid as it continues to recover from flooding that occurred several years ago. A significant portion of Santa Clara Pueblo’s watershed was wiped out by wildfire in 2011 and the flooding that followed. President Donald Trump recently authorized an increase in the level of funding for public projects undertaken as a result of flooding that occurred during the summer of 2012. Under the disaster declaration issued for the state in August 2012, the federal share for public assistance was 75% of total eligible costs. Trump’s order increases that to 90% for the pueblo. The tribe is in the midst of rehabilitating the Santa Clara Creek and surrounding areas by building erosion-control structures and replanting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s court system says it plans to expand the gender options on jury documents in an effort to be more inclusive of people who do not identify as male or female. State court spokesman Lucian Chalfen says the system aims to have the updated juror information card set for distribution by early January. Chalfen says the new categories will include female, male, transgender, nonbinary, intersex and other. He says the cards, which tell people when they must attend jury duty, only have male and female gender options right now. The court system is also changing up its juror questionnaire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Education officials had to warn parents not to use Google to search for two schools because the results included explicit images. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports searches for Four Oaks Middle School and South Johnston High School over the weekend returned an “explicit image” in the top results. The newspaper described the image as “graphic and overtly sexual.” A search of the two websites Monday showed the offending images appear to have been removed. Johnston County Schools said it was working with the schools, law enforcement and Google to get the images taken down, and it asked faculty and staff to help remove the image by reporting it as inappropriate to Google.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A break-in at a sorority house at the University of North Dakota has some students on edge. Police are looking for a man who broke into the Gamma Phi Beta house early Monday and took pictures of a woman who was sleeping. Senior Matthew Ely tells KVLY-TV the crime is “kind of weird, kind of scary” because it’s something that doesn’t happen very often on campus. Chloe Shelton, a freshman and sorority member, says she always walks with a group of people, especially at night. University administrators sent an alert to students after the crime occurred.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Tree farmers are joining forces with the state to send a little holiday cheer to the troops overseas. The Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Ohio Christmas Tree Association are partnering on an effort that will ship more than 100 Christmas trees to military members stationed overseas. Growers will donate the trees, and state inspectors will make sure they are free of pests and disease. Both groups will work with volunteers Tuesday to wrap, load and ship the trees at the Ohio Department of Agriculture in Columbus. Each shipment will also include decorations provided by schoolchildren, churches and veterans’ groups.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group working to reduce the state’s prison population is launching a new initiative petition that could lead to the release of hundreds more inmates. A group of business, political and religious leaders filed the constitutional ballot initiative Tuesday. The proposal would prohibit prosecutors from using previous felony convictions to enhance sentences in nonviolent cases. It would also allow people who already had such sentence enhancements to petition the courts for relief. Once its petition is finalized, the group will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters to place the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. The same group launched a successful initiative in 2016 that reduced criminal penalties and ultimately helped lead to the release of hundreds of inmates from prison last week.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Portland State University study found tiny pieces of plastic in the vast majority of razor clams and oysters sampled along the state’s coast. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports up to 700,000 of the microscopic fibers are shed by yoga pants, fleeces and other active outerwear made of synthetic textiles during a wash. These fibers are in the wastewater from laundry machines that eventually winds up in the ocean. Some of the tiny plastic fibers could also come from derelict fishing gear. The study’s authors collected and sampled shellfish from 15 sites from Clatsop in the north to Gold Beach near the California border. Of the roughly 300 shellfish studied, all but two contained at least some microplastics. There was an average of 11 pieces of microplastic in each specimen.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The family of a sick inmate who died inside a rural jail two years ago claims guards and medical professionals ignored and even ridiculed his distress but documented his agony. A federal lawsuit filed Friday by the mother of 40-year-old Shawn Kitchen blames Clinton County, jail officials and medical staff for mishandling what began as a urinary tract infection and led to a fatal kidney infection. The lawsuit claims Kitchen exhibited symptoms shortly after being jailed for an alleged probation violation and within three days was seen crying in his cell and unable to stand without assistance. It accuses medical and jail staff of responding to his complaints by putting him in a restraint chair and solitary confinement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has announced plans to double the number of veterans it enrolls by changing admissions policies, increasing financial support and bolstering recruitment. The Ivy League university announced in a press release on Veterans Day that standardized test scores will be optional for veterans in the admissions process. The release indicates changes in financial aid will eliminate “all out-of-pocket costs” for undergraduate tuition and fees for veterans. “We owe an immense debt of gratitude to our veterans,” university President Christina Paxson says. The Providence Journal reports there are currently 21 undergraduate veterans at the school, out of about 7,000 undergraduates.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Clemson University and WYFF 4 Greenville are partnering to create an on-campus satellite news bureau. The bureau gives Clemson students the chance to work alongside industry professionals. “Our students will have the opportunity to work alongside WYFF journalists in the bureau on campus and gain tremendous professional experiences doing that,” says Clemson University Department of Communications Chair Joseph Mazer. The bureau, housed at Hendrix Student Center next to the Student Media offices and studio, was unveiled Tuesday. WYFF 4 news director Bruce Barkley says the Clemson bureau won’t be a main fixture during the station’s newscasts but will be used by reporters and crew members while on assignment in the Clemson area. WYFF 4 sports reporters will be able to use the office as a home base during major sporting events.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Visiting and camping in the state’s parks will be a little more costly after legislators gave a proposed fee increase the final OK on Monday. The legislative Rules Review Committee agreed the process was complete for implementing the increased park entrance and camping fees, which was the final step for the proposal that began in September. Sen. Lance Russell, R-Hot Springs, was the sole opposition in the 5-1 vote. Beginning Jan. 1, an annual state park pass will cost $36, and a daily pass will cost $8. Prime campsites will cost $26, preferred campsites will cost $23, and modern campsites will cost $20. A new statewide $15 fee will begin for all non-electric, tent-only campsites. A seven-day motorcycle pass to Custer State Park will cost $20. Currently, an annual park pass costs $30, and a daily pass is $6, while the seven-day Custer motorcycle pass is $10, and campsites start at $17 for a modern campsite.\n\nTennessee\n\nLynchburg: The distillery that produces Jack Daniel’s whiskey is once again teaming up with a military support group to help service members and their families get home for the holidays. For the ninth year, the distillery is working with the Armed Services YMCA for the “Operation Ride Home” campaign. It provides financial assistance to active-duty junior-enlisted military members and their families to travel home during the holidays. Distillery officials say that since the campaign began, about 7,230 service members and their relatives have been assisted. Jack Daniel’s says it has again donated $100,000 to kick off the campaign. Military members have been able to travel to all 50 states thanks to the program.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The makeshift memorial formed after the Aug. 3 mass shooting was completely removed Tuesday in anticipation of the reopening of the Cielo Vista Walmart. City officials say some materials will be preserved for historical purposes. A permanent memorial for the 22 killed in the shooting is being built by Walmart in the south end of the store. Construction crews could be seen building the memorial Tuesday morning. Some materials have been moved to a smaller memorial in Ponder Park. Staff from the El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso Museum of History and the Public Art Program, along with Zaragoza Rotary volunteers, began selecting items from the memorial Tuesday to take to Ponder Park. Erica Marin, a registrar at the El Paso Museum of History, says they selected a mix of items, from handmade ones like a string of paper cranes and wooden stars to religious items like rosaries and memorial wreaths.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: City officials have bought more than 100 new hybrid sedans for the police department, but some have criticized the vehicle’s size. KUTV-TV reports some officers from the Salt Lake City Police Department have warned city leaders that the Ford Fusion Responder hybrid sedan is too small for use by officers or people they have in custody. Officers say the vehicle is a liability, citing concerns with safety in the event of a collision and lack of all-wheel drive in wintry conditions. City leaders say replacing police cruisers with hybrid models is more sustainable. Officers say the cars could still be used in other areas, but it doesn’t solve the patrol car problem. Officers say some cars are more than a decade old and have thousands of miles.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state auditor says numerous questionable choices were made in the administration of the state’s remote worker program aimed at attracting new residents by paying them to move to the Green Mountain state. In a report released Tuesday, Auditor Doug Hoffer wrote that the program’s cost-effectiveness cannot be determined because it’s not known for certain if the grantees moved to Vermont because of the program. He also says the program has serious structural flaws by requiring applicants to prove their Vermont residency before applying. Hoffer writes that “spending taxpayer funds on programs of questionable value is bad enough,” and the problem is made worse by not spending that money “on programs with demonstrable and quantifiable long-term benefits.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An army of Confederate monuments dots the state’s landscape, but some of those statues could soon start coming down after Election Day gave Democrats control of the General Assembly for the first time in decades. Members of the new legislative majority say they plan to revive proposals to make it easier to remove the public displays honoring Civil War soldiers and generals in a state that was home to two Confederate capitals. Previous attempts to do so were quickly dispatched in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, in votes largely along party lines. Del.-elect Sally Hudson, a Democrat whose district includes Charlottesville, says she plans to reintroduce legislation her predecessor, David Toscano, sponsored, giving cities and counties the ability to remove Confederate monuments. Local governments are currently hamstrung by a 1904 state law.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new federal lawsuit aims to kill plans for building one of the world’s biggest methanol refineries along the Columbia River. Plans for the $2 billion refinery, shipping terminal and pipeline project in Kalama, Washington, are already stalled after a state board required further environmental review. Now conservation groups including Columbia Riverkeeper are suing in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. They said Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not consider the huge amount of greenhouse gases the project would emit or the effect on endangered orcas. The refinery would turn fracked gas from Canada into methanol, which would be shipped to China to make plastics. The project’s backer, Northwest Innovation Works, says the project would provide a cleaner source of plastics than coal-based methanol.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginians are being told to be on the lookout for an invasive insect. The state Department of Agriculture says in a news release that a small population of the spotted lanternfly was detected in the Eastern Panhandle community of Bunker Hill last month. The insects are devastating to trees and crops such as grapes and hops. They lay eggs in the fall on surfaces including vehicles, firewood, outdoor furniture and campers. That allows them to hitch a ride to new areas. Agriculture Commissioner Kent Leonhardt says protecting the fruit orchards and wineries in the Eastern Panhandle is a concern. The agency says landowners should inspect their property for lanternfly egg masses. The insect is native to China and likely arrived in North America on goods imported from Asia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed an executive order designed to promote diversity and inclusiveness in state government. Evers signed the order at a state office building Tuesday surrounded by Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, members of his Cabinet, Democratic state lawmakers and others in his administration. The order requires state agencies to develop and implement equity and inclusion action plans. It also calls for creating and providing mandatory equity and inclusion training for all state agency employees. Evers is also creating a diversity and equity advisory council. He says the state is taking a proactive role in making make sure government employees feel empowered and heard in the workplace. Supporters say the effort will help address racial disparities in Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: An interim legislative committee has rejected a proposed bill to raise the state’s property tax. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that members of the Joint Revenue Interim Committee took the action during their meeting Monday in Cheyenne. The bill would have raised the tax rate on real and personal property from 9.5% to 11.5%, a jump that calculates to a roughly 20% increase in taxable property. Under the bill, minerals and industrial property would have been excluded from the increase. Proponents of the idea say the increase is essential to help the state deal with declining mineral industry revenue in the coming years. But opponents say raising the property tax could place an unfair burden on low-income people.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/24/dc-statehood-redneck-rave-pathway-police-news-around-states/117199848/", "title": "DC statehood, Redneck Rave: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The University of Alabama has modified some of the COVID-19 restrictions for summer commencement ceremonies scheduled for July 31 at Coleman Coliseum. According to a news release, masks will not be required for people in attendance who are fully vaccinated. For those who have not been fully vaccinated, face coverings will be required. Another change is that there will be no limit on the number of guests each graduate can invite, and no tickets will be required for entry. UA also recommends that groups of guests maintain social distancing of 3 feet. Hand sanitizing stations will be provided throughout the coliseum, and the building will be cleaned and sanitized between the 8:30 a.m. and noon ceremonies. More than 1,000 students are expected to receive their diplomas during the two July 31 ceremonies.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State health officials say 361 cases of syphilis were reported in 2020, a 49% increase over the previous year. The numbers didn’t surprise Susan A. Jones, an Anchorage-based public health nurse consultant and the HIV/STD program manager with the state health department, who was involved with a report on the continuing syphilis outbreak. “In some ways, I’m surprised there aren’t more cases,” she told the Juneau Empire. Last year’s count included eight cases of congenital syphilis, which occurs when an infected mother passes the infection on to a newborn. Untreated syphilis can cause fetal death, and about 40% of untreated babies with the infection die, she said. Alaska’s syphilis outbreak was first declared in early 2018, and case counts have increased annually since. Jones said she’s worried about Alaska’s numbers in the future. “The pandemic drained much of our public health resources. I wouldn’t be surprised if our numbers surpassed this in 2021,” she said. The rise in cases indicates people are not seeking medical services, a situation exacerbated by pandemic-related concerns, Jones said. As the pandemic wanes, more people will seek services and get diagnosed, she said. Without treatment with antibiotics, syphilis can spread to the brain, nervous system or eyes, health officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Unprecedented shortages are delaying air conditioning repairs across Maricopa County during a record-breaking heat wave, forcing residents to pay for hotels, crash with friends and family, or risk their health by staying in indoor temperatures above 90 degrees. Long wait times for HVAC repairs can be dangerous as Arizona’s summers become hotter, and heat-related illnesses and deaths increase. At least 494 people across the state died of heat-related causes last year. A current parts shortage is driven by factories shutting down during the pandemic and by prices for materials rising due to tariffs and changes to product lines, said Mike Donley, president of Phoenix-based Donley A/C & Plumbing. Unfilled jobs have also affected local companies, he said. Other factors causing lags include an uptick in homeowners seeking renovations during the pandemic and extreme weather such as Texas’ February ice storms disrupting supply chains, according to Associated General Contractors of America. The Arizona Registrar of Contractors, which licenses HVAC companies, recently urged patience when dealing with delays. “From new home builds and pools to installing air conditioning units, both residential and commercial contractors alike have been struggling to get materials and find enough workers,” agency officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday reported 485 new coronavirus cases – its biggest one-day jump in more than three months. The Department of Health said it was the biggest daily tally since 570 new cases March 5. Arkansas has recorded 346,180 total cases since the pandemic began last year. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, rose by 251 to 2,570. Total COVID-19 deaths rose by eight to 5,884. Hospitalizations rose by four to 285. Arkansas in late March opened COVID-19 vaccines to everyone at least 16 years old and lifted its statewide mask mandate, and those as young as 12 are now eligible for shots, but the state has maintained one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson cited the latest case increase as he urged more people to get vaccinated to stop the spread of the virus. About 41% of the state’s population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and about 33% have completed their vaccinations, according to the Centers for Disease Control. “Until we increase the number of shots, we will continue to have increased numbers of hospitalizations and new cases like we did today,” Hutchinson tweeted. “It is sad to see someone go to the hospital or die when it can be prevented.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Construction has started on an $898.6 million station that will directly connect Los Angeles International Airport to the region’s light rail and bus transportation systems, solving a decades-old problem. The Airport Metro Connector will connect with an automated people mover train being built to carry people to and from the airport’s terminals. A ceremony was held Monday to mark the start of construction. “This groundbreaking is a pivotal milestone in our effort to give residents and visitors alike real alternatives to sitting in traffic,” said Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Bonin, who is also on the board of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station will have platforms to access Metro light rail trains, a bus plaza, a drop-off zone for travelers, a bicycle hub and commercial space. The airport is in the midst of a massive multibillion-dollar makeover.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A program that allows doctors, dentists, pharmacists and others to check a database before issuing prescriptions for certain drugs hasn’t stopped so-called doctor shopping for opioids and sedatives and requires legislation to compel prescribers to register with the database and to use it, according to the Office of the State Auditor. After examining Colorado’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program within the Department of Regulatory Agencies, the office presented an audit to the Legislative Audit Committee on Monday. Created in 2008, the monitoring program is designed to collect data on certain prescriptions by pharmacies to stop patients from obtaining large amounts of opioids and dangerous combinations of drugs. Colorado Politics reports that overdose deaths from prescription opioids have risen from 246 in 2008 to 433 in 2019. A 2014 law requires pharmacists to submit information on dispensed controlled substances to the database. But the audit found there are no penalties for failing to do so. It recommended requiring prescribers to check the database before issuing opioid or benzodiazepine prescriptions; adding penalties to compel registration and use; enforcing limits on opioid prescriptions; and adding referrals to law enforcement or health care regulatory boards for those who don’t comply.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday signed a bill making Connecticut the 19th state to legalize recreational use of marijuana, which remains an illegal drug under federal law. People 21 and older will be allowed to possess and consume marijuana beginning July 1 under the new law, which also lays the groundwork for a new cannabis industry in the state and attempts to address racial inequities stemming from the nation’s war on drugs. “We had a chance to learn from others, and I think we’ve got it right here in the state of Connecticut,” said Lamont, a Democrat, referring to the multiyear effort to finally pass a legalization bill. “Maybe we weren’t the first, but we were the first, I think, to show that we can get it right.” The legislation received final approval from both chambers of the General Assembly last week during a special legislative session. “I think it will be the most comprehensive and best cannabis legalization bill in the country,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. The law allows those age 21 and up to possess or consume up to 1.5 ounces of “cannabis plant material” and up to 5 ounces in a locked container in a home or in the trunk or locked glove box in the person’s vehicle. Retail sales of recreational cannabis in Connecticut are not expected to begin until summer 2022, at the earliest.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Legislation from Delaware Democrats could allow the Delmar Police Department to unionize, a feat previously unattainable due to a “fluke of geography.” A union could help Delmar police negotiate a raise and attract officers to the department’s vacant positions. Teamsters Local 326, the union hoping to organize, is proposing to require two officers per shift. Many believe the April death of Police Cpl. Keith Heacook could have been prevented by the presence of another officer. Delmar, “the little town too big for one state,” has two separate municipal governments. The Delmar, Delaware, mayor and town council and the Delmar, Maryland, mayor and commissioners work together to govern the town. The Maryland side amended its charter to allow police to organize and collectively bargain in 2009. Delmar police officers last attempted to unionize in 2017, when they took their request to the quasi-judicial Delaware Public Employment Relations Board. The town of Delmar, Delaware, opposed their petition. According to a February 2020 special notice, the Delaware council opposed the petition in part was because it isn’t the exclusive employer of the officers, as required by state law. The Public Employment Relations Board agreed. A bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday would add clarifying language to the act.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Proponents of statehood for the district vowed Tuesday to keep pushing even though the prospects were dim as the bill began working its way through the Senate. “Our democracy is truly in the hands of this Senate,” Mayor Muriel Bowser told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “We will not quit until we achieve full democracy. … We will keep pushing until D.C.’s tragic disenfranchisement is rectified.” In Tuesday’s hearings on a bill that would make Washington, D.C., the 51st state, Democrats framed it as a long-standing injustice finally being made right. The nation’s capital has a larger population than Wyoming or Vermont, and its estimated 712,000 residents pay federal taxes, vote for president and serve in the armed forces, but they have no voting representation in Congress. Republicans, however, dismissed the bill as a cynical Democratic power play because the district votes solidly Democratic. They claim statehood was never the intention of the Founding Fathers and insist Congress doesn’t even have the power to change D.C.’s status. The bill proposes creating a 51st state, while a tiny sliver of land would remain as a federal district. Instead of the District of Columbia, the state would be known as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth – named after famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who lived in Washington from 1877 until his death in 1895. The bill comes as D.C. statehood is receiving unprecedented levels of popular and political support. It received a formal endorsement from the White House, which called Washington’s current status “an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Civics education will be expanded, including instruction about communist and totalitarian governments, and state universities will be prevented from quashing conservative ideology under bills Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed Tuesday. At a Lee County middle school, DeSantis signed three bills, two of which dealt with civics education, the other guaranteeing the freedom of expression at state universities. DeSantis said students need to be taught that communist and totalitarian governments are evil. “Why would somebody flee across shark-infested waters, say leaving from Cuba, to come to southern Florida?” DeSantis said. “It’s important that students understand that.” The law will require development of a K-12 civics curriculum that, among other things, would include “portraits in patriotism” that tell the personal stories of civic-mindedness, including “first-person accounts of victims of other nations’ governing philosophies who can compare those philosophies with those of the United States.” State university students will be required to pass a civic literacy assessment exam and take a course on civic literacy in order to graduate. The third bill protects free speech at state universities by saying the schools can’t shield students from accessing or observing ideas and opinions “they may find uncomfortable, unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp says he will end the state’s public health state of emergency July 1, more than 15 months after he initially declared it because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor made the announcement Tuesday, signing a fresh, final extension of the extraordinary powers granted to him by lawmakers. “Thanks to those efforts, more Georgians are getting vaccinated, our economic momentum is strong, and people are getting back to normal,” Kemp said in a statement. “We have emerged resilient, and I thank all Georgians for doing their part.” The move comes even as public health officials warn of the spread of the more infectious delta variant of the coronavirus. The governor says he will hold on to some extraordinary powers, saying he will issue a different kind of emergency order suspending state rules and regulations to help state agencies and businesses fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first use of Georgia’s public health emergency law. It grants Kemp sweeping powers to suspend laws and state regulations. He can use it to commandeer private property, take over hospitals, shut down schools, offer temporary housing and welfare payments, and take money directly from the state treasury without legislative authorization.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Uncertainty remains about when the state will drop its requirement for vaccinated travelers to have negative coronavirus test results so they can avoid quarantine after arriving in Hawaii. Lt. Gov. Josh Green wants the testing requirement for fully vaccinated travelers to end ahead of the July 4 holiday, but Gov. David Ige is reluctant and would not commit to dropping the travel tests Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Democratic governor said earlier this month that testing requirements for vaccinated domestic travelers would end once 60% of Hawaii residents are fully vaccinated. That figure has been slow to climb in recent weeks and currently stands at 57%. “We do anticipate crossing that 60% threshold,” Ige said. “It is hard to predict exactly when that would happen because of the fact that the pace of vaccinations is actually slowing, and the number of vaccines administered in the last week is significantly lower than the number of vaccines administered, for example, two weeks ago.” But Green, who is also a Democrat, said there could be confusion and conflict if the state doesn’t drop the requirements soon. “It’s just really important that Hawaii not get a black eye by being unclear,” Green said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded a new $6.4 billion contract to clean up nuclear waste at its sprawling site west of the city, which includes a national laboratory that does nuclear research. The Energy Department announced Friday that the 10-year Idaho Cleanup Project contract went to the Tullahoma, Tennessee-based Idaho Environmental Coalition, replacing Fluor Idaho. A 1995 settlement agreement between the Energy Department and the state requires nuclear waste to be cleaned up at the site that sits above a giant aquifer supplying water to farms and cities in the region. The department said it received five proposals, and the best value was from the Idaho Environmental Coalition, which includes Jacobs Technology Inc. and North Wind Portage. The 890-square-mile site includes the Idaho National Laboratory, which sits atop the Lake Erie-sized Snake River Plain Aquifer, which started becoming contaminated from the nuclear site in 1952, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report released last year. The report said contamination levels at all but a handful of nearly 180 wells are below acceptable standards for drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The report cited cleanup efforts at the site as helping to improve the aquifer.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is requiring students attending classes in person this fall to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before stepping onto its three campuses, officials said Monday. In a mass email, University President Tim Killeen said the requirement for its campuses in Urbana-Champaign, Springfield and Chicago is consistent with the school’s own modeling of the risks associated with the spread of the coronavirus and its variants. “Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, students have helped make the University of Illinois System a model for the nation – a model of community, a model of safety and a model of pulling together for the common good,” Killeen said. “We look forward to their help in setting the standard again this fall, a semester that will restore most in-person instruction and many of the other traditional rhythms of campus life that COVID interrupted last year. Widespread vaccinations will help us do that.” Students who can’t be vaccinated because of their health or other reasons must follow each campus’ COVID-19 protocols, according to officials. Killeen said vaccination guidelines for faculty and staff are still being developed. The University of Chicago, DePaul and Northwestern are also requiring students to be vaccinated before they return to class. Illinois State University said it won’t require the shots.\n\nIndiana\n\nFranklin: The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a lawsuit against Mayor Steve Barnett on Tuesday claiming he violated a man’s First Amendment rights by blocking the man from his Facebook page. The suit, filed on behalf of former Indiana resident William Reynolds, claims Barnett was unjustified when he blocked Reynolds from viewing or commenting on his Facebook page after Reynolds repeatedly tagged Barnett in a video of the mayor participating in a Black Lives Matter protest in May 2020. The video features messages of inclusion and shows Barnett holding a colorful Black Lives Matter sign and leading a small crowd in a chant of “Black Lives Matter.” Reynolds tagged Barnett in the post in the Franklin Equity and Justice Coalition Facebook group, and Barnett “promptly” untagged himself, according to the lawsuit. When Reynolds again tagged Barnett on the same post, the mayor blocked Reynolds, preventing him from viewing or interacting with his page. “Mayor Barnett’s action in blocking Mr. Reynolds from viewing (Barnett’s) Facebook page was taken solely as a result of Mr. Reynolds’ decision to share true information concerning Mayor Barnett’s support for the Black Lives Matter movement and for the cause of racial justice,” the lawsuit says.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A judge has permanently blocked a state law requiring women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. In his order, filed Monday afternoon, District Court Judge Mitchell Turner held that the 2020 law is unconstitutional and cannot be enforced on two grounds: that the Legislature violated the “single-subject rule” of the Iowa Constitution when lawmakers passed the measure as an amendment to an unrelated bill and that the law violates a 2018 Iowa Supreme Court decision that protects abortion rights. The law was opposed in court by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland and the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa. Turner had previously issued a temporary injunction blocking the law just before it was to take effect July 1, 2020. Monday’s order makes that injunction permanent. In his order, Turner also canceled a planned trial in the case, which was set for January. At a press conference Tuesday, Planned Parenthood North Central States Director of Public Affairs Jamie Burch Elliott said the law was “medically unnecessary and harmful” and would have effectively put abortion access out of reach for many people. Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who signed the law last year, said she will appeal the ruling.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: A civil rights group warned Uber Eats that its app profiles place transgender drivers at risk of harassment and violence, prompting the company to apologize Tuesday to a Topeka man and to resolve issues within the app that outed him. The move came after American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas released a letter it had sent to the food delivery service Monday on behalf of Laine Repic, a 41-year-old transgender man who has been driving for the company since April. The ACLU of Kansas contended that Uber Eats has forced Repic to have his app profile display his legal name, which he no longer uses and does not match his male gender presentation – effectively outing him as transgender. The ACLU noted that Repic has experienced harassment and ridicule as a result when he drops off food to customers, making him fearful for his safety. “Having to, like, drive around with that name following you everywhere from customers, it was nerve-wracking, and it was scary, and we shouldn’t have to be put in that position – especially when it was such a simple fix,” Repic said Tuesday in a phone interview. Repic said he reached out to the ACLU because he needed someone who would have his back, and Uber didn’t seem to support him.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave: Dozens of people face criminal charges or suffered injuries during a five-day party billed as a “Redneck Rave.” Blue Holler Offroad Park in Edmonson County hosted the event last week that organizers said would feature “mud, music and mayhem,” the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The crowd was estimated to be in the thousands, with attendees including some from outside Kentucky. Edmonson County Sheriff Shane Doyle told the newspaper 14 people were arrested, and another 34 were cited on criminal charges that ranged from assault and strangulation to drug and alcohol possession. Some who attended reported accidental injuries, including one person who was impaled by a log that pierced the floorboard of his vehicle, and others suffered lacerations, dislocated fingers and broken bones, Doyle said. Organizer Justin Stowers did not immediately respond to the newspaper when asked about the event but said in a Facebook post that it was “the biggest event we’ve ever done and with as many people and random things that popped up unexpectedly I feel like we all handled it very well,” the Herald-Leader reports. In addition to live music, the rave featured a football game and a demolition derby. Another event is scheduled in October.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ rejection of legislation banning transgender athletes from participating on school sports teams is spurring talk that Republican lawmakers may try to hold Louisiana’s first veto session under its decades-old constitution. Republican House Speaker Clay Schexnayder announced Tuesday night that he wants such a mid-July session, giving the possibility of the historic gathering some momentum. But GOP Senate President Page Cortez hasn’t taken a public position, which could put the chances in doubt. It only takes a majority written vote of lawmakers in either the House or Senate to scrap a veto session in Louisiana. Plus, it’s unclear if lawmakers could hold the bipartisan coalition of votes together that would be needed to overturn the Democratic governor’s spurning of the transgender sports ban bill if the veto session were held. Edwards announced Tuesday that he struck down Franklinton Republican Sen. Beth Mizell’s bill prohibiting transgender athletes from competing on school sports teams of their identified gender, a measure that has been passed in several conservative states. “Discrimination is not a Louisiana value, and this bill was a solution in search of a problem that simply does not exist in Louisiana,” Edwards said in his veto announcement.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Legislators have passed a bill banning the intentional release of many balloons. The measure now awaits the signature of Gov. Janet Mills. Out of concern for balloons’ impact on the environment, the bill would create a fine for anyone who releases a large number of balloons on purpose, the Sun Journal reports. “It’s time to define intentional balloon releases as an act of littering so that people know how they are affecting the marine ecosystem,” Rep. Genevieve McDonald said when she introduced the bill, which was adopted earlier this month. First-time offenders who release between 16 and 24 balloons would be fined between $100 and $500 if Mills signs the proposal into law. Anyone who releases more than 24 balloons would face a fine of at least $500. The bill is not intended to punish the accidental release of a balloon by a child or someone else, the newspaper reports. It also exempts the release of balloons for scientific or meteorological purposes.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The health of the Chesapeake Bay improved to a grade of C in 2020, up from a C-minus in 2019, according to an annual report card by scientists. Individual indicators on the health of the nation’s largest estuary had mixed results in 2020, but the report released Tuesday by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science found the overall baywide trend continues to improve over time. For the first time, the report card examined new indicators of watershed health including stewardship, protected lands, walkability and heat vulnerability. Scientists have been putting a focus on assessing not just the environment but also the social and economic factors that influence ecosystem health. Seven out of 15 regions showed significantly improving health trends, the report said. Dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen scores improved, while chlorophyll a and total phosphorus scores declined. Water clarity, benthic community – organisms in the bottom of the bay – and aquatic grass scores decreased slightly. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, UMCES said there was a monitoring gap from March to May. The effects of the pandemic on the ecosystem health of the bay are not yet known, besides a reduction in atmospheric nitrogen, which has a declining trend, continued by reduced travel during 2020.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: With no-excuse mail-in voting laws set to expire at the end of the month, state lawmakers need to hurry up and take action to extend those rights through the end of the year, Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said Tuesday. Up to 21 cities and towns, including Boston, have preliminary municipal elections scheduled for Sept. 14, with another 13 cities scheduled to hold elections Sept. 21. Without an extension, the cities will be unable to let voters cast ballots by mail without having an excuse or to hold in-person early voting for their city elections, Galvin said in a letter to Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ronald Mariano, both Democrats. Several local elections scheduled for July will also be affected without a new law in place, Galvin said. “For budgetary and planning purposes these cities must have clarity,” Galvin, also a Democrat, wrote to both legislative leaders. “Urgent action is needed.” There’s significant support on Beacon Hill for extending the voting options that were adopted during the pandemic and proved popular with voters. Democratic Sen. Barry Finegold, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Election Laws, said he’s working with fellow lawmakers to make vote-by-mail and other election changes permanent in Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The city could use more trees – about 1.2 million more, according to American Forests. The Washington-based, nonprofit conservation organization on Tuesday published Tree Equity scores for 150,000 neighborhoods in 486 urbanized areas. Each score is based on how much tree canopy and surface temperatures align with the number of people living in a given area or neighborhood, income, employment, race, age and health factors. The scores indicate whether there are enough trees for everyone living in those areas to experience the health, economic and climate benefits that trees provide. Low-income, predominantly minority neighborhoods have fewer trees than wealthier, mostly white areas, according to Chris David, American Forests geographic information system and data science vice president. The premise of tree equity “helps cities identify where to target places that have been historically ignored,” David said. “Where the places are that lack trees historically have underserved people in poverty, people of color.” Trees improve the quality of life in neighborhoods by providing shade that reduces heat-related health issues. They also improve air quality by helping to reduce air pollution and create jobs involved in the care of trees, the nonprofit said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Kids caught scootering, biking, skateboarding or riding anything else that would require a helmet could be awarded a free Dairy Queen kid’s cone this summer from participating police and sheriff’s departments as part of a statewide initiative funded by AAA. Stearns County Sheriff Steve Soyka said the initiative is designed to promote safety and foster trust with local law enforcement. Each of the county’s patrol officers received five to 10 certificates last month to give out randomly while on patrol, he said. Although he said the county doesn’t see an abnormally large number of severe bicycle accidents each year, he said wearing a helmet is always a good preventative measure. “If you can catch people when they’re doing things right, and you can reinforce that behavior, they’ll continue to carry on that positive behavior,” said Sauk Rapids police chief Perry Beise. “A bike helmet can save people from a lifelong head injury.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Four words on the state’s license plates have sparked a federal lawsuit. American Atheists, the Mississippi Humanist Association and three nonreligious residents filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the state over its “In God We Trust” license plate. The complaint accuses the Mississippi Commissioner of Revenue of violating the people’s freedom of speech and religion by forcing them to display the religious message on their personal vehicles. The license plate has included “In God We Trust” since 2019. The lawsuit claims car owners are forced to promote the religious statement or pay an additional fee for a specialty plate without it. “Every minute they spend on the streets of Mississippi, atheists are forced to act as a billboard for the state’s religious message,” said Geoffrey T. Blackwell, litigation counsel at American Atheists. “Some can avoid being a mouthpiece for the government by paying a penalty.” The lawsuit also claims that there are no alternatives to the plate for trailers, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, drivers with disabilities and custom plates. Gov. Tate Reeves, in a statement on Twitter, said he plans to defend the license plate’s motto. “I know Mississippi’s values are our strength…and I meant it when I said as Governor I would defend our values every single day!” he wrote.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Jim Bakker and his southwestern Missouri church will pay restitution of $156,000 to settle a lawsuit that accuses the TV pastor of falsely claiming a health supplement could cure COVID-19. Court records show a settlement agreement that was filed Tuesday calls for refunds to people who paid money or gave contributions to obtain a product known as Silver Solution in the early days of the pandemic. The settlement also prohibits Bakker and Morningside Church Productions Inc. from advertising or selling Silver Solution “to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat or cure any disease or illness.” Bakker, in the agreement, does not admit wrongdoing. Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued Bakker and Morningside in March 2020. Schmitt sought an injunction ordering Bakker to stop selling Silver Solution as a treatment for COVID-19 on his streaming TV program, The Jim Bakker Show. The lawsuit said Bakker and a guest made the cure claim during 11 episodes in February and March of 2020. Schmitt said in a news release Wednesday that Bakker has already made restitution to many consumers and must pay back another $90,000 to others. The consent agreement notes that during “The Jim Bakker Show,” Silver Solution was offered to those who agreed to contribute $80 to $125.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Yellowstone National Park visitors hoping to see its world-renowned geysers, wolves and bears can expect warmer temperatures and less snow as climate change alters the park’s environment, according to a report by U.S. and university researchers released Wednesday. Average temperatures in the Yellowstone region in recent decades were likely the warmest of the past 800,000 years, according to geologic studies. And average annual snowfall has decreased by nearly 2 feet since 1950. The changing climate could affect some of the park’s most iconic sites, including Old Faithful, a geyser famous for erupting at regular intervals. Past droughts have reduced the frequency of water shooting out of the popular geyser, meaning it could erupt less frequently as drought conditions become more common in the park, Bryan Shuman, a geology professor at the University of Wyoming, said during a news conference Wednesday. Temperatures in the region have increased by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950 and are expected to increase by an additional 5 to 10 degrees by the end of the century, according to findings by scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, Montana State University and the University of Wyoming. Communities in the surrounding area, including Bozeman, could see between 40 and 60 more days per year of temperatures above 90 degrees. And the changes are likely to affect tribes that have called the region home for millennia.\n\nNebraska\n\nOffutt Air Force Base: Offutt Air Force Base’s 55th Wing has a new leader – the first woman to command the 80-year-old reconnaissance unit. The Omaha World-Herald reports Col. Kristen Thompson took over command Tuesday, becoming the first woman among the 65 officers who have led the unit since it was established in 1941. She replaces Col. Gavin Marks, who was the first Black leader of the unit. Marks led the 55th Wing through a tumultuous time that included the early stages of recovery from the March 2019 floods and the COVID-19 pandemic. About 300 people, including Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, attended the ceremony. Thompson, a 2001 graduate of the Air Force Academy, flew 600 combat hours in Iraq and Afghanistan. She was most recently commander of the 380th Expeditionary Operations Group at a base in United Arab Emirates.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is launching a new program to help hundreds of student-athletes find out how they could get compensated for the use of their name and likeness. KVVU-TV reports UNLV has established “The Vegas Effect,” which will assist athletes in navigating how to take advantage of name, image and likeness opportunities. The announcement comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that the NCAA can’t limit education-related benefits – like computers and paid internships – that colleges can offer their sports stars. The ruling could help open the door to further easing in the decades-old fight over paying student-athletes. “The Vegas Effect” program includes a platform to connect student-athletes with resources to help them build their personal brand. There are also ways to connect to on-campus resources for help with financial literacy, handling of taxes and career development. School officials say they created the program in anticipation of NCAA-approved legislation permitting college athletes to generate revenue for themselves. The measure will take effect next year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Funds from the latest federal coronavirus aid package are going to support child care programs and workers, the state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. Over the next 30 to 60 days, the department plans to launch stabilization grants to child care programs, workforce recruitment and retention efforts, and market rate increases for the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship Program. Starting July 12, the grants will be open to all licensed and enrolled license-exempt child care providers. The scholarship market rate for tuition costs for enrolled families will increase as much as 10% for infants through preschoolers and an average of 40% for school-age children. The state also is increasing recruitment and retention efforts to increase the number of child care workers in centers, homes and after-school programs, including an internship program. “These programs will help ensure that residents who need access to child care in order to return to work will have as many options as possible,” said Christine Santaniello, associate commissioner of the department. “Child care programs have been essential since the first case of COVID-19 in New Hampshire.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRandolph: A board of education has reversed itself following a public outcry and restored the names of holidays to its school calendar. The Randolph school board on Monday night voted 8-1 to overturn a decision made earlier this month to replace the names of holidays with “day off.” The panel also will create a committee to gain input from the public. Criticism began when the school board voted in May to refer to Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day. Following complaints from Italian Americans, the board then voted to label holidays generically. Critics accused the board of bowing to so-called cancel culture. An online petition called for Superintendent Jennifer Fano and members of the school board to resign. The district issued a statement in which it said the actions were “misconstrued.” “The buck stops here with those of us seated in front of you, and we own it,” school board president Tammy MacKay said. “Neither the superintendent nor any other administrator, principal, teacher or other district employee had anything to do with those votes or decisions. To cast blame on any of them for what this board did is quite simply wrong.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A major business in the state’s burgeoning market for marijuana wants the state to refund millions of dollars in taxes that were levied in recent years on sales of medical marijuana but not against most prescription medications. Integrated cannabis provider Ultra Health said Tuesday that it has asked the state Supreme Court for the opportunity to provide arguments in a legal dispute between another medical marijuana company and the state Taxation and Revenue Department. New Mexico lawmakers and cannabis regulators made clear this year that a limited personal supply of medical cannabis will be available tax-free starting June 29. The provision is part of legislation signed in April by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to legalize recreational marijuana sales by April 2022 and waive taxes on medical marijuana this year. “We are very glad the New Mexico Legislature had taken the initiative to include that clause for the deduction,” said Marissa Novel, chief marketing officer at Ultra Health. “What’s still up for debate is years worth of (past) medical cannabis activity.” In its Supreme Court filing, Ultra Health said it paid nearly $2.7 million in gross receipts taxes in 2020 alone on $39.5 million in sales.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: In-home COVID-19 shots are now available for all city residents, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Wednesday. “Anyone who’s sitting out there and thinking, ‘Wow, I’m ready, but I’d rather the vaccine be done right here in my home,’ go to nyc.gov/homevaccine, fill out the request, and we’ll send the vaccinators to your door,” the mayor said during an online briefing. City officials had already been offering the service to homebound residents and are expanding it as they try to entice more people to get COVID-19 vaccinations. “We are going to keep innovating new ways to get people the vaccine,” de Blasio said. The mayor said 9 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in New York City so far.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation that would raise the minimum age to get married from 14 to 16 cleared a state House committee Tuesday. The measure, which was approved unanimously by the Senate last month, also would prevent the young person’s spouse from being more than four years older. And 16- and 17-year-olds would need either written parental consent or a judge’s order to marry. Current law requires parental consent for 16- and 17-year-olds, and 14- and 15-year-olds can only marry if a pregnancy is involved and if a judge authorizes the marriage. There is no age-gap limit between the couple. Backers of the measure say North Carolina has become a destination for out-of-state couples involving an underage partner because of its rules, and that in turn can encourage child trafficking. They say the age-gap limit also would bring restrictions more in line with North Carolina’s statutory rape law. An estimated 8,800 minors were listed on North Carolina marriage license applications from 2000 to 2015, according to an analysis by the International Center for Research on Women. Bill supporters say too many of these young women end up living amid poverty and abuse.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A frequent political candidate is leading an effort to recall Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford. Michael Coachman, who last year received just 10% of the vote in the GOP primary for governor, is alleging “contempt of the voters” and negligence by Burgum. Secretary of State Al Jaeger on Wednesday announced he approved for circulation a petition for the recall effort. Burgum’s spokesman, Mike Nowatzki, said the governor’s second-term victory last year “speaks for itself.” To hold a recall election, supporters of the idea need to collect more than 89,000 signatures, roughly 25% of those who voted in the last general election. Coachman is a retired U.S. Air Force veteran who lives in Larimore. He was previously an unsuccessful candidate for secretary of state in 2018 and for lieutenant governor in 2012 and 2016.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine made good on his promise Wednesday to professionalize policing in the state by introducing a college-to-law enforcement pathway program. The pilot program under the new state Office of Law Enforcement Recruitment is an effort by the Republican governor to both recruit more law enforcement officers as departures engulf agencies across the state and make sure the candidates who do apply are qualified. “This is not an easy time to be in law enforcement,” DeWine said at a briefing, surrounded by police chiefs, deputies and rank-and-file officers from across Ohio. “Failure to keep the ranks of law enforcement full has the potential to create a public safety crisis.” The objective of the new program, DeWine said, is to connect criminal justice programs from colleges and universities in Ohio to law enforcement agencies in the state, effectively creating a pipeline for college students to become officers. The announcement of the program comes as the reckoning over racial injustice that began after George Floyd’s killing last summer has shifted the public perception of police and their roles in the community. The result of that is low morale among rank-and-file officers, leading to more officers retiring and fewer people coming forward to serve, DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Those responsible for a ransomware attack on the city last month are sharing some residents’ personal information online, city officials said. More than 18,000 city files, mostly police citations and internal police department files, have been posted on the dark web, the city said in a statement late Tuesday. Police citations include some personally identifiable information such as name, date of birth, address and driver’s license number but do not include Social Security numbers, officials said. Still, city officials are warning anyone who has filed a police report, received a police citation or shared personally identifiable information with the city to monitor their financial accounts and credit reports. They are also warning those people to alert credit and debit card companies and to change passwords to personal accounts. Last month, the city said no personal data had been accessed by the breach. Malware was initially detected May 6, the city said. Mayor G.T. Bynum said the hackers told the city to pay a ransom, but Tulsa didn’t pay. The city shut down much of its network to stop the malware from spreading. The primary effect of the shutdown was that most residents were prevented from paying their water bills because the city could not process credit or debit cards with computers inoperable.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Officials confirmed Tuesday that another COVID-19 outbreak at Multnomah County’s Inverness Jail has infected 25 people in custody in the past month. Those in custody at the Northeast Portland jail were not taken to their court appearances Monday because of the outbreak, according to written notices posted at the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse. Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Chris Liedle told The Oregonian/OregonLive the outbreak started May 23 when a person lodged at Inverness who had been showing COVID-19 symptoms tested positive for the coronavirus. Liedle said almost all those who have since tested positive have had mild or no symptoms. One inmate was hospitalized, Liedle said, but is now back in jail. Liedle did not immediately specify the source of the outbreak. He said inmates are regularly offered COVID-19 vaccines, and the county has reduced its jail population by one-third and increased virus testing. The jail has had other COVID-19 outbreaks since the start of the pandemic. In April, 15 inmates who contracted COVID-19 while at Inverness sued the county and Sheriff Mike Reese, alleging the county failed to take proper safety precautions, denied inmates coronavirus testing, and mixed infected inmates and guards with those who were healthy.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Republican rewrite of state election law that would mandate voter IDs, alter registration and ballot-counting deadlines, and give conservatives auditing procedures for which they have clamored passed the state House on Tuesday despite the Democratic governor’s veto threat. The lengthy and complex bill, crafted after 10 committee hearings on the subject earlier this year, was sent to the state Senate on a vote of 110-91. Rep. Margo Davidson, D-Delaware, dismissed its proposed security provisions by raising the specter of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by those who supported former President Donald Trump’s baseless efforts to reverse his reelection defeat. “What a farce,” Davidson said. “We are advancing election security measures, so we say, by ignoring the facts and embracing actual fantasies.” Voters must have confidence that the system is fair, said Rep. Greg Rothman, R-Cumberland. “We know that democracy dies in darkness,” Rothman said. “Democracy will die without trust in the process.” The bill would establish a new county-issued voter ID that Rep. Tim Bonner, R-Mercer, said was not a burden or a way to suppress votes. But Democratic Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia described the bill as “voter suppression in bad drag.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: To the relief of many, the state reopened public restrooms Wednesday at the Kennedy Plaza transit hub in Providence, which had been closed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority also recently reopened to the general public bathroom facilities at the Newport Transportation and Visitors Center and the Pawtucket Transit Center. “Reopening public restrooms at three busy transit facilities in our state is a necessary step to address public need as we re-emerge from the pandemic,” Gov. Daniel McKee said in a statement. The agency has kept the Kennedy Plaza bathrooms closed to the general public, citing the need to enforce a federal mask mandate and to provide bus drivers with their own facilities where they didn’t have to wait in line and in turn could keep buses running on schedule. RIPTA chief Scott Avedisian said the issue has been resolved. The city agreed on a plan that will accommodate the public need for the facilities while also making provisions for drivers by retrofitting restrooms at the nearby public skating rink for them. “We are happy to be moving forward on this issue,” Avedisian said, “and we appreciate the steps the city is taking.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s nearly $11 billion budget was sent to the governor’s desk Monday as lawmakers cut close the deadline to get the spending plan in place before it begins July 1. There is something for almost everyone in the budget, including raises for most state employees, teachers and law enforcement officers. It also includes money to expand the port in Charleston, repair college buildings, and place a police officer and nurse in every public school in the state. Lawmakers also have earmarked funds for dozens of local projects such as downtown renovations, lighthouse repairs and art programs. What passed Monday doesn’t include the $2.5 billion that lawmakers will control of the nearly $9 billion South Carolina is getting from federal COVID-19 relief. How to spend that money will be debated later this year. Gov. Henry McMaster has until the end of Saturday to decide if he wants to veto any individual items in the spending plan. The General Assembly plans to return June 29 to decide whether to override any potential vetoes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s oldest residents are seeing major gains from strong vaccination rates. The state has reported just three new coronavirus cases among people 80 and older this month. As of Tuesday, there was just one active infection in that age group, which has been the hardest-hit by COVID-19, with 1 in 5 of those who tested positive for the virus dying. Among those 70-79, the state has been seeing a new case every other day. The case fatality rate for that age group declines sharply, with just 6% having died. As of Tuesday, there were just eight active infections in that age group. Meanwhile, there hasn’t been a fatality reported among the state’s long-term care residents since May 28. The vaccination rate among older South Dakotans has been high: As of Monday, 91% of those 65 or older have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while 85% are fully vaccinated. According to Tuesday’s report from the South Dakota Department of Health, the seven-day average for new cases was 10. It hadn’t been that low since March 29, 2020, two weeks into the pandemic. But overall, the number of people seeking a COVID-19 vaccine continues to fall, with the state averaging just 465 newly vaccinated residents over the past seven days.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A panel of federal appellate judges on Tuesday reinstated a state law requiring first-time voters to appear in person to vote, reasoning in part that the COVID-19 pandemic is “unlikely to pose a serious threat during the next election cycle.” In a 2-1 decision, a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned a lower court’s ruling in September that blocked the restriction on absentee voting ahead of the 2020 general election. In October, a panel from the 6th Circuit decided to keep the preliminary injunction, with Judge Julia Smith Gibbons ruling that the court shouldn’t disrupt the new rules at that late stage in the election. In reinstating the requirement, the same judge wrote Tuesday that there is not a “reasonable expectation” that voters will again face the same kind of burdens they did during the fall 2020 election. “Fortunately, because of advancements in COVID-19 vaccinations and treatment since this case began, the COVID-19 pandemic is unlikely to pose a serious threat during the next election cycle,” the ruling said. The judge also said the legal standing to bring the case, through a member of the Tennessee NAACP, disappeared once the state Supreme Court separately rolled back another judge’s widespread expansion of a vote-by-mail option last year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday ordered lawmakers back to work in July, raising expectations of another attempt to pass new voting restrictions after Democrats blocked the GOP’s first try with a dramatic late-night walkout in May. However, Abbott did not reveal why he was ordering a special legislative session starting July 8, saying only in a two-sentence announcement that an agenda would come later. As governor, only Abbott can determine what issues lawmakers take up during a special session. But Abbott has previously made clear that he would bring lawmakers back to pass new election laws after Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives left the chamber one by one less than two hours before a midnight deadline over Memorial Day weekend, denying the GOP majority the quorum needed to pass what was one of the nation’s most restrictive voting measures. Democrats have vowed to continue fighting GOP efforts to reduce polling hours and voting access in Texas after staging the last-ditch revolt to stop the sweeping elections overhaul from reaching Abbott’s desk. None has called for a boycott of the special session, and the Republicans’ commanding majority means it’s likely that an elections bill will ultimately pass.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park is warning tourists about the dangers of heat and toxic bacteria. With the ongoing drought and summer temperatures spiking to record highs, the park is asking visitors to be diligent about heat-related illnesses as search and rescue operations spike. During a Tuesday press event, Zion’s Chief Ranger Daniel Fagergren said there has been a noticeable uptick in 911 calls since Memorial Day weekend. “That’s the secret: being prepared, knowing your limitations and watching the weather,” he said. Fagregren said there were six heat-related injuries within a two-hour period on one recent weekend. Temperatures at Zion reached as high as 112 during last week’s heat waves. Fagergren said the Zion canyon is like a “parabola,” reflecting heat back into the canyon and increasing the temperature compared to nearby towns. In addition, toxic cyanobacteria are still present in Zion’s Virgin River, so officials are asking visitors to avoid the water – no matter how tempting it may be – and to keep an eye out for algal blooms. “It certainly complicates things, especially this time of year, as people gravitate toward the water,” Fagergren said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Wednesday voted to override Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of separate bills that would change the municipal charters of the cities of Montpelier and Winooski to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. The votes were 103 to 47 on both measures. “We have a rich history of Vermonters coming together in their cities, towns, and villages to work together and chart a path forward that works best for their communities,” House Speaker Jill Krowinski said in a statement. “These charters expand local voting rights to residents of these respective communities, and these decisions were made by the voters after robust discussion and deliberation.” The Democrat-controlled Senate is expected to take up the measure Thursday. Last November, voters in Winooski – considered one of the most diverse cities in northern New England – authorized noncitizens to vote in local elections if they were in the U.S. legally. In 2019, Montpelier passed a similar measure, but it did not pass the Legislature in 2020. In his veto message, Scott said noncitizen voting was an important issue that deserves further consideration but said a town-by-town approach to municipal voting creates inconsistency in election policy.\n\nVirginia\n\nLeesburg: One person was arrested and a second cited for trespassing after Loudoun County’s school board shut down public comment on proposed rules for the treatment of transgender students. Hundreds of people showed up at Tuesday’s meeting in Leesburg to voice their opinions, but the school board voted unanimously to close public comment after just a few speakers, citing unruly behavior from the audience. “Even after numerous attempts to ask for decorum, so everyone could speak, those attending insisted on continued interruptions in an attempt to delay and disrupt the proceeding,” school board Chair Brenda Sheridan said in a statement early Wednesday. “These politically motivated antics ought to end.” Critics of the school board accused its members of ignoring public sentiment. The proposed regulations would require that transgender students be addressed by their preferred name and pronoun and allow students to use the restroom associated with their preferred gender. School systems across Virginia are adopting similar regulations. But Loudoun has become a flashpoint in the debate. Conservative groups rallied to support an elementary school gym teacher who was suspended after he spoke at a school board meeting in opposition to the new rules. A judge has ordered his reinstatement, but the school board is appealing the ruling.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Five Black officers with the University of Washington Police Department have filed claims of racism against the department and are seeking $8 million in damages, alleging they were routinely insulted and demeaned by co-workers and supervisors. Some officers said they were disciplined and denied promotions because of their race, KOMO-TV reports. Officer Damien Taylor said a white supervisor referred to him as “ ‘(his) own negro’ on a call and later laughed at me when I confronted him about it.” Officer Karinn Young said that “a banana was put in front of my locker with a note reading, ‘Here’s your lunch, you ******* monkey.’ ” The officers said University of Washington Police Chief John Vinson, who is also Black, was repeatedly criticized by white officers for hiring too many Black people. “White officers called Chief Vinson the n-word on several occasions,” said Officer Russell Ellis said in the claim. Vinson was later reassigned to an administrative position at the university, KOMO-TV reports. University spokesperson Victor Balta said that the college is stunned by the allegations and that the institution has no record of complaints being filed about the issues.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nGlen Jean: The permanent home of the National Scout Jamboree will hold a four-day outdoor festival for the public in September. The Adventure On! Freedom Festival will take place Sept. 10-13 at the 14,000-acre Summit Bechtel Reserve in southern West Virginia, WVVA-TV reports. Among the events will be a free concert featuring the band Lonestar on Sept. 11 for first responders, active-duty or retired military, and law enforcement officers on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The event also will feature motor bike and electric bike racing, swimming, hiking, fishing, skateboarding, target shooting, camping and ziplines. Local vendors also will be allowed to sell their wares. Tickets can be purchased in advance.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Police would be prohibited from enforcing any future federal federal laws banning or restricting the use of guns under a bill the state Senate sent to Gov. Tony Evers on Wednesday. The proposal is part of a national wave of Republican-authored legislation intended to resist a push from President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to tighten gun control laws. The U.S. Constitution dictates that federal law trumps conflicting state law, however, and many previous GOP proposals to thwart gun control laws have been found unconstitutional. Evers, a Democrat, almost certainly will veto the Wisconsin bill. Republicans are pushing forward anyway, knowing the attempt will please their base constituents. The Senate passed the bill on a voice vote Wednesday with no debate, sending the proposal to Evers. The Assembly approved the bill earlier this month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The late world champion rodeo cowboy and country music singer Chris LeDoux has returned to Cheyenne Frontier Days in the form of a huge statue. The bronze featuring LeDoux on a bucking horse arrived Tuesday and was installed on a pedestal at the park where the annual rodeo and Western culture celebration takes place during the last two weeks of July, according to Frontier Days officials. The 125th anniversary Frontier Days will be dedicated to LeDoux. The statue will be dedicated in a ceremony July 23. LeDoux grew up in Cheyenne and performed both in the rodeo and onstage at Frontier Days. He won the 1976 National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. He recorded 36 albums that sold more than 6 million copies. LeDoux died of cancer in 2005 at age 56. The coronavirus pandemic canceled last year’s Frontier Days for the first time in the event’s history.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/23/renegade-rodeo-microsoft-returns-texas-roadhouse-news-around-states/115590028/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: National Guard members will begin immunizing rural residents against COVID-19 this week as Alabama tries to improve a vaccination rate that’s trailing most of the nation. Mobile vaccination clinics will be held Tuesday in Andalusia and Livingston, according to a news release by the state, followed by clinics in Enterprise and Eutaw on Wednesday. Guard teams will provide shots later in the week in Ozark, Greensboro, Abbeville and Marion, and additional clinics are planned elsewhere into April. The National Guard has two teams that are capable of providing at least 1,000 vaccinations a day. It plans to administer about 8,000 doses per week. Appointments aren’t required, and the shots are free. Gov. Kay Ivey said the effort will help as the state looks to get past the coronavirus pandemic. “I encourage everyone eligible to take advantage of this great resource, and please remain patient as we continue working to get our hands on as many doses as we are able from the federal government,” she said in a statement.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Regulators amid much fanfare in early 2020 approved two cannabis lounges in Alaska, making it one of the few states where customers would be allowed to use marijuana at retail pot shops. Then the pandemic hit. One of the sites opened briefly in Ketchikan in October, near the start of a statewide COVID-19 surge that an owner said forced it to hit pause. The other, in Fairbanks, hopes to open later this year. Records showed a small number of other shop owners have filed paperwork signaling plans to seek approval for consumption hangouts – where customers can smoke marijuana or eat or drink marijuana products – though the virus has caused some of them to delay their efforts too. Marijuana businesses were allowed to stay open. Dan Peters, an owner of GoodSinse in Fairbanks, said he was surprised by how many people were buying cannabis. “I think maybe even bulk amounts of purchasing were happening,” he said. “I just assume that people are stuck at home and needed things to do that’s something fun that doesn’t cause too much trouble.” GoodSinse was one of the first two businesses approved for on-site use by the state Marijuana Control Board in January 2020. Over the last year, Peters said he focused on other aspects of the business, which include retail, cultivation and manufacturing, because the pandemic – and social distancing – made it hard to create the experience he wanted for the planned café-style consumption area. As more people are vaccinated, he said he expects to resume work on the consumption area and hopes to open it this summer.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State-run outdoor vaccination sites will switch to nighttime operations or shut down next month in anticipation of hotter temperatures, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Department of Health Services, said officials are already looking at indoor venues with air conditioning to replace the parking lot operations at State Farm Stadium in Glendale and Phoenix Municipal Stadium. The state has identified a site in Mesa that will replace the vaccination clinic at Chandler-Gilbert Community College. “We know come April and May, the weather is going to be getting too warm for our volunteers and patients to be safely outside while our patients are in their cars,” Christ said. The University of Arizona site in Tucson, however, will continue administering vaccines outdoors. Beginning April 4, State Farm Stadium, where the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals play, will only give out doses between the hours of 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. There will be more appointment times added so the capacity of doses administered daily won’t won’t be significantly reduced, according to Christ. She said she is hopeful that will only run for a short time until an indoor site is ready to open.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Sunday he believes his proposal to remove a mask mandate intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus will take place as planned at the end of the month. On CNN’s ‘State of the Union,’ Hutchinson said goals announced in February to lift the mask mandate, which include a positivity rate below 10%, or fewer than 750 hospitalizations, are being met and he believes the mask requirement will be lifted. “I set some goals. And we’re making those goals. So, I expect that (mandate) to be lifted,” Hutchinson said. “Common sense is going to replace mandates. And I think that’s where we are right now. You cannot go beyond the toleration of the American public” to a mandate. Hutchinson said he believes people will continue wearing masks when social distancing is not possible or they are otherwise at risk of virus exposure. Hutchinson’s February announcement lifted restrictions on capacity limits on bars, restaurants, gyms and large venues. The state’s positivity rate was 9% on Thursday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Students in California classrooms can sit 3 feet apart instead of 6 under new guidelines adopted by the state as school officials figure out how to reopen campuses closed for a year during the coronavirus pandemic. The state recommendations announced Saturday came a day after federal health officials relaxed social distancing guidelines for schools nationwide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised at least 3 feet of space between desks in most schools, even in towns and cities where community spread is high, so long as students and teachers wear masks and take other precautions. Local education leaders will have the final say on distancing in California. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second-largest, said it would stick with the 6-foot rule, the LA Times reported Sunday. Some districts across the state will likely embrace the revised rules. But many school systems, including Los Angeles Unified, have approved agreements with their teachers unions that stipulate a 6-foot desk separation, the Times said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State government revenue this year will be significantly higher than expected as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, but that recovery is marked by gross disparities, particularly when it comes to the restaurant and tourism industries and jobs lost by lower-income wage earners, officials said. Two economic forecasts presented to the Joint Budget Committee suggested lawmakers will have more to spend in crafting a balanced budget than they did last year. But demands for that money are many, including restoring the budget cuts, ensuring ambitious stimulus plans are funded, and replenishing a rainy day reserve fund. Colorado’s key hospitality and restaurant industries continue to suffer, and overall, the state has recovered just 57% of all jobs lost since the pandemic began, the legislative report said. Jobs for low-income individuals are down 30% from prepandemic levels, compared to a slight increase for high income earners, the forecast said. A quarterly forecast from the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting suggested the state will have nearly $13 billion in general fund revenue this fiscal year – close to prepandemic levels – and nearly $14 billion in fiscal year 2021-22. Both figures were revised upward by $425 million and $390 million, respectively, from a December forecast.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Connecticut Department of Labor continues to receive a high volume of unemployment claims, with 200,000 to 210,000 people filing weekly. Although that’s down from nearly 400,000 weekly filers in May 2020, it’s still much higher than before the coronavirus pandemic hit the state, when the agency handled an average of 40,000 filers a week. Since March 13, 2020, the department has received 1.4 million unemployment applications over the six programs it administers, a volume usually experienced over a 10-year period. “This past year has been nothing short of devastating for our workforce and our economy. Out of 1.9 million workers in Connecticut, COVID-19 sent nearly 580,000 of them into unemployment,” said Department of Labor Commissioner Kurt Westby in a statement. He noted that the state’s 40-year old computer system was never meant to handle that kind of surge, but the agency’s benefits and technical teams kept the system running and whittled down a backlog of applications. Westby credited the agency’s customer care center with reducing a four-to-six week application processing time during the height of the pandemic to one-to-three days. The center has more than 100 staff members.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: The memory of last summer's ever-changing mask mandates and business restrictions might still haunt Delaware’s beach communities, but summer 2021 is bringing glimpses of optimism and hope. It's not even April yet and many beach rentals are selling out – and not just for the summer, but for the months that bookend the state's favorite season. Airbnb and Vrbo, two major online travel agencies, reported that the Delaware beaches are trending destinations nationwide since the resort towns are near outdoor activities. It also helps that the beaches are within driving distance of several cities – something that has always driven tourism there but has the potential to boost visitors with many still wary of flying. After 26 summers managing rentals in Rehoboth and Dewey Beach, Sheila Davolos said this summer has been “the busiest I’ve ever seen the rental market.” Although she said new listings continue to come in – and her company, Jack Lingo, Realtor, has been booking summer rentals since October – many places are fully booked.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:George Washington University said it will cut varsity of men's rowing and six other sports by the end of this spring, a result of budget cuts because of the pandemic, WUSA-TV reported. In addition to men's rowing, co-ed sailing, men's and women's squash, men's indoor track, men's tennis and women's water polo will be cut. Although George Washington is the only D.C.-area school to announce sports cuts, they are far from alone. In the D.C. region, Hampton University cut men's and women's golf. Old Dominion University disbanded its wrestling program. The university said before the cuts, it sponsored more varsity programs than any of their \"peers in the Atlantic 10 Conference.\" Over the years, those programs \"have increasingly strained resources\" and were already under review before the pandemic struck, the school said. The roughly $200 million hole that pandemic punched in its bottom line made that work more urgent. For student-athletes on cut programs at George Washington, scholarships will still be honored through graduation. The school has also promised to support any athlete choosing to transfer \"in every way possible.\"\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A baby was born with coronavirus antibodies just weeks after her mother was vaccinated against the disease. Doctors believe the baby is among the first with some protection because of the vaccine. The baby’s mother is a front-line health care worker who got her first dose of the Moderna vaccine in late December. Three weeks later, she delivered a baby girl. During a routine testing of the blood that comes from the child’s umbilical cord, Boca Raton pediatricians Dr. Chad Rudnick and Dr. Paul Gilbert had the sample tested for coronavirus antibodies, too. The doctors had a hypothesis: With other vaccines, like the flu shot, if a mother is vaccinated within a certain time frame, her child will be born with some antibodies. Would the COVID-19 vaccine offer the same? Their hunch was right. The family was ecstatic. “Her first question was, ‘What does this mean in terms of protection?’ ” Gilbert said. The doctors couldn’t give her a definite answer. They knew the baby had some protection but they didn’t know how long the antibodies would last or if they were enough to give the child full protection against the virus. Data on this is still lacking. There are also no COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States yet for children younger than 16. What they did know is that the baby being born with some protection was a sign that the world “was turning a corner on this virus,” Rudnick said. Gilbert said they also knew the little girl was probably “one of the first in the world” to be born with antibodies from the vaccine. For now, the doctors are keeping the mother’s identification and other information private.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Hartsfield-Jackson International saw steep drops in traffic in 2020, but with air travel everywhere taking a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic, it still handled more passengers than any other U.S. airport. The airport had 20.6 million passengers boarding flights in 2020 – a 62% decline from a year earlier, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The traffic put Hartsfield-Jackson ahead of Dallas/Fort Worth in second place, Denver in third place, Chicago O’Hare in fourth and Los Angeles International in fifth. Atlanta’s airport has held the No. 1 ranking in the world for passenger traffic since 1998, but 2020 global rankings have not yet been released. Hartsfield-Jackson also handled more flights than O’Hare last year, according to Federal Aviation Administration figures, after O’Hare held the title for the most flights in the world in 2018 and 2019. At the lowest point in April, Hartsfield-Jackson had only 450 flights a day and about 9,000 passengers, down from 2,600 flights a day and 310,000 passengers in prepandemic times, general manager John Selden said. The terminal “was very strange looking, very eerie, very deserted,” Selden said. But “traffic is coming back” and the airport recovered to 2,000 flights a day last weekend. “We look forward to very good passenger traffic coming through spring break and then into summer,” he added.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Two people were arrested and two others were cited during a weekend anti-mask rally in Waikiki on allegations that they violated emergency public health orders related to the coronavirus pandemic. The rally at Kapiolani Park drew hundreds of people on Saturday who protested mask usage and other coronavirus-related health restrictions. Honolulu police officers responded to the gathering organized by the Aloha Freedom Coalition and, at one point, there was a confrontation between protesters and officers that resulted in one woman being forced to the ground. One member of the anti-mask group accused officers of reacting too aggressively. “It’s just doesn’t make any sense,” said Gary Cordery of the Aloha Freedom Coalition. “And everybody’s going, ‘What are you guys arresting her for? What? What’s the crime here? What does she do?’ ” Police officers had given verbal warnings to the crowd to disperse after they allegedly violated of public health orders. The Honolulu Police Department did not immediately respond to requests for comments from Hawaii News Now, the media outlet reported on Sunday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said the state will be deliberative in spending about $2.2 billion it is receiving in the latest round of federal coronavirus relief money. It is the third round of federal relief money coming to Idaho following infusions last fall and last spring. The state received a similar amount in the spring of 2020 as the pandemic was taking hold in Idaho and there was little understanding of the virus and no vaccine. The state was given nine months to spend that money. The state has until 2024 to spend most of the latest infusion. “This time around, we have nearly four years to spend the new funds,\" Little said. “This time around, we’re not in crisis mode. We’ve learned a lot about the disease, how it spreads, and how to best protect ourselves and our loved ones.” The Republican governor said he will work with the Legislature to find projects that will benefit future generations of Idaho residents who will have to pay off the federal debt being added to with the $1.9 trillion federal program. He said that if Idaho didn’t take the money, some other state would get it. “That is unacceptable,” Little said during the 30-minute news conference. “Therefore, Idaho will accept the allocation for our state.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Second City, one of Chicago’s most storied entertainment options and an economic mainstay of its Old Town neighborhood, is to reopen its comedy shows at Piper’s Alley on May 7. Live, and in person. Albeit at reduced audience capacity because of the pandemic. “It’s exciting,” said Jon Carr, the theater’s newly hired executive producer. “After not being able to do them for a year, even the mundane things like planning rehearsals are a thrill.” Carr said the Mainstage and e.t.c. Stages, located in the 1600 block of N. Wells St., will have new shows, performed Thursdays through Sundays, mostly by cast members who were working in each of the theaters at the point of closure roughly a year ago. Neither show will be traditional Second City revues, however. Carr said the plan was to ease back into business and create distinct, hourlong shows made up of new sketch material, improv and archival fare. The reduced running time will allow for more cleaning time between performances, especially because there will be two shows on Friday and Saturday nights. The plan will require approval from the Actors Equity union because Second City long has seen itself as a legitimate theater and operates under a union contract on both stages. Carr said audiences will have to fill out health questionnaires in the lobby and remain masked during the show. Such details as to whether (and how) the theater will be able to serve drinks are yet to be worked out. And ticket prices and performance times are still to be set.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:More than 12,500 Hoosiers have been laid to rest after dying of COVID-19 in the past year. Reimbursement for the funeral expenses is on the way for some. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said last week that the agency has allocated $2 billion to reimburse and pay for COVID-19-related funeral costs – up to $7,000 per family. The program uses funds made available under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021, signed earlier this month. To be eligible, applicants must meet the following conditions: the death occurred in the United States; the death certificate must show COVID-19 as the cause of death. Applicants must be a U.S. citizen, noncitizen national or legal immigrant who paid for a COVID-19 funeral expense past Jan. 20, 2020. However, the deceased does not need to be a U.S. citizen, noncitizen national or legal immigrant. FEMA will begin accepting funeral assistance applications in April. The agency is working to set up a toll-free phone number to apply and will be available soon here.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: In just over three months, the departments of public health from Iowa and Illinois reported the Quad-Cities is the home of 40,644 fully vaccinated residents. That’s a vaccination rate of 12.8% for the entire metro area. The 23,836 adults fully vaccinated in Scott County gives the Iowa side a vaccination rate of 13.7%, and Rock Island County’s vaccination rate of 11.7% is based on 16,808 completed vaccinations. On Friday, the Iowa Department of Public Health reported Scott County’s positivity rate climbed to 5%, just over a full percentage point higher than 10 days ago and higher than the state positivity rate of 3.9%. Iowa Department of Public Health officials reported 34 new COVID-19 cases Friday – double the 17 new cases reported in Rock Island County.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Mayor Michelle De La Isla said she won’t seek reelection, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. She made the announcement Friday. De La Isla, first elected in 2018, said she began thinking about not running during the coronavirus pandemic. She serves on Shawnee County’s COVID-19 Incident Command team and said the workload, combined with her work as mayor, is difficult to balance. She said she is exploring options, but politics isn’t on the list.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Texas Roadhouse Inc. founder Kent Taylor died by suicide last week after battling symptoms following a case of COVID-19, including tinnitus, the company and his family said in a joint statement. He was 65. “After a battle with post-COVID-related symptoms, including severe tinnitus, Kent Taylor took his own life,” according to the statement. “Kent battled and fought hard like the former track champion that he was, but the suffering that greatly intensified in recent days became unbearable.” Taylor founded the restaurant chain in 1993 and most recently was its chief executive officer and chairman. During the pandemic, he donated his entire compensation to support the company’s front-line workers, and recently committed to fund a clinical study to help members of the military who also suffer from tinnitus, according to the statement. Tinnitus is a ringing or noise in the ears even when there’s no external sound. The American Tinnitus Association said the chronic condition is exacerbated by increased stress and anxiety, which are at unprecedented levels because of the pandemic. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior U.S. senator from Kentucky, was among several public figures who paid tribute to Taylor, saying he’d built the company “with creativity, grit and a lot of bold risks.” “From the cooks to the executives, Kent deeply cared about his team,” McConnell said. ”When the pandemic threw everything into uncertainty last year, there was no question what Kent would do.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Centenary College in Shreveport said the 2021 class will be recognized at a morning ceremony on May 8, and an afternoon ceremony is set for those whose May 2020 ceremony was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commencement speaker for both ceremonies will be Dr. Diya Surie. She is a 2006 Centenary graduate who went on to earn a medical degree at Louisiana Health Sciences Center in New Orleans. She is a medical officer at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infections.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Maine Arts Commission said it has made $127,000 available for artists and cultural organization affected by the coronavirus pandemic. It will take more money to meet the needs of Maine’s artists and art organizations, commissioner executive director David Greenham said. Arts and culture venues were among the first to close when the pandemic upended the worldwide economy. “The arts are critical to Maine’s success, and the artistic community is anxiously optimistic that we may soon safely welcome the public to our performing arts venues, museums, galleries, artist studios, workshops, fairs and festivals,” Greenham said. The commissioner said the money will be distributed directly to the artists and groups.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Officials at Loyola University announced plans to return to a full in-person format for the fall semester, including a full range of classes, athletics, and other in-person events and experiences. The university said on its website that it will have secondary plans in place in the event additional steps are needed to continue to halt the spread of COVID-19, such as allowing for extra space in classrooms.. Plans for the fall will include accommodations for students whose health or immigration status will prevent their returning to campus for in-person education. Testing will still continue and isolation space will be available for students who are not fully vaccinated and test positive, the school said. Loyola is encouraging members of the school community to get one of the available COVID-19 vaccines. Loyola offered online instruction during the fall semester of 2020, but students returned for hybrid instruction this semester, as well as a chance for undergraduate students to live on campus.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state made about 800,00O additional residents eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and relaxed restrictions on many business and public events. Residents aged 60 to 64, as well as hundreds of thousands of workers in essential industries including supermarkets, restaurants, public transit and funeral homes, can now book a vaccine appointment. In good news for sports fans, Gillette Stadium, TD Garden, and Fenway Park can welcome back fans up to 12% capacity after submitting a plan to the state Department of Public Health. People coming to Massachusetts, including visitors and residents returning home, are now required to quarantine for 10 days upon arrival if they have been out of the state for longer than a 24-hour period. The advisory does not apply to people who are fully vaccinated. Gov. Charlie Baker relaxed the restrictions despite advice from a coalition of public health officials urging a delay in reopening limits, saying there is a danger of another surge. Also Monday, the state's latest mass vaccination site at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston's Back Bay became fully operational after a soft launch last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Starting Monday, hundreds of school districts in the state had to offer at least 20 hours a week of in-person instruction to receive all of a minimum $450-per-student increase in emergency pandemic funding. The provision affects 206, or 38%, of the state’s 537 traditional K-12 districts – those with higher numbers or percentages of children from middle-class and wealthy families. Under federal law, the districts are due to receive a smaller share of nearly $1.5 billion in COVID-19 aid than are districts and charter schools with higher numbers or portions of poor students. The Republican-led Legislature allocated $136 million in state money to ensure hundreds of districts still get at least $450 more per pupil, but it added a string. Those with five-day schedules must provide at least 20 hours of weekly face-to-face instruction to qualify for the supplemental dollars. Districts that were not providing 20 hours had less than two weeks to alter their schedules after the law was signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on March 9, frustrating school officials who had unsuccessfully asked GOP lawmakers for more time.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials on Sunday confirmed 956 new COVID-19 cases, raising the total number of infections to more than 505,000 since the start of the pandemic. The update showed five deaths from complications of the disease, for a total of 6,782 fatalities statewide. The ranking for number of cases in comparison to population has been rising in Minnesota in the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. There were about 270 new cases per 100,000 people in the state since March 6, which ranks 12th in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 712 people in Minnesota tested positive in the past week, researchers said. Health officials said at least 1,408,601 residents have received one dose of a COVID vaccine and 839,860 people have completed their inoculations.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The State Department of Health reported 95 new cases of COVID-19 and no coronavirus-related deaths on Monday. Since the virus hit the state in March 2020, a total of 302,932 cases and 6,956 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon:As the amount of COVID-19 vaccine starts to increase, leaders of the St. Louis region are putting out a call for volunteers, especially clinicians who can give shots. Three vaccines are now available, and Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he expects a large influx of vaccine in April, so much so that the state is opening vaccinations to all adults starting April 9. St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said Monday that the county is aiming for 15,000 vaccinations this week, which would be a record, and he expects even more in the coming weeks. “To prepare for the vaccine surge we will need more volunteers to help us,” Page said. In addition to vaccinators, he asked for volunteers for nonclinical roles such as greeters and line monitors. Dr. Alex Garza of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force made a similar plea in a news conference last week. He said volunteers are important to help get more people vaccinated and “get immunity into our community at a faster rate.” Page also urged residents to continue with protocols such as wearing a mask and avoiding large crowds. “We cannot have a healthy economy without healthy residents,” Page said.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Cascade City-County Health Department said it is lifting its mask mandate and 75% capacity restrictions following a second week of a COVID-19 case rate at or below 10 per 100,000. In February, the health department said if the county maintained a case rate below that threshold for consecutive weeks, it would lift the restrictions. Last week, the county reported a rate of 9.6 per 100,000. \"Please be mindful that now, although lifting restrictions is a good sign for our community, businesses, schools and other agencies have the right to implement stricter requirements to protect their stakeholders and staff,\" the department wrote in a press release. The health department also advised that community members be mindful of \"what got us to this point,\" which included practices such as social distancing, good hygiene, wearing face coverings and staying home when sick. The mask mandate at Great Falls Public Schools will remain in effect because it was put in place through the district's reopening plan.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: Vaccinations might be slowing the spread of COVID-19, but not the spread of hunger. Many people still are struggling with lost or reduced paychecks as the year-old pandemic drags on. Dick Cochran, founder and president of Hot Meals USA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farmers to Families food program are assisting hungry people. The program is part of a $3 billion effort that distributes surplus produce, dairy and meat products to food-insecure people. Last week, cars drove slowly into the Ag building at the Buffalo County Fairgrounds and stopped as volunteers loaded free boxes of food into their trunks. People got as many boxes as they requested. No ID was required. No questions were asked. The Kearney Hub reported that scenes like that have been repeated weekly since Cochran learned of the program last June and offered to oversee the food distribution in the city.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is changing course and now plans in-person spring graduation ceremonies in May as the coronavirus outbreak slows. UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in a letter to students and staff that he firmly believes the university “can offer a traditional commencement while adhering to public health guidelines.” Whitfield said there would be two ceremonies for spring 2021 graduates at 8 a.m. on May 14 and May 15 and a third ceremony for 2020 graduates at 6:30 p.m. May 14. All three ceremonies will be held at Sam Boyd Stadium. Each graduate will be allowed up to four guests, with everyone required to follow social distancing guidelines and wear face coverings. Whitfield said holding the in-person graduation ceremonies is contingent on approval from local and state authorities and COVID-19 numbers continuing to decline.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Schools in multiple communities were closed Monday because of staff absences attributed to vaccine side-effects. Teachers, school staff and child care workers became eligible for the vaccine last week, and vaccination clinics were held in numerous locations over the weekend. School was canceled Monday in Concord because of staff reactions to vaccines, said Assistant Superintendent Donna Palley. A message on the Hillsboro-Deering district website described a similar situation. “A large number of staff members received their COVID vaccines (Sunday) and many are reporting feeling very ill. There will be no remote or in-person learning for the high school (Monday),” the message said.The main side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. include pain at the injection site and flu-like fever, fatigue and headache.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Even the Super Bowl couldn’t lift the fortunes for Atlantic City's casinos, as they posted declines from the same time just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit New Jersey, according to state figures. Total gaming revenue for February was $258.5 illion, a 6% drop from $275 million in the same period last year, according to the Division of Gaming Enforcement. When the state's racetracks are factored in, the total margin of loss is much narrower: $288.3 million this February compared with $287.3 million in February 2020. The monthly figures continue to reflect the new reality for casinos in the pandemic, even as restrictions slowly lift: Online gaming and sports betting are money-makers, but casino business is down. However, the total gaming revenue for the industry increased 8% in the first two months of the year, to $634.4 million, compared with $587.8 million in January and February of 2020, gaming enforcement said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The 42nd annual Baca Rodeo Series was held each Saturday from Feb. 13 through March 13 but operated in violation of the New Mexico emergency COVID-19 public health orders with hundreds in attendance each weekend. The Casper Baca Rodeo Company founded the series in 1976 in San Fidel, a town in Cibola County near Grants. The series has been held in Belen in recent history. This year, it was moved to the Landmark Arena located off Stern Drive in Mesquite. C.J. Baca, son of Casper Baca, was the coordinator for the event and said Landmark Mercantile opened the doors to its private arena when asked, allowing the company to move forward with holding the rodeo. The arena is owned by Jason McClure of Landmark Mercantile, a feed and supply store in Mesquite. COVID-19 restrictions were not enforced, according to Baca. All were welcome to attend and people were free to decide whether to wear a mask and social distance. “We do it the way it needs to be done,” Baca said of the rodeo. “Everybody needs sunshine and entertainment. The pandemic was a big bummer to a lot of people and people just kind of need some excitement, so we went on with the show.” However, McClure said they handed out masks to people and their agreement with New Mexico State Police was that they made sure people social distanced and were not in large groups. He added that people were not forced to attend the rodeo, and the people who did were considerate of other attendees. Nora Meyers Sackett, press secretary for the office of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the office was not aware of the rodeo being held and that the state would look into it.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is expanding eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine to everyone aged 50 and older, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. The governor said newly eligible people can start signing up for vaccines starting at 8 a.m. Tuesday. Currently, everyone aged 60 and older can get vaccinated, as well as certain essential workers and people with select health conditions that leave them at-risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Cuomo said the state can expand eligibility because of promises from the federal government that vaccine supplies will keep increasing. It’s unknown how many people are now eligible for vaccines in New York. “We will have enough vaccine to vaccinate people,” Cuomo said. “We have to make sure we have the capacity and willingness to take the vaccine.” Local and county officials for weeks have urged the Cuomo administration to ease restrictions on eligibility and who can administer vaccines to help speed up vaccinations. The governor has said low vaccine supplies have held up distribution early on in New York’s rollout, but he has eased eligibility restrictions in recent weeks. New York has now provided at least one dose of the vaccine to about one-fourth of its population of 19 million residents. That’s in line with the national average, according to federal data.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: Duke University has lifted a stay-in-place order it issued last week for all undergraduate students following a spike in COVID-19 cases that officials blamed largely on students attending fraternity rush events. The lifting of the order Sunday morning meant all courses will resume their standard delivery method, whether in-person or hybrid. Students living in university-provided housing are again allowed to move about campus but are being asked to leave campus only for essential travel and health-related activities through Sunday. Students living off-campus in the Durham area are permitted to be on campus only to attend in-person classes and essential academic activities, participate in surveillance testing, seek medical care or pick up food orders. Libraries will reopen for undergraduates, but indoor dining on campus is not allowed. Indoor gatherings are limited to 10 people, on or off campus, unless permission for a larger student event is granted. The stay-in-place order was imposed March 13 after a week in which more than 180 students were in isolation after testing positive, and another 200 students were in quarantine as a result of contact tracing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials on Sunday reported 49 new cases of COVID-19, lifting the total number of positive tests to 137 for the weekend and 101,514 since the start of the pandemic. The state lab processed a typical light load of 801 tests in the last day, for a positivity rate of more than 7%. One death was confirmed over the weekend, for a total of 1,461 fatalities. Hospitalizations have increased from 13 to 18 in the last two days, with six people being treated in intensive care units. There were about 164 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranked 37th in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. One in every 1,152 people in the state tested positive in the past week.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine predicted a chaotic future for Ohio in a letter Monday pleading with fellow Republican lawmakers to compromise on a health bill that would handicap the state’s ability to issue any orders during an emergency. In the five-page letter, the Republican governor laid out what he sees as the perils of the legislation passed by the GOP-controlled House and Senate earlier this month and how it will impede the administrative branch’s ability to protect Ohioans, not only during the coronavirus pandemic but also amid weather emergencies, food contaminations, prison riots, or terrorist attacks. In his letter, DeWine also warned members of his party of the onslaught of lawsuits that will flood the state’s courthouses under a provision of the bill that would allow anyone who feels aggrieved by a local or state health order to sue. DeWine promised to veto the bill that came to his desk two weeks ago but ended the letter with an invitation for lawmakers to find a compromise. Senate President Matt Huffman and House Speaker Bob Cupp said the chambers have enough votes to override the governor’s veto.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine will have no impact on life insurance coverage or benefits, Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready said in response to what he said was misinformation circulating online. Mulready said all three vaccines being distributed in Oklahoma are safe and effective and have received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “I assure you that getting a COVID-19 vaccine will not impact your life insurance benefits,\" Mulready said in a statement. Oklahoma ranks 13th in the nation with 25.3% of its population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, above the national average.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Gov. Kate Brown said she is accelerating Oregon's COVID-19 vaccine eligibility timeline in order for vulnerable populations to receive shots ahead of May 1, when all adults will become eligible. In addition, beginning Monday, counties that have largely completed vaccinating residents who are 65 or older can begin administering shots to the next eligible groups, along with migrant and seasonal farm workers. Lane County will move ahead with the accelerated vaccination schedule on Monday, according to Lane County Public Health spokesman Jason Davis. He said the county feels comfortable with where it is concerning vaccinating people 65 and older, and can move on to also vaccinating the next eligible group, which includes adults between 45 and 64 with one or more underlying health conditions with increased risk and several other categories. On the accelerated eligibility timeline, beginning March 29, those eligible for the vaccine, Group 6, will be people 45-64 with underlying health conditions, migrant and seasonal farm workers, seafood and agricultural workers, food processing workers, people living in low-income senior housing, senior congregate and independent living, homeless people, people displaced by the 2020 wildfires, wildland firefighters and pregnant people 16 and older.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state eased its mask mandate to allow people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to gather with other vaccinated people without masks or social distancing, state health officials said Monday. The new rules also apply to vaccinated people gathering with people from a single household who have not been vaccinated but who are considered at low risk of severe disease from the coronavirus – such as vaccinated grandparents visiting with healthy grandchildren. Vaccinated people also no longer have to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19, as long as they do not develop symptoms, state health officials said. Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam revised the state’s existing masking order to to align with recent guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state said vaccinated people should continue wearing masks and socially distance in public, and when visiting with people in multiple households or with those who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. All other aspects of the state’s current masking order remain in force.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: The city on Monday opened COVID-19 vaccination eligibility to all adults who live in the city. Residents must be 18 or older to receive a Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccine or 16 or older for a Pfizer shot, Mayor Donald Grebien said. “There is a demand in the community for vaccines, and we are very excited to encourage all residents to receive the vaccine when they are able to get an appointment,” he said. “We are continuing to work with the state through the High Density Community initiatives in order to continuously get vaccines in the arms of Pawtucket residents.” Pawtucket has been one of the hardest-hit communities in the state, with more than 10,000 residents, or more than 14% of the population, testing positive at some point, according to state Department of Health data. The city is expecting additional vaccinations in the coming weeks and will continue encouraging residents to stay tuned to the city’s vaccination website for available dates and times. It might take some time to book an appointment, city leaders said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: All nursing homes and assisted-living facilities in South Carolina are now required to allow outdoor visitation under updated guidelines announced by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. All facilities are also required to allow indoor visitation, with few exceptions. Before the ruling, the department said facilities in just 40 of the state's 46 counties were eligible for visitation because the county COVID-19 rates were below a 10% threshold. There were 177 facilities in the six counties that exceeded the 10% rate that were not allowing visitation. Through last Wednesday, though, all 46 counties had below 10%, thus outdoor visitation must be allowed at all 193 nursing homes and 495 assisted-living facilities statewide, according to the department. Greenville County's COVID-19 rate was 5.5%; Spartanburg County's was 5%; Anderson County, 3.8%; and Pickens County, 2.3%. Indoor visitation must also be allowed in every facility unless less than 70% of its residents are fully vaccinated or if a new positive case is identified. In that case, the facility must suspend indoor visitation pending results of a round of testing. Also, there can be limits on indoor visitation if residents are in quarantine.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state Department of Health opened vaccinations to another priority group Monday. Group 1E includes fire personnel and critical infrastructure workers, which covers employees in industries like water and wastewater, energy, finance, food service, food and agriculture, legal, manufacturing, shelter and housing, transportation and logistics, information technology and communications. The group includes approximately 227,000 South Dakotans. Currently, 37% of South Dakotans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and 23% are fully vaccinated. Health officials on Sunday reported no change in the number of active COVID-19 cases and a drop in hospitalizations.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon allow all residents 16 and older to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Bill Lee said Monday. Tennessee had been distributing the vaccine to health care workers, first responders, senior citizens and people 16 and older who have high-risk health conditions – including cancer, hypertension, obesity and pregnancy – as well as caregivers and household residents of medically fragile children. However, starting Monday, Lee said two new groups would be eligible, including Tennesseans 55 and older and those who work in critical infrastructure industries. By April 5, anyone 16 and older will be able to receive the shot. “The federal government has asked us to make sure every adult can receive access by May 1, and Tennessee will beat that deadline,” Lee, a Republican, said in a video announcement, noting that a few counties were planning on starting earlier but didn’t disclose which ones. State data showed that about 19% of the total population was at least partially vaccinated against the disease that has killed more than 11,600 people in Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of newly reported coronavirus virus cases in Texas declined Sunday and the rolling average of cases in the state is down 36.1%. There were a reported 1,905 new virus cases Sunday, according to the Texas health department, compared to 3,673 new cases on Saturday. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Texas dropped during the past two weeks from 6,189.7 a day on March 5 to 3,953.1 on March 19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The Johns Hopkins data showed 47,346 deaths from COVID-19 since the pandemic began, the third-highest total in the nation. The seven-day rolling average of deaths in the state, however, has fallen from 247.1 on March 5 to 133.1 on March 19, according to the Johns Hopkins data.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The state reported 3,250 new cases of coronavirus in the week ending Sunday, down 7.9% from the previous week. There were a reported 3,529 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Utah ranked 28th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Cases fell in three counties, with the best declines in Salt Lake, Davis and Utah counties. Utah ranked 47th among states in share of people receiving at least one shot, with 21.7% of its residents at least partially vaccinated. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 129,856 vaccine doses, compared to 174,328 the previous week. In all, Utah reported it has administered 1,137,351 doses.\n\nVermont\n\nNewport: The Department of Corrections reported three new positive cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 at the Northern State Correctional Facility. The cases were found in testing done Thursday, and they were in the same unit as the past four rounds of positive results among inmates. No staff tested positive. There are 33 cases among inmates and three among staff. The department said 145 inmates who had tested positive are no longer positive for the coronavirus and they have been cleared to leave isolation. The entire facility was scheduled to be tested again Monday. The outbreak began after one staff member and 21 inmates tested positive in sampling done on Feb. 23.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam’s office said in a statement Monday that the coronavirus pandemic has lead to a decline in completion rates of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. The Virginia College Access Network and the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia have partnered to offer one-on-one FAFSA assistance. Students and families can go to virginiacan.org/fafsa to schedule a virtual meeting and connect with an advisor until June 30. Virginia has seen 4,300 fewer high school seniors complete the FAFSA. That’s a drop of nearly 10% compared to last year. The decline also mirrors the 9% drop in FAFSA completion rates across the country. “Completing the FAFSA can be difficult under normal circumstances, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and shift to remote learning have added to the challenge of assisting our high school seniors with filling out their forms,” the Democratic governor said.\n\nWashington\n\nRedmond: Microsoft will begin bringing workers back to its suburban Seattle global headquarters on March 29 as the tech giant starts to reopen more facilities it largely shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic. In a post Monday on the company’s corporate blog, Executive Vice President Kurt DelBene said Microsoft has been monitoring local health data and decided it can bring more employees back to its Redmond campus. DelBene said workers will have the choice to return to headquarters, continue working remotely or do a combination of both. More than 50,000 people work at the company’s campus in Redmond, 15 miles east of Seattle. On Monday, the state moved into Phase 3 of its COVID-19 reopening plan, meaning all of its 39 counties will be allowed to relax coronavirus restrictions.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state will immediately open COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to all residents aged 16 and older, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The state becomes one of the few in the nation to lift virtually all eligibility requirements way ahead of President Joe Biden’s goal of allowing all adults to get shots starting on May 1. Justice said the state will continue prioritizing doses for residents 65 and over. “Now is our time. Let’s go West Virginia,” he said. “Let’s get everybody in this state vaccinated.” There are about 1.43 million people 18 and older in the state, according to census data. State data showed that about 25% of the total population was partially vaccinated, and 15% were fully inoculated against the disease that has killed 2,612 in West Virginia. The state previously was allowing shots for all residents 50 and over, essential workers of any age and individuals 16 and over who had underlying medical conditions.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers signed a bill Monday that allows dentists to administer COVID-19 vaccinations, the same day that more than 2 million more people became eligible for shots. The Republican-authored bill allows dentists who complete eight hours of training on vaccine protocols and record-keeping to administer shots. Dentists in neighboring Minnesota and Illinois are permitted to give the vaccine. About 3,500 dentists in Wisconsin could be enlisted to help vaccinate. Evers’ administration announced earlier this month that people age 16 and older with certain preexisting conditions would be eligible on Monday, a week earlier than previously announced. Qualifying conditions include moderate to severe asthma; cancer; diabetes; high blood pressure, Down syndrome; and being overweight with a body mass index of 25 or above. Women who are pregnant are also eligible. Department of Health Services Secretary Karen Timberlake urged people to be patient as they try to book vaccination appointments, warning some vaccinators might have waiting lists. The general public will become eligible on May 1, according to state health officials.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Lawmakers are working on competing proposals to address a projected $300 million shortfall in K-12 education funding over the next two years – and are looking to solutions for a longer-term deficit in school funding. The state’s rainy day fund of about $1.3 billion is available to cover the short-term shortfall. But House legislators are working on a bill that would phase in cuts of about $68 million over the next three years, and a Senate proposal would cut $130 million from the school finance model, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. Lawmakers are working on a solution with two weeks left in the legislative session.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/27/python-haul-beef-theft-ring-kansa-warrior-statue-news-around-states/50877423/", "title": "Python haul, beef theft ring: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Supreme Court has upheld a decision removing a probate judge from office who was accused of racist and sexually inappropriate behavior that included showing an explicit video to an employee and making inappropriate comments after George Floyd’s murder by a police officer. The justices last week unanimously upheld the 2021 decision by the Court of the Judiciary – a disciplinary panel that hears complaints against judges – to remove Randy Jinks as Talladega County probate judge. The Alabama Court of the Judiciary, the panel tasked with hearing ethics complaints against judges, last year ruled that Jinks failed to uphold the integrity and independence of the court system. The initial complaint against Jinks included that he made derogatory comments about women and African Americans, including references to Floyd, whose death sparked nationwide protests. The panel ruled that there was clear and convincing evidence that Jinks had displayed inappropriate behavior that included showing an explicit video to an employee; asking an attorney if he knew of an acronym involving a racial slur; asking a Black employee if he was selling drugs after he purchased a new car; and other inappropriate comments.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The running mate of Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Pierce said Tuesday that she’s withdrawing from the campaign team and urging voters to support Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s reelection bid instead. Edie Grunwald, who was running for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Pierce, in a statement cited “recent circumstances” surrounding Pierce that led her to make her decision. The decision was announced two weeks before the Nov. 8 election. Pierce, a former Kenai Peninsula Borough mayor, was sued last week by a woman who said he sexually harassed her when she worked as an assistant. The lawsuit also lists the borough as a defendant. Pierce did not immediately return a message from the Associated Press on Tuesday. On Saturday, after a candidate forum in Anchorage, he told the AP he had no plans to end his campaign. Grunwald, in her statement, said: “I support and advocate for the respectful treatment of women in politics, the workplace and the world in general. I believe my stepping down at this time is in the best interest of Alaskans and a demonstration of my support for all women, regardless of political affiliation.” Early and absentee in-person voting began Monday.\n\nArizona\n\nPeach Springs: Five people in a tour group have been rescued after spending more than 24 hours underground at the Grand Canyon Caverns due to an elevator malfunction, authorities said Tuesday. Coconino County Sheriff’s officials said there were no reported injuries, and nobody in the party suffered any medical issues requiring treatment on the scene Monday night. The names and ages of the tourists weren’t immediately released Tuesday, but authorities said the group included a husband and wife and a second couple with two young children and at least two people were in their 70s. Authorities said one man was able to take the emergency staircase to the surface to seek help prior to the other five people being rescued. According to its website, the Grand Canyon Caverns is tourist attraction 12 miles east of Peach Springs that allows visitors to tour inside an ancient cave, dine and stay in an underground motel. A group were taking a 30-minute tour of the caverns about noon Sunday when sheriff’s officials said they were notified about 8:30 p.m. that people were stranded at the bottom of the elevator some 21 stories below ground. After assessing the situation over the phone and with personnel from Grand Canyon Caverns, sheriff’s officials say it was determined that the stranded party could stay overnight in a hotel suite.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The city will be in focus as the face of homelessness for a crew making a documentary on those living without a roof over their heads this November. In Fort Smith, homeless people live outdoors year-round, some in makeshift camps near the Arkansas River or sleeping along northside streets with day shelters and food pantries. Unhoused women and veterans are the focus of an ongoing nationwide documentary effort on film coming soon. Some of the common factors of homelessness for women involve domestic violence and divorce, said California documentary filmmaker Robert Craig. Craig said he knows Fort Smith is a destination for filming as part of “No Address,” the documentary title, because of people who are not only experiencing homelessness in the River Valley but because organizations are addressing growing needs. Craig said he has never visited Fort Smith. The heat of the summer and a winter storm added to challenges for those living without shelter in Fort Smith. Colder days are ahead. “I do know that the reason we’re going there (Fort Smith) is that there are important areas that we want to capture with encampments and the organizations that are trying to reduce homelessness and interviewing them,” Craig said. “So we are excited about that.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The City Council was forced to recess Wednesday to clear chanting protesters from its chamber, as members were poised to formally rebuke two council members and the council’s former president for their involvement in a racism scandal. A small but noisy group crowded into the main aisle of an otherwise mostly empty chamber, banged water bottles on a lectern, whooped and shouted in what appeared to be an effort to shut down the meeting. They unrolled a large sign calling the council “illegitimate.” “Justice now!” they chanted. “Shut down!” After multiple warnings to take seats, council leaders called the recess to clear the room. That led to something of a standoff in which about 20 protesters continued shouting, as police officers watched over the group. Council members earlier had left the room. Council President Paul Krekorian warned the protesters they would not deter the council’s business. “We will continue to do the work of the people of Los Angeles,” he said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A potential election worker in Larimer County reported receiving a fake phone call earlier this month spreading disinformation about working the upcoming November election. The call – which was reported to the Larimer County Clerk and Recorder’s Office on Oct. 6 – informed the potential election worker that “Larimer County requires all Election Judges to be vaccinated in order to work in the Election,” according to a notice about the call issued by the county’s election operation manager. Larimer County does not require vaccination or proof of vaccination to work during the election, according to the notice. “I said, ‘Not in my county,’ ” Clerk and Recorder Angela Myers said of her reaction to hearing of the report. The call came from a spoofed phone number, modified to look like it came from the “Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk,” according to the notice. The number comes from a Long Beach, California, area code. Myers said she called the number, but it was not a working line. A reporter also called the number and got the same result. No other similar calls have been reported to the clerk’s office, and no other election-related concerns have been reported to the clerk’s office this election cycle, Myers said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Newly released tax documents show Gov. Ned Lamont, a former cable television entrepreneur, earned more than $54 million last year, most of it from investment earnings. It marks a big increase in income when compared to Lamont’s previous tax documents, released in April by his reelection campaign. Those showed his adjusted gross income for the first three of his four years in office had totaled nearly $26 million. The governor is not accepting the $150,000 state salary for governors. Lamont, who files his taxes separately from his wife, Annie, a successful venture capital consultant, had sought a filing extension from the IRS and didn’t release his 2021 returns until Friday. His reelection campaign allowed reporters to review cover sheets of Lamont’s federal and state tax returns, which showed the Democrat paid $12.8 million in federal taxes and $3.7 million in state taxes for the 2021 tax year. The campaign also included a list of organizations that benefited from $1.6 million in charitable contributions distributed by the governor’s philanthropy fund. The list of groups includes the Boy Scouts of America, Council on Foreign Relations, Yale University and 4-CT, the independent, nonprofit charity Lamont helped to create during the early days of the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Plans for a second library in the city have raised complaints that the money could be better spent elsewhere and that Wilmington doesn’t need a second such facility. Last month Gov. John Carney announced plans to build a new $22 million library on North Market Street, a project spearheaded by state Sen. Darius Brown. Just one month earlier, state Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha announced plans to renovate the existing library, also on North Market, a mere 5-minute walk from the proposed location of the new one. Several comments under a social media post announcing the new library claimed that the existing library is underused. Even Linda Gray, the city council member who represents the district in which both libraries would exist, has her reservations, said that the neighborhood is a food desert, that “there’s enough libraries around” and that the area has bigger needs. State Librarian Annie Norman said there are valid reasons for having the two facilities in the same area. The existing location will continue to operate much like a traditional library but with added space for activities and speaker and author events. The new library will provide meeting space, literacy programs, workforce development resources, digital technology access and computer skills training, and resources for entrepreneurship.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Public Library has extended its hours. Starting Nov. 14, branches will be open until 9 p.m. during the week, WUSA-TV reports. The extended times will provide 15 more hours of operations per week at libraries across the district. These added hours will help patrons more easily visit the library and pick up books after work, as well as give people the opportunity to attend workshops.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A 19-year-old South Florida man captured 28 Burmese pythons during a 10-day competition that was created to increase awareness about the threats the invasive snakes pose to the state’s ecology. Matthew Concepcion was among the 1,000 participants from 32 states, Canada and Latvia who participated in the annual challenge, which removed 231 of the unwanted pythons, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said in a news release. For his efforts, Concepcion was awarded the $10,000 Ultimate Grand Prize courtesy of the Bergeron Everglades Foundation. Dustin Crum won a $1,500 grand prize for removing the longest python, at just over 11 feet. Earlier this year, a team of biologists hauled in the heaviest Burmese python ever captured in Florida. That female python weighed in at 215 pounds, was nearly 18 feet long and had 122 developing eggs, according to the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. Burmese pythons aren’t protected except by Florida’s anti-cruelty law, so participants had to document that each one was killed humanely. Concepcion told the South Florida SunSentinel he’s been hunting pythons for about five years and typically looks for them at night because that’s when they’re on the move, seeking the warmth of roads.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge on Wednesday ordered former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to testify before a special grand jury that’s investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies illegally tried to sway Georgia’s results in the 2020 election. Meadows, a former GOP congressman, is a key figure in the investigation. He traveled to Georgia, sat in on Trump’s phone calls with state officials, and coordinated and communicated with outside influencers who were either encouraging or discouraging the pressure campaign. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the investigation last year into actions taken by Trump and others to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the state. Meadows is just one of several associates and advisers of the Republican ex-president whose testimony Willis has sought. Because Meadows doesn’t live in Georgia, Willis, a Democrat, had to use a process that involved getting a judge where he lives in South Carolina to order him to appear. First, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury, signed off on a petition certifying that Meadows was a “necessary and material witness.” Now, Circuit Court Judge Edward Miller in Pickens County, South Carolina, has honored McBurney’s finding and ordered Meadows to .\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Concerns about lead contamination have led to staff shortages at a public shooting range, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The federal government is suing a small town near Grand Teton National Park for dumping toxic waste from its sewage treatment plant into a stream that feeds several scenic rivers in the region. The lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice was filed in Idaho’s U.S. District Court on Monday. The federal government contends the city of Driggs violated the Clean Water Act by dumping effluent with too much e. coli and ammonia or otherwise violated wastewater permit rules more than 2,600 times over the past seven years. The effluent was released into Woods Creek, which flows into the Teton River, Henry’s Fork, and the Snake and Columbia Rivers on its way to the Pacific Ocean. The Teton River and Henry’s Fork are renown fly fishing locations, drawing anglers from around the world. The violations, if proven, could put the city of about 2,100 people on the hook for more than $160 million in fines. In written statement, the city of Driggs said the lawsuit was a positive development because it will allow the EPA and city officials to work together to come up with solutions. “Although it seems scary to be sued by the Department of Justice, it’s actually an opportunity to receive support and resources” from the federal government, Driggs Mayor August Christensen wrote in the statement.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A former Teamsters union boss who was once one of the most powerful labor leaders in Chicago was sentenced Wednesday to 19 months in federal prison for extorting $325,000 from the head of a film studio in the city. The sentence comes more than three years after John Coli Sr. pleaded guilty to extortion, faced with secret recordings made by Cinespace Chicago Film Studios President Alex Pissios in which Coli could be heard threatening a union strike if Pissios didn’t pay him. In one tape, Coli tells Pissios that he would have union workers walking a picket line that would shut the studio down “within an hour” if he didn’t continue making the secret payments. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss several counts against the 63-year-old Coli in exchange for his guilty plea to receiving prohibited payments as a union official and making a false income tax return. In exchange, Coli agreed to cooperate with federal investigators and that cooperation helped build an extortion case that landed former state Sen. Thomas Cullerton in prison this year. Cullerton pleaded guilty to embezzlement charges for improperly taking more than $248,000 from the Teamsters.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Housing Agency, the federal agency responsible for providing housing to low-income tenants in the city, has been battling a cyberattack for the past three weeks that’s compromised their entire information technology system. The agency has not released details about the motive or identity of the individuals behind the ransomware attack, which is a type of malicious software often unknowingly downloaded onto computers through methods such as innocuous email attachments. The software prevents users from accessing computer files and systems. It can result in massive disruptions and loss of information. As the name suggests, ransomware attacks can involve demands for ransom payments in exchange for the system being restored. The ransomware attack delayed the Indianapolis Housing Agency’s ability to send out October rent payments to landlords for the federal housing choice voucher program, also known as Section 8, which 8,000 Indianapolis families depend on. Section 8 provides rental assistance to very low-income families, the elderly, and disabled individuals for housing on the private market, and the agency administers the program for Indianapolis.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state dished out $238,000 in unemployment compensation to people who were either incarcerated or dead, according to a new report. Iowa Workforce Development issued the payments because agency officials were not using or checking systems designed to detect fraud, according to the review State Auditor Rob Sand released Tuesday. The annual report examined practices by the agency during the fiscal year that ended in June 2020, about three months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps more than any other government agency, Iowa Workforce Development was inundated during those months as hundreds of thousands of workers lost their jobs amid shutdowns ordered while the deadly virus began to sweep through the state. During a 15-week period beginning that March, 365,000 people filed unemployment claims with the state. That’s more than the 285,000 claims that the state received in all of the previous two years. Amid that crunch, the state did not run claims through a computer system to check whether applicants’ personal information matched those of inmates, according to the audit. Among other reasons, an inmate is ineligible for unemployment because a federal law requires that a recipient be “available for work.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: People who want a selfie with the bronze statue of a Kansa warrior atop the Statehouse may soon be able to snap that photo with a replica statue closer to the ground. The second statue of Ad Astra is already made and has been sitting in storage in Salina since before the word “selfie” became part of English vocabulary. It’s waiting to be placed on a pedestal that sits empty. “The intent was always to finish the Ad Astra plaza as it was started 20 years ago,” said state Sen. Elaine Bowers, R-Concordia. “And on top of the pedestal is nothing, and the pedestal is waiting for the 8-foot statue.” The Capitol Preservation Committee is moving forward with completing the project after a Tuesday meeting and a subcommittee meeting earlier this month. The 6-foot granite pedestal is already on the plaza southwest of the Statehouse. The 8-foot bronze replica of the dome sculpture would be mounted on top of the pedestal, surrounded by bronze plaques. Three of the plaques have already been cast, with 19 more needing to be done. Former state Sen. Randall Hardy, R-Salina, has been an advocate for completing the project and said he believes the addition will be an attraction. “The statue will be a magnet to draw people to the to that part of the Statehouse grounds,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Campbell: Staff are using controlled burn techniques to manage a fire that started in a training area last week. The fire started Friday near Trigg County during routine training, Fort Campbell said in a news release Tuesday. Clinton Allen, Directorate of Public Works conservation branch chief, said workers are using back fires to make a buffer. “The back burns will help keep it from getting closer to the boundary with Land Between the Lakes,” Allen said. The Forestry Section of the DPW Environmental Division annually burns about 20,000 acres to support training operations and preserve the natural environment, the post said. The fire has burned through several hundred acres in an area where controlled burns are held. Anyone across the installation’s rear training area should watch for potential hazards if they see smoke and fire and contact dispatch, range control or the fire desk at (270) 798-4122 if they’re concerned, DPW forester J.P. Hart said. The sprawling Fort Campbell Army post straddles the Kentucky-Tennessee line.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Police say they have arrested one of two women seen on a social media video firing guns from a moving vehicle on Interstate 10. The 20-year-old suspect surrendered Monday with her attorney present, according to a police news release. The other suspect, a 21-year-old woman, was still at large Wednesday. Police said the shootings occurred on Oct. 16. Video circulating on social media showed two women, one in the front seat, the other in the back, firing handguns from passenger-side windows. Police said conviction on the charge of illegal discharge of a firearm from a moving vehicle would bring a prison sentence of five to 10 years. Nobody was reported injured in the Oct. 16 incident. However, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that shootings on the interstate highway in New Orleans have increased. Interstate shootings have killed six people this year, the newspaper reported. Police said the shootings generally fall into one of three categories: road rage incidents; pre-existing feuds where shooters are targeting someone they know or someone getting caught in the crossfire.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Despite the state’s view of itself as independent, few unenrolled candidates actually win elections, The Maine Monitor reports. Good Party, a startup campaign platform company that began taking shape in 2020, hopes to change that. It is using Maine as a testing ground to see if its model succeeds and what might need to be improved, with the idea of expanding its groundwork elsewhere. While independents from across the country are featured on their site, organizers say Maine is the only state where it is conducting events and doing outreach for candidates. All of its Facebook ads have been targeted to Mainers within the last 90 days and featured Maine candidates, according to the platform’s ad library. Its goal is to elevate independent candidates outside of the traditional political campaign and money engine that has increasingly defined elections. It also aims to increase participation from unenrolled voters, a population that the Pew Research Center found in 2019 is less politically engaged than partisan voters and who make up 32% of registered voters in Maine. Some independents see promise in the tool and say unenrolled candidates need all the support they can get. It is an open question whether it will be enough to get them over the finish line.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge last week blocked a first-of-its-kind digital advertising tax on companies making more than $100 million, but the state Senate’s president called for an appeal and maintains education funding will continue. The law, which may be appealed by Maryland’s attorney general, passed the General Assembly in 2021 with the intent of collecting revenue to fund the state’s schools. “We always knew this issue would face a legal journey,” Senate President Bill Ferguson, said in a statement after the judge’s decision. “We are confident that the Attorney General will prevail in state courts on appeal.” According to court documents, a hearing in the case is scheduled for Jan. 6. Oral arguments are scheduled in a separate federal case about the law Nov. 29. The Democrat tied the law, which he previously deemed a tax on “big tech” companies, to funding for the state’s education system. “Maryland’s children deserve a world-class 21st-century education system that works for them and that’s funded appropriately,” said Ferguson, a former teacher. “That’s what this law is all about.” In a separate statement, Ferguson assured funding for education will continue through the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, independent of the lawsuit, at least in the short term.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMalden: The state education department is investigating a complaint that claims the rights of children with disabilities in the Boston Public Schools are being violated because the district’s bus system is in “disarray,” Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley said Tuesday. The complaint filed last week by Greater Boston Legal Services and Massachusetts Advocates for Children on behalf of the parents and guardians of six students with disabilities says children are being being denied an education because of chronically late or canceled buses. “The systemic disarray of the BPS transportation and special education departments deprives thousands of Boston children, many of whom are low-income students with disabilities and students of color, of what cumulatively amounts to weeks or months of learning time,” the complaint said. Riley confirmed the investigation at Tuesday’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education board meeting. “We’ve been in touch with BPS regarding their transportation challenges, particularly as it relates to students with disabilities,” he said. “We have encouraged the district to work with families and advocates to resolve this issue.” Under federal law, the department has 60 days to investigate and either issue a letter of finding or a letter of closure, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Three men accused of supporting terrorism in the plot to kidnap the governor were convicted of all charges Wednesday in a trial that focused on paramilitary drills and fierce contempt for government ahead of the 2020 election. Joe Morrison, his father-in-law Pete Musico, and Paul Bellar were found guilty of supplying “material support” for a terrorist act as members of a group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. They held gun training in rural Jackson County with a leader of the kidnapping scheme, Adam Fox, who was disgusted with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and other officials and said he wanted to snatch her. The trial in state court was an offshoot of the main case in federal court, which produced mixed results: conspiracy convictions for Fox and three others but also two acquittals. Jurors in Jackson, Michigan, read and heard violent, anti-government screeds as well as support for the “boogaloo,” a civil war that might be triggered by a shocking abduction. Prosecutors said COVID-19 restrictions ordered by Whitmer turned out to be fruit to recruit more people to the Watchmen. “The facts drip out slowly,” state Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin told the jury, “and you begin to see – wow – there were things that happened that people knew about.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A former state House speaker is stepping down as vice chairman of the University of Minnesota Board of Regents following increased criticism over his question about whether the Morris campus is “too diverse.” Steve Sviggum has resigned his leadership position but will remain on the board until his term expires when the Legislature holds its regents election during the 2023 session, according to a statement from the University of Minnesota. Sviggum, 71, faced mounting pressure over comments he made nearly two weeks ago during a regents meeting. In talking about declining enrollment at the Morris campus, Sviggum asked acting Chancellor Janet Schrunk Ericksen whether the campus was “too diverse,” from a marketing standpoint. Currently, Morris has 1,068 students enrolled. Of those, 41% are people of color. Sviggum said that after meeting with board Chairman Ken Powell over the weekend, he came to the “realization” that he should resign as vice chairman immediately, the Star Tribune reports. “I owe that position to my colleagues who have shown disapproval in my actions,” he wrote in a letter to Powell. “I do so humbly and thoughtfully, with knowledge that the success of the University of Minnesota is the most important focus and is much more important than any one person or position.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Federal investigations into public spending on the failing water system in the majority-Black city are a test of President Joe Biden’s commitment to racial equity, one of his congressional allies told hundreds of people at a town hall meeting hosted by the NAACP. “President Biden has made a fundamental policy in his administration to talk about equity. And this is an issue of equity and fair treatment about the citizens of Jackson,” Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson said Monday night at Jackson’s New Hope Baptist Church – the same spacious sanctuary where Biden spoke during the 2020 campaign. The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it is investigating whether Mississippi state agencies have discriminated against Jackson by refusing to fund water system improvements in the city of 150,000, where more than 80% of residents are Black and about a quarter of the population lives in poverty. Thompson said the EPA civil investigation is expected to take about four months. The federal agency could withhold money from the state if it finds wrongdoing – potentially millions of dollars. If the state agencies don’t cooperate with the investigation, the EPA could refer the case to the Department of Justice.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Relatives of the gunman who killed a student and a teacher during a school shooting had long been concerned about his mental health and worked with police to take a gun away from him – possibly the same gun used in the attack, Police Commissioner Michael Sack said Wednesday. Police and the FBI are working to determine what prompted 19-year-old Orlando Harris to force his way into Central Visual and Performing Arts High School on Monday and start shooting. Sack said the the carnage could have been far worse. The gunman was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and an estimated 600 rounds of ammunition. Fifteen-year-old Alexzandria Bell and 61-year-old teacher Jean Kuczka died in the shooting. Four students suffered gunshot or graze wounds, two had bruises, and one had a broken ankle – apparently from jumping out of the three-story building. Sack said all are recovering, as is a police officer who suffered cuts from broken glass. Police believe Harris, who was killed by responding officers, had intended targets. They have not said if any of the victims were among them. Harris’ mother was “heartbroken” by the shooting, Sack said. She and other relatives had long dealt with Harris’ mental health issues and even had him committed at times, Sack said at a news conference.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Montana Shakespeare in the Parks will return for a 50th anniversary season with a winter production of “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) - Revised,” after postponing last winter’s tour of this same production. The free performances will be staged in 29 communities in Montana and Wyoming through Nov. 20, including a date in Great Falls on Nov. 14, at the Mansfield Theater at The Civic Center. The fast-paced comedy features three actors touching on all 37 plays by the famed playwright in just 90 minutes, and is an outreach program of Montana State University’s College of Arts and Architecture. “Though we were all disappointed to have to postpone last year’s winter tour, what we missed the most was all of you,” said Kevin Asselin, executive artistic director, in a statement. “Shakespeare has always been about the community for us, and that still holds true in our 50th season! This winter’s production is beyond phenomenal, but what will make it special is getting to share it with our friends, family, and community. We invite everyone to come out for our final tour of the 2022 season!” For more information, visit shakespeareintheparks.org.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: An investigation into the theft this summer of several semitrailers loaded with frozen beef from Nebraska has led to arrests and uncovered a multimillion-dollar theft ring targeting meatpacking plants in six Midwestern states, federal authorities said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported Tuesday that the discovery of the Miami-based theft ring began in June with a Nebraska investigation into the theft of several semitrailers loaded with nearly $1 million in frozen beef from areas near Grand Island and Lincoln. The investigation, led by the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office in Nebraska and Homeland Security’s Major Crimes Task Force in Omaha, determined that the theft ring was targeting beef and pork packaging plants in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Wisconsin. On Oct. 20, investigators arrested three Miami men on suspicion of transporting stolen goods and money laundering. They face charges in federal court in Florida. Information on whether the men have attorneys representing them in the case could not immediately be found Wednesday. Investigators said they have identified approximately 45 thefts that occurred across the six Midwest states totaling $9 million in losses.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Prosecutors said they won’t seek the death penalty against a former Las Vegas-area politician who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to killing a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. “Not guilty, your honor,” Robert Telles, a Democrat who has been stripped of his elected position, responded during his arraignment on an indictment in the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German. Telles, 45, appeared with his new lawyer, Ryan Helmick, who Telles hired to replace deputy public defenders initially named to his case at taxpayer expense following a declaration by Telles that he was unable to afford a lawyer. The Review-Journal last week reported that Telles and his wife were making $20,500 per month before his arrest and that he owns five rental houses in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Local property records show the couple also owns a Las Vegas home with a taxable value of more than $320,000. A trial date was not immediately set. Telles’ next court date is Nov. 2 before Clark County District Court Judge Mark Denton. Helmick declined outside court to comment.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Massachusetts has agreed to pay about $3.5 million to New Hampshire to settle a yearslong dispute over lost property taxes caused by infrastructure in New Hampshire that helps to prevent Merrimack River flooding that primarily benefits Massachusetts, authorities said Wednesday. Some of the 15 flood control facilities constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers date to the 1940s, according to a statement from the office of New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella. The states in 1957 entered into an agreement to ensure that Massachusetts paid affected New Hampshire communties some of the lost property tax revenue. But since 2014, the states have been unable to agree on the precise amount. Massachusetts has now agreed to pay the full amount owed to New Hampshire dating to 2014, Formella’s office said. The states have also agreed to come up with a formula to determine future reimbursements. “After eight years of impasse, I am pleased that our two great states have been able to reach agreement on this settlement payment to compensate New Hampshire citizens for almost a decade of lost revenue,” Formella said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Another toll increase is on the horizon, marking the third time in four years that New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway usage fees are going up. On Jan. 1, 2023, tolls will rise 3%, the same rate they increased last year. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority board unanimously approved the measure as part of the 2023 budget Tuesday. The increase comes as revenues came in above agency projections across the board for the first nine months of the year. The Turnpike Authority collected more than $1.82 billion in revenue during that time, up 6% compared to what it budgeted. The number of vehicles traversing the two highways also rose 1.3% in September 2022 when compared to the same month last year. Commercial vehicle transactions reached the third-highest number amount ever recorded, according to board documents. The budget is designed to provide “enough funding for operating expenses budgeted at approximately $714 million to operate and maintain the Turnpike and Parkway during a time inflation levels not seen in 40 years, and growth,” according to budget documents. Tom Feeney, a Turnpike spokesman, noted the toll increase is less than half that of the inflation rate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An environmental group is suing U.S. wildlife managers, saying they have failed to protect a rare grouse found in areas that include one of the country’s most prolific areas for oil and gas development. A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Center for Biological Diversity says the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is nearly five months late in releasing a final rule outlining protections for the lesser prairie chicken. Once listed as a threatened species, the prarie chicken’s habitat spans parts of New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas – including a portion of the oil-rich Permian Basin that straddles the New Mexico-Texas state line. Environmentalists have been pushing to reinstate federal protections for years. They consider the species severely threatened, citing lost and fragmented habitat as the result of oil and gas development, livestock grazing, farming and the building of roads and power lines. The Fish and Wildlife Service in 2021 proposed listing the southern population in New Mexico and the southern reaches of the Texas Panhandle as endangered and those birds in the northern part of the species’ range as threatened. The agency had a deadline of June 1.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City sanitation workers who were fired for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19 should be reinstated and given back pay, a state judge ruled in a decision released Tuesday. Sitting in Staten Island, state Supreme Court Justice Ralph Porzio held that the city’s health commissioner overstepped his authority and violated the workers’ due process and equal protection rights when he barred the workers from their jobs. Porzio also cited Mayor Eric Adams’s lifting of the vaccine mandate for some private employees earlier this year – notably, athletes and entertainers – as evidence that the public worker mandate was arbitrary and unreasonable. “There is nothing in the record to support the rationality of keeping a vaccination mandate for public employees while vacating the mandate for private sector employees or creating a carveout for certain professions, like artists, athletes or performers,” Porzio wrote. “This is clearly and arbitrary and capricious action because we are dealing with identical unvaccinated people being treated differently by the same administrative agency.” The city’s law department said Tuesday it had appealed Porzio’s ruling.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: A former nurse at a hospital has been charged in the deaths of two patients after officials said he injected them with lethal doses of insulin. Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill announced at a news conference Tuesday that Johnathan Howard Hayes, a registered nurse, was charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, news outlets report. Hayes worked at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem. Hayes was ordered held without bond at a first appearance Wednesday, police said. His case was referred to the public defender’s office, but one hasn’t been assigned yet, according to the clerk of the court’s office. The 47-year-old Winston-Salem man, described by O’Neill as a “rogue nurse,” is accused of administering a near-fatal dose of insulin to Pamela Little on Dec. 1, 2021, O’Neill said. Little survived. On Jan. 5, Hayes administered a lethal dose of insulin to patient Gwen Crawford, who died three days later, O’Neill said. On Jan. 22, Hayes gave another lethal dose of insulin to Vickie Lingerfelt, who died five days later, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: North Dakota State University is facing drastic budget cuts, the school’s new president said Tuesday. David Cook wrote in a campuswide email that significant reductions will be necessary due to decreasing enrollments over the past several years. He describes the cuts as “incredibly difficult.” The north Fargo campus is facing a $10.5 million budget shortfall for the next biennium. Cook said he has asked the school’s deans to help with “rightsizing and reorganizing the academic enterprise” and creating new programs to meet workforce needs. The school is also looking at new strategies to retain students, he said. The email does not mention layoffs, KFGO radio reports. Cook said most of the NDSU’s money comes from tuition and state revenue, both of which are dependent on student numbers. Enrollment at the university is at a 15-year low. “Please understand that I know NDSU has been living through numerous years of budget cuts, and I appreciate how difficult it has been,” Cook said. “My goal is for us to transform our operations strategically so that we can set NDSU up for future success.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio law does not permit voters to return absentee ballots at their precincts on Election Day, the state’s elections chief is cautioning amid a misinformation campaign around the security of voting machines that’s urging them to do so. Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose said those voters who heed advice from a prominent national group of Republican election deniers and hold onto their paper ballots until Nov. 8 must deliver them to their county board of elections office. Poll workers at precinct-level voting locations cannot accept them, he said. “This is why it’s dangerous for people who don’t know what they’re talking about to be dispensing bad elections-related advice to people,” he said in an Associated Press interview Tuesday. “Because if someone is telling voters to take their absentee ballot to their polling location on Election Day, they’re effectively instructing them how to disenfranchise themselves.” LaRose said that possibility has caused concern among county election officials.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The process of re-exhuming of some of the 19 bodies exhumed a year ago for testing in an effort to identify victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, then reburied in an Oklahoma cemetery, began Wednesday to gather more DNA from the remains. The latest exhumations of bodies that were taken from Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, will be followed by another excavation for additional remains. Of the 19 bodies previously exhumed, 14 fit the criteria for additional DNA analysis, but just two of the 14 had enough usable DNA recovered to begin sequencing by Intermountain Forensics of Salt Lake City. Danny Hellwig, director of laboratory development for Intermountain, said Wednesday that the DNA recovered from the remains had degraded during the more than 100 years they were buried. “These samples are very … degraded,” Hellwig said. “There are samples that are very light right now on DNA, some that are semi viable, some that are just on the threshold” of being viable.” Hellwig said work to develop a genealogy profile for the two remains with enough viable DNA is expected to start in about a week and couple be completed within a few weeks, but efforts to identify the remains could take years.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A waiting and vetting period would be baked into gun purchases if a measure on the November statewide ballot passes. If voters approve the measure Nov. 8, buying a gun would first involve the potential purchaser obtaining a permit, which requires a number of steps supporters of the initiative say would save lives. The measure also bans large capacity gun magazines. The ballot measure is aimed at saving lives from suicide – in Oregon, 82% of gun deaths are suicides – mass shootings and other gun violence. The gun safety initiative gained momentum after mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, with more volunteers joining the effort, which was led by interfaith leaders. “We’re making a strong, strong push and the coalition is just growing by the day,” the Rev. Mark Knutson, one of the chief petitioners, said over the phone last week. “Everybody’s working hard in the next three weeks.” He said volunteers are canvassing door-to-door, erecting lawn signs and reaching out to voters by phone. The measure would require a permit to purchase any gun. To qualify for a permit, valid for five years, an applicant would need to complete an approved firearm safety course, pay a fee, provide personal information, submit to fingerprinting and photographing, and pass a criminal background check.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Republicans in the state House introduced a measure Wednesday to impeach Philadelphia’s Democratic district attorney, saying they may add session days to get the job done before the two-year legislative term expires next month. Rep. Martina White, the only House Republican who currently represents the city, sponsored the 22-page resolution aimed at removing District Attorney Larry Krasner a year after he was overwhelmingly reelected. White and about two dozen other House Republicans announced the move at a Capitol news conference. White accused Krasner of “dereliction of duty and despicable behavior” and running an office with a “staggering amount of dysfunction.” She said Krasner is “responsible for the rise of crime across our city.” Krasner tweeted just before the news conference that those seeking his removal “don’t allege I’ve committed a crime.” He wrote: “They just don’t think Philly has a right to govern itself,” saying the move is “devastating to democracy, and it shows how far toward fascism the Republican Party is creeping.” “These Republicans divest from communities and then grandstand about crime for political gain,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s $10 million reparations budget cleared a major hurdle Tuesday night, receiving its first vote of approval from the City Council. The budget is set to fund more than 20 efforts related to home ownership and financial literacy, workforce training, media, community organizations, small business and more. The finance committee opted to remove three investments to establish a home repair fund, expand Mayor Jorge Elorza’s guaranteed income program and create a legal defense fund for renters facing evictions. Instead, council members moved to reallocate the more than $1.7 million that would have been spent on those categories to a “United Way COVID-19 Equity Fund.” Next step toward reparationsDetails on how those funds would be spent was not provided, though the intent would be to secure additional funding for the city’s reparations program. However, any proposed expenditures regarding that fund would require a public hearing followed by council approval. The council was highly supportive of the budget, with all members voting in favor except Councilmen Michael Correia, Nicholas Narducci and James Taylor, and Councilwoman Kat Kerwin, who were each absent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina has announced a new branding mark to go along with its iconic tree-and-gates academic logo. University officials said Wednesday that the school it is simplifying its branding marks while also introducing a new spirit mark for USC. The brand update becomes effective on Jan. 4, 2023, but some changes will take place immediately. The school will maintain and replace signs in phases. The university said the updated brand standards will include these guidelines: The iconic tree-and-gates will remain as the official academic logo. It becomes the official mark for academic branding. The university will introduce a new block-letter USC spirit mark that embraces the university’s unrivaled spirit and includes 1801, the year of its founding. The spirit mark will provide versatility in promoting the university in non-academic settings. The university will be referred to as the University of South Carolina, USC, South Carolina or Carolina in editorial and marketing materials. Athletics logos, including the “Block C” logo, will not be changed. “It’s great that the change announced today has been extremely well received across the board, especially by alumni who are really embracing the news,” said Jeff Stensland, assistant vice president of Institutional Relations and Public Affairs.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state has seen a rapid rise in people registering to use medical marijuana in recent months, as many obtain their patient cards through temporary consultation sites rather than their regular medical providers, a state health official told lawmakers Tuesday. Chris Qualm, who administers the state’s medical pot program, told a legislative oversight committee that there are now more than 4,000 people registered to use the drug. That’s a rapid rise from this summer, when the state tracked several hundred people registering each month. Many of those cardholders are getting certified to use medical marijuana at so-called pop-up clinics where physicians certify they have a medical condition that qualifies them for medical pot use. The quick consultations – sometimes lasting as little as five minutes – prompted some members of the legislative committee to voice concern that the process was not thorough enough. Advocates for medical marijuana access said patients were turning to the temporary consultation sites because established health care systems have not embraced the drug. “The problem is not pop-up clinics,” said Melissa Mentele, who organized the 2020 ballot initiative that legalized medical cannabis. “It’s our health systems refusing to participate in the program.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A former officer has been sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for giving police information and equipment to civilians who robbed drug dealers in the city, prosecutors said. Former Memphis Police Officer Sam Blue, 63, pleaded guilty in January 2020 to conspiracy to violate civil rights by using force, violence and intimidation, and conspiracy to commit robbery affecting interstate commerce. Blue was sentenced to the prison sentence, plus three years of probation, on Tuesday, the U.S. attorney’s office said. From 2014 to 2018, Blue conspired with others to rob drug dealers. Blue gave robbers home addresses for targets. He also provided robbers with an official Memphis Police Department badge and a car dashboard blue light. In 2018, several men put on fake police uniforms and used a blue police dashboard light to stop Eric Cain near his apartment, prosecutors said. Attackers handcuffed, kidnapped and tortured Cain, demanding to know where he kept his drugs and money. Cain escaped and spent a week in the hospital.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A teen shot by a police officer three weeks ago as he put his car in reverse while eating a hamburger is still hospitalized, and his condition remains “very touch and go,” his father said Tuesday in the family’s first public comments since the shooting. “He is getting slightly better, his wounds are healing, but the wounds that he’s endured, they are great; there’s a lot of them,” Eric Cantu said at a news conference. Family attorney Ben Crump – who has taken on some of the nation’s most high-profile police killings of Black people – said the family has been told that the now-fired officer who shot 17-year-old Erik Cantu racially profiled him while searching for a Hispanic suspect. Cantu was shot on Oct. 2 by Officer James Brennand in a McDonald’s parking lot. After the shooting, the 27-year-old rookie officer was fired and charged with two counts of aggravated assault by a public official. Police said Brennand violated his training and police procedures after approaching the car. Police have said Brennand was responding to an unrelated disturbance when he saw Cantu inside a car he believed had evaded him the day before during an attempted traffic stop. Brennand said he suspected the car was stolen.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: St. George has hosted at least one IRONMAN triathlon event every year since 2010, so local motorists have gotten used to navigating road closures and other obstacles presented on race day. But this year, with the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships set to take place over the course of two full days, the event could come with more challenges than usual. The 70.3-mile race – half the distance of the traditional triathlon – covers wide swaths of Washington County, starting with a 1.2-mile swim through Sand Hollow Reservoir, followed by a 56-mile bike ride that crosses through Hurricane, Washington, St. George, Ivins and Snow Canyon State Park before finishing with a 13.1-mile run through central St. George. The official races start at 7:30 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, and while the top professionals can finish in under four hours, many participants can take the better part of the day to complete the grueling task. The race is expected to bring more than $20 million in direct economic impact to the area, and local governments have gathered a favorable reputation with race organizers for their willingness to plan around the event.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Ski resorts across the state have begun announcing their opening days and taking reservations for those wanting a chance at the untouched powder. Weather conditions could influence opening day plans, but many resorts say they would refund reserved lift tickets due to unfavorable conditions. Season passes have already gone on sale, but for those day-trippers ready to reserve the first lift tickets, the early bird gets the berm. Jay Peak Resort expects to begin its season Nov. 25, as does Killington Ski Resort. Mad River Glen in Waitsfield.Ski season at Mad River Glen in Waitsfield is expected to open Dec. 10, but Stark’s Pub should open Nov. 25. Mount Snow Ski Resort in Somerset plans to open Nov. 11. Okemo Mountain Resort in Ludlow is projected to open Nov. 19. Opening day for Saskadena Six in South Pomfret is planned for Dec. 14, weather permitting, and Ski Quechee in Hartford is looking to Dec. 21. Smugglers’ Notch in Jeffersonville plans to kick things off Nov. 25; Stowe Mountain Resort is starting Nov. 18 and Stratton Mountain on Nov. 19.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A judge has sided with city officials in a lawsuit over whether Richmond can remove a final Confederate monument and the remains of a rebel general interred beneath it. Circuit Court Judge David Eugene Cheek Sr. said in a ruling Tuesday that city officials – not the descendants of A.P. Hill – get to decide where the statue goes next, the Richmond Times-Dispatch and TV station WRIC report. The city plans to give the statue to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia, which the plaintiffs found objectionable. The plaintiffs, who were indirect descendants of Hill, did not oppose the removal of the general’s remains to a cemetery in Culpeper, near where Hill was born. But they argued that the ownership of the statue should be transferred to them. They hoped to move it to a battlefield, also in Culpeper, according to the news outlets. “We’re gratified by Judge Cheek’s ruling,” Mayor Levar Stoney said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Big ships entering and leaving Puget Sound will be asked to slow down to reduce underwater noise this fall in an effort to help the Pacific Northwest’s critically endangered orca whales. Washington state is importing the voluntary slowdown from British Columbia for container ships, tankers, freighters, cruise ships and car carriers coming from the Canadian province, Northwest News Network reports. The optional slowdown is scheduled to run from Oct. 24 to Dec. 22 and covers the shipping lanes from Admiralty Inlet by Port Townsend south to Kingston and Mukilteo. “When large vessels slow their speed they reduce the amount of underwater noise they create, and less underwater noise means better habitat for the endangered Southern Resident killer whales,” said Rachel Aronson, the program director of Quiet Sound, which is a relatively new, government-funded outfit that organized the slowdown trial. Aronson said most vessels would need to reduce speed by 30% to 50% over 20 nautical miles. She estimated that participating might add between 10 minutes to an hour of ships’ travel time, depending on their usual speed. Aronson said the time period and geographic area for the trial slowdown were chosen because the orcas travel into inland Puget Sound during that time to chase salmon runs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeaver: Federal officials are investigating complaints about conditions at a jail, according to a published report. The Register-Herald reports the West Virginia Department of Homeland Security denied its request to tour the Southern Regional Jail in Raleigh County citing a federal probe of the facility. “The federal government is in the process of investigating the facility, and the integrity of that investigation is of the utmost importance to the WV Department of Homeland Security,” said Morgan Switzer, deputy general counsel for the state agency said in an email to the newspaper. The jail in Beaver has been the “subject of many questions and concerns” since March, Switzer said. The state agency hasn’t answered questions about which federal agency is investigating and when the investigation began, the newspaper reports. A federal civil rights lawsuit was filed against the jail last month on behalf of current and former inmates who have described conditions at the facility as inhumane. The complaint references a lack of access to water and food, as well as overcrowded conditions and fights that were allowed to continue until someone was injured. A state investigation of conditions at the jail earlier this year found no evidence of inhumane treatment.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A man who stole the head from the state Capitol statue of Hans Christian Heg during a night of protests in 2020 pleaded guilty to misdemeanor theft on Wednesday and was sentenced to a year of probation. Rodney A. Clendening, 36, of Beloit, was originally charged with felony theft, but the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor as part of a plea agreement that resulted in the probation imposed by Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland. The Wisconsin State Journal reports Clendening turned over the head of the statue to his attorney. Heg was an abolitionist and Union Army colonel during the Civil War. Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said that because of that gesture, he agreed to reduce the charge. Damage to the statue was estimated at the time at more than $50,000. It has since been restored, reinstalled and rededicated at on the state Capitol grounds. Protests in Madison over the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police began in late May 2020. Protests the night of June 23 were in response to the arrest earlier in the day of local activist Devonere Johnson. He has since been convicted in federal court of extortion involving a Madison business.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A movement in the state aims to create an alert system for missing Indigenous adults, WyoFile.com reports. What would be called the Ashanti alert system would function similarly to existing Amber Alerts, which inform the public of missing children.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/29/news-around-states/40907031/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRogersville: A nonprofit group is accepting donations to help clean up Joe Wheeler State Park, which was badly damaged by a tornado earlier this month. The News Courier reported the Alabama State Parks Foundation will take contributions to restore the park near Rogersville. As many as 150 acres of land at the popular park was badly damaged, said superintendent Chad Davis. The damaged areas include campgrounds and day-use areas that are closed indefinitely. Dozens of trees are down and some buildings were damaged. The park would be working with the Alabama Forestry Commission during the cleanup, Davis said. The lodge, marina and some other areas have reopened at the park, which is located along park the Tennessee River. The weather service said it was struck by a twister with 110 mph maximum winds that left a trail of damage as wide as 500 yards.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Transportation officials have launched an updated monitoring system providing drivers real-time road and traffic conditions throughout the state. The Alaska Department of Transportation launched Friday the 511 road condition alert system designed to be more user- and mobile-friendly, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Users can set up notifications and alerts on personalized routes, zoom in and out of the map and click on areas to find out more information, department officials said. The old version was removed from the store and users must download the new version, she said. The system will show traffic speeds and integrates a Google-owned application Waze allowing users to report road conditions, closures or crashes, officials said. The system can be accessed by calling 511, visiting 511.alaska.gov or downloading the mobile app from Google Play or the App Store, officials said. About 450,000 travelers used the 511 website, more than 68,000 calls were made to the 511 phone system and the app was downloaded more than 9,000 times this year, department officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The mood along the streets of central Phoenix was lively, even before the Fiesta Bowl Parade officially began at 9 a.m. Saturday. Historic cars roared their engines as they drove through the blocked-off streets and children holding plastic balloon souvenirs waved hello to a team of police officers mounted on bicycles as they rode through the parade route ahead of its start. A sea of lawn chairs lined Central Avenue, with most of their occupants wrapped in blankets and clutching coffee-filled thermoses as the temperature hovered around 45 degrees — arguably a glacial temperature, by Phoenix standards anyway.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has announced plans for a new outpatient medical clinic in Fort Smith, which is expected to create about 100 jobs. The agency announced plans Thursday for the new clinic, which will have more than double the space now available at the existing VA clinic in Fort Smith. About 15,000 veterans in Crawford, Sebastian and Franklin counties use the facility, officials said. The larger clinic is expected to improve access to medical care for veterans in the area and create about 100 jobs, including positions for doctors, nurses and support staff, the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce said. The outpatient clinic will offer primary care, mental health, audiology, optometry, radiology and lab services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A federal judge has temporarily blocked a California law banning the import and sale of alligator and crocodile products. U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller also scheduled an April 24 hearing on Louisiana’s request for a longer-lasting order called a preliminary injunction. Both sides agreed to the temporary order, Mueller wrote. It was signed Sunday and made public Monday in online court records. Mueller noted that California is not conceding anything by agreeing to the temporary restraining order and might continue to enforce laws barring the importation of alligator and crocodile bodies and body parts that are forbidden under the Endangered Species Act. American alligators are one of only two alligator species. Chinese alligators are one of the world’s most endangered crocodilians but American alligators are thriving, partly with help from alligator farmers. Their harvest and sale remain regulated, for their own sake and, under an international treaty, because they look like some species that are endangered or threatened. American alligators were removed from the U.S. endangered species list in 1987. The alligator business has played a key part in bringing back the animals and is important in protecting marshes and swamps and other species that depend on wetlands, according to Louisiana’s lawsuit. The big reptiles don’t breed well in captivity, so farmers get permits to collect eggs from the big heaps of plants that alligators pile up as wetland nests. When the alligators hatched from those eggs are 3 to 5 feet long, the number that would have survived to that length in the wild must be returned to the wild, where most hatchlings get eaten if the eggs don’t get eaten first.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: A puppy that was thrown at a vehicle by a homeless man last week was adopted on Friday following a raffle organized by animal shelter officials. Officials with the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region set up the drawing in Pueblo. KKTV-TV reported the lucky winner is Beth Sisneros of Peyton. Shelter workers had dubbed the dog “Bob” and Sisneros renamed the pup, Buddy Junior. An anonymous donor paid for Buddy’s $400 adoption fee. The Pueblo Chieftain reported that the puppy was thrown by a man reportedly under the influence of meth at a vehicle that was occupied by a mother and her daughter Dec. 15, authorities said. Amanda Belcher was in the car with her daughter when she said the man approached her vehicle and threw the puppy at the roof of the vehicle with force, authorities said. The man was cited for animal cruelty, authorities said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Guided hikes will be offered on New Year’s Day at 15 parks and recreation areas across the state. The free First Day Hikes, which average one or two miles, are being hosted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. It’s part of America’s State Parks’ First Day Hikes initiative, which is taking place in all 50 states on Wednesday. The goal of the First Day hikes is to encourage people to get outside, exercise, enjoy nature and welcome the new year with friends and family. Parks staff and volunteers will lead the hikes. Information about the locations can be found on the Connecticut State Parks and Forests website. Some hikes, such as one planned at Burr Pond State Park in Torrington, allow dogs on leashes. But others, such as a hike through the Candlewood Hill Wildlife Management Area in Groton do not. Those looking for adventure might consider a moderate two-mile hike through Kettletown State Park in Southbury. First Day Hikes began more than 25 years ago at the Blue Hills Reservation, a state park south of Boston.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Davian Higgins-Reeves might not have been in her new home for the holidays, but she has the keys in her hands. She and her family will be living in a new Simonds Gardens home after receiving the keys during a home dedication ceremony by Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County. The home, the fourth either built or renovated by Habitat in Simonds Gardens, will get Higgins-Reeves out of an apartment she shares with her sister and cousin and into housing that will allow her to save money and have something she helped build. Higgins-Reeves, who got the keys Dec. 20 and is expected to move into the house in January, put in more than 250 hours of “sweat equity” – the term Habitat uses for the investment the owner provides before moving into a home. This can be anything from helping build the house to being engaged in their new community. Along with the sweat equity, families in the program attend financial coaching classes, home maintenance training and civic engagement training. Higgins-Reeves will be moving into her new home with her husband and her younger sister.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A 15-year-old boy was arrested nearly a month after two individuals were shot near the ZooLights display at the National Zoo, WUSA-TV reported. Police said on Nov. 30, a group of teens set off fireworks near the zoo, which some visitors mistook for gunshots. During this incident, police said a 15-year-old suspect approached two victims in the 2800 block of Connecticut Ave., Northwest and pulled out a handgun. Then, he shot the victims. The suspect fled the scene, and the victims were taken to a hospital for treatment of their nonlife-threatening injuries. D.C. Police said they arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pittsburgh and charged him with assault of a dangerous weapon (gun). Following the incident, zoo officials looked to increase security measures and tighten up safety precautions. National Zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson said that zoo officials held a discussion with D.C. Police, the Smithsonian Office of Protection Services and Metro Transit Police following the shootings to determine what those safety precautions will look like and how they will be carried out. Following that discussion, Baker-Masson said there would be an increase in security staff, as well as temporary screening stations that will include bag checks and wanding. In addition to increased precautions in the zoo, Baker-Masson said D.C. Police would have a heavier presence outside the zoo, as well.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A cat that went missing two years ago in Florida during Hurricane Irma has been reunited with the pet’s owner. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office tweeted late last week that the cat showed up at one of its offices in the Tampa area and deputies were hoping to find the owner. The sheriff’s office provided an update on Friday, saying that the owner had been traced via microchip after deputies took the cat to a local veterinarian. The sheriff’s office didn’t identify Eva’s owner but said the cat disappeared during the 2017 hurricane, whose path cut through the middle of Florida. “Tonight, the owner was reunited with Eva,” the sheriff’s office tweeted. “Eva is now living in luxury. MEOW, that is a great story!”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Supporters of Georgia’s South River are hoping it becomes more popular. They believe that if the river south of Atlanta was used more frequently for recreation, it might bring more funding and protection. The South River traverses for about 60 miles from East Point into DeKalb County, before it winds south through five more metro Atlanta counties into Jackson Lake Reservoir in Butts County, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Part of the South River traverses by Panola Mountain State Park, forming the border between DeKalb and Rockdale counties. The hope is that more use will give it added protection from development and pollution. Despite its history of sewage spills, water quality in the river has improved over the last two decades, officials said, and Jackie Echols, board president of the watershed alliance, said it is safe enough for recreational uses such as kayaking.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Authorities said a pilot mobile homeless center program has seen success after launching multiple inflatable tents at a park on Oahu. The Homeless Outreach and Navigations for Unsheltered Persons project set up 10 tents at Waipahu Cultural Garden Park this month, providing homeless people access to food, showers, restrooms and kennels for pets, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The 400-square-foot tents house up to 10 people each, authorities said. People housed in the tents are being helped by social services agencies to find more permanent housing solutions, authorities said. The program is a three-year, $6 million pilot project staffed by the Honolulu Police Department and Department of Community Services. The program expects to spend 90 days in Waipahu before moving to another city-owned park, officials said. More than 20 of those who stayed at the camp and were placed in shelters were from Waipahu, but others have come from Kakaako, Pearl City, Ewa Beach and Waianae, authorities said. The next location for the mobile shelter could be somewhere in the McCully or Moiliili area where many complaints have been received about large homeless encampments, Lambert said.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: Authorities said there have been five mountain lion attacks that have killed or injured dogs in the same central Idaho community in the past week. The Idaho State Journal reported a Labrador retriever was attacked early Saturday morning near Hailey after its owners let the dog outside in their unfenced backyard. It marked the fifth case in the Wood River Valley in the span of a week, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. The Labrador has since recovered and returned home, but at least three other dogs have died. The state said there has been an increasing number of predators in the area because elk and mule deer can now be found there year-round. It urged residents to be vigilant in the early morning and evening hours.\n\nIllinois\n\nAurora: A man who made more than 27,000 crosses to commemorate victims of mass shootings across the country is retiring. Greg Zanis came to realize, after 23 years, his Crosses for Losses ministry was beginning to take a personal and financial toll on him, according to The Beacon-News. Zanis has set up crosses after the school shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland. He also placed crosses after the Las Vegas music festival shooting and the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2016, he made more than 700 crosses that were carried along Michigan Avenue in Chicago to honor each person who had been killed that year. Earlier this year, Zanis found himself making crosses for his hometown of Aurora after a Henry Pratt Co. employee opened fire on his coworkers. Zanis said he hopes to pass on his ministry to the nonprofit Lutheran Church Charities of Northbrook.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An electric car-sharing service that debuted in 2015 is pulling the plug on its network of rechargeable cars after residents failed to embrace the vehicles. Blue Indy will end its collaboration with the city of Indianapolis on May 21, saying in a statement that the car-sharing service would end “because we did not reach the level of activity required to be economically viable.” When Bolloré Logistics launched Blue Indy in Indiana’s capital in September 2015, the Paris-based company predicted it would be operating profitably by 2020, with at least 15,000 members, 200 stations and 500 cars. But as of August, Blue Indy had just 3,000 active members, a fifth of the total it had projected that it needed for profitability. And it had 92 stations and 200 cars – 80 fewer than it had two years ago. The Blue Indy project cost about $50 million, with the company investing $41 million, the city contributing $6 million and Indianapolis Power & Light Co. covering the remaining $3 million. The company did not say what would happen to the cars’ charging stations, which can be found all over Indianapolis.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:A dozen people have applied to fill a vacant seat on the Iowa Supreme Court left by the death in November of Chief Justice Mark Cady. Court officials said the State Judicial Nominating Commission will conduct interviews on Jan. 9 of the applicants. Those interviews, to be held in the Iowa Supreme Court courtroom in Des Moines, are open to the public. Following the interviews, the commission will select three nominees to be forwarded to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The Republican governor will then have 30 days to appoint the new justice from the three nominees. The applicants are Joel Barrows, a district judge from Bettendorf; Romonda Belcher, a district associate judge from Des Moines; Mary Chicchelly, a district judge from Cedar Rapids; Ames lawyer Timothy Gartin; David May, an Iowa Appeals Court judge from Polk City; Des Moines lawyer Matthew McDermott; Iowa City lawyer Craig Nierman; Muscatine County Attorney Alan Ostergren; Cedar Rapids lawyer Dana Oxley; assistant Iowa attorney general Lisa Reel Schmidt; Theresa Wilson, an assistant appellate defender; and Des Moines lawyer William Miller. Iowan residents can email written comments regarding applicants to the commission no later than 5 p.m. Jan. 7 to sjnc@iowa.gov.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A voluntary recall of several pork products produced in Clay Center will be issued on Monday because of possible listeria contamination, Kansas health officials said Saturday. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said in a news release that Clay Center Locker Plant will issue the recall for any ready-to-eat product including smoked pork loins, ham hocks and smoked ham from the plant produced on Nov. 21. The department is urging the public not to consume any of the products, including those bought at the retail counter in the plant and hams that were delivered to the Future Farmers of America chapters in Clay Center and Chapman. To date, no illnesses have been linked with the recall, the department said. The department said the recall was initiated after tests from routine samplings by the state Agriculture Department found listeria monocytogenes. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.\n\nKentucky\n\nVersailles:Jim Beam was fined $600,000 earlier this month after a July warehouse fire sent a nearly 23-mile plume of alcohol into the Kentucky and Ohio rivers, killing fish. The distiller agreed to the fine in a Dec. 6 order from the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, The Courier-Journal reported. Jim Beam will also reimburse the state agency $112,000. The July 3 fire was started when lightning struck a massive barrel warehouse near the Woodford-Franklin County line. The blaze sent flames shooting into the night sky that could be seen for miles and generated so much heat that firetruck lights melted. About 40,000 barrels of aging whiskey were destroyed, with the runoff pouring into nearby Glenns Creek and then downstream into the rivers. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources found dead fish along 62 miles of Glenns Creek and the Kentucky River. There were also dead fish in the Ohio River, but Energy and Environment Cabinet spokesman John Mura has described the impact there as “negligible.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nDonaldsonville: Seven people have been arrested on charges of dogfighting in south Louisiana and officials said more arrests might be pending. Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre on Friday said deputies responded to a call regarding dogfighting at a residence in Donaldsonville on Dec. 20. Detectives rounded up 10 dogs, two of them had been fighting and were severely injured. One of the injured dogs died. Investigators also searched 10 vehicles left at the scene and seized drugs, guns, cash, dogfighting paraphernalia and drug paraphernalia, news outlets reported. “Cases of animal cruelty will always be taken seriously,” Webre said. “We will not tolerate dogfighting or anything like it in Ascension Parish.” Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office at 225-621-4636.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A bill backed by Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine that is designed to protect animals by cutting down on illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching has been signed into law. Collins joined Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon in proposing the Rescuing Animals With Rewards Act. The proposal authorizes the federal government to offer financial rewards for information that leads to disruption of wildlife trafficking networks, the senators said. Illegal trafficking of wildlife is a “transnational crime that requires a coordinated and sustained global effort” to be stopped, Collins said. Collins and Merkley submitted their proposal in May. It has the support of numerous animal welfare organizations.\n\nMaryland\n\nForestville: Ulysses Currie, a powerful former Maryland lawmaker who was censured in an ethics scandal has died. He was 82. Currie’s wife, Shirley Gravely-Currie, told The Washington Post that he died Friday from advanced dementia at his home in Prince George’s County. The Democrat had represented the area as a state lawmaker for more than three decades until his term ended earlier this year. The son of a sharecropper, Currie was a teacher who rose to become a popular and leading black lawmaker. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 1986 and then elected to the state Senate in 1994. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller praised his former colleague, saying his story “is the story of the best of our state and this country.” Currie was the chairman of the powerful Senate budget committee in 2002 but stepped down from the chairmanship when he was indicted in federal court in 2010 for failing to disclose work for a grocery store chain that paid him about $245,000 over several years. He was acquitted of all charges, including conspiracy, bribery and extortion. The Senate voted unanimously to censure him, making it the first time in 14 years the chamber had disciplined one of its own.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A couple reunited for extra-sweet wedding vows at the same Dunkin’ Donuts where their young love splintered nearly 30 years ago. Valerie Sneade and Jason Roy were married Friday afternoon, joined by family, friends and customers buying coffee and pastries at the Dunkin’ Donuts on Grafton Street in Worcester. Sneade and Roy mostly didn’t see each other for 25 years after a conversation about their future at the same shop in 1992 led the young, in-love couple to step back from their relationship. Sneade blamed misunderstandings at the time and words that didn’t come out right. Roy joined the Navy, married and had three children. Sneade also had a first marriage and moved to Florida. She became a singer and actress, developing her own cabaret shows. Both later divorced. When Roy learned Sneade was performing a Valentine’s Day-themed musical revue in Worcester in February 2018, he showed up and sat in the front row. Three months later, she moved back to Massachusetts. Roy proposed that New Year’s Eve.\n\nMichigan\n\nGladstone: A small-town tradition in the Upper Peninsula spread holiday cheer and helped a charity. Firefighters riding in fire trucks went door-to-door last weekend in Gladstone, distributing candy canes while collecting food and $465.79 for the local St. Vincent de Paul branch. The Daily Press in Escanaba said the tradition started more than 20 years ago with five volunteers and one truck. Now more than 20 people are involved. Children eagerly looked out their windows as fire trucks decorated with Christmas lights went up and down Gladstone’s streets, playing holiday music. Stockings full of candy canes were donated by Walmart.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: An 11-year-old boy who was overcome by fumes at a western Minnesota grain silo has died, becoming the third victim to die from the farm accident that claimed his father and uncle, authorities said. Alex Boesl was pronounced dead on Friday, according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. The boy had been hospitalized at Children’s Hospital of Minneapolis since breathing in the silage gas on Dec. 21. The boy’s father, 47-year-old Curt Boesl, and uncle, 49-year-old Steven Boesl, also died. Authorities said Curt Boesl and Alex were working on top of the silo near Millerville when they apparently were overcome by fumes. Steven Boesl tried to rescue his brother and nephew and also was overcome. By the time deputies arrived, all three were unconscious. Emergency responders removed the three from the silo. Ambulance personnel declared Steven Boesl dead at the scene. Curt Boesl died on the morning of Dec. 22. Community members in Millerville, a town of about 100 residents, have rallied around the Boesl families. A GoFundMe account set up to be split between the two families had raised more than $65,000 from about 800 donors as of Friday night, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is asking a federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that said the state’s ban on most abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy is unconstitutional. The ruling was issued Dec. 13 by a panel of three judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, dealing a blow to those seeking to overturn the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The next day, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant said he wants the state to appeal to the Supreme Court. Papers filed Friday are an in-between step. Mississippi is asking the full 5th Circuit to toss out the panel’s decision and reconsider the case. Attorneys for the state wrote that the panel’s decision conflicted with a Supreme Court ruling in an abortion case “which requires courts to consider not only the burdens a law might impose but the benefits that it provides.” The 5th Circuit panel said U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled correctly when he blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect in 2018.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state has stopped withholding union dues from the bimonthly paychecks of prison guards in what the union’s grievance officer calls a “pitiful attempt to bankrupt” the labor organization. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the maneuver by Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration has left the Missouri Correctional Officers Association with a funding shortfall as it negotiates a new contract with the state for 5,000-plus guards and sergeants. The decision by the state was announced in a Dec. 9 letter from the Office of Administration, which Parson controls. Stacy Neal, director of the agency’s division of accounting, said in the letter that the state would no longer withhold union dues because the bargaining unit is not covered by an existing labor agreement. The union and the state have been negotiating a new contract since the old one expired Sept. 18. Union members have been working under the terms of the old contract since then. Missouri prison guards are among the lowest paid in the nation even after Parson earmarked money for raises in the current budget.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A minimum of $4 million should be raised to invest in much-needed improvements to Hell Creek State Park in order to make it a “genuine destination park” on Fort Peck Reservoir. That’s the recommendation of Tom Towe, a Billings attorney who was appointed as a special liaison to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Director Martha Williams, the Billings Gazette reported. Towe was appointed by Gov. Steve Bullock in 2017 to lead the discussion of funding for the park. He submitted his suggestions to Williams in a letter dated Dec. 18. The last Legislature’s investment of $700,000 into a new sewer and water system for Hell Creek also demonstrated a political will for supporting Hell Creek, he said. Towe got tangled in the fray that erupted when the previous park director was dismissed and the Legislature latched on to unused park funds. After he was dismissed by the governor, Towe negotiated his term as a liaison, despite the fact that he had lobbied to make state parks a separate entity from FWP. Now he is reporting to the FWP director. In his 13 page letter to director Williams, Towe “strongly” recommended that the lease be renewed with the Corps of Engineers so that the state could enter into a 20-year contract with a concessionaire to operate the marina and hotel. That facility is currently operated by Clint and Deb Thomas. Towe said the contract for the concessionaire should be put out for bid, without the state playing “favorites.”\n\nNebraska\n\nValentine: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has declared a fish salvage for Hackberry Lake on the Valentine National Wildlife Refuge. The lake was scheduled to have its existing fish population renovated during 2019 to eliminate common carp on the refuge. But the renovation was not completed because of wet conditions and unsuitable water levels. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said length limits are rescinded during the salvage, which runs through Sept. 30, but daily bag limits are maintained. Fish can be taken only by fishing or archery. Game fish can be taken by archery from July 1-Sept. 30, and nongame fish, such as common carp, can be taken any time. Salvaged fish cannot be sold or used for stocking into other public or private bodies of water.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Wildlife officials said the biggest threat to the state’s desert bighorn sheep is bacterial pneumonia, which continues to kill off entire herds statewide. The Las Vegas Sun reported that the problem was first identified in 2012 and has afflicted herds of the bighorn sheep across the U.S. Desert bighorn sheep, Nevada’s official state animal, number about 10,400. Pat Cummings, a game biologist for the Nevada Department of Wildlife, said officials have learned more about the origins and spread of the disease, but “it’s not in any kind of control.” Nevada Department of Wildlife veterinarian Peregrine Wolff said the sheep likely first caught the bacteria generations ago when they were brought to the U.S. from Europe. Wild bighorn sheep had no immunity to the bacteria, unlike domestic sheep, which has left them vulnerable. Wildlife officials are surveying the estimated 100 herds of bighorns in the state over the next few months. They’re collecting tissues from sheep in each herd to try to identify if they have any conditions that could make them more vulnerable once exposed to bacterial pneumonia, and try to determine what percentage of Nevada’s herds are infected.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHolderness: Registration opens soon for an annual program aimed at helping women learn skills for outdoor activities. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department’s Winter Becoming an Outdoorswoman workshop will be held Feb. 22 at the Owl Brook Hunter Education Center in Holderness. Participants will choose among activities such as ice fishing, winter outdoor survival, snowshoeing and wildlife tracking and woodland target shooting. Registration will open Jan. 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHamilton: A crane being used to remove a tree at a central New Jersey home somehow crashed into the residence on Friday, but authorities said no injuries were reported. The 63,000-pound tri-axle crane came down shortly after noon in Hamilton, while crews were working in the back yard of the Miry Brook Road home. The home sustained some damage in the accident, but the extent and severity was not immediately clear. The crane remained on the home for several hours as emergency responders secured the scene and sought to determine the safest way to right the machinery. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A future mother-in-law tasked with making a phone recording of her future son-in-law proposing to her daughter apparently missed the moment. She ended up recording a selfie on her reaction to what she was seeing. KOB-TV reported Susan Griego somehow took a selfie video of herself watching Benjamin Steele Bacon proposed to her daughter Amber. She did capture the moment Bacon popped the question to Amber by the penguin exhibit at the Albuquerque Biopark. The couple said the selfie video made the proposal more memorable. “People have asked about it. I feel like that’s kind of our relationship. Something wacky and random,” Amber said. “It’s the perfect start to this.” Her mother admitted she’s probably “not very good at photography.”\n\nNew York\n\nLatham: The New York Army and Air National Guard are on track to provide military honors at the burials of about 11,050 veterans during 2019, the state Division of Military & Naval Affairs said Saturday. The expected total is close to the numbers in the last two years. Among the veterans who received the honors this year was Sgt. Francis S. Currey, who was one of the last three surviving Medal of Honor recipients from World War II when he died in October at age 94. Currey, of Selkirk, received the medal for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge. The New York Army National Guard also provided honors for Pfc. Needham Mayes, who had successfully appealed to the Army to reverse his 1956 dishonorable discharge, allowing him to be buried in a veterans’ cemetery with military honors. Mayes, of New York City, died on Veterans Day at age 85. In New York, the burial honors generally involve two National Guard soldiers or airmen presenting an American flag to the veteran’s family and sounding taps on an electronic bugle.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFletcher: A small plane landed in a fiery crash near a western North Carolina airport late Saturday afternoon, officials said. There were no serious injuries reported. The crash occurred about 5:30 p.m. at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center about a quarter-mile from the Asheville Regional Airport, according to local television stations. There were no fatalities and no one was taken to a hospital, Buncombe County Sheriff’s Office public information officer Aaron Sarver said, according to WYFF-TV. Citing the Federal Aviation Administration and emergency officials, WLOS-TV reported a Piper PA-32 crashed east of the airport into a parking lot as it was taking off. Social media posts showed fire and smoke coming from a plane. Firefighters also could be seen watering down wreckage. The crash occurred hours after a small airplane crashed in a Louisiana parking lot, killing five people who were on board.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A man who was hunting pheasants in the Custer Mine area near Garrison on Thursday shot and killed a mountain lion that had emerged from tall grass and charged at him. Gary Gorney told the Minot Daily News that he expected to see a rooster pheasant after his German shorthaired dog had pointed to the area. Instead he was greeted by a female lion that weighed more than 100 pounds. Gorney said he doesn’t remember dropping his dad’s 100-year double-barrel shotgun and reaching for his 9-millimeter handgun underneath his jacket. “My instincts as a military law enforcement officer took over,” Gorney said. “There was no thought process. It was self-defense.” The lion came within 10 feet of Gorney before she was shot. Both of his dogs sprang into action and jumped on the lion. Gorney said he wanted to pull them off but “wasn’t going anywhere near that lion.” Gorney, who has a picture of himself holding the big cat, said it was the first mountain lion he had seen in 31 years of hunting. He said the grass perfectly matched the lion’s coat.\n\nOhio\n\nAda: A town long associated with the manufacturing of footballs has set a Guinness World Record for the most thrown at the same time. The organization certified the record after the attempt was made Oct. 25 by 950 people simultaneously throwing a football on the Ada War Memorial Stadium football field, the Lima News reported last week. Students from kindergarten through 12th grade joined teachers, coaches, bus drivers, school staff and community members to set the record. The Wilson Football Factory in Ada donated more than 1,000 commemorative footballs for the attempt. Workers at the factory make about 3,000 footballs a day, cutting, stitching and lacing each by hand in a 25-step process. The company supplies the football used by the NFL.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma refiled their petition on Friday after facing a fierce backlash over what the plan might do to the state’s burgeoning medical marijuana industry. Two Oklahoma City residents – Michelle Tilley and Ryan Kiesel – filed the new paperwork for State Question 807 with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. Tilley said the petition was redrafted to make sure there were greater protections for the existing medical marijuana industry and its patients. Kiesel is the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. The state question also includes provisions that would allow certain people with previous marijuana convictions to be resentenced or have their criminal records expunged. Once the petition clears a review and challenge period, organizers will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify the question for the ballot. A second, separate petition to decriminalize marijuana in Oklahoma also was filed Friday by a Tulsa man, Paul Tay.\n\nOregon\n\nCloverdale: Authorities are searching for information after three garbage bags full of the remains of ducks and geese were found near the Oregon coast. Oregon State Police said in a release that a person walking their dog on Thursday near the Nestucca River in Tillamook County reported the gruesome discovery. Eight geese and five ducks were found in the garbage bags, with the breast meat removed from three of the geese. The remains were found near where the Cloverdale Boat Launch and the Cloverdale Water District building are located. Anyone with information should contact Oregon State Police troopers in the fish and wildlife division\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHouston: Officials said a large western Pennsylvania public burial ground thought to contain hundreds of remains actually has many more than previously thought – and there’s a new resource available to those who believe a relative might be buried there. Potter’s Field – a term for common graves, those for paupers or unclaimed bodies – was believed to contain as many as 502 people, many of whom might have fallen victim to tuberculosis, The (Washington) Observer-Reporter reported. But research conducted at the behest of Commissioner Harlan Shober, encompassing records kept for 66 years until 1945, concludes that more than 1,300 were likely buried there in unmarked graves. In 1830, state lawmakers mandated that the county care for the poorest of its residents, which often included burial in unmarked graves. Almost 300 grave markers – bearing no names, only numbers – dot the hillside on a field near the site of the old Washington County Home for the Poor in Chartiers Township. A ledger contained the names of 57 people buried from 1879 to 1882, and another microfilm list had deaths from 1912 to 1921. The rest of the data was transcribed from an old, leather-bound ledger listing all deaths at the Washington County Home for the Poor and everyone buried in Potters’ Field from 1912 to 1945, she said. A brief history of the Washington County poor farm, orphanage and homes for aged men and aged women is posted on the county website. The database is available through http://pottersfield.washcopa.org/PottersField/index.aspx.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state will receive an extra $50 million in federal funds for bridge improvement and repair projects. The funding was included in a new federal transportation legislation co-authored by Democratic U.S. Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The federal transportation bill was signed into law earlier this month. Reed said the additional funds, the maximum amount allowable, will help finance repairs to six bridges in Cranston and Providence. Four of them are considered structurally deficient. Reed said the state has received nearly $350 million in federal funds for road, bridge and mass transit improvements in 2019.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Minimum wage employees of Bon Secours St. Francis Health System are in line for a raise. Salaries for those workers are going up to $15 an hour by 2022, the hospital’s parent company, Bon Secours Mercy Health, announced last week. The move is designed to provide employees and their families “a dignified livelihood while working, and in retirement,” officials said in a news release. More than 8,100 employees, or 14% of the system’s 60,000 workers, will be affected by the change, which represents an additional $17 million investment over the next three years, officials said. Bon Secours St. Francis Health System had 3,452 employees in South Carolina in 2017, according to tax filings. Larry Pitts, human resources director for the hospital, said 475 employees will be affected by the increase locally, The Greenville News reported. The move will make the hospital more competitive by attracting health care workers and reducing turnover, he added. The increase will be phased in at all of the system’s U.S. markets, adjusted for cost of living variances. Exceptions include union workers whose wages are negotiated as part of their collective bargaining agreements, or about 7% of the workforce, and the Ireland market, which joined the health system in 2019, officials said. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. South Carolina’s minimum wage is also $7.25 according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: Two Sturgis police officers who pulled a man from a burning home in May 2018 are among 18 people selected to receive Carnegie Medals, known as the nation’s highest civilian award for heroism. Sturgis Police Sgt. Christopher Schmoker and Officer Dylan Goetsch are being recognized by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission for rescuing Jason McKee, who had passed out from heavy smoke in an upper-level bedroom., the Rapid City Journal reported. Using water-soaked clothing tied around their faces as makeshift masks, the officers dragged McKee’s unconscious body down a stairway and got him to the home’s front door, seconds before the fire overtook the living room and hallway where they had just been.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Officials said a bear that decided to make its way through the University of Tennessee campus ended up stuck inside the baseball stadium. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency said in a Facebook post that the bear was reported on the Knoxville campus and stuck inside Lindsey Nelson Stadium early Sunday morning. Wildlife Sgt. Roy Smith and Wildlife Officer Jeff Roberson responded to the scene, where they quickly tranquilized and removed the bear with the help of University of Tennessee police officers. The agency did not say how the bear got stuck inside the stadium. State officials will now transport and release the bear to a “more suitable bear habitat.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The limestone cliffs of Santa Elena Canyon in Big Bend National Park will soon adorn priority mail postage stamps across the country. Designed by art director Greg Breeding with original art by Dan Cosgrove, the stamp depicts the Rio Grande flowing through the 1,500-feet-high canyon, one of the park’s most visited destinations. The stamp, to be released Jan. 18, is part of a focus in 2020 on stamps that celebrate “the people, events and cultural milestones unique to the history of the United States,” according to a release from the Postal Service. The Postal Service receives about 30,000 suggestions annually for stamp ideas. The Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, made up of experts in fields such as history, science and art, review the suggestions and pare down a list for the Postmaster General. Priority mail delivers a package anywhere in the United States in one to three days.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah is about to start requiring nonresidents to get a new type of permit for using an off-highway vehicle in state parks or on public lands. KSL-TV reports that the $30 permit good for 12 months is a result of Utah dropping its recognition of off-highway vehicle registrations from Nevada or any other state. The new requirement takes effect Wednesday. Utah State Parks officials said revenue from permit sales will support recreational areas. Program coordinator Chris Haller said that fewer and fewer states have honored each other’s permits and that only 13 had reciprocity with Utah at the beginning of 2019.\n\nVermont\n\nLewis: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is celebrating eight years of improving trout habitat in northeastern Vermont rivers and streams. Trout thrive in streams that offer places to hide, such as under trees that have fallen into the streams. Fallen trees also create a mix of pools and shallow areas that are used by trout for feeding, reproducing, avoiding high flows and hiding from predators. The Caledonian Record reported that more than 27 miles of brook trout streams have been improved by the placement of large trees in strategic locations. A six-year study in the East Branch Nulhegan River watershed found that on average brook trout abundance tripled in just three years at sites with added trees. The fallen trees store sediment and organic material, helping to reduce the flow downstream of sediment, nutrients and slow runoff, reducing downstream flooding. The work has been done by a variety of organizations including Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, Trout Unlimited on lands owned by Weyerhaeuser and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: One of the largest school districts in the United States has announced that it will allow students one excused absence per school year to participate civic activities such as protests. Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia plans to start allowing the absences on Jan. 27, news outlets reported. The district is the largest school system in the state. Students in seventh through 12th grades can use the day for “civic engagement activities” such as attending marches or meeting with lawmakers, according to district spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell. The new policy was introduced by Fairfax School Board member Ryan McElveen, according to The Washington Post. He said the rule might be the first of its kind in the U.S. Students must give at least two days notice before the absence, school officials said. A parent or guardian has to give permission and students must fill out a form to explain the reason they’re missing school, McElveen said. To address worries about accreditation, the student must stop by their school campus at least once on the day of their excused absence, McElveen said.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A memorial service has been scheduled for a western Washington sheriff’s deputy who died in a car crash while rushing to assist other officers. Pierce County Sheriff’s Deputy Cooper Dyson, 25, will be honored with a public service at 1 p.m. Monday at the Tacoma Dome. The street procession will begin at 11 a.m. at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Dyson died on Dec. 21 after his patrol car crashed into a commercial building while he was on his way to back up two fellow officers dispatched to a house in Parkland for an urgent domestic violence call. Dyson had been with the department since 2018. He is survived by his 2-year-old child and his pregnant wife. It was the first motor vehicle collision death of a Pierce County Sheriff’s deputy since 1941.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner announced the formation of a committee to plan events commemorating the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which gave women the right to vote. Kat Williams, a professor of U.S. women’s history at Marshall University, is helping with the planning. “There will be marches; there will be speeches; and there will be a number of different, exciting events,” she told The Herald-Dispatch. One of the committee’s main goals is to raise awareness of the milestone and its importance, she said. Williams is teaching a special class in the spring 2020 semester that will discuss the history of U.S. women since the passage of the amendment. Helen Gibbins, president of the League of Women Voters of the Huntington Area, said her group is helping to plan local and statewide events. They include a parade on Women’s Equality Day in August, which will begin on Marshall’s campus. A “Right to Vote” Reader’s Theater that the League has performed in years prior will have a special focus on women’s suffrage in 2020, Gibbons said. A complete list of events statewide will be released by the Secretary of State’s Office at the start of the new year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A water main break flooded streets just south of Interstate 94 in Milwaukee on Saturday. The water main ruptured Saturday morning in the area of Hawley Road and Main Street. Law enforcement rerouted traffic and closed off-ramps on the interstate at Hawley Road. Numerous vehicles were partially submerged. Twitter users posted videos showing water gushing down roads into yards and parking lots, and drivers walking in thigh-high water to reach their vehicles and move them to higher ground, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The cause of the break was not immediately reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Landowners have raised concerns about health risks after a potential drilling project was announced near city limits. Samson Energy Company has announced plans to drill 10 to 15 oil wells east of Cheyenne, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The drilling spacing units run from Iron Mountain Road in the north to Interstate 80 in the south and were approved by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, company officials said. The project would remain 1,000 feet from any occupied structure and cannot even cover the entire area, company officials said. Application for the drilling permit will narrow where the drilling will occur, officials said. Part of the proposed 12-square-mile zone falls within city limits, landowners and residents said. An October report from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found people living within 2,000 feet of fracking sites could face an elevated risk of short-term health issues like nosebleeds, headaches, breathing trouble and dizziness, said Wayne Lax, vice president of the landowners coalition. Drilling could begin next summer if permits are approved, company officials said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/22/sequoia-toll-daffodil-project-ferret-release-news-around-states/49419721/", "title": "Sequoia toll, Daffodil Project: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A television station has donated thousands of items including historic footage from the civil rights era to the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which will make the material available to the public. WSFA-TV in Montgomery announced it had given the agency materials dating to the 1950s, including footage from news conferences by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coverage of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and original film from the “Stand in the School House Door” by then-Gov. George C. Wallace in 1963. The video also includes scenes from a visit to the NASA center in Huntsville by the President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson in 1962 and special reports on the death of former University of Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant in 1983. As the TV station was planning to switch locations, managers determined it wasn’t practical to move the large numbers of delicate film reels and boxes full of video and other items. Steve Murray, the state archives director, said archivists had long suspected the WSFA studios held valuable content for historical preservation, and his department jumped at the opportunity to add to its collection when a phone call came in late 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Members of the Biden administration have launched a series of events aimed at exploring the Arctic’s potential to act as a “living laboratory of clean energy innovation.” Officials participating in the online event, billed as “ArcticX,” spoke of the challenges faced by remote communities in Alaska’s Arctic region, such as high energy costs and impacts from climate change. During the event’s broad discussions, they said they see opportunities for sustainable or renewable energy systems. Wednesday’s meeting was the first of four planned online events, with an in-person gathering set for May in Alaska. Among the speakers was U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Offices that fall under the department co-hosted the event. “We hope to combine the world-class expertise of our national labs, of our 17 national labs, with the know-how that Arctic communities have developed over centuries of innovation in the far north so together we can get new technologies out of the lab and into the field and onto the market and support communities in taking control of their own clean energy future,” Granholm said. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources accounted for about 30% of Alaska’s electricity generation in 2019. Many rural communities rely largely on diesel electric generators for power.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Motor Vehicle Division failed to notify more than 34,000 drivers that their licenses had been suspended, revoked or canceled and also lagged for months in alerting prosecutors. The MVD notified county attorney’s offices around the state of the problem Wednesday, saying in an email that notices weren’t mailed “beginning in late 2020 and ending in March.” A glitch with the agency’s mailing process was the cause. “When MVD discovered this issue in February 2021, the first step was to understand what caused the problem, the extent of customers affected and how to resolve the problem,” MVD spokesman Doug Parcey said in an email. “Once those were known, the affected customers were immediately notified.” Some prosecutors learned about the issue from defense attorneys. Potentially thousands of drivers might have been arrested and prosecuted or paid hefty fines because they unknowingly drove with a suspended license. Prosecutors in Maricopa and Pinal counties have already flagged more than 1,000 cases. Municipal and justice courts will also have to review cases involving suspended licenses. “Our first priority is to look at convictions,” said Rachel Mitchell, acting division chief of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. “We are focusing on prison. … It is certainly scary for me as a prosecutor.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Friday delayed a vote on whether to allow state-run health care facilities to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines – a move officials say is needed to protect millions of dollars in federal funding. The Arkansas Legislative Council voted to delay considering the requests by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs for an exemption from a state law banning vaccine requirements by government entities. The law conflicts with a federal COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers issued by President Joe Biden’s administration that’s set to take effect in January. A group of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, have asked a federal judge to block its enforcement. UAMS could lose $600 million in Medicare and Medicaid funding and another $100 million in federal contracts if it doesn’t comply with the federal rule, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson told the panel. Patterson said the exemption was needed to ensure that the university’s workers are in compliance with the federal requirement and that funding isn’t threatened. The panel did not set a date for considering the exemptions. But legislative leaders said they hoped to meet before Dec. 5.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, leading to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday. Fires in Sequoia National Park and surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Nearby wildfires last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 giant sequoias that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Losses now account for 13% to 19% of the 75,000 sequoias greater than 4 feet in diameter. Blazes so intense to burn hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias – trees once considered nearly fireproof – put an exclamation point on climate change’s impact. A warming planet that has created hotter droughts combined with a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled flames that have sounded the death knell for trees dating to ancient civilizations. “The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after police stopped him on the street and put him in a neck hold two years ago, the city and family attorneys announced Friday. A federal magistrate judge accepted terms of the settlement after a mediation session, said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney for McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain. Outside court, Sheneen McClain said she was glad to have the agreement finalized but noted the work of fighting for justice for her son just makes her miss him more. “The money is just the world’s way of saying, ‘We’re sorry,’ but it’s not going to help me heal the hole in my heart,” she said. The settlement amount was agreed to in July but not officially disclosed until now because of a dispute between McClain’s parents about how the wording of the agreement could affect their dispute over how the money should be divided. Sheneen McClain said Elijah’s father, LaWayne Mosley, was not involved in raising him. How the money will be divided will be addressed separately. In a statement, Mosley did not address the dispute but said he hoped the settlement would send a message to police. “I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlymouth: Officials believe nearly 40 drug overdoses across the state since July may be linked to marijuana laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl and are warning the public about the potential danger. State health officials said marijuana seized in Plymouth after an overdose in early October tested positive for fentanyl at the state crime lab. “This is the first lab confirmed case of marijuana with fentanyl in Connecticut and possibly the first confirmed case in the United States,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday. Officials had been investigating reports of people across Connecticut who overdosed and were revived with naloxone but denied using opioids. They told authorities they only smoked marijuana. There were 11 such overdoses in July, nine in August, nine in September and 10 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. No deaths were reported. Brian Foley, an aide to state public safety Commissioner James Rovella, said the state crime lab will now be testing all marijuana that police submit for fentanyl. An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a recent one-year period – a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In October, as the state allocated $78 million in federal money to health care facilities struggling with staffing shortages, hospitals received $25million total – only about one-third of what they requested. Health care workers, who have been fighting the coronavirus for nearly two years, have said they’re burned out and exhausted. Some chose to leave the hospital bedside or the profession entirely. Others declined financial incentives of several hundred dollars offered to fill shifts, citing mental health reasons. Many are jumping ship to other hospitals in Delaware or the Philadelphia area because health systems are providing hefty signing bonuses and significant increases in pay. Hospitals are also relying on travel nurses, who work in three-month shifts, to fill the gaps. Travel nurses can make twice as much or more what permanent hospital nurses take home in pay. ChristianaCare requested $40 million in federal aid, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. Instead, the state’s largest hospital and private employer received $12 million, the biggest sum any health system received. ChristianaCare, like others, continues to offer $10,000 signing bonuses for a number of open nursing positions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser’s decision to ease mask requirements in the nation’s capital has sparked a public debate about timing, with the majority of the D.C. Council pleading with her to reconsider. It’s a localized debate that reflects a broader national dynamic in the country’s coronavirus-mitigation stance, with some leaders and businesses pushing for more normalcy after the successful reopening of schools and others preaching caution against reckless pre-winter moves. Starting Monday, masks will no longer be required in many indoor spaces in D.C. They must still be worn in multiple settings, including schools, libraries, public transportation, ride-share vehicles, and group-living facilities like nursing homes, dorms and jails. Private businesses will still be able to require customers to wear masks. Bowser has cautiously hailed the step as a “shift in where we are with the pandemic,” saying the return of the mask mandate earlier this year helped blunt the late-summer surge of the delta variant. The nation’s capital originally lifted its indoor mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals in May but reinstated it in late July as cases began to rise again. According to D.C. Health Department statistics, the current seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was in May but still well below the late-summer delta-variant peak.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed work on a $339 million Everglades restoration project aimed at cleansing water runoff before it flows into a troubled river. Corps and local officials held a ceremony Friday for the 12,000-acre project in Martin County known officially as the C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area. It’s a key part of a broader effort to restore the vast Florida Everglades. The reservoir will capture, store and clean fertilizer-laden runoff from farms and development before it is routed into the St. Lucie River and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon. Both have been plagued by harmful algae blooms and other long-term problems associated with water pollution that threatens wildlife and human health. “I think it’s huge” for the east coast, said Chauncey Goss, chair of the South Florida Water Management District. “Not only symbolically, but it’s also going to be taking water, cleaning it up and helping to get rid of some of these discharges, which is really the goal of all of this.” The project can store 19.7 billion gallons of water, according to state water managers. It will use plants such as cattails to suck up about 35 metric tons of phosphorus every year before the water makes its way into the St. Lucie River.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCumming: Leaders with Forsyth County Schools, Congregation Beth Israel and the OneForsyth Council have planted 500 daffodil bulbs outside the school district’s new Forsyth County Arts and Learning Center as part of the Daffodil Project, a worldwide initiative aiming to plant the flowers all over in honor of each of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust. Thanks to the partnership, Forsyth County will now be home to 500 of those daffodils, which will bloom in the spring on Holocaust Remembrance Day. FCS Superintendent Dr. Jeff Bearden, Rabbi Levi Mentz with Congregation Beth Israel and OneForsyth Council Chair Kristin Cook all gave opening remarks at a Nov. 8 ceremony before county and school district leaders began planting each of the bulbs. Cook said she was proud to be there, speaking on behalf of OneForsyth, the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce’s diversity initiative, and modeling their guiding principles of uniting, celebrating and promoting inclusion in the county. “Our hope is that, by continuing to support events like these, we will all grow to appreciate the unique identities that embody us all,” Cook said. Metz said he was overjoyed to see the project coming to Forsyth County, his involvement feeling personal to him and his family since his grandfather was a survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering additional protections for waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. NOAA announced the proposal to designate oceanic areas of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which is already one of the largest protected natural areas in the world, as a national marine sanctuary on Friday. The agency opened the plan to public comment through January. The designation would build on existing protections meant to maintain marine habitats and wildlife. The new rules would apply only to oceanic areas, not the islands that are already part of the monument. “Papahānaumokuākea’s ecosystems are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs currently co-manage the monument. Papahānaumokuākea is larger than all other U.S. national parks combined and is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, seabirds and extensive coral reef ecosystems. The area is home to many species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: If anyone has a good idea on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, the U.S. government wants to hear about it. NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab on Friday put out a request for proposals for a fission surface power system. NASA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to establish a sun-independent power source for missions to the moon by the end of the decade. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. If the effort is successful in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next objective would be Mars. NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new store at the Illinois State Museum will feature products from the state, along with themed souvenirs, specialty foods and toys. The Shop opened to the public Saturday. Families were invited to attend an opening event in their flannel and fleece pajamas. The store is located in the first floor of the Illinois State Museum, which owns and operates the Shop to fund programs and research. Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, the museum’s director, called the opening an important moment in the museum’s return to operations. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration shut down the museum in 2015 during an ongoing budget impasse. It reopened the following year but since then has seen closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum was established in 1877 and has branch facilities in Lewistown and Lockport.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A renewed push for the state to join more than two-thirds of states with some form of legalized marijuana use appears to face the same roadblock from Statehouse Republicans who have opposed such a step for many years. Legislative Democrats and the state Democratic Party united last week in urging approval of marijuana legalization during the legislative session that starts in January, arguing that it could benefit those wanting to use it for medical purposes, create new jobs and become an additional state tax revenue source. The Republican-dominated Legislature has not taken any action on bills submitted over the past decade for allowing medical marijuana or removing criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug, even as recreational marijuana sales have won approval in Michigan and Illinois and as medical use is allowed in Ohio. Legalization advocates haven’t yet changed the minds of legislative leaders, who reject arguments that Indiana is losing money to neighboring states and point to pot still being illegal under federal law. “I think when you make the argument about having that substantial a public policy change just because you’re trying to chase dollars makes no sense to me, so I’m in the same place I’ve been,” Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A city park will now be named Ioway Creek Park to align with the creek’s name change earlier this year. The Ames City Council voted unanimously last week to change the name of Squaw Creek Park to Ioway Creek Park. In February, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names changed the name of Squaw Creek, a 42-mile-long tributary of the South Skunk River, to Ioway Creek, as the original name is considered derogatory to Native Americans. The Ames Tribune reports that an Indigenous teen, Fawn Stubben, pushed for the change in the 1990s, but the proposal wasn’t considered until Ames resident Jasmine Martin applied to the federal board in 2019. The Ames City Council and Story County Board of Supervisors both voted in support of the change. The current name honors the Ioway, an Indigenous tribe that once lived in parts of Iowa. Creek sign names have since been adjusted around Ames, but there were still remnants of the former name, including Squaw Creek Drive. The street was renamed Stonehaven Drive as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday formally declared “squaw” a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove it from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Next year, the state will start requiring employers, individuals and health insurance companies to pay some costs associated with coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment announced Friday that it will start phasing out free screening tests for people who aren’t showing COVID-19 symptoms or haven’t potentially been exposed. The agency said it expects the policy to begin in March 2022. The department said it can’t sustain having public health agencies cover the cost of all testing indefinitely. The agency said it initially allocated $141 million in federal funds to make coronavirus tests available and support commercial and university labs to expand processing and sampling capacity. But the department said infections from the delta variant depleted the funds faster than expected. “Testing has become an increasingly important way in which those who choose to be unvaccinated may still be able to work, attend events, and travel,” Ashley Goss, the department’s acting secretary, said in a statement. The changes will mainly affect programs used by employers to test 10% of their workers on a regular basis and programs by community organizations to offer free rapid tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city has received a perfect 100 score from the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, for its laws, policies, services and programs to protect and support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The city received a total score of 106 for additional steps it has taken over the past few years to benefit the LGBTQ community. It’s the highest ranking of any city in Kentucky, though Louisville has received a perfect score for several years. A 100 is considered a perfect score, but cities can earn up to 122 additional points for programs and services. “We’ve worked hard to create an atmosphere welcoming all people,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said. “That hard work has resulted in the highest score received by a Kentucky city.” It’s the first time since the rankings began eight years ago that Lexington has earned a perfect score. In 2020, it received a 95 out of 100. Lexington received high marks despite Kentucky not having a statewide LGBTQ nondiscrimination law. The Human Rights Campaign evaluated more than 506 cities across the country. Other evaluated Kentucky cities include Berea, Bowling Green, Covington, Frankfort, Morehead and Owensboro. Covington’s score was 96. The lowest-scoring Kentucky city was Owensboro with 18.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers on Friday lambasted Louisiana’s temporary housing program enacted after Hurricane Ida, saying it continues to move too slowly to help people living in damaged homes and tents since late August. “We’re moving at a snail’s pace. It’s just unbelievable,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who represents Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, which were among the hardest hit by Ida. The state has spent $90 million in federal disaster aid on more than 2,000 trailers to provide temporary shelter to residents in southeastern Louisiana. Half have been placed on residents’ properties and other community housing sites, and 653 families have moved into the trailers so far, the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness told lawmakers. The program has received near-constant criticism about the time it’s taking to place trailers since Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration launched the Hurricane Ida Sheltering Program on Oct. 4. That critique spilled over into Friday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, as the homeland security agency asked lawmakers to approve $500 million in authority to spend federal disaster recovery aid. Director Casey Tingle defended the housing program, telling lawmakers: “We have a brand new program that’s never been done before.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The developer of a $1 billion electric transmission line is suspending construction at the request of the governor after she certified election results Friday in which residents firmly opposed the project. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills had urged New England Clean Energy Connect Transmission LLC to stop construction on the 145-mile project until legal challenges are resolved. Thorn Dickinson, president and CEO of NECEC, said work will be temporarily halted until a judge rules on a request for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit contending the referendum was unconstitutional. “This was not an easy decision. Suspending construction will require the layoff of more than 400 Mainers just as the holiday season begins,” Dickinson said in a statement Friday evening. Mills supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.” Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the project would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid. That’s enough electricity for 1 million homes. Critics said the project is damaging the woods and changing the character of a part of western Maine with little if any benefit for its residents.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: With sailboats taking over Carroll Creek, a unique holiday tradition has returned to downtown Frederick for its sixth year. About two dozen sailboats were launched in the creek Saturday as part of the annual Sailing Through the Winter Solstice project. Volunteers rushed about Saturday morning, lowering the boats off the banks of the creek into the water. Some volunteers had the unenviable task of wading through the water on the chilly November morning to ensure the boats were anchored in place. Peter Kremers, who co-founded and serves as the chair of the event, said there were about 25 sailboats in and around the creek this year. Now in its sixth year, the project has quickly grown into a beloved part of the holiday season in the city. This year’s event has more sailboats than ever. “We started with one boat in ’16,” Kremers said of the project’s speedy growth. “I think last year we had maybe 19 in the water; this year we have 22 boats in the water and three on land.” The sailboats will stay on Carroll Creek until March, each fitted with lights and decorations to brighten up the dark nights of winter. But the goal isn’t just to make the downtown look nice. The project also helps raise a significant amount of money for a number of local charities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 48-foot white spruce chosen as the city’s Christmas tree has arrived from Nova Scotia as part of a decades-old tradition. This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common on Thursday, WCVB-TV reports. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people. It will be lit Dec. 2. For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reports. Last year, with many people cooped up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree – sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer, shorter trees.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pure Michigan is marketing the state’s upcoming winter season in an advertising campaign running in key regional and state markets. The Still Pure Michigan campaign is expected to run through the end of February and use broadcast and connected television, online video and digital ads, and social media, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said. Much of the focus of the tourism and marketing campaign will be on travel and shopping. Advertising spots will run in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, Traverse City, Cadillac, Marquette and Alpena. They also will be seen in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky. This year’s total winter advertising budget tops $3 million. The launch of the Pure Michigan campaign comes just ahead of the opening of many of Michigan’s ski resorts for the year, according to the MEDC. “As winter approaches, adventure awaits us in the form of downhill skiing, fat-tire biking or snowshoeing epic backcountry landscapes,” Travel Michigan Vice President Dave Lorenz said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Farmers across the state who grow about 45 million turkeys annually will benefit from higher prices this year, according to agriculture experts. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said the price of turkeys has steadily increased as demand has risen following a year when there were fewer family gatherings, and restaurant traffic was down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “USDA is actually predicting this year to be a record-high price for turkeys,” said Tim Petry, a livestock marketing economist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service. “From a price standpoint, these are the best prices they’ve seen for a number of years. So, you know, that’s good news for producers.” The good news on prices is tempered somewhat by rising costs to raise the birds on more than 500 farms in the state, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Higher prices for corn and soybeans to feed the turkeys are cutting into profits, growers said. “Those are our two biggest ingredients, and and those prices were substantially higher than last year or past years,” said Jessica Westbrock, the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. While turkey prices are up 17 cents a pound from last year, Petry said consumers are still likely to find bargains, as many stores sell turkeys below cost.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi School Boards Association is joining a handful of other states in breaking ties with the National School Board Association after the nonprofit sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking for federal support investigating harassment and threats of violence against school board members. Mississippi School Boards’ leadership wrote this week in a letter explaining the decision that the National School Boards Association’s “inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance.” It said Mississippi will end its relationship with the nonprofit NSBA on June 30, 2022, the end of the term for which the Mississippi School Boards Association has paid its dues to the national organization. Mississippi will then work with school board associations in other states to form a new organization that “will provide services to its member state school boards associations which are requested by and tailored to each member state school boards associations’ unique needs.” Local school boards across the country have become political battlegrounds over issues such as COVID-19-related mask rules, the treatment of transgender students, and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A couple who gained fame after waving guns at protesters near their home in 2020 are seeking to keep their law licenses by arguing their actions were justified because they were defending their property from a violent and threatening mob. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, made that claim in response to a complaint asking the Missouri Supreme Court to suspend their licenses. The demonstrators went past the McCloskeys’ home June 28, 2020, at the height of racial injustice protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The couple, who were eating dinner on the patio with their daughter, responded by waving two weapons at the protesters. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt. Their actions gained praise from conservatives, including then-President Donald Trump. Mark McCloskey is now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. They contend in their legal response that the demonstrations “involved significant unlawful and violent conduct,” KCUR reports. The response cites a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association finding nearly 89% of protests in St. Louis in June 2020 involved unlawful activity, and 11% involved some level of violence. Still, special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined the protesters near the McCloskeys’ home were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Biden administration on Friday said it will consider new measures to protect greater sage grouse, a bird species once found across much of the West that has suffered drastic declines in recent decades due to oil and gas drilling, grazing, wildfires and other pressures. The announcement of a range-wide evaluation of habitat plans for greater sage grouse came after the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice president in 2015. A federal court blocked Trump’s changes. But Biden administration officials said the attempt set back conservation efforts – even as the chicken-sized bird’s habitat was further ravaged by wildfires, invasive plants and continued development. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said he believed Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – a former aide to the lawmaker – would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that will keep sage grouse from becoming an endangered species. But Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines criticized the action, saying states should be given deference to manage wildlife and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing. Daines said state and local conservation efforts needs to be protected from “federal overreach,” while Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, said Montana already has a plan that balances conservation and rural economies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s unemployment rate fell to a mere 1.9% last month – the lowest any state has reached since data collection began in 1976, according to labor statistics released Friday. The October rate reported by Nebraska’s labor department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics marked the first time any state’s unemployment rate dropped below 2%. Spokespeople for both agencies confirmed that Nebraska’s rate is the country’s lowest on record. Nebraska has maintained its status as the state with the lowest rate through much of the pandemic. Its 1.9% rate for October was down slightly from the September rate of 2%. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said total nonfarm employment has risen by more than 30,000 from October of last year. The state reported 1,031,001 filled jobs in October, which was 10,718 more than the previous month. Nebraska has struggled with a chronic worker shortage since even before the pandemic, and it has driven up wages and made it difficult for employers to hire and expand. Earlier this month, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry released a survey of its members in which 92% said finding skilled workers was a top priority.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A big southern Nevada sewage pumping facility failed last year, spewing an estimated 500,000 gallons of wastewater and leaking into a creek that leads toward the Lake Mead reservoir on the Colorado River, a television station investigation found. Officials want to spend $40 million to rehabilitate the Clark County Water Reclamation District wastewater lift station, where the January 2020 spill was blamed on a corroded underground pipe, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports. Most of the spilled sewage was vacuumed up from land outside the Whitney Lift Station, KLAS-TV reports, citing documents, photos and emails obtained with a public records request. But an estimated 10,000 gallons – about enough water to fill an average kidney-shaped backyard swimming pool – went into a nearby creek that feeds the Las Vegas Wash. The wash flows to Lake Mead, the drought-stricken reservoir that provides about 90% of the Las Vegas-area drinking water supply. The Whitney Lift Station is one of 24 similar facilities operated by the reclamation district, which was formed in 1956 to reclaim wastewater from unincorporated Clark County, the largest jurisdiction in the Las Vegas area. The district treats nearly 106 million gallons of wastewater per day, according to its website.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers accepted $22.5 million in federal COVID-19 vaccine funding Friday that has sparked intense debate and angry protests for the past two months. The Joint Fiscal Committee had tabled a request from the Department of Health and Human Service in September to spend the money to hire new workers to promote the vaccines and help providers comply with the state’s new vaccine registry system. Meanwhile, the Executive Council, which approves state contracts, initially rejected the money before reversing course earlier this month. On Friday, three Republicans joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting to accept the money. Four Republicans voted no, with some citing concerns that language in the grant would require the state to follow future federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. “The action we take today will be historic,” said Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren. “It will be historic because we will either reject the notion of subservience to government coercion, or it will be historic because we accede to that notion and violate the most fundamental premises of freedom upon which our state and nation were founded and which are imperiled as never before in our nation’s history.” Giuda predicted the vote would become a campaign issue next year. At least one audience member agreed, shouting at Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “Treason! You will never get elected again, Morse! You’re done!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The decades­long odyssey to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, a tenacious leader of the Teamsters union, apparently has turned to land next to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in the Garden State. The FBI obtained a search warrant to “conduct a site survey underneath the Pulaski Skyway” last month, said Mara Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Detroit field office. She didn’t indicate whether anything was removed. The FBI’s disclosure is another turn in a mystery that has gripped law enforcement for more than 45 years. Hoffa was last seen July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit. The focus now is in Jersey City, below a four-lane bridge where the sound of cars and trucks doesn’t stop. Wild overgrown brush thrives in the gritty industrial area, and green dumpsters abound. No one nearby at Interstate Waste Services offered a comment. “I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” journalist Dan Moldea said, referring to the FBI’s work in October.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Internet problems continue to slow down many students in the state, but a pilot project using TV signals to transmit computer files may help. On Thursday, state public education officials distributed devices to eight families in Taos that allow schools to send them digital files via television. The boxes the size of a deck of cards allow digital television receivers to connect with computers using technology called datacasting. Many rural areas of New Mexico are too far from internet infrastructure such as fiber cables and cell towers but do get TV reception. In October, local broadcasting affiliates of New Mexico PBS finished testing the technology to make sure they could set aside bandwidth not taken up by TV show broadcasts and dedicate it to broadcast downloadable digital files. The pilot program in Taos relies on a broadcast from northern New Mexico PBS affiliate KNME, while two others are planning to roll out pilot programs in the cities of Silver City and Portales. Remote learning during the pandemic highlighted the digital divide for New Mexico students, many of whom had to learn using paper packets while their peers could participate in virtual lessons via video chat.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The New York Assembly’s investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office concluded the Democrat’s administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died of COVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee’s still-secret report. Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as this week. The report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, including sexual harassment claims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic. Other topics include the Cuomo administration’s manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public. Gaps in the state’s statistical accounting of fatalities include the administration’s decision to exclude from its nursing home death totals thousands of patients who died after being transferred to hospitals. The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state’s nursing home fatality count.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A bear cub wandering around a neighborhood with a jug stuck on its head is running free in the forest again thanks to wildlife biologists and some observant residents. Wildlife biologists with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission spent two days searching for the bear cub, according to a news release. The commission said the bear likely got stuck while going through some trash and was wandering around an Asheville neighborhood. District Biologist Justin McVey got the initial report about the bear Monday night. Commission officials reached out to the public to help identify its location. McVey said a combination of responses to a message posted to NextDoor by the commission and direct calls to biologists, local residents led personnel directly to the bear cub. The bear was anesthetized before the jug was taken off its head. Biologists performed a health check before relocating it to a remote area in western North Carolina.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library has agreed to take a controversial equestrian statue of the 26th president that has stood on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1940. The bronze statue, designed by James Earle Fraser, was commissioned by the Board of Trustees of the New York State Roosevelt Memorial in 1929. The library opening next year in Medora will be getting it as a long-term loan. The statue, which depicts the former president on horseback with a Native American man and an African man flanking the horse, has been the subject of years of criticism that it symbolizes colonial subjugation and racial discrimination. Objections grew more forceful after the death of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a wave of protests across the U.S. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to remove the statue in 2020, calling it “problematic,” which drew an angry response from President Donald Trump, who tweeted: “Ridiculous, don’t do it!” With the support of members of the Roosevelt family, the North Dakota library will establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black communities, historians, scholars and artists to “guide the recontextualization” of the statue.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a map of new congressional districts Saturday that will be in effect for the next four years, despite objections from Democrats and voting rights groups. DeWine said in a statement that, compared with other proposals from House and Senate lawmakers from both parties, the Senate legislation he signed “makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map.” The redistricting measure cleared the Legislature along party lines with House approval Thursday after a breakneck sprint through both chambers, amid praise from majority Republicans. Democrats blasted the Republican-led mapmaking process as unfair, partisan and cloaked in secrecy. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday, only about 16 hours after the new map was released. The nonpartisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an F grade. The new law creates at most three safe Democratic districts out of 15 new U.S. House seats in a state where voters are split roughly 54% Republican, 46% Democratic. Populous Cuyahoga and Hamilton counties – home to Cleveland and Cincinnati, respectively – are divided three ways each. Franklin County, home to Columbus, is divided two ways, and the western Cleveland suburbs in Lorain County are part of a district that stretches to the Indiana border, a nearly 3-hour drive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s building code commission has undermined the efforts of its own committee tasked with reviewing energy conservation standards by shooting down proposed changes and completing a takeover of the committee itself. Last week’s actions leave green building in Oklahoma a dozen years behind, stuck in 2009, standing pat with current minimum standards, said Kelly Parker, chairman of the committee whose months of work was spurned. The committee started its work in May as part of a state-mandated code review every six years to update the state’s modified versions of various building codes. But committee members had not seen the commission’s recommendations on energy conservation until they were presented Tuesday. Commission Chairman Cary Williamson, Ardmore’s fire chief, wondered why and argued that the energy committee, effectively shut down in October, should have been allowed to do its job. Commissioner Kyle Lombardo, an architect with Rees Associates, complained that he was not given time to review the complex, technical recommendations, which will go to state lawmakers next year. The Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission further eroded efforts to make home construction in the state more environmentally friendly, Parker said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A man who was protesting outside the city’s federal courthouse when a federal law enforcement officer shot him in the face with a “less lethal” impact munition is suing in federal court. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit filed by Donavan LaBella calls the unnamed officer’s actions “unprovoked, unjustifiable, and unlawful.” LaBella’s injury July 11, 2020, was captured on video and shared widely. The video depicts then-26-year-old LaBella holding a speaker over his head, pointed at the courthouse. Federal officers turn on a bright light, and then an officer fires a less lethal munition striking LaBella. Like other protesters who have tried suing federal law enforcement agencies over injuries at protests for racial justice, LaBella’s attorneys have struggled to identify the officers. The lawsuit names “John Does 1-10″ as unknown federal law enforcement officers, believed to be with the U.S. Marshals Service, present or responsible for shooting LaBella. Desiree LaBella, Donavan’s mother, said the people responsible for injuring her son need to be held accountable. “As much as we wish it didn’t have to come to this, he’s irreparably damaged,” she said. He now suffers from a debilitating, permanent frontal lobe brain injury that has negatively altered the course of (his) life,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Frozen vials labeled “Smallpox” that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in the state “contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,” federal health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain “vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine,” and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. The CDC had said Monday that the vials “were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker” who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents. Mark O’Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County. It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was “in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization” about the findings. Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, followed by spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority is getting a $900,000 federal boost to develop plans for a high-capacity transit corridor to connect Central Falls to Warwick via Providence, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The corridor was one of five goals included in RIPTA’s Transit Master Plan for the next 20 years. The planning grant could enable RIPTA to complete the preliminary work needed to eventually bring a bus rapid transit or light rail project to the region. The $900,000 planning grant is made available through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity grant program, for capital investments in surface transportation that will have a significant impact on or directly benefit areas of persistent poverty. The state’s congressional delegation and RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian have scheduled a news conference for Monday at the agency’s Chafee Transportation Center in Providence to discuss the study and its potential impacts.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSeneca: One of the most wanted fugitives in the United States apparently died about four months ago in a South Carolina home about 16 years after he was first wanted in San Diego for sexually assaulting children, investigators said. Frederick Cecil McLean, 70, died of natural causes in July, but his body wasn’t found until Nov. 6, when someone asked deputies to check on a neighbor who hadn’t been seen in a while, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said. McLean has been on the U.S. Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list since 2006, a year after the San Diego Sheriff’s Department issued arrest warrants for sexual assaults on a child and determined he was a high risk to continue attacking girls. One girl was assaulted more than 100 times before she turned 13, marshals said in a statement. McLean had been living in South Carolina for 15 years, going by the name of James Fitzgerald, marshals said. “The discovery of Frederick McLean’s body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,” U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis said. Investigators are now trying to determine if anyone helped McLean avoid being found by police. They have determined he used several other aliases and also lived in Anderson, South Carolina, and Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMcIntosh: The work of two wildlife management agencies has resulted in the release of 28 endangered black-footed ferrets on the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the Dakotas. The push behind the effort by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is twofold: to maintain control of black-tailed prairie dogs in an area of the reservation used primarily for grazing and to save from extinction the black-footed ferret, considered the most endangered mammal in the U.S. They are yellowish-buff in color and weigh 11/ 2 to 2 pounds. The forehead, muzzle and throat are white, and the feet are black. They have a black mask around the eyes that is well-defined in young ferrets. The ferrets were released Oct. 20 in prairie dog towns between McIntosh and Bullhead, said Michael Gutzmer, ecologist with New Century Environmental, the Nebraska company that provides biological services to the tribe, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Prairie dogs make up 90% of the black-footed ferrets’ diet. The ferrets live in prairie dog burrows, and each eats a prairie dog about every three days, said Seth Gutzmer, biologist on the Standing Rock project and Michael Gutzmer’s son. The ferrets were considered extinct in the wild in 1987.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Friends and associates of slain rapper Young Dolph handed out Thanksgiving turkeys at a neighborhood church Friday, two days after he was gunned down in broad daylight inside his favorite bakery. Known for acts of charity in his hometown, the hip-hop artist and label owner had helped organize the event at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and was going to participate before he was fatally shot Wednesday. Undaunted, members of his music label, Paper Route Empire, along with church volunteers and community activists, distributed dozens of turkeys, stuffing mix and cranberry sauce to people driving past the church. It was the type of event Young Dolph, who grew up in the Castalia neighborhood where the church is located, has been organizing for years, often without the reporters and cameras present Friday. Before the event, volunteers spoke quietly among themselves or sat in solemn reflection as his music played outside the church on the sunny afternoon. Label employee Bee Bee Jones, 38, helped hand out the food, honoring his friend of 30 years. “When I hear his music, I just break down,” Jones said. “The truth in all of it, and where he came from, that’s what really gets to me sometimes. This is what he would want us to do right here, still keep on giving. He came from nothing, but he wanted to make sure everybody got some.”\n\nTexas\n\nBig Spring: A pickup truck heading the wrong way on a West Texas highway slammed into a bus carrying members of a high school band, killing three people, officials said Friday. Two students from the bus were critically injured in the late Friday afternoon crash on Interstate 20 in Big Spring, about 250 miles west of Fort Worth, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The bus from Andrews High School was headed to a football game with 25 students aboard when it was hit by the wrong-way truck, which burst into flames, killing the truck’s driver, said DPS Sgt. Justin Baker. One of the adults from the bus was also pronounced dead at the scene, he said. A third adult and two students were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, 95 miles north of the crash site. The adult died at the hospital, and the two students were listed in critical but stable condition, Baker said. Other students were taken to the Scenic Mountain Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, he said. The football playoff game between Andrews and Springtown in Sweetwater was postponed.\n\nUtah\n\nBeaver County: Climate change has been making droughts more frequent and intense and limiting Utah farmers’ ability to grow crops. In the past two years, a growing number of farmers have signed up for a state program that helps fund projects to increase their water use efficiency, KUER-FM reports. Among them is Trent Brown, a longtime rancher and farmer in Beaver County who’s also the county assessor, since farming doesn’t pay all the bills. It’s a family tradition: His father and grandfather were ranchers and farmers and worked government jobs, too. Brown finished the switch from growing alfalfa to grass five years ago to save water, but it wasn’t enough to overcome this summer’s drought. Earlier this year, he used a grant from the state’s Water Optimization Program to replace the cement in a ditch that brings water from the nearby Manderfield Reservoir to him and other farmers in the valley. “The concrete ditch was put in in the ’60s, and it was just falling apart, failing,” he said. “We were losing a lot of water. We figure probably 20%.” Utah established the Water Optimization Program in 2020. It got $3 million in state funding that year and another $3 million in 2021. During the latest round, the program got 81 applications totaling $10.6 million – more than triple the money available to spend, according to the program’s director, Jay Olsen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Captain Snowpants; Yo Bro, No Snow; Plow-A-Tron 6,000; and Jennifer Snowpez are among the names that will be on some of the state’s snowplows this winter. Vermont school students participated in the state transportation department’s Name a Plow contest to come up with names for the plows serving their communities. The entries ranged from “creative and clever to cute and silly,” the agency said. Participating schools got a visit from their newly named plows last week. One child was so upset she had missed the visit from the snowplow named Super Snow Storm that the driver and plow will visit again, said Amy Tatko, spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The full list of the Vermont names – including Snowbegone Kenobe, Plowy McPlowFace, Brr-rito and Steve – can be found on the transportation department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order Thursday aimed at improving how the state receives and evaluates input from tribal nations when making decisions about permits related to environmental, historical or cultural resources. The order directs four agencies to draft their own policies within 90 days for working with tribal nations before a permit is approved or denied. The Northam administration said this would help Virginia identify and understand concerns from tribal nations before finalizing permits, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The directive applies to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Northam’s executive order also directs the secretary of the commonwealth to appoint an ombudsman who can work with both state agencies and tribal nations. Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will take office a month before Northam’s deadline and could potentially cancel the executive order. The Youngkin transition team didn’t immediately respond to the Times-Dispatch’s requests for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As lawmakers prepare for a new legislative session to craft and pass a supplemental budget, they’ll have more money to work with thanks to a steady increase of state revenues over the past year. Updated numbers by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council released Friday show that projected revenue collections for the 2021-2023 budget cycle are $898 million above what had been originally forecasted in September. And projections for the next two-year budget cycle that ends in mid-2025 increased by more than $965 million. Revenues for the current budget cycle that ends mid-2023 are now projected to be $60.2 billion. And projected revenues for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1, 2023, are projected to be about $64 billion. Steve Lerch, the chief economist and executive director of the council, said compared to the first forecast this year in March, overall revenues increased $3.6 billion for the current biennium and $4.1 billion for the next. Republican legislative members of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council said in response to the strong growth, tax cuts should be part of any final plan. Democratic budget writers said nothing is off the table but expressed caution.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBramwell: A 128-year-old church collapsed suddenly in the middle of the night Thursday, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Bramwell’s historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, which has stood since 1893, caved in about midnight, Mayor Louise Stoker told the paper. The church’s original congregation included many of the town’s first residents, Stoker said. The Independent Bible Church later occupied the building before donating it to the town, which had been planning to conserve the historic structure. “I’ve been in dialogue with a preservation contractor,” Stoker said. “This week, in fact, we had sent him photos.” Workers clearing the debris noted things that could be saved such as large wooden beams and the old church bell. Some of the church’s Queen Anne-style stained glass windows were also mostly intact. Stoker said the town council will discuss what to do next, but it’s possible that a portion of the building that didn’t collapse will have to be taken down. Standing outside the church Friday, she pointed out six circular stained glass windows in the remaining structure. “Not one of them has a broken piece,” she remarked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: As the state kicked off its 170th deer gun season Saturday, some hunters were feeling ill-equipped for the second straight year. A nationwide ammunition shortage due to the supply chain issues affecting other products has left hunters searching far and wide for ammo in the first place and then shelling out more money if they do find it. Randy and Tiffani Rogness, who own Paddock Lake Sporting Goods in Salem, had empty ammunition shelves Friday. When a new supply is delivered, it lasts two to three hours, even with a one-box limit per customer, they said. “We search everywhere. We’ve ordered so much, and it’s just not coming in,” Tiffani Rogness said. One of the nation’s biggest ammunition manufacturers, Vista Outdoor in Anoka, Minnesota, said it’s “ramping production ahead of schedule at its Remington facility to meet unprecedented demand.” The price of almost any caliber ammunition is double what it was a year ago. Manufacturers say the pandemic created new gun buyers, along with more hunters looking for something to do outside, WISN-TV reports. More than 570,000 deer hunters from around the world are expected to try their luck in this year’s nine-day season, Department of Natural Resources officials said. Wisconsin has more than 7 million acres of land open for hunting.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the past four months, people have been protesting the presence of sexual education and LGBTQ books in the children’s and teen sections of the Campbell County Public Library. The movement, part of a national trend, is being led by the Wyoming chapter of MassResistance, a national group headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, that prides itself on “pro-family activism.” The local chapter was formed in July. Since then, the group has worked to get its message out to the community that the library is actively corrupting the youth with its books, the Gillette News Record reports. “It’s been hard on the library staff,” said library director Terri Lesley. “It’s been a long time, and I’m very proud of them for how well they’re doing, how well they’re holding up. It’s not easy to be in the middle of a big controversy.” MassResistance’s goal is to protect “the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society.” It believes in marriage between a man and a woman and that people are not born homosexual. Library board member Charlie Anderson said he’s been called names, and Lesley said she and some of her staff have received angry emails and letters, some from out of state. Lesley said she’s also received a lot of support, which has helped balance out the calls for her resignation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/05/stolen-turtle-bald-eagles-peregrine-falcons-amazing-avalanche-survivor-news-around-states/111397766/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The Xscape Tapas Grille has been fined nearly $25,000 by the city following a Valentines Day record-release party for a local rapper that violated occupancy limits. The club has a maximum occupancy rating of 99. The party for rapper D-Aye packed the club with 342 people, meaning it was 243 over the rated capacity. Because of this, the city fined the club $100 per person over the limit for a total of $24,300. Xscape owner Frank Walker appeared in front of the City Council on Tuesday to review the violation. Walker asked the Council to reduce what his attorney called an excessive fine, but was told he would need to appeal the fine to city administration. He argued he was bringing people together for a positive event to celebrate a rare success in Montgomery, but more people showed up than expected. Walker’s attorney, Preston Presley, said Walker was looking into installing a $30,000 sprinkler system that would allow him to expand capacity of the club. Councilwoman Audrey Graham brought up a past violation in March 2019 when Xscape was 42 people over capacity. “The first time there was a small amount and you paid the fine and we are here again,” Graham said. Graham did ask if the Council could reduce the fine. Councilman CC Calhoun said the fine was set by ordinance and the only way it could be reduced was by an administrative process through the mayor’s office. When asked if the mayor’s administration would appeal the fine, Director of Public Information Michael Briddell said he didn’t know what the mayor’s response would be, but other mayors have been reluctant to throw out a fine.\n\nAlaska\n\nGalena: A dog musher participating in an event near Galena was injured when she was struck by a snowmobile. Kirsten Bey, 64, of Nome was flown from Galena to Fairbanks with what Alaska State Troopers called “significant” injuries. Bey on Sunday night was participating in the Serum Run. After leaving Ruby, she was hit about 5 miles outside of Galena. Another participant in the Serum Run transported her to Galena by snowmobile. Troopers received word of the crash Monday. The driver of the snowmobile who struck Bey later contacted troopers and is cooperating with the investigation, troopers said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:K-12 public district school spending increased in the state by $475million from 2018 to 2019, but the boost to teacher salaries promised by Gov. Doug Ducey fell short, according to a new report. The state Auditor General’s annual report examining classroom spending found that school districts spent 54.7% of their funding in the classroom in fiscal year 2019, a slight increase from 54% in 2018. It’s the third year in a row that classroom spending rose. The report also examined Arizona teacher salaries. Ducey in 2018 promised a 20% teacher raise by 2020. According to Ducey’s plan, about 10% of that raise would have been sent to schools by July 2019 to distribute. But during that period, according to the report, the average teacher salary actually went up 8.4%. The report does not include classroom spending data on public charter schools.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he will commute the life sentence of a woman convicted more than three decades ago of fatally shooting her husband, who had physically abused her. Hutchinson announced his intent to make Willie Mae Harris, 72, immediately eligible for parole, citing the physical abuse Harris suffered. Harris was convicted of first-degree murder in 1985. Harris admitted to shooting her husband, Clyde, but said it was an accident related to self-defense. Harris is legally blind and the state Parole Board several times over the years has recommended she receive clemency. Her case has gained renewed attention in recent months following columns by Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Mike Masterson and a story by The Appeal, a website focused on criminal justice issues. In her most recent application for clemency, Harris said she did not receive a fair trial because none of the evidence of the abuse she suffered was presented. She included an affidavit from her aunt, who said Clyde Harris once broke Willie Mae’s hand with a universal joint from a car. Hutchinson also said planned to commute the sentence of Robert R. Johnson Jr., 36, who was sentenced in 2008 to 86 years in prison on multiple nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTemecula:A man who became wedged deep inside a narrow storm drain was extricated Tuesday following an hours-long rescue operation mounted by firefighters. The man, whose name was not released, was discovered about 1 a.m. about 270 feet inside the tunnel in the 31000 block of Hickory Place, near Aspen Way, according to the Riverside County Fire Department. There was no immediate word on how or why he got into the drain. A half-dozen engine crews and three truck companies, as well as a hazardous material unit, were sent to the location and initiated attempts to pull the man out of the 18-inch diameter passage, but he was uncooperative for unspecified reasons, and personnel had to switch strategies, according to the fire department. The ensuing technical rescue using industrial equipment, and relying on assistance from the Eastern Municipal Water District and the Temecula Department of Public Works, succeeded in removing him from the drain shortly after 9 a.m., according to the fire department. The man was taken to Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar for treatment of what were described as moderate injuries.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The city has reached a $325,000 settlement with a woman who said she was beaten by a police officer in 2018 while being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting at a Target store, attorneys said. Natasha Patnode has said former police officer Todd Hopkins struck her with his fist and baton 50 times, sat on her and tased her, the Coloradoan reported Tuesday. Patnode reached the settlement with the city on Feb. 13, defense attorney David Lane said. City attorney Carrie Daggett confirmed the agreement. Hopkins responded to a shoplifting call from Target, authorities said. He was not wearing a body-mounted camera because his shift had just ended, but Target surveillance footage showed Hopkins grabbed Patnode by the collar, took her to the ground, used pepper spray and sat on Patnode as he tried to handcuff her, the newspaper said. Then-interim Police Chief Terry Jones requested an investigation of Hopkins, who resigned after it determined he should be fired. Patnode pleaded guilty to assault and resisting arrest. A shoplifting charge was dismissed.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The largest organization of cities and towns in Connecticut has called on the state and businesses to provide them with more help in addressing the expensive environmental fallout from chemicals in firefighting foam and similar products. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities said the $2 million in borrowing Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont proposed in his budget is good but not enough. The funding is supposed to help cities and towns get rid of the foam, which contains toxins often called “forever chemicals,” and replace it with different firefighting products through a new buy-back program. There’s also more than $857,000 proposed in Lamont’s budget for things like replacing firefighting foam used by state agencies and to plan and test for the chemicals in statewide surface water and sediment. High levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively called PFAS, have been found in drinking water systems in Greenwich, Willimantic and Enfield, the Hartford Courant reported in February. There were also multiple spills of thousands of gallons of firefighting foam containing the chemicals that entered the Farmington River last year.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A Muslim cemetery that failed a code inspection and was ordered closed was granted special permission to bury a 1-year-old child, officials said. The Muslim Cemetery of Delaware in New Castle County was issued the permit this week, and will be able to continue burying people regularly once safety concerns are met, County Executive Matt Meyer said at a news conference Wednesday. The county closed the cemetery last week after learning it did not meet state code because it failed to provide designated parking spaces or paved paths through the grass, The Delaware News Journal reported. Officials were alerted to the problems after a rainy day this winter when visitors were seen placing wood planks over the ground to avoid mud, said Imam Muhammad Salaam of the Muslim Center of Wilmington. The Islamic Cemetery of Delaware remains registered with the state Department of Health and Social Service to have a cemetery on the property, and is legally permitted to perform funerals there once the safety issues are addressed. The county granted the cemetery a special permit for the Friday burial of infant Ja-Ziyah Gordon, who was set to be taken off life support after a battle with a terminal lung condition, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Librarians at some district public schools could see cuts in their positions next year, according to the Washington Teachers’ Union, WUSA-TV reported. The school district confirmed that it received “some” petitions regarding librarians in the budget submissions, but could not confirm the number. According to DCPS policy, librarians are classified as a “Level 2 staff member,” which means “flexible with petition.” Essentially, schools are not required to maintain the position if they state a case for the reallocation of that money to other needs. The union tweeted that 25 petitions have been submitted to get rid of librarians, saying the announcement came at a meeting with librarians Tuesday night. DCPS confirmed 25 petitions have been submitted to get rid of librarians. All but three came from East of River. The union and librarians said they’re concerned that increased budget cuts could cost them their jobs, and cost children the access to resources that Boyd said they will need to succeed.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Fears of the new coronavirus have led to postponement of the three-day Ultra electronic dance music festival, city officials said. The festival that draws thousands of people from around the world was set to begin March 20 at Miami’s downtown Bayfront Park. Steven Ferreiro, chief of staff for City Commissioner Manolo Reyes, said the event will be postponed, with an official announcement expected Friday. It’s likely Ultra could be postponed until 2021, meaning there would be no festival this year, officials said. Mayor Francis Suarez had said at an earlier news conference that Ultra should not go forward because of the coronavirus concerns. It wasn’t immediately clear how the postponement will affect people who bought tickets or whether other satellite events would still take place. Among the acts scheduled to perform at the main event are David Guetta, The Chainsmokers, Afrojack, Cash Cash, Martin Garrix and Galantis, according to the Ultra website.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state Senate unanimously passed legislation to restrict practices by pharmacy benefit managers – companies that run prescription drug coverage for insurers and other groups – just a day after the state House took similar action. The bill would require pharmacy benefit managers, called PBMs, to pass along discounts they receive from drug manufacturers for a particular medication to consumers. It would also subject PBMs to surcharges for ordering patients to use an affiliated pharmacy and require them to cover the cost of prescriptions at other pharmacies, among other provisions. It passed the Senate by a vote of 52-0, after the House passed a companion bill 165-1 on Wednesday. Supporters of the measure are concerned that PBMs – viewed as middlemen by critics – are overcharging patients, squeezing pharmacies and stifling competition that could bring down drug costs. PBMs argue that drug makers are responsible for setting initial prices, and they use their purchasing power to achieve savings.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A councilman accused of leading a methamphetamine ring must be held without bail, a U.S. judge ruled Wednesday. Arthur Brun led a major drug-trafficking conspiracy involving 11 other defendants since at least June 2019, while serving as an elected member of the Kauai County Council, prosecutors said after his arrest last week. Brun, vice chair of the council’s Public Safety and Human Services Committee, has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Brun must be denied bail because in allegedly leading the meth ring, he supplied guns, conspired with a gang leader, requested sexual favors for drugs and assaulted a law enforcement officer. Brun obtained meth from a leader of the United Samoan Organization gang and had the drugs mailed to Hawaii from California, prosecutors said. Another co-defendant is a convicted felon whom Brun used for protection, prosecutors said. Crystal meth is the drug of choice in Hawaii, where it’s known locally as “batu” or “ice.” Mailing or shipping drugs to Hawaii became more common with increased airport security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when it got more difficult to smuggle drugs through air travel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation significantly increasing what it will cost nonresidents to hunt deer and elk in Idaho has been signed into law by Gov. Brad Little. The Republican governor signed the measure Tuesday that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said resident hunters asked for so there will be less overcrowding in the field. Fish and Game is doing that by capping how many nonresidents can hunt deer and elk. But that will result in reducing Fish and Game revenue with fewer nonresident hunters. Estimates put the loss at $5.4 million and $9 million a year. To make up for that, Fish and Game is increasing hunting and fishing costs for nonresidents. Most notably, the costs for elk and deer hunting are going up dramatically, which are the two most profitable areas for Idaho Fish and Game. An elk tag for a nonresident hunter would cost $650. A fishing license would cost about $106. The increases will go into effect on Dec. 1. Fish and Game officials said the increases are the first in 10 years for nonresidents and put the state more in line with what neighboring states charge nonresidents for hunting and fishing. About 39,000 nonresidents bought elk and deer tags in 2019.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Casey Urlacher, a brother of Chicago Bears Hall of Fame linebacker Brian Urlacher, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges alleging he was part of an offshore sports gambling business. Urlacher, the mayor of the suburban Chicago village of Mettawa, entered his plea with nine others in U.S. District Court. He is charged with conspiracy and running an illegal gambling business. Prosecutors alleged Urlacher and the others were part of a ring that raked in millions of dollars. Urlacher, 40, acted as an agent for the gambling ring. He is accused of recruiting bettors in exchange for a cut of their eventual losses. acting with Urlacher as an agent was Nicholas Stella, 42, a Chicago police officer, prosecutors said. Stella has been stripped of his police powers. Among the other “agents” charged were Matthew Knight, 46, of Mokena; Justin Hines, 40, of Algonquin; Todd Blanken, 43, of Cary; Matthew Namoff, 23, of Midlothian; Vasilios Prassas, 37, of Chicago; and Keith Benson, 49, of Lombard. The ring was headed by 54-year-old Vincent DelGiudice of Orland Park, who paid a Costa Rica-based sportsbook a service fee to use its online platform and recruited gamblers to place wagers on the website, according to prosecutors. DelGiudice pleaded not guilty during Wednesday’s hearing and was released on his own recognizance. DelGiudice’s father, Eugene, 84, was also charged. Urlacher was elected mayor of Mettawa in 2013 and re-elected four years later. He said at a village meeting this week he intended to stay on as mayor while he fights the charges. However, he did resign from his position on the Illinois Civil Service Commission, to which he was appointed in 2013 by then-Gov. Pat Quinn.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel:Hamilton County Parks officials believe a 10-year-old turtle named Sputnik was stolen from Cool Creek Nature Center and are appealing to his abductor to return him, no questions asked. “Don’t just release him in the wild, he wouldn’t be able to survive,” said Parks and Recreation Director Al Patterson. “Our only goal here is to get Sputnik safely back in his enclosure.” Authorities said Sputnik was last seen during feeding time on Feb. 15 but was not discovered missing until Feb. 18 after President’s Day. He lived in a 50-gallon glass case on a stand, about eye level for small children, and was apparently lifted out and smuggled through the doors. “Unfortunately, we can’t keep our eyes on everyone at all times,” Patterson said. Sputnik is described as 8 inches tall and 6 inches wide, weighing 11/ 2 pounds with a ruddy brown shell, four claws and a happy disposition. He needs vegetables daily and sunlight and is accustomed to regular veterinarian care. There are no security cameras at the center and leads about Sputnik’s whereabouts have been few, Patterson said. Anyone with information about the tortoise can call Cool Creek Nature Center at (317) 774-2500 or the county parks offices at (317) 770-4400.\n\nIowa\n\nDecorah:A bald eagle known as Mrs. North laid her third egg on March 4, according to a livestream by the Raptor Resource Project. The Project estimated that Mrs. North would lay her first egg between Feb. 17 and Feb. 23, and she ended up laying her first egg on Feb. 21 and the second on Feb. 24 – just as she did in 2019. The nest is high in a white oak tree on private property near a stream. Another bald eagle named Mom Decorah laid her first egg on Feb. 26 and second on Feb. 29. According to the Project, this likely will be Mom Decorah’s last egg of the 2020 season. She is almost 17 years old and has now laid 36 eggs on the property, the project said in a Facebook post. Mom Decorah is mated to Decorah Male Two. Her original mate disappeared in April 2018. Their nest is settled in a tree near a trout hatchery. According to the project, eggs typically hatch in about 35 days, so viewers could be seeing at least one eaglet from either Mrs. North or Mom Decorah by late March or early April. A livestream of the Decorah eagle nest, which began last June for this mating season and has been following the eagles for 10 years, is consistently watched by more than 1,000 people.

Police said thieves broke into Topeka Lutheran School early Thursday. The damage was discovered when teachers and staff arrived to work, WIBW reported. More than 20 laptops and Chromebooks, several iPads, food, a document camera, cash, a security storage system and sports uniforms were taken, police said. The school canceled classes Thursday so teachers and staff could clean up the damage.\n\nKentucky\n\nWhitesburg: Letcher County Schools has removed a Bible verse from an athletic locker room after receiving a complaint from the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The decision came after the organization sent a letter to the district stating that the message violated the Constitution, schools Superintendent Denise Yonts told WYMT-TV on Wednesday. Yonts said officials decided to paint over the verse after consulting with the school board attorney becuase it was not a student-generated display. Freedom from Religion Foundation co-president Annie Laurie Gaylor said in a statement that she applauded the action.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:Bossier Parish deputy Verdis Walker was promoted to Command Sergeant Major of the Louisiana National Guard. “It’s been a long time in the making. This is my 30th year as a guardsman and I’ve reached the pinnacle in the enlisted ranks,” Walker said. The ceremony was held at the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Training Academy because Walker is going through police training at the academy. He is set to graduate from the academy on April 24.During the ceremony, Walker expressed this thanks and appreciation to multiple people in the audience, including his mother and father, who sat in the front row. Walker graduated from Haughton High School in 1984 and enlisted in the Louisiana National Guard a few years later. He started in the Army band in Bossier City and then moved into the Recruit Sustainment Program to help recruits prepare for basic training. Later, he deployed to Baghdad, Iraq, with the 39th Military Police of Camp Minden. For his service there, Walker was awarded a Bronze Star. He was sworn into the Bossier Sheriff’s Office by Sheriff Julian Whittington in March 2019. As of August 2019, Walker was assigned to the Bossier Maximum Security Facility.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal to beef up health insurance benefits for retired emergency responders has received the approval of a state legislative committee. The bill from Democratic Sen. Nate Libby is designed to make stronger the state’s law about the health insurance program for retired firefighters and law enforcement officers. The Labor and Housing Committee unanimously approved the proposal on Wednesday. A previous law sponsored by Libby created a change in which counties and municipalities that employ first responders must notify them of the Retired County and Municipal Law Enforcement Officers and Municipal Firefighters Health Insurance Program less than two months after they are hired. Libby’s new proposal makes changes such as removing the requirement of five years of contributions by enrollees. It also changes the percentage of gross wages for contributions. The bill must pass the full House of Representatives and Senate to become law.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A measure to extend the state’s sales tax to most professional services has been rejected by a House subcommittee on Wednesday night. The measure would have raised an estimated $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2025. It was proposed to pay the state’s share of a major education funding plan that is advancing in the legislature. However, the extension of the tax was widely opposed by Maryland business groups. Del. Eric Luedtke sponsored the bill. He said a House subcommittee has advanced a smaller package of revenue measures for the education proposal, which would be phased in over 10 years. The Montgomery County Democrat said on Twitter that officials will have more work to do in the future to fund later years in the education measure.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s first recreational marijuana shop – and the state’s first black-owned one – is set to open next week. The Cannabis Control Commission on Thursday authorized Pure Oasis to begin operations in three calendar days or later. The “commence operations” notice was the last administrative step needed after regulators awarded it a final license last month. Owners Kobie Evans and Kevin Hart said they plan to welcome the first customers to their storefront in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood at 11 a.m. Monday. Pure Oasis is the first store to open after participating in the state’s “equity” programs to help black, Latino and other businesses owners from communities impacted by the war on drugs enter the legal marijuana industry. Massachusetts has nearly 40 retail marijuana locations, but only one is in Greater Boston: New England Treatment Access, in the affluent suburb of Brookline. Black and Latino groups have voiced their frustration for months at the slow pace of approvals for minority-owned businesses in Massachusetts and nationwide. And in Boston, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh has faced criticism for his city’s particularly slow rollout of pot shops since voters approved legalizing marijuana in 2016. On Wednesday, Walsh announced he had appointed five people to a new Cannabis Board meant to oversee the local approval process.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Art Van Furniture, the metro Detroit-based company and the Midwest’s top furniture and mattress retailer, said it is shutting down and will begin liquidation sales at all of its company-owned stores in Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. The shock announcement comes just three years after the company’s sale by the Van Elslander family to a private equity firm. Boston-based private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners bought a majority stake in Art Van Furniture in early 2017, about a year before the death of company founder Archie Van Elslander at age 87. Art Van is expected to declare bankruptcy early next week. The filing would be a Chapter 11 reorganization, yet could potentially result in the permanent closure and liquidation of all Art Van Furniture stores – unless one or more buyers step forward to rescue the retailer. The liquidation sales will begin Friday at all Art Van Furniture, Art Van PureSleep and Scott Shuptrine Interiors in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, as well as select Levin & Wolf stores in Maryland and Virginia. The Art Van stores are to close in 60 days. Art Van has about 190 stores and about 3,100 employees. Twenty of the stores are franchise locations, situated in the company’s “outmarkets” including the Upper Peninsula, Alpena, Mount Pleasant and Owosso in Michigan and in Indiana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSartell:Riders of the Metro Bus ConneX on-demand ride service could see fares double for the remainder of the program’s pilot phase this year. The Metro Bus Board of Commissioners will hold a public hearing on the proposed change at 3:30 p.m. March 17 at Sartell City Hall, according to a release from Metro Bus on Tuesday. After a period of public comment, the board will vote whether to increase the fare for a single ride from $1.25 to $2.50, effective April 1. Fares for regular bus routes and Dial-a-Ride service will remain unchanged, and the increase wouldn’t affect free transfers. The service began its pilot program in January 2019, and was originally scheduled to last six months. It has been extended twice and ran through the end of December. Beginning February, the service began reduced hours and expanded its service area into the portion of Sartell east of the Mississippi River. Riders on the ConneX service can call to request pickup, after which a bus picks them up and anyone else requesting the service along the way. The service drops off at destinations or connects to regular bus lines. The service replaced most of Route 32 to cut down on expenses from constantly moving empty buses. The pilot program will end Dec. 31, after which the board will decide whether to make it a permanent service.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A man sentenced to 120 years in prison on a drug charge will soon be free. Circuit Judge Lee Howard freed 66-year-old Felix Wynn of Starkville during a hearing Tuesday at the Oktibbeha County Courthouse based on new sentencing guidelines, news outlets reported. Wynne was convicted in 2006 on two counts of selling cocaine. As a habitual offender, he was given 60 years for each count and a $2 million fine. Howard resentenced Wynne for the time he has served, 13 years and 10 months, and dropped the fine. Wynne will be held in the county jail until the Mississippi Department of Corrections processes his paperwork. His attorney, Roy A. Perkins, and the judge believe the paperwork process should take about four days. Perkins argued that the 120-year sentence was a misinterpretation of the law. Howard initially sentenced Wynn under a statute that orders the maximum sentence with no parole and no chance of early release, according to circuit court documents. Perkins said Howard was wrong to believe the maximum sentence was the only option, and he cited state Supreme Court precedent from 2017 that a person can, but does not have to, receive a double prison sentence for a second charge, the Commercial Dispatch reported. Wynne briefly spoke before the court during Tuesday’s hearing, during which he apologized and took full responsibility for the crime, WTVA-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nUniversity City: A suburban St. Louis man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people in a bustling entertainment district while dressed as the Batman villain the Joker has been charged with terrorism. Jeremy Garnier, 48, of University City was charged Tuesday with a felony count of making a terrorist threat. A judge ordered Garnier held without bail, with court documents noting that he was a “danger to the community.” Court records did not list an attorney who can speak on his behalf. The charging document doesn’t indicate whether he was in possession of any explosives or was otherwise armed. Police responded Monday night to the Blueberry Hill restaurant and music club in the Delmar Loop neighborhood in University City after receiving a call about an active shooter, according to the charging document. The charges said Garnier had made threats while dressed as the Joker. A nearly hourlong livestream posted to the Facebook account for a Jeremy Joseph Garnier showed a man dressed as the Joker, complete with makeup, talking to the camera in a bedroom where he is putting on a costume. He’s later seen driving in his car, smoking a pipe and going to the St. Louis Galleria shopping mall in Richmond Heights, where he’s stopped by security and asked to leave. The video then shows him talking about ending the country’s opioid epidemic before he enters the venue where he orders a soda, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Within minutes, the man was handcuffed with the livestream still rolling. Garnier has eight burglary and stealing convictions dating to 1990.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman:A snowmobile trail groomer survived after accidentally triggering an avalanche on Feb. 27 and being swept in his vehicle about 165 feet downhill. Daniel Kristensen, 30, of Belgrade, president of the Gallatin Valley Snowmobile Association, was working his way up an old logging road in the Gallatin Canyon that climbs out of Storm Castle Creek up and over the divide to Swan Creek. At about 8 p.m., he was about 3 to 5 miles from finishing when he encountered a large drift across the road. Using the PistenBully snow groomer’s front blade, he began breaking up the drift, pushing the snow off the road on the downhill edge. It was a route he had driven once earlier this winter. While grading the ,snow Kristensen triggered an avalanche on the slope above him. It broke 2 to 3 feet deep and 100 feet wide before crashing downhill on a 38-degree slope. In the 470 feet before reaching the road, the snow picked up speed and grew larger before striking the groomer on the driver’s side. When the machine came to a stop against some pine trees, it was right-side up and still running. Snow filled three-quarters of the cab because all of the windows had been broken out. Kristensen said he took about 30 seconds to assess the situation: he was alive, no limbs seemed broken and there was no blood gushing. Yet his mind was still in disbelief about what had happened. If the avalanche had been larger, if logs or rocks had been tossed into the cab as it rolled, or if his arm had been thrust out the window when the machine tumbled, the situation could have been much worse. “I got so lucky,” Kristensen said. “It’s a blessing for me.” He said he has a sore neck from the crash and scratched up his hands digging through the glass-filled snow in search of his gloves, but other than that, he’s OK. The club will now reasses where they groom because the route he was on doesn’t get a lot of traffic.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Dangerous weather conditions for brush fires were forecast Thursday for much of the state, meteorologists said. A red flag warning from the National Weather Service said low humidity and wind gusts up to 45 mph were expected. Brush fires have blackened thousands of acres across Nebraska this week, officials said. Regional 26 emergency manager Alma Beland estimated that firefighters battled flames Monday on between 1,500 and 2,000 acres between Thedford and Stapleton. A blaze north of Lodgepole forced closure of U.S. Highway 30 for a time Wednesday. It was contained by 6 p.m., officials said. It’s not clear how many acres were charred.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Firefighters contained a blaze in an apartment building where two people were rescued by firefighters on ladders and a young child was dropped to safety from a third-floor window and caught by a passer-by Thursday. No injuries were reported. There was no immediate word on cause of the fire. Battalion Chief John McNamara said a fire truck on a nonemergency call diverted to the apartment building after firefighters spotted a large smoke column. Once there, they saw heavy smoke coming from second- and third-floor apartments. Arriving firefighters saw a crowd outside the building and a child being dangled out of a window, McNamara said. “Before they could stop them, the child was dropped and was caught. Then we threw some ground ladders up to the third floor windows and assisted the two residents out the windows,” he said. Other residents were evacuated without incident. Regarding possible injuries, it“made a huge difference” that the child was caught and that firefighters quickly rescued the two other people, he said. Firefighters quickly contained the fire but at least 12 units suffered damage, McNamara said. “It could have been a lot worse,” he said. Twelve fire trucks with approximately 50 firefighters responded to the three-alarm fire.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A female bear who journeyed thousands of miles to return home after being saved and relocated by Gov. Chris Sununu is preparing to emerge from her den with three new cubs. Sununu joined Fish and Game officials on Wednesday to check on “Mink,” who was set to be euthanized along with three of her offspring in 2017 after repeated problems with them feeding from trash and bird feeders culminated with two bears entering a home in Hanover. Sununu instead ordered them to be moved to far northern New Hampshire, but by last spring, Mink had found her way back to her preferred home near Dartmouth College. The bear is hibernating in a den in the same area. Sununu said her three male cubs weigh just over 6 pounds each and are all in good health. Mink’s three yearlings were moved soon after the public outcry over the euthanasia plan in 2017, but one was killed within weeks by a hunter in Quebec, Canada. Mink wasn’t captured then because she left town to mate and later returned with four cubs in 2018. She was fitted with a tracking collar in June of that year and moved about 120 miles north, but returned to Hanover last May after traveling thousands of miles in a looping route through New Hampshire and Vermont. Officials favoring euthanasia had argued the animals were no longer afraid of humans and likely would find new neighborhoods to frequent if moved, or would eventually find their way back to Hanover.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater Township:Two state troopers pulled a trucker to safety just seconds before his burning tractor-trailer exploded. Trooper Robert Tarleton had stopped a vehicle on Interstate 287 on Monday when he saw the truck become engulfed in flames after it hit a guardrail and bridge abutment, state police said. “He immediately returned the driver’s credentials and ran back to his troop car to request for fire and emergency medical services personnel to respond to the crash,” state police said. Tarleton drove to the scene of the crash, where State Police Lt. Edward Ryer, who was headed home from work, was trying to rescue the driver. Police body camera video showed the two troopers worked together to drag the trucker from the cab to safety seconds before it exploded. The driver sustained minor injuries. His name has not been released. The cause of the crash was under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCuyamungue: A woman is facing a larceny charge after authorities said she stole a neighbor’s anatomical skeleton model that allegedly was making an offensive gesture toward her. Court documents filed Monday showed that Diana Hogrebe was charged with one count of larceny in connection with the skeleton heist, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. Hogrebe told Santa Fe County Sheriff’s deputies she was offended by the way the skeleton’s hand was posed – with the middle finger pointed up. Hogrebe told the Santa Fe New Mexican the episode was the culmination of a monthslong feud between her and neighbor Joseph Downs, who she said has hassled her family and other nearby residents. “I just, you know, had it,” Hogrebe said. “It was like the last straw that broke the camel’s back, and I don’t know what to do.” The skeleton has not been located, authorities said. According to the deputy’s statement of probable cause, the skeleton was a gift to Downs from a family member and was worth about $1,500.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A reptile breeder in upstate New York has paid a $500 fine related to the possession of more than 150 venomous snakes in his home, the state Department of Environmental Conservation said. The DEC said in a report that investigators got a warrant to search the Orange County home of Darren Paolini after the man was hospitalized for a venomous snake bite last June. He had been bitten by a Taiwanese pit viper at his home, where he had a sophisticated breeding operation in the basement. Officers seized 157 live venomous snakes and several years of breeding records from Paolini’s Newburgh home. The snakes, which included 29 species, were turned over to the Bronx Zoo. DEC said Paolini told an investigator he gets snakes from importers, breeds them and trades the babies for new snakes. Paolini pleaded guilty to misdemeanor commercialization of wildlife charges in February and agreed to pay a fine, DEC said. In June, Paolini told News12 Westchester that he had studied Asian pit vipers for 30 years and was an expert on breeding them. “It’s just been a love in my life. A passion since a young child,” he said. He said he had believed reptile permits he obtained in 2005 were still valid.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: A federal inmate has died from injuries sustained in a fight with at least one fellow prisoner, authorities said. A verbal altercation between Maurice Antoine King, of Durham and at least one other inmate escalated late Wednesday at the Orange County Detention Center, a county sheriff’s spokeswoman said in a statement. King, 35, was taken to a hospital following the fight and was pronounced dead, the statement said. The other inmates involved were not immediately identified. Sheriff’s officials didn’t comment on the circumstances leading to the fight or the nature of King’s injuries. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was continuing to investigate.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: State regulators voted Wednesday to reject a permit for a proposed wind farm in Ward and McLean counties. The Public Service Commission denied the permit for Southern Power’s Ruso Wind project by a 2-1 vote, the Bismarck Tribune reported. But the commission left open the possibility of reconsidering the project. The project had difficulties complying with a 2017 state law requiring new technology to stop lights atop the turbines from blinking red all night. Southern Power planned to use radar-based light-mitigating technology, which would have turned off the lights at night except for when aircraft pass in the vicinity of the turbines. But the Minot Airforce Base raised concerns that the blinking lights could tip off an enemy to a helicopter’s location – the Air Force flies hundreds of helicopter missions annually to intercontinental ballistic missile sites, some near the proposed turbines. Others complained that flashing red lights would ruin the dark night sky. A message left with Southern Power was not immediately returned to the Associated Press.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city’s police chief will not discipline a police supervisor who detained a 12-year-old black youth’s sister the day the youth was fatally shot by a white police officer while playing with a pellet gun. Cleveland.com reported that Chief Calvin Williams dismissed the civilian complaint against Sgt. Janell Rutherford on Monday. Cleveland police Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said the decision would not become official until the end of a 30-day period during which an appeal can be made to the city’s Public Safety Director. The city’s Civilian Police Review Board had recommended in November that Rutherford receive an unpaid suspension of six to 10 days for keeping Tamir Rice’s 14-year-old sister, in the back of a police cruiser for over an hour after Tamir was shot in November 2014. Rice’s sister filed the complaint against Rutherford in 2015. Subodh Chandra, an attorney for the Rice family, issued a statement that said the children’s mother, Samira, “is no longer shocked by the unwillingness of the police chief to hold anyone accountable, but she is disappointed.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Voters rejected a citizens’ initiative for a dedicated parks sales tax largely on the strength of voters’ opposition in Cleveland and Canadian counties, The Oklahoman reported. The loss was a blow to former Ward 2 Councilman Ed Shadid, who promoted the initiative campaign that collected nearly 8,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot. Former Ward 4 Councilman Pete White ran a shoestring campaign to pass the initiative. The campaign was a rare case of citizen legislating in Oklahoma City. Only five previous citizens’ initiatives had made it to the ballot since 1930. All five were approved. Two of those, in 1989 and 1990, created dedicated sales tax revenue streams for public safety and for the Oklahoma City Zoo.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: Because of low snow pack and precipitation, Gov. Kate Brown signed an executive order this week declaring a drought in Klamath County. Brown issued a drought declaration saying that the extremely low water supply is causing natural and economic disaster conditions heading into spring and summer, the Capital Press reported. The declaration gives state agencies the ability to expedite water management tools such as emergency water permits, exchanges, substitutions and in-stream leases to mitigate conditions on the ground. Snowpack is 35% below normal in the Klamath Basin as of March 4, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Mountain snow is crucial because it acts as a natural reservoir, replenishing streams and lakes during the irrigation season. Neighboring Rogue and Umpqua basins in Southern Oregon are also lagging behind typical nowpack , as are the Lake County and Goose Lake areas. Ken Stahr, surface water hydrology manager at the Oregon Water Resources Department, serves as co-chair of the state’s Drought Readiness Council, which considers requests from counties for drought aid. He said no other counties have filed applications yet, though now is the time of year when communities might begin to sense the impacts of drought.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State troopers will now be allowed to have tattoos on their arms, but those who do will have to wear long-sleeved uniform shirts that conceal them when they are on duty, the agency announced Wednesday. In a statement, Col. Robert Evanchick, the state police commissioner, said the policy change reflects an “evolving public perception” about tattoos. The agency hopes the new policy will widen its field of potential recruits. Before Wednesday’s announcement, troopers could have tattoos, as long as they were not visible to the public. Troopers still cannot have tattoos that are above their neckline or below their wrist, the state police said. Tattoos that could be seen as hateful or discriminatory toward any race, national origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity are prohibited. A committee will review tattoos on prospective cadets during the hiring process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A man authorities have said is the leader of the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club will remain behind bars after failing to “keep the peace” while out on bail. Superior Court Magistrate Richard Raspallo ordered Joseph Lancia, 28, of Smithfield to be locked up after being arrested over the weekend for a scuffle at a strip club, WPRI reported Wednesday. He was charged with disorderly conduct and simple assault in connection with a fight late Saturday night outside the Cadillac Lounge after a Providence police officer said he witnessed Lancia punch someone, knocking him unconscious. At the time, he was out on a $100,000 bail in a separate case after he was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly firing a gun at a truck as the driver was passing by the Hells Angels headquarters. Prosecutors at Tuesday’s hearing said that the Saturday night brawl broke the terms of his bail and asked that he remain in custody. His attorney, Joseph Voccola, said security video showed his client was coming to the defense of his fellow club members when he punched the off-duty member of the strip club’s security team. The judge ordered Lancia to be held without bail. He is due back in court on March 10.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLancaster: Two people were accused of having 10 dead dogs and 26 malnourished animals on their property. Steppes Stagvelt Starwolf, 62, and Stevie Jenna Starwolf, 53, have been charged with ill treatment of animals, news outlets reported. The relationship between the pair was not stated. The dead and sick animals were found Friday during a welfare check at a home in Lancaster, according to a news release from the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office. Ten dog carcasses were found in a trash bag outside the house, the sheriff’s office said. No one answered the front door when officers arrived, but officials obtained a search warrant and entered the home. Authorities said 25 huskies and a cat were inside the house, some in cages. “None of the animals had accessible food or water, and all appeared to be malnourished and in ill health,” the release stated. Both suspects returned to the home Friday night with another dog in their vehicle. They appeared before a magistrate on Saturday. Both were released after posting $10,000 bond. It was unclear whether they had attorneys to comment on their behalf. The sheriff’s office said all of the animals were taken to a shelter for treatment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A proposal to give South Dakotans the option to take the written portion of driver’s license examinations in Spanish is headed to a final vote in the House after a committee approved it Thursday. Proponents from the Latino community in South Dakota told lawmakers it would empower them to get to work, take their kids to school and participate in community events. A similar proposals died last year, but the measure this year appears to have broad support, including from business groups. It has passed in the Senate. Alex Ramirez, a member of the Hispanic Business Network in Sioux Falls, said South Dakota is one of three states that does not allow driver’s license exams to be taken in Spanish. It has sent a message to Latinos that they are not welcome in the state, he said. Sen. V.J. Smith, a Brookings Republican who introduced the bill, said he has had to overcome attitudes from constituents and some lawmakers that people should only speak English. He pointed out that there are German-speaking communities in the state. The House Transportation committee passed the bill on an 8-3 vote. Lawmakers opposed to the measure said drivers should be able to read road signs in English.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two mobile units have been deployed to help residents who lost state driver’s licenses or photo identification in severe storms that ravaged Tennessee counties this week. Tennessee’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security said Wednesday that mobile units that can issue duplicate licenses or photo IDs have been sent to Nashville in Davidson County and Cookeville in Putnam County.Fees for duplicate licenses or IDs will be waived, officials said. Meanwhile, Tennessee’s Department of Commerce and Insurance has set up a facility at Centennial SportsPlex in Nashville to answer questions about insurance policies and storm coverage. Major insurance carriers will be in attendance also for people to make claims in person, officials said. Officials are also helping residents with insurance questions at the Wilson County Emergency Management Center in Lebanon and the Putnam County 911 Center in Cookeville. State emergency officials said 24 people died when fast-moving storms crossed Tennessee early Tuesday. Eighteen of them, including five preteen children, died in Putnam County, some 80 miles east of Nashville. Eighty-eight more were injured in the county.\n\nTexas\n\nPort Arthur: A 24-year-old man was sentenced Wednesday to 30 days in jail for posting on social media a video last August of himself removing an ice cream container from a Texas market freezer, licking the contents and returning the container to the freezer. D’Adrien Anderson, 24, also was sentenced to an additional six-month jail term probated for two years and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,565 in restitution to Blue Bell Creameries, which had to replace all of its products in the freezer. Anderson began serving his jail term immediately after sentencing. The incident happened Aug. 26 at a Walmart in Port Arthur. Store surveillance cameras showed that he finally took the Blue Bell ice cream from the freezer and bought it, which wasn’t captured in the social media video, authorities said. Anderson could have been sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined $4,000 for misdemeanor criminal mischief. Port Arthur is about 85 miles east of Houston.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Brigham Young University reiterated Wednesday that “same-sex romantic behavior” is not allowed on campus – dashing the hopes of LGTBTQ students who thought they could be more open after the college previously revised its code of conduct. The university, owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, posted a letter online, saying it was clarifying a misinterpretation after it dropped a section of the code banning behavior that reflected “homosexual feelings.” A college administrator wrote that the recent revision doesn’t change the “moral standards” of the church or the faith’s opposition to same-sex marriage. The letter and an accompanying Q&A posted online don’t provide details about what romantic behaviors are and aren’t allowed, but seem to shut the door on the notion that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates. “Same-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code,” wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system. BYU officials said on Feb. 19 that questions about permitted behaviors by same-sex couples would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but the issue hadn’t been addressed again until the letter was released Wednesday. The clarification letter caused fury and heartbreak among LGBTQ students and allies, said former BYU student Addison Jenkins, a past president of a campus support group for gay and lesbian students. He called it “cruel” to dash the hopes of LGBTQ students who felt the campus climate would become more welcoming, and then two weeks later issue this new letter that shows “anti-queer rules” remain.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Twelve towns have voted to become founding members of a regional communications group to spread high-speed internet to underserved neighborhoods. Residents approved their town’s participation in the Southern Vermont Communications Union District this week, the Bennington Banner reported Wednesday. Tim Scoggins, the head of the task force that worked to create the group, said the new internet system will likely be in place within three to five years. The group plans to form a governing board made up of representatives from each member town. The board is expected to meet in April. The towns included in the group are Arlington, Bennington, Dorset, Landgrove, Manchester, Peru, Pownal, Rupert, Sandgate, Shaftsbury, Sunderland and Woodford.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: For the fourth year in a row, nature lovers will be able to watch a livestream of a peregrine falcon nest in downtown Richmond. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has set up a live video feed of the nest on the 21st floor of the Riverfront Plaza building. The feed is available for viewing online at www.dgif.virginia.gov/falcon-cam. The department said in a news release that wildlife officials have confirmed that last year’s new male – identifiable by his bands – is back again with an unbanded female. In the past two years, there has been a lot of turnover in falcons at the site and no nesting, although the birds have appeared on camera. Officials said the return of the male falcon is a sign of some stability, and they are optimistic that the pair will breed successfully. The department, which manages the threatened birds, has collaborated for the last four years with Comcast Business to provide connectivity for the live broadcast. March is typically a busy month as falcons tend to nest during this time following a period of courtship, with the first egg laid around mid- to late-March. The falcon cam will remain live until July.\n\nWashington\n\nMoses Lake: A police dog had his left removed during surgery after being shot while chasing a suspect, authorities said. The suspect led police officers on a car chase for several miles Feb. 28 before getting out of the vehicle and running away, KING-TV reported. The suspect was pursued by an officer and his police dog partner, Chief, authorities said. The suspect shot Chief in the eye during the pursuit before officers returned fire, fatally shooting the suspect, police said. Chief initially needed a breathing tube, but was stabilized and treated over a few days by veterinarians at Washington State University. The bullet destroyed Chief’s eye and broke his jaw, but did not cause other permanent damage, health officials said. Chief had eye-removal surgery Wednesday before going home to recover, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials announced a restoration project was underway to bring back bobwhite quail, which disappeared from the state in the late 1970s because of habitat destruction and harsh winters. The five-year plan launched last week when 48 of the birds were captured in Texas and released at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area, news outlets reported. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources was working with the Texas Parks and Wildlife agency on the plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Transmitters have been placed on some of the quail for monitoring. The goal is to create “a self-sustaining population” of quail, said Michael Peters, DNR Game Bird and Small Game Project Leader, in the release. The restoration effort has been underway for the past several years. The state DNR acquired the Tomblin WMA, a 32,000-acre tract of former surface-mined land in Logan and Mingo counties, in 2015.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Part of a city-owned closed landfill at 1600 E. College Ave. near Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport will be dedicated to generating solar power, under a resolution adopted by the Common Council. Aldermen on Tuesday unanimously approved leasing to We Energies about 8 acres, where the company will build and operate a 2.25-megawatt solar array through its Solar Now pilot program. The lease lasts 20 years. The resolution states that revenue from the lease “is intended” to be put toward other climate action initiatives. The lease payments will depend on what’s generated, but they’re estimated to be between $90,000 and $100,000 each year, Ald. Scott Spiker said. The city won’t pay anything to build or maintain the solar array, he said. It will be built next to the 128th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard, and in an emergency, the solar field would provide a source of energy for the base should something happen to the electrical grid.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Actor Harrison Ford and rapper Kanye West will take part in a celebrity softball game for charity in Wyoming. The game June 13 in Cody will raise money for cancer research, organizer Ryan Brown told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other confirmed players include former Denver Broncos football players Byron Chamberlain, Spencer Larsen and Shawn Moore, said Brown, athletics director for the city of Cody and host of a local radio show. “The crazy thing is they don’t know who I am,” Brown said. “They’re just like, ‘Yeah, I’m in.’ It’s just amazing how people jump on stuff like this.” Tickets for the game and related events can be purchased online for as low as $2.24. Sponsorships range from $50 to $5,000. Ford is best known for his roles in the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” movie franchises. He has a home in Jackson. West recently bought two ranches in the Cody area and has become active in the community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/08/music-city-moves-cannabis-boost-bag-ban-delay-news-around-states/115269430/", "title": "Music City moves, cannabis boost: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Mayor Randall Woodfin was released from a hospital Wednesday after being treated for COVID-19 and planned to continue recovering from the illness and quarantining at home. Woodfin, 39, was admitted to Princeton Baptist Medical Center on Monday with pneumonia in his left lung caused by COVID-19. He said a grandmother who died of the illness caused by the new coronavirus was being laid to rest as he was being discharged. “That pains me. I can’t be there, and I miss her. She was 87 years old and she died of COVID-19,” he said in a statement. “If you don’t have to be out, don’t be out. Wash your hands. Wear your masks and practice social distancing.” Woodfin received Remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy during his stay in the hospital. Woodfin fell ill at the same time three other Alabama mayors from Auburn, Decatur and Florence were fighting the illness. Meanwhile, state health officials urged patience Wednesday amid a slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, saying it plans soon to expand who is eligible to get the shots. The state is in the first phase of its vaccination plan, which prioritizes health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, about 377,000 altogether.But it has only received 226,000 vaccines so far.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: A school district established a limited intranet system in an attempt to provide students with more reliable distance learning amid the pandemic. The Lower Kuskokwim School District said every student has now received the hardware necessary for the intranet system, although a teacher said some homes are still not connected, KYUK-AM reports. “It’s a slow process because the actual hardware that families need to install on their home, it’s a self-install because of COVID, because of health mandates,” said Jeffrey Behselich, a science teacher in the village of Atmautluak. He said about a quarter of homes in the community are still not connected to the intranet system, which functions like a limited internet. Lockdowns of communities in the southwestern Alaska district to slow the virus’s spread left students and families navigating the new technology without assistance. Teachers also had to learn the software and remotely provide instruction to students about its use, Behselich said. Deployment of the district’s intranet was delayed for months, forcing schools to rely on paper packets. Many students withdrew from school activities as a result.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Five months after President Donald Trump hailed Arizona as a model for how it dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts warned Wednesday that the state has become “the hot spot of the world” and that health restrictions the governor has been hesitant to impose could have tamped down the crisis. “It’s way worse than July already, and it’s going to continue to get worse. We’re probably two weeks behind LA in terms of our situation,” said Will Humble, head of the Arizona Public Health Association, referring to Los Angeles County, where a COVID-19 surge has created a shortage of oxygen and led ambulance crews to stop transporting patients they can’t revive in the field. Arizona on Thursday reported nearly 300 more coronavirus deaths, a pandemic-high number of fatalities for the second time this week, along with nearly 10,000 additional known COVID-19 cases. The surge has stressed Arizona’s health care system, and the state’s coronavirus dashboard reported a record high of 4,920 COVID-19 patients occupying inpatient hospital beds as of Wednesday. The 1,101 patients in intensive care beds also set a record. Arizona has the worst coronavirus diagnosis rate in the country, with 1 of every 119 people in the state testing positive in the past week.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported a near-record increase in coronavirus deaths Wednesday as cases continued to mount. The Department of Health reported 65 new deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, bringing the state’s total fatalities since the pandemic began to 3,901. The increase was the state’s highest since it reported a record 66 deaths Dec. 29. The state’s virus cases rose by 3,705 to 242,593. Its hospitalizations, which had hit record levels in recent days, dropped by two to 1,321. “It has been a tough day with the loss of another 65 of our friends and neighbors to COVID-19,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement released by his office. “Vaccine doses continue to be distributed across the state to those in Category 1-A, and we are also receiving additional doses each week.” Nearly 4% of the state’s intensive care unit beds and 21% of its hospital beds are available, according to the Department of Health. There are 427 COVID-19 patients in ICUs around the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Millions of low-income Californians would get a $600 payment from the state under a budget proposal by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The proposed payment, announced Wednesday, would go to people with annual incomes of less than $30,000, including immigrants living in the country illegally who file taxes with the state. Roughly 4 million people would be eligible for the payment, for a total state cost of $2.4 billion. Newsom is also asking the Legislature to extend a moratorium on evictions. Newsom called on lawmakers to join him with a sense of urgency to help Californians who are dealing with stress and anxiety about the prospect of putting food on the table, paying for child care or facing eviction. State lawmakers normally pass the budget in June, but Newsom is asking them to act early on several proposals to provide faster relief to people suffering due to the coronavirus pandemic. California’s unemployment rate was 8.2% in November, the most recent month with available state data. But that doesn’t reflect the true number of out-of-work Californians, as many people have stopped seeking work. A handful of Democratic lawmakers joined Newsom for a virtual announcement, indicating he’ll find support in the Legislature.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis sought Wednesday to assure residents the state is vaccinating against COVID-19 as quickly as it can, urging patience as officials target highly vulnerable populations in the campaign’s initial stages. The Democratic governor had come under criticism over the holidays for slightly easing statewide restrictions on businesses without notice and adjusting a vaccination plan that put residents 70 and older in a high-priority vaccination category ahead of teachers. Polis defended those decisions Wednesday, arguing in the first instance that a recent downward trend in COVID-19 hospitalizations allowed the easing of restrictions on businesses. The governor insisted that vaccinating residents 70 and older will significantly reduce virus deaths, saying that age group accounts for nearly 80% of the nearly 4,000 COVID-19 deaths to date in Colorado. Over the next two months, front-line workers such as bus drivers and grocery, farm and manufacturing workers will be eligible for vaccines, said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the state health department. That group potentially encompasses 1.3 million people, she said. The general population can expect vaccine availability this summer. Teachers can expect their vaccines beginning in March, Ryan said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The first two known cases of a new, more contagious variant of the coronavirus have been detected in the state, Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday. The two people, described as between ages 15 and 25, live in New Haven County, and each had traveled recently outside the state, one to Ireland and one to New York state. Genetic sequencing showed the cases are unrelated, the governor’s office said. Meanwhile, the ability to install cameras in rooms, a statewide visitation policy and full-time infection control specialists are among recommendations by members of a committee considering pandemic-inspired changes at Connecticut nursing homes. Members are also suggesting that Lamont sign an executive order allowing residents of long-term care facilities to designate an “essential caregiver” for in-person visits. “There were a lot of people that wasted away because of their lack of being able to see family,” said state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, who co-chairs a subcommittee of the Nursing Home and Assisted Living Oversight Working Group that is focusing on improvements to socialization, visitation and caregiver engagement.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of lawmakers wants a special committee to investigate how the state’s Department of Correction has handled the COVID-19 pandemic. Legislators will introduce a resolution to create the committee and have it make recommendations regarding prison health care. A separate bill is aimed at allowing some prisoners early release. Delaware’s prisons have seen more than 1,750 prisoners infected with the coronavirus and 12 die with it. Prisoners have questioned whether prison officials have exacerbated the spread of the virus. Prisoners have also said that vulnerable inmates have not been protected sufficiently from the virus. State prison officials have disputed those opinions as “false narratives” and portrayed the situation as under control. A Department of Correction spokesman said officials have been “actively and responsibly engaged with legislators, inmate families, and other stakeholders throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district is maintaining a “zero-waste” policy for the COVID-19 vaccine to ensure doses get used if people don’t show up for their appointments to be inoculated, WTOP-FM reports. According to the outlet, the policy helped a law student score an unexpected vaccination at a D.C. pharmacy.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state launched an investigation Wednesday into an upscale nursing home amid reports that it administered COVID-19 vaccines to wealthy donors and members of a country club along with its residents and employees. The Washington Post and New York Post both reported that MorseLife Health System, a nonprofit that operates a nursing home and assisted living facility in West Palm Beach, has given vaccinations to donors and members of the Palm Beach Country Club, whose foundation has donated at least $75,000 to MorseLife since 2015, tax records show. The newspapers report the vaccinations were organized by MorseLife CEO Keith Myers and New Jersey-based developer David Mack, who is a member of various MorseLife boards and chairman of the country club foundation’s board. The vaccines were distributed at the Joseph L. Morse Health Center, which is on David S. Mack Drive. Meredith Beatrice, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in an email that the governor “has been extremely clear that vaccine should only be administered to Florida’s seniors 65 and older, frontline health care workers, and long-term care facility residents and staff.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: A study of health care and front-line workers in Augusta and across the country could reveal not only whether COVID-19 vaccines work better than antibodies from an infection but also how long those antibodies last and whether one vaccine is better than another, an investigator said. The study at Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University and four other sites around the U.S. was already collecting samples and testing thousands of health care and front-line workers who might be regularly exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19. But now as those workers get vaccinated, it puts the study in a position to begin comparing antibodies and protection, said Dr. Ravindra Kolhe, principal investigator for the study at AU and director of the Georgia Esoteric and Molecular Laboratory at MCG. The study has enrolled more than 6,000 of those workers, including about 300 in Augusta, which is looking for more workers to participate, Kolhe said. That includes people who have already tested positive, which 50% of the Augusta participants have, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Catholic Charities Hawaii announced the launch of a rent relief program for people affected by the pandemic, saying it will be conducted with state assistance. The Rent Assistance and Mediation Program administered by the social service organization will begin accepting applications next week, KITV-TV reports. The $6 million program is expected to provide assistance to renters who are at risk of eviction after experiencing reduced income, decreased work hours or unemployment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will attempt to help tenants avoid eviction by providing payments for unpaid rent and mediation services. Payments will have a cap of $1,500 per household per month. The organization expects to offer a maximum of up to two months of past due and ongoing rental assistance. Catholic Charities Hawaii estimates the available funds will cover about 2,000 applications. The program is funded by a portion of settlement payments from Honda Motor Co. to the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Office of Consumer Protection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An 87-year-old man has filed a federal lawsuit against Republican Gov. Brad Little and the state’s health department seeking to force the state to put people 65 and older at the front of the line for COVID-19 vaccinations. Richard Byrd of Rogerson said in the lawsuit filed Monday that it’s a life-and-death issue for older people who tend to die at much higher rates than younger people if they get COVID-19. Byrd contends denying him access to the vaccine immediately is a violation of his rights under the U.S. Constitution “and in reality is a ‘threat’ to my life.” The first phase of Idaho’s plan calls for vaccinating 130,000 front-line health care workers and long-term care residents. Little’s objective is to distribute the vaccine’s limited supply to preserve health care capacity and protect the most vulnerable. The first phase of vaccinations aims to fulfill both those goals by vaccinating health care workers who come in contact with COVID-19 patients and residents of long-term care facilities where outbreaks can be especially deadly. Byrd takes issue with vaccinating health care workers who he said tend to be younger and healthier and more likely to survive getting COVID-19 than older adults.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Statewide Tier 3 COVID-19 mitigations could be lifted within 10 days. Starting Jan. 15, exactly one incubation period from New Year’s Day, any region that has met requirements for a reduction of mitigations will be able to move out of the Tier 3 mitigation plan, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Wednesday. “I’m cautiously optimistic as there are some early signs indicating that some regions have made real progress and won’t reverse that progress this week or next,” he said. The entire state has been under Tier 3 restrictions since Nov. 20 in an effort to combat a potential holiday surge in cases. Under these increased restrictions, businesses are required to follow 25% capacity limits and close bars and restaurants to indoor service – a mitigation that will still be in place even when a region moves back to Tier 2. Pritzker said that despite not seeing a post-Thanksgiving surge, he is still advising Tier 3 restrictions be upheld for 14 days to ensure infection rates remain as low as possible. After Jan. 15, regions will be able to proceed past Tier 2, which could allow restaurants and bars to reopen for indoor service.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: COVID-19 vaccinations will start becoming available to residents 80 and older starting Friday as state health officials start expanding access to those shots. The next vaccination steps announced Wednesday come after vaccinations of Indiana health care workers began Dec. 16 and extended to nursing home residents and staffers last week. State health officials said they plan to start offering vaccinations in the coming weeks to those 70 and older and then those 60 and older. Those age groups make up 93% of Indiana’s more than 8,700 coronavirus-related deaths since March. “We are really concentrating on saving lives and reducing hospitalizations,” said Dr. Lindsay Weaver, the state health department’s chief medical officer. “If we vaccinate every Hoosier that’s 60 and older, that’s 1.5 million people, and so it’ll be quite some time before we get that vaccine in order to do it.” Notification postcards about scheduling vaccination appointments will be sent out to some 250,000 people ages 80 and older, State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said. Appointments will be available in all 92 counties and can be made starting Friday for those 80 and older at ourshot.in.gov or by calling the state’s 2-1-1 telephone assistance service.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds and four aides helped make a marketing video for a Utah company that was awarded no-bid contracts for work on the coronavirus pandemic, a move that has raised allegations of favoritism and improper use of public resources. Domo Inc.’s video features interviews with Reynolds, state epidemiologist Caitlin Pedati and chief operations officer Paul Trombino portraying their COVID-19 management as a success for Iowa and the software vendor. The appearances go against long-standing guidance to avoid any hint of preferential treatment in relationships with contractors. The video puts a positive spin on their response to the virus, which has caused more cases and deaths per capita in Iowa than most other states. State Hygienic Laboratory director Michael Pentella said through a University of Iowa spokesman that he was asked to participate in the video by the governor’s office and was not told how the material would be used. Pentella’s appearance – in which he calls Domo “a great planning tool” – may contradict a university policy limiting product endorsements.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council is diverting COVID-19 grant funding that had been intended for hiring a pandemic-control officer and is instead using it to lease software that ensures police officers don’t cheat on their training. In May, the council earmarked about $250,000 to hire an emergency management coordinator to manage the police department’s pandemic response, the Wichita Eagle reports. Police told the council Tuesday that they were unable to fill the position and wanted to divert $165,000 of the funds to lease for three years software to track officers’ training online, a capability the department has sought for years. It had advertised the two-year position of COVID emergency manager, but neither of two finalists would take the job, said administrative division Capt. Dan East. Mayor Brandon Whipple said the money could have been better spent to hire someone to act as a liaison with county and state government to create a more coordinated response to the pandemic. He also questioned why city staff sat on the money for nine months before proposing an alternate use for it. Moore said the software meets the grant conditions because so much of police training has had to move online.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Rebuking the Democratic governor’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, Republican lawmakers advanced bills Wednesday to limit his emergency powers and keep businesses open amid the pandemic. The measures, put on the fast track in the opening days of the 2021 session, reflect mounting GOP frustration with Gov. Andy Beshear’s use of his executive authority. His moves to put restrictions on businesses and individuals to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus have increasingly become politicized. The House State Government Committee advanced a bill to allow Kentucky businesses and schools to stay open if they comply with federal virus-related guidelines. The measure, a priority of House Republicans, cleared the committee over Democratic objections. The Senate State and Local Government Committee later approved a priority measure to limit the governor’s executive orders in times of emergency to 30 days unless extended by lawmakers. Beshear has criticized efforts to rein in his ability to respond to the pandemic, saying steps he has taken have saved lives. But Republicans have the votes to override his vetoes in both chambers. The governor has noted that some GOP-led states with more lax responses have been hit much harder by the virus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As a slow distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine rolls out across the state, hospital leaders warned Wednesday that they are running dangerously short of beds because of the influx of coronavirus patients, a situation only expected to worsen after the holidays. Gov. John Bel Edwards described state efforts to improve the pace of vaccinations, but he and public health officials noted nothing would happen quickly enough to combat Louisiana’s coronavirus outbreak except the precautionary measures they’ve been preaching for months. The Democratic governor, whose current virus restrictions expire next week, said he didn’t know whether he’d try to toughen the rules in place or renew them as is. New Orleans announced new restrictions Wednesday. “If they’re not following mitigation measures and restrictions that are in place, what makes you believe that if I impose more restrictions and mitigation measures, that they’re going to follow those? And this is the dilemma for me,” Edwards said, his voice at one point rising in frustration and emotion. “We’re either going to do the right thing, or we’re not. And if we don’t do better, we’re going to watch a lot more of our fellow Louisiana brothers and sisters die.”\n\nMaine\n\nGuilford: A local manufacturer of medical supplies that have proven critical during the coronavirus pandemic won the “Company of the Year” award from a business magazine. Inc. magazine bestowed the award on Puritan Medical Products of Guilford. The company has played a key role in diagnostics during the pandemic because it manufactures nasal swabs. Inc. wrote that Puritan “will have increased its production capacity more than 30-fold within a year.” The company recruited hundreds of employees to meet manufacturing demand, the Maine Department of Labor said Wednesday. It also opened a second facility in Pittsfield. Maine’s Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Puritan “embodies the long and proud tradition of Maine businesses stepping up during tumultuous times to meet the needs of our state.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has delayed implementing its ban on single-use plastic bags, citing economic hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban was supposed to take effect next week but now will be implemented July 9, The Baltimore Sun reports. Mayor Brandon Scott said it’s not responsible to implement the ban right now because residents who are out of work and local businesses are hurting due to the pandemic. Scott’s executive order said the ban could be pushed back further but will take effect no later than 30 days after the expiration of the governor’s coronavirus state of emergency. The ban requires city shoppers to bring their own reusable bags to stores, buy a reusable one, or pay at least 5 cents for each paper or compostable bag provided at checkout. The city had hoped to have thousands of reusable grocery bags to distribute to residents but had far fewer than expected when Scott took office last month. Local business owners complained that the ban, signed into law about a year ago, would have required restaurants and retailers to switch to paper or other bags at a time when many have closed and others are operating with limited capacity because of the pandemic.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The coronavirus field hospital in the city has expanded to 75 beds and treated 275 patients since reopening last month, officials said Wednesday. The field hospital run by UMass Memorial Health Care first treated patients last spring. All told, nearly 500 patients were treated at the field hospital in 2020, UMass Memorial President Dr. Eric Dickson said during a virtual town hall meeting, Masslive.com reports. “The DCU field hospital really saved us the first time, but it’s been even more important the second time,” Dickson said. The average age of patients is 66 years old, and the average length of stay is four days, he said. The field hospital is expected to expand to 100 beds soon, he said. “When the dust all settles, you’re going to find that this is probably going to be the most efficient, in terms of cost-efficient, field hospital in the country and one of the most utilized field hospitals in the country,” Dickson said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A state fiscal agency is projecting a much rosier budget picture than Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and her budget officials have been projecting, despite a weaker outlook for economic growth. A Wednesday report from the Senate Fiscal Agency says the impact of the recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic is unlike any Michigan has seen. Employment fell sharply in 2020, but both income and consumer spending rose, largely because of federal stimulus checks and federal supplements paid to those collecting unemployment. The result: At least for the short term, Michigan has about $1.4 billion more to work with than anticipated just a few months ago, in August. And the August estimates – which have now proved too pessimistic – represented a $2.3 billion upward revision from what officials had estimated in May. The upward revisions do not strengthen Whitmer’s case for more direct federal aid for Michigan, which she has called for repeatedly in recent weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: The state has added 1,714 confirmed coronavirus cases and 44 COVID-19 deaths, according to Thursday’s report from the Minnesota Department of Health. The positivity rate of tests in the state has begun to increase again, from below 5% of samples testing positive for the virus to 6.6% as of Dec. 29, Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said during a conference call Thursday afternoon. The positivity rate appears to be continuing to increase during the first week of 2021, she said. “We think we might be seeing a little bit of that ... bump in cases associated with the holiday gathering,” Malcolm said during the call. “We’ve averaged 2,300 new cases each day over the past seven days, and that’s up from about 1,800 a day during the week between Christmas and New Years.” Malcolm said the amount of testing over the first week of 2021 is “stable” but lower than before the holidays. She also said the state is seeing “a pretty encouraging trend in hospital beds for COVID care.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: High school students will take end-of-course exams and third graders will take mandated reading assessments this spring, state Superintendent of Education Carey Wright told lawmakers Wednesday. But she said the state should waive the requirement that students pass those tests because school routines have been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. “I do believe this needs to be a year of grace for our schools,” Wright told members of the Senate Education Committee. Under a Mississippi law that’s been in place several years, students are required to pass a reading assessment at the end of third grade. Those who don’t pass are supposed to be held back. The Legislature could tweak the law to waive the passing requirement, or Gov. Tate Reeves could do it through an executive order. After the first coronavirus cases were found in Mississippi in March, Reeves ordered all public schools to stop in-person instruction for the final weeks of the 2019-20 school year. For the current school year, each school district could choose whether to have classes in person, online or both. Most have had at least some in-person classes.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The coronavirus pandemic will get worse before it gets better, but vaccinations “will be the real gateway” to a return to normal, Dr. Anthony Fauci told a group of Missouri scientists and students Thursday. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, spoke remotely during the Washington University School of Medicine’s “Grand Rounds” forum. The live lecture allows experts to discuss clinical problems and new research. The event was accessible to the public via YouTube. Fauci said the nation is seeing up to 300,000 new coronavirus cases, up to 3,000 new deaths and record hospitalizations every day, calling the numbers “really stunning.” “We expect it to get a bit worse as we get into the middle and end weeks of January” because cases will likely surge from holiday gatherings, Fauci said. “On the other side of the coin, there is light at the end of the tunnel with regard to vaccinations,” Fauci said. He lauded the coronavirus vaccines as highly successful and very safe. The challenge, he said, “is to get the vaccine out and implemented in an efficient way so we can get the overwhelming majority of our population vaccinated within a several-month period.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County Board of Health officials approved a motion Wednesday to support maintaining local COVID-19 regulations, including a mask mandate, that would remain in place even if statewide mandates are lifted. The motion expressed the Board of Health’s support for Cascade City-County Health Department Public Health Officer Trisha Gardner’s Nov. 20 order concerning COVID-19 safety measures. Gardner’s most recent order includes regulations on closing time and maximum occupancy rates for specific types of businesses, social distancing guidelines, limits on group gatherings and face-covering requirements. Former Gov. Steve Bullock issued a statewide mask mandate in July that remains in effect. On Tuesday, new Gov. Greg Gianforte announced plans to remove the mask mandate and make other changes to current COVID-19 guidelines. According to Gardner, Wednesday’s motion before the Board of Health was in anticipation of those proposed changes by Gianforte.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of vaccines being administered in the state jumped significantly this week as it continued to inoculate health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The state said 13,732 vaccinations were administered Tuesday, more than triple the previous daily high of 4,210 on Dec. 23. Officials have said they expect the pace of vaccine distribution to speed up over the next two weeks. At least 53,418 of the 108,188 doses of the vaccine the state has received have now been administered. The state reported 1,436 new virus cases and 11 deaths Wednesday to give Nebraska 172,469 cases and 1,703 deaths since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases decreased over the past two weeks from 1,066.14 new cases per day Dec. 23 to 1,036 new cases per day Wednesday. The number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state declined Wednesday to 506 from the previous day’s 515. That number has stayed steady over the past two weeks.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State officials reported 60 coronavirus deaths Wednesday, breaking the record for the highest single-day total since the start of the pandemic. The sum surpasses Dec. 31, when the state reported 59 deaths, and brings the cumulative total to 3,295 deaths – roughly 1 out of every 1,000 Nevada residents. Public health officials also reported 1,938 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 237,393 since the start of the pandemic. Nevada has broken records for cases, deaths, positivity rates and hospitalizations on a regular basis throughout the months­long surge that began in the fall. Most cases have been in Las Vegas and surrounding Clark County, the region where most of the state’s population resides. Authorities nationally say the number of infections could be higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Chris Sununu was sworn in for a third term as governor Thursday in a small, private ceremony shaped by concerns about both the coronavirus and potential violence. Sununu originally had planned to be inaugurated outside to allow for social distancing and avoid spread of the coronavirus. “Then unfortunately, public safety concerns over the past month and unfortunately really culminating with the tragedy that we saw yesterday in Washington, D.C., brought yet another change,” he said as he kicked off “what is going to go down as the shortest inaugural ceremony probably in the state’s history.” The Statehouse ceremony, attended by a handful of legislative leaders and streamed online, came a day after a violent mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. But Sununu’s decision to cancel the larger, outdoor inaugural was prompted in large part by events in his own backyard. Opponents of restrictions imposed by Sununu during the pandemic have been protesting outside his home in Newfields, where one was arrested last week carrying two dozen rounds of ammunition, Sununu said. On social media, some participants urged one another to bring weapons to future protests.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Thursday a bill authorizing more than $14 billion in tax credits for businesses. The massive tax break program is spread over as many as seven years and is meant to give businesses struggling from COVID-19 shutdowns a boost, the Democratic governor and the bill’s sponsors say. And while it passed with bipartisan majorities in the Democrat-led Legislature, opponents on the left and the right have attacked it. Progressives say it’s too big a giveaway, and Republicans argue it didn’t do enough for small businesses hurt by outbreak restrictions. Murphy signed the bill Thursday at a chocolate shop in Hamilton. The legislation had been in the works for three years, he said. “I am immensely proud of the result, which will not only provide much needed relief for our small businesses but will also fundamentally change economic development in our state while creating thousands of high-paying jobs for our residents,” he said. The legislation is designed to give an incentive to companies to rehabilitate historic properties, clean up brownfield sites, attract grocery stores to areas without them, invest in innovative projects and more.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: In final written arguments published Thursday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration urged the state Supreme Court to reject demands that businesses be compensated for losses linked to pandemic-related public health orders. The high court is weighing whether financial compensation is due to businesses in response to the state’s public health orders that ban mass gatherings and prohibit business activities such as indoor dining. Businesses have scaled back or closed their doors as state health officials struggle to contain the coronavirus amid widespread testing and the rollout in December and January of the first vaccine doses. Attorneys representing the governor’s office and state Health Department say enforcement of public health orders derives from a long-standing principle that property rights contain an inherent limitation not to use property in a manner that endangers others. A coalition of businesses says pandemic restrictions have effectively seized private property from businesses that might otherwise have taken their own precautions against the spread of COVID-19. Their lawsuit characterizes the state’s public health emergency orders as a regulatory taking the merits compensation to businesses.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: For months, as they planned for a possible resurgence of the coronavirus, the state’s leaders talked about how a strict set of scientific metrics would guide decisions about whether to reimpose restrictions and closures that helped tame the virus in the spring. But as COVID-19 has made its expected comeback, several statistical thresholds that were once supposed to trigger shutdowns have been eased or abandoned. The latest example came this week, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed course on a plan to force schools to switch to remote learning in regions where 9% or more of coronavirus tests come back positive. Schools can now stay open in counties that cross that threshold, if they launch testing programs and can show that the virus is spreading at a lower rate among students than in the general population, Cuomo said. “My position has always been if the children are safer in this school than they are on the streets of the community, then children should be in school,” he said Monday. Unions representing teachers and school staff have objected to the change, saying the state is endangering workers by keeping schools open.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s new chief justice says he’s asked Gov. Roy Cooper to consider getting COVID-19 vaccines more quickly to local court officials to meet a state constitutional requirement that “all courts shall be open.” Speaking at Wednesday’s online installation ceremony for himself and two new justices, Chief Justice Paul Newby said that “access to justice through the courts is not a luxury – it’s a mandate.” Newby, a Republican who as an associate justice narrowly defeated then-Chief Justice Cheri Beasley in November, said he’s communicated with Cooper to “enhance the availability of the vaccine to the courthouse personnel who bravely and I even say courageously open the courts to fulfill our constitutional mandate.” Under the current schedule from the state Department of Health and Human Services, essential workers in the legal field who aren’t at least 65 or facing high-risk medical conditions could have to wait for some time before having vaccine access. Sharon Gladwell, a North Carolina Judicial Branch spokeswoman, said the vaccination request seeks to cover all court officials, including clerks, district attorneys and magistrates. Court activities in all 100 counties have been dramatically scaled back since the pandemic began.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Some Republican lawmakers, upset with Gov. Doug Burgum’s moves on the coronavirus pandemic, want to limit emergency or disaster declarations and allow the Legislature more oversight of the executive branch action. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, would limit such a declaration to 30 days. It could be extended another 30 days if the governor calls a special session of the Legislature, which could be held virtually. The legislation was inspired by a rash of executive orders filed by the Republican governor, most in response to the pandemic. “This is not an anti-Burgum bill, nor is it a COVID bill,” Myrdal said. “This was requested by people we represent.” Burgum filed some 45 executive orders in 2020, from requiring face coverings to imposing business restrictions in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus as it stressed the state’s hospital capacity. Myrdal said a one-size-fits all solution doesn’t always work. For example, she said a bar in a tiny rural North Dakota town is not the same as a bar in Fargo.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: While the world has its eyes on vaccines to stop the coronavirus’ spread, therapeutic drugs are still needed to treat hospitalized patients. One of these treatments, remdesivir, is the first and only antiviral agent of its kind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved so far for COVID-19. But research performed at the University of Cincinnati concludes the drug is being used too indiscriminately when treating patients hospitalized with the virus. The study was published late last month in the online, peer-reviewed journal Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology. The FDA approved remdesivir for emergency use authorization last May to treat COVID-19 and granted full approval for treatment in October. In the UC study, lead author Bingfang Yan, a pharmaceutical scientist, and his UC graduate students Yue Shen and William Eades found that the drug permanently stops the activity of an enzyme called CES-2, which is found in the intestine, liver and kidney and is needed for the breakdown of many medications. Yan said this breakdown increases the toxicity of many more medications such as with heart medicines and anticancer drugs.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Republican-led state House rejected an attempt by Democrats to require members to wear masks on the House floor and take other steps to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. The House and Senate each convened Tuesday for a constitutionally mandated organizational day to formally elect leaders and seat elected members. They also voted to adopt rules ahead of the new legislative session that begins Feb. 1. During discussion of the new House rules, Democratic leader Rep. Emily Virgin proposed several amendments, including a requirement that members wear masks on the floor of the House and a provision to allow remote participation in meetings and floor votes. But all those amendments were rejected on mostly party-line votes. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed an executive order requiring state employees and visitors to state buildings to wear masks and maintain social distance, but the rule technically doesn’t apply to members of the House and Senate, and many Republican legislators opted not to wear masks or socially distance Tuesday. “Why are we acting like an executive order of the governor … doesn’t apply to us?” Virgin asked. “It’s hypocrisy at its finest.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Recreational cannabis sales soared in 2020, peaking during a challenging summer of racial justice protests and coronavirus lockdowns. The result was a record year of business for the state’s marijuana purveyors, based on data from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which oversees marijuana sales, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Total marijuana sales in the state jumped from $795 million in 2019 to more than $1 billion – $1,110,520,723 – for the year that just ended. Oregonians began buying a lot more recreational cannabis in March when Gov. Kate Brown instituted a stay-at-home order and other restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales numbers for marijuana spiked about 20% in March and kept climbing in the following months. In May, Oregon marijuana sales topped $100 million in a single month for the first time. Sales then surpassed $100 million in each of the three months that followed as well, with a high of more than $106 million in July. State tax revenue from marijuana sales in 2020 likely will exceed $150 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Schools should consider a return to in-person instruction for elementary-age students, state health and education officials said Thursday, a change from previous state guidance that recommended online-only education in areas where the coronavirus is raging. Since the beginning of the academic year, state officials have urged virtual instruction in counties with a “substantial” level of community transmission – a number that rose rapidly as the virus surged this fall and winter. For the past month, all 67 of Pennsylvania’s counties have been deemed to have a substantial level of viral spread. State officials now want schools to consider bringing elementary students back to the classroom, saying that’s where they belong. The change in guidance takes effect for the third marking period, which begins in late January. “We know that educators and families recognize that students benefit from being physically in their classroom. Research has taught us that this is especially true for our youngest learners,” Noe Ortega, acting secretary of the state Department of Education, said at an online news conference Thursday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The VA Providence Healthcare System has started giving COVID-19 vaccinations for veteran patients at the Providence VA Medical Center, authorities say. John Kirby was the first non-employee veteran to receive a first dose of the vaccination Wednesday. “As vaccine supplies increase, our ultimate goal is to offer free COVID-19 vaccinations to all veterans and employees who want to be vaccinated,” system Director Lawrence Connell said in a statement. VA Providence has a dedicated team that is actively contacting patients at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 to schedule vaccination appointments, the agency said. Veterans can also call for an appointment. The VA said even after receiving a vaccination, employees and veterans should continue wearing face coverings, practicing physical distancing and washing their hands frequently.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s top jurist has again called off in-person hearings, saying he made the call because of the “ongoing increase” in COVID-19 cases across the state. “It is prudent to once again make changes to the operations of the circuit, family, probate, and master-in-equity courts for the protection of those who work within the courts, as well as those who use the courts,” state Supreme Court Chief Justice Don Beatty wrote in an order dated Wednesday and posted online. In his order, Beatty suspended any in-person hearings that were to begin statewide on or after Jan. 11. Circuit and family court judges can still hear in-person emergency matters, like bonds, bench warrants, and protective custody or domestic abuse situations. This is the second shutdown of most of the state’s in-person courtroom operations. In mid-March, Beatty ordered the shuttering of all in-person judicial business as part of a broad effort to stem the spread of the pandemic. Judges at the circuit and family court levels subsequently held thousands of online hearings via WebEx. The high court itself held its first-ever virtual oral argument in May, in a case over voting access concerns related to the pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of South Dakotans who died in the first 11 months of 2020 soared as the coronavirus pandemic became the third-leading cause of mortality. Data released Thursday by the South Dakota Department of Health shows COVID-19 caused a surge in deaths. From 2010 to 2019, the state averaged 6,931 total deaths from January through November. But in 2020, the state saw 8,804 deaths, 1,873 more than the average and 1,240 more than the same period in 2019. Even before the pandemic hit in March, causing the first two COVID-19 fatalities in the state, South Dakota was seeing higher mortality figures, a reflection of a growing and older population. But the pandemic accelerated deaths as it spread last summer. The rate of death among the state’s American Indian population – which suffers from higher rates of obesity and diabetes, two contributing factors in COVID-19 deaths – is higher than that of white South Dakotans. Across all age groups, the rate of deaths for whites is 129.5, but for Indians, the rate is 215.0. Among certain older age groups, the difference is even higher.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Volunteer State elbowed out Texas and Florida to welcome the nation’s largest net gain of new residents during the COVID-19 pandemic’s “Great American Move,” according to one weighty metric. In 2020, Tennessee topped U-Haul’s list of one-way moves for the first time, with a 12% jump in new arrivals over the prior year. Knoxville had a 23% spike in new arrivals over 2019, when Tennessee notched the 12th-most moves from U-Haul’s 22,000 truck- and trailer-sharing locations nationwide. “Places like Nashville, Murfreesboro and Clarksville are attracting tons of new residents,” U-Haul Company of Nashville President Jeff Porter said. “I’ve definitely seen an increase with the virus in just the sheer volume of rentals. We’re busier, but I don’t think it’s all just because of COVID-19. People are drawn to Tennessee.” People flocked to Middle and East Tennessee as waves of stay-at-home orders spread across the country. Knoxville, Johnson City, Cookeville, Clarksville, Cleveland, Murfreesboro and Maryville were top picks for newcomers traveling with U-Haul.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state reported its first known case of a person infected with the new variant of the coronavirus Thursday, and health officials announced they will send most of the vaccine the state receives next week to large providers who can conduct large-scale vaccinations. Texas joins a handful of states with at least one known case of the new variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. It was first identified in the United Kingdom and appears to spread more easily from person to person. But state health officials say there is no evidence it causes more severe disease and say current vaccines are expected to still be effective. The infected person was identified as a Houston-area man who is between 30 and 40 years old who has no travel history. Officials said he was in stable condition and would remain in isolation until cleared by local health officials. Statewide, Texas has seen nearly 28,000 COVID-19 deaths and reported a record 13,628 hospitalizations Wednesday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Park officials say residents are seeing an increase in annual pass prices for state parks this year. Passes for visitors living in the state increased from $75 to $100, and senior passes increased from $30 to $50, marking the first increase in 25 years, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. “Money generated by these fees will be spent on maintaining visitors’ access to the best possible outdoor facilities and experiences,” the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation said in a statement Thursday. “Over the past several years the Division has reinvested over $42 million back into the parks to add and improve recreational opportunities, infrastructure, and facilities.” The statement attributed the rising cost to an increase in operating costs and visitation numbers. State parks visitation levels fluctuated wildly last year, with admissions nosediving during the spring lockdown and then skyrocketing as safety regulations were relaxed amid the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: The chief of the Bennington Police Department says the experience of contracting COVID-19 was “scary.” Chief Paul Doucette, four other officers and a civilian employee tested positive for the coronavirus in mid-December. One of those people is in the hospital, and the five others have returned to work, including the chief, the Bennington Banner reports. “I know there are many people that think that this was someone’s political agenda. And that COVID-19 is not real. I know that there are people that don’t want to wear masks. But I’m here to tell you that COVID-19 is real,” Doucette said. He isolated for 12 days at home and said he could not shake the fever. “There were times when I felt like someone had taken a ratchet strap and just wrapped it around my chest. I just couldn’t get a deep breath, and it was very scary for me,” Doucette said, noting that his wife and son also tested positive despite following recommended precautions. Officials think the virus was spread in the police department when officers shared a computer for a remote hearing, although employees had followed protocols of wearing masks, washing hands and staying 6 feet apart.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is urging hospital systems to move quickly to administer coronavirus vaccines, saying the state will now implement a “use it or lose it” policy designed to speed up distribution of the shots. “No one wants to see any supply sitting unused,” Northam said at a news conference Wednesday, saying health systems that don’t move fast enough will receive fewer doses in future distribution rounds. With frustration rising over the sluggish rollout of the vaccine, Northam is one of many state leaders and other politicians around the U.S. who are turning up the pressure to get shots in arms more quickly. The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans for the pace of vaccinations. “There’s no question we need to speed the process up,” Northam said. He also named Dr. Danny Avula responsible for coordinating the state’s vaccination drive and announced details for the first time about who will be included in the state’s second and third tier of vaccine priorities. Police, grocery workers and teachers, along with residents over age 75, are in the next eligible group, 1B, and 1C includes essential workers in housing construction, food service, and transportation and logistics.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Everyone over 70 years old and anyone over 50 who lives in a multigenerational household will be prioritized next for COVID-19 vaccines, state health officials said Wednesday. Newly installed Health Secretary Dr. Umair Shah told an online media briefing that the state remains in the first phase of vaccination distribution, with high-risk health care workers, first responders and residents of long-term care facilities first in line. But he said within two or three weeks the state should be able to move to Phase B1, which will focus on all residents over 70 and those over 50 who live in multigenerational households. That will be followed sometime next month by Phase B2, with vaccinations for high-risk critical workers over 50 who work in certain congregate settings like schools, jails, grocery stores and farms. Officials hope to get to those over 16 years old who have multiple underlying conditions in March. High-risk critical workers younger than 50 and those who live and work in other congregate settings – including inmates, homeless people staying in shelters and residents of group homes – would be eligible in April.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University has extended a ban on fans attending home athletic events through Jan. 24 due to a recent spike in coronavirus cases in the state. The university said Wednesday that only families and guests of the players and coaching staffs along with essential game personnel will be admitted to the events on the Morgantown campus. “We continue to be disappointed not to allow fans at our home indoor events, but quite frankly, COVID-19 is not yet under control,” athletic director Shane Lyons said in a statement.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Assembly on Thursday passed a doomed COVID-19 response bill that Senate Republicans and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers oppose, and there’s no sign of an agreement on a plan to combat the virus that has killed more than 5,000 people in the state. Evers and Assembly Democrats have their own proposals that Republicans do not support. The Legislature hasn’t passed anything related to the pandemic since April, and recent talks between Evers and Republican leaders failed to result in a deal. The Assembly voted 56-34 to pass the bill Thursday, with all Republicans in support and Democrats against. Republicans voted down the Democratic proposal offered as an amendment, which included accepting the federal Medicaid expansion, something the GOP has long opposed. The measure contains many provisions Democrats oppose, including waiving liability for COVID-19 claims for businesses, making it more difficult for schools to remain all virtual, and giving the Legislature control over future federal money for pandemic response.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Leaders of several tribal nations said a Trump administration decision to permit five oil companies drilling rights in Wyoming will destroy cultural resources, compromise air and water quality, and violate existing treaty rights, Native American tribal leaders say. The Oglala Sioux Tribe said U.S. regulators failed to uphold federal law and fairly consult local tribes when they made their decision, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The tribe also said the environmental reviews that occurred in conjunction with the project were “deficient,” according to their recent protests. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management issued an order Dec. 23 that will allow for year-round drilling on federal leases in Converse County. The area carries significant meaning for over a dozen tribes with history in the southern Powder River Basin, the newspaper reports. Cultural resources, sacred sites and rivers within the area are important for many local tribes. The rivers within the approved project area serve as an important water source for the Oglala Sioux Tribe and other tribes in the Sioux Nation. Multiple treaties grant the tribes rights to the land.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/02/22/preaching-vaccines-bonnet-scheme-water-news-around-states/115492470/", "title": "Preaching vaccines, bonnet scheme: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state health officer said Friday that he is cautiously optimistic about improving COVID-19 numbers but urged people to maintain precautions such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds. “This is the most optimistic we’ve been, I think, maybe since this all began,” Dr. Scott Harris said. Three major barometers of the pandemic’s severity – hospitalizations, daily new cases and coronavirus test percent positivity – have fallen to levels the state last saw in fall or summer. “We are not out of the woods, but we see how to get out of the woods. Please don’t stop doing the things that you are doing. This is not the time to ease up wearing your mask. It’s not the time to go be in large groups of people,” Harris said. The number of COVID-19 patients in Alabama hospitals Friday dipped below 1,000 for the first time since October. Harris said there may be increased immunity both from vaccinations and from temporary natural immunity in people who have been exposed to the virus. The end of the holiday season and related large gatherings likely also plays a part, he said. “Frankly, it has been a breath of fresh air for all of us in health care. This has been a tremendous burden for all of us,” said Dr. Sarah Nafziger, vice president for clinical services at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said his administration will no longer respond to or participate in hearings led by state Sen. Lora Reinbold, telling the fellow Republican in a withering letter that she has used her position to “misrepresent” the state’s COVID-19 response and that her demands for information have gone beyond checks and balances and are “not based in fact.” “It is lamentable that the good citizens of Eagle River and Chugiak are deprived of meaningful representation by the actions of the person holding the office of Senator,” Dunleavy wrote in the letter dated Thursday. “I will not continue to subject the public resources of the State of Alaska to the mockery of a charade, disguised as public purpose.” Reinbold has criticized the governor for issuing pandemic-related disaster declarations while the Legislature was not in session and taken aim at health restrictions imposed by local governments, airlines and the Legislature, including mask requirements. On social media, Reinbold has accused the Dunleavy administration of being “wild” about “these experimental” COVID-19 vaccines, “bragging over 100,000 have gotten them in Alaska,” and characterized the administration as seeking disaster declarations to get mass vaccination clinics. Health officials say the vaccines are safe and effective, and no steps were skipped during the clinical trials.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state on Friday announced it would provide $100 million of federal funding to counties for coronavirus testing and related work. The state Department of Health Services said the $100 million initial allocation is being provided for staffing, laboratory testing “and other activities critical to combating COVID-19.” The announcement followed Pima County officials’ recent declaration that they might have to suspend testing as of Monday because of a lack of funding. Arizona received $418.9 million in January from the federal government for virus testing and related work and must submit a budget by mid-March to detail how it will spend the money, the department said. In addition to allocations to counties, the state will use some of the money for statewide testing programs, including testing done by Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, the department said. Of the $100 million to counties, $60.6 million is being sent to Maricopa County and $14.4 million to Pima County, which include most of metro Phoenix and most of the Tucson area, respectively.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of coronavirus cases in the state rose by more than 500 on Saturday, and the death toll increased by 12, the Department of Health said, as the averages of both numbers continued to decline. According to the department, 5,348 Arkansans have died of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The number of people hospitalized in the state with the virus fell by 25 to 605. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases in Arkansas has decreased by nearly 75%, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Gov. Asa Hutchinson planned to visit vaccination clinics over the weekend, a senior citizen’s center in Lavaca and a pharmacy in Bryant, after urging vaccine providers on Friday to schedule extra weekend hours to make up for a slowdown because of last week’s snowstorms. “It is critical to get our vaccines out as quickly as possible, and we have to catch up on the missed appointments and slow vaccine distribution over the last week,” he said in a statement. Hutchinson has said the state needs to vaccinate more people age 70 and older before expanding the vaccine program to others.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state plans to set aside 10% of first vaccine doses for educators, school staff and child care providers starting in March to help get children back in classrooms, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday. The move is aimed at jump-starting in-person learning after nearly a year of distance learning for most of California’s 6 million K-12 students. The announcement came a day after legislative leaders announced a $6.5 billion proposal aimed at reopening schools this spring. Newsom said that’s not fast enough and suggested he could veto it. “I can’t support something that’s going to delay the safe reopening of schools for our youngest kids,” he said. Lawmakers didn’t appear deterred by Newsom’s comments and still planned to take up the school legislation Monday, said Nannette Miranda, a spokeswoman for Assemblyman Phil Ting, a Democrat who heads the chamber’s budget committee. California on Friday also announced a more rapid return to athletic playing fields for youth sports, while Newsom recently said more counties will soon be able to allow various businesses to reopen and expand customer volume. But school districts in many areas of the state such as San Francisco and the city of Los Angeles remain closed to in-person learning.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Out-of-work residents are able to reopen and file new claims after a program distributing pandemic unemployment assistance ended in December, officials said. Colorado Department of Labor and Employment Director Joe Barela said residents could begin filing Saturday, marking the second launch of federal extended jobless benefits this year, Colorado Public Radio reports. The first phase began in February for people who still had money remaining on their account in December, when federal programs funded through the coronavirus relief bill ended. “They will be able to begin certifying their weeks or the payments filing new claims and reopening if they were moving into programs,” Barela said. “That’s really exciting.” The state does not know exactly how many people qualified over the weekend but said about 289,000 were contacted with information on how to sign up for the benefits. The state was delayed in revamping the benefits because it upgraded its system and needed to reprogram the benefit options. Phil Spesshardt, benefits services manager with the department, said the delay was caused in part by Congress, which waited until the program ended to take any action and then waited for additional information from the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is partnering with a Hartford-based nonprofit organization that advocates for health equity across the state to reach out to more than 10,000 minority residents over the next three months and dispel myths about the COVID-19 vaccine. The arrangement announced Friday is part of the state’s efforts to reach out to Black and Latino communities that have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus and may be reticent to get vaccinated. “We want to ensure that communities at highest risk have equitable access to the vaccines that will protect them and allow everyone to return to a sense of normalcy,” Dr. Deidre Gifford, the state’s acting public health commissioner, said in a statement. “The team at Health Equity Solutions will strengthen and enhance our outreach efforts in the Black and Latino communities.” The organization plans to focus on faith- and education-based networks to reach the widest audience possible with information about the vaccine. There will be a particular focus on issues concerning distrust of the medical system within the state’s Black community. Health Equity Solutions already hosted webinars that have reached more than 3,000 people, and more than 20 events have been scheduled, with more being planned.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: With coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continuing to plummet, Gov. John Carney on Friday announced a loosening of the restrictions for indoor gatherings at businesses and other indoor spaces. The new rules allow for a maximum of 25 people or 50% of the stated fire occupancy restrictions, whichever is lower, though organizers may submit a plan to the Division of Public Health to host larger events up to 150 people. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 50 people or up to 250 with an approved plan from DPH. “I don’t think anything else is imminent after today’s announcement,” said Jonathan Starkey, a spokesman for Carney. “We are continuing to see positive trends in the numbers – hospitalizations, percent positive and cases. That’s good news. We are also still moving down from the winter peaks, which is why the governor and the public health team are taking a cautious approach as we see sustained decreases in spread. We’ll continue to follow the numbers and ask everyone to do their part.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Rev. Wallace Charles Smith started his virtual Valentine’s Day sermon at Shiloh Baptist Church by talking about love and vaccinations. “When you get a vaccination, you are saying to everyone around you that you love them enough that you don’t want any hurt, harm or danger to befall them,” he said. “In the spirit of love, keep at it until you get your vaccination. That’s the only thing that’s going to erase this terrible scourge.” Health officials in the nation’s capital are hoping Smith and other Black religious leaders will serve as community influencers to overcome what officials say is a persistent vaccine reluctance in the Black community. Smith and several other local ministers recently received their first vaccine shots. Black residents make up a little under half of Washington’s population but constitute nearly three-fourths of the city’s COVID-19 deaths. D.C. is now offering vaccinations to residents over age 65, but numbers show seniors in the poorest and blackest parts of Washington are lagging behind. Officials partially blame historic distrust of the medical establishment, especially among Black seniors, who vividly remember medical exploitation horrors such as the Tuskegee syphilis study. The D.C. government is giving priority for vaccine registration to predominantly Black ZIP codes and running public information campaigns. “There’s distrust in our community. We can’t ignore that,” said the Rev. James Coleman of All Nations Baptist, who was vaccinated along with Smith. “The church, and particularly the Black church, is essential. … That’s what pastors do.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Two women who dressed up to make themselves appear older to get COVID-19 vaccinations were turned away and issued trespass warnings, officials said. Dr. Raul Pino, state health officer in Orange County, said the women disguised themselves Wednesday with bonnets, gloves and glasses. Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Michelle Guido told the Orlando Sentinel the women altered their birth years on their vaccination registrations to bypass the state system, which prioritizes people 65 and older. It appeared the women had gotten the first shot, but it was unclear where. “Their names matched their registration but not their dates of birth,” she told the newspaper. The women were 35 and 45 years old, officials said in a news release. Health Department officials asked deputies to issue trespass warnings. In a video provided by the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, a deputy could be heard saying, “You’ve stolen a vaccine from somebody that needs it more than you.” Guido said the warning means the women can’t return to the convention center for any reason – including a vaccine, coronavirus test, convention or show. If they do return, they could face arrest.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is renewing its request to again be exempted from federal requirements to administer standardized tests. State Superintendent Richard Woods announced Thursday that he and Gov. Brian Kemp had resubmitted a waiver request to the U.S. Department of Education. Former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said in September that she would deny waiver requests for the 2020-2021 school year, after granting them last year. Woods argues that tests are useless because they’re supposed to measure instruction in a regular learning environment. “This unprecedented school year has been anything but traditional, and experts know tests cannot be completely redesigned and revamped overnight,” Woods said in a statement Thursday. Most Georgia school districts have been offering in-person instruction for most of the year, but a substantial portion of students have chosen to learn remotely from home. A handful of districts have offered no in-person instruction. It’s unclear how the Biden administration will receive renewed waiver requests, which are being submitted by a number of states. Miguel Cardona, Biden’s nominee for education secretary, has yet to get a confirmation vote in the U.S. Senate. Woods said it will be hard for all students to take tests in-person, as testing security rules required.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: More than 200 people gathered on Kauai last week to show support for reopening tourism on the island amid the pandemic. The group outside Vidinha Stadium on Wednesday primarily consisted of business owners, The Garden Island reports. Attendees said they wanted to express concerns to county and state officials about the continued economic impact of restrictions on tourism. Kauai requires visitors to take part in the Safe Travels Hawaii pre-travel testing program. Those who stay at a county-approved resort can bypass the state’s mandated 10-day quarantine with a negative coronavirus test taken after at least three days on the island. Cynthia Keener shared the struggles she and her husband have experienced under travel restrictions while trying to operate their business, Ohana Fishing Charters. “Just like many in the business community, we had a thriving growing business before COVID,” she said. “As a result of these policies, we have almost lost 100% of our revenue and acquired mountains of debt from government loans just to hang on.” Keener said there is “no transparency” from the Kauai County Council or the office of Mayor Derek Kawakami about future plans. “Keep me alive; (don’t) kill my dream. Don’t kill that,” said David Stewart, who owns a landscaping business he hopes to pass on to his children..\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill to outlaw demonstrating at a person’s residence headed to the full state House on Friday, after a series of demonstrations at the homes of officials and police officers spurred by frustration with restrictions on gatherings or mask-wearing mandates to slow coronavirus infections and deaths. The House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee voted 11-4 to approve the bill backers say is needed to prevent mobs from trying to intimidate and even terrorize families in their homes. Backers say allowing the demonstrations will tear the social fabric by causing people to avoid public service or join police agencies. “When we turn the volume up this high on political discourse, we crowd out anybody not willing to be equally as confrontational, angry, loud or violent,” Republican Rep. Greg Chaney said. He is a co-sponsor of the legislation with Rep. Brooke Green, a Democrat from Boise. In the past year, “a new playbook has been written, and several groups of individuals across the spectrum used it to terrify families in their homes,” Green said. The public hearing drew so many people wanting to testify that comments were taken Wednesday and Friday. After Wednesday’s raucous hearing, torch- and pitchfork-wielding protesters gathered outside Chaney’s house that evening.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s top doctor has vowed wide availability of the COVID-19 vaccine to residents but said it’ll take months for supply to meet demand. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike’s comments in a weekend Chicago Tribune opinion piece come amid complaints of shortages and difficulties in obtaining appointments. A recent blast of winter weather also delayed shipments, leading to canceled appointments. “It will be months before our supply comfortably outpaces demand – an obstacle we always expected, and the very reason we have devoted so much time and thought to the phases of prioritization,” Ezike wrote. “Everyone deserves their turn to get the vaccine, and it’s my promise to Illinois that we will get there – as efficiently, quickly and equitably as we can.” Currently, health care workers, residents 65 and older, and essential workers are eligible in Illinois. State officials announced an expansion starting later this month to include people with underlying health conditions, but Chicago and other areas are delaying, citing a vaccine shortage. More than 2.1 million doses have been administered in Illinois, according to state officials. Overall, Illinois has reported more than 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 20,000 deaths.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Legislators are supporting proposals that would permanently allow members of local government boards to participate virtually in public meetings. Similar bills approved by the state House and Senate would permit boards to adopt policies allowing members to vote virtually as long as they can be seen and heard. State and local government boards have generally been allowed to hold all-virtual meetings since Gov. Eric Holcomb issued an exemption to the current state law requiring in-person meetings last spring as part of COVID-19 public health measures. The proposals would require that at least half of board members attend public meetings in person and that members participate virtually in no more than half of the meetings except for limited reasons such as illness or military service. The House-passed version would require meetings with virtual participation to also allow the public to observe the meeting online starting in July, while the Senate version would delay that requirement until January 2023.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Seventy-six of the state’s 82 critical-access hospitals ended the last fiscal year with negative operating margins, an IowaWatch analysis of their most recently reported financial data shows. Only six critical-access hospitals – facilities with 25 or fewer beds and designated by Congress as essential for rural communities – brought in more revenue from patient care than what they spent on providing that care, the data shows. “If you were vulnerable before this, you’re more vulnerable now,” said Kirk Norris, the Iowa Hospital Association’s president and CEO. The new data includes the distribution of federal stimulus money to stem revenue losses after the onset of COVID-19. Stimulus money helped 37 of the 50 hospitals ending their fiscal year in June 2020 to report net income, IowaWatch’s analysis showed. But COVID-19 clearly disrupted hospitals forced to switch from offering their main revenue producer – outpatient services – to focusing on patients with COVID-19 last spring. The Iowa Hospital Association reported last year that 17 hospitals already were at financial risk more than a year before COVID-19 hit the state. The association reported in December that Iowa hospitals, overall, lost an estimated $433 million in March through October because of COVID-19.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Gov. Laura Kelly has announced plans to fix issues that have led the state to underreport the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19. Kansas’ vaccination rate consistently ranks among the lowest in the country, and Kelly has blamed technical problems with the tracking system, called KSWebIZ. As of Friday, 11.1% of the state’s population, or 456,093 people, had received at least the first of two required doses, state health data showed. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed the state had administered only 72% of 581,975 doses received, up from 60.2% a week ago. The state’s data showed that 78% of 581,975 doses had been administered. Dr. Lee Norman, the head of the state health department, said last week that 100,000 doses administered had not been registered as such because of system glitches. Kelly said in a statement released Thursday evening that the state is working on addressing underlying data transfer problems with KSWebIZ. In the meantime, providers are required starting Monday to report daily on the number of doses received, administered, in inventory and transferred.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state is relaxing coronavirus-related restrictions at some of its long-term care facilities. Indoor visitation will resume at non-Medicare-certified facilities that have been through the COVID-19 vaccination process, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Group activities, communal dining and visitations among vaccinated residents will resume, he said. Included in the updated protocols are assisted living facilities, personal care homes, intermediate care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities and independent living centers, Beshear said. “It’s been a long journey, and it’s exciting to be able to relax some restrictions,” said state Cabinet for Health and Family Services inspector general Adam Mather. People will be expected to schedule their visits with the facility, and up to two visitors from the same household can visit a resident at one time, state officials said. Visitors will need to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the visit. The new protocols took effect Saturday. Beshear said Friday that more than 550,000 Kentuckians had received at least one dose of the two-dose COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state is asking President Joe Biden’s administration to establish one of its planned federal COVID-19 vaccine sites at the New Orleans convention center, but state officials would like that site to come with extra doses of the shots rather than a reshuffling of current supply. Negotiations continue with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Key questions remain unanswered about how such a site could be financed and whether that would help Louisiana get new doses of the vaccine, said Dr. Joe Kanter, the top public health adviser to Gov. John Bel Edwards. Kanter said New Orleans is prepared to staff the vaccination site itself, working with LCMC Health, which operates six hospitals and urgent care centers in the region. But Kanter said the city “would like some financial reimbursement on it. And the doses would be important to all of us. So those are the two biggest things.” The Biden administration said it intends to open 100 federal vaccination sites by the end of the month in an effort to speed the immunizations. But governors and health officials around the country are mixed on the offer because they don’t necessarily need more places to administer the vaccine – just more doses overall.\n\nMaine\n\nManchester: Pediatricians are reminding parents to get their children caught up on routine immunizations, which many students have missed during the coronavirus pandemic. The Maine Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics said Thursday that a Blue Cross Blue Shield analysis found a 26% drop in vaccine doses last year. The analysis also found 40% of parents surveyed said their children missed shots because of the pandemic. The chapter called on parents to get in touch with their pediatricians to schedule visits to keep their children up to date. Data indicates adolescents in Maine are behind on vaccines for certain cancers, pertussis and meningitis, the organization said in a statement. The chapter said parents have delayed or skipped vaccination appointments because of fear of catching the coronavirus, economic hardship, and greater demands on their time and attention. Immunizations are required to attend school in Maine, and a new law goes into effect this year that takes away philosophical and religious exemptions.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate voted Friday to expand a tax credit for low-income workers to include immigrants, including those living in the country illegally, who work and pay taxes in the state in a measure that adds to a broader pandemic relief initiative already enacted last week. The measure, now in the hands of the House of Delegates, is a follow-up to more than $1 billion in relief that passed with bipartisan support this month and was signed into law last Monday by Gov. Larry Hogan. The House had added the provisions but withdrew them over the Republican governor’s opposition. Democrats, who control the General Assembly, are moving forward now in separate legislation. The measure, which extends the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income residents to people who use individual taxpayer individual numbers rather than Social Security numbers, was approved 32-15, largely along party lines. Sen. Justin Ready, R-Carroll County, noted that the measure would cost about $60 million in each of the next three years. But supporters say the workers covered under the measure pay more than $100 million in taxes annually without being eligible for most tax credits or public assistance programs.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The medical director of the city agency coordinating Boston’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has been working remotely from Hawaii for several months, and even though she has permission to do so, some critics say it may hinder her effectiveness. Dr. Jennifer Lo relocated with her family in November with approval from Rita Nieves, the Boston Public Health Commission’s executive director, NBC10 Boston reports. Since then, the city has had to deal with a post-holiday surge in cases and the vaccine rollout. As medical director, Lo’s job is to advise the commission on medical policy issues. Lo, in an email to the station, said she and her husband made “the difficult decision” to temporarily relocate to Hawaii for personal reasons, including to take care of two sets of aging parents. She said plans on returning to Massachusetts this summer. She offered to resign, but the commission “determined I would be able to effectively continue my work remotely while maintaining the same level of responsibilities required in this role,” she wrote. Nieves said she consulted with other city leaders before approving Lo’s work arrangement. She said it took about a year to fill the position the last time it opened, and she didn’t want to risk being without a medical director during an emergency.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A $2.5 million federal grant will be used to address health care staffing shortages in the state’s rural communities. Michigan’s Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity said the grant will support the addition of more than 430 new health care workers over the next four years. The agency will lead MiREACH, a network of employer-led collaboratives, to identify targeted health care occupations based on employer demand and feedback. The grant program aims to help individuals gain the skills necessary to provide needed services, fill vacancies and allow employers to find skilled workers more readily. The coronavirus pandemic has increased the need for health care workers, particularly in rural areas, according to the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Public school enrollment in the state dropped by about 17,000 students as families turned to home schooling, private schools and delaying entry into kindergarten amid the coronavirus pandemic, education officials announced Friday. The enrollment figures from the Minnesota Department of Education represented a 2% drop from the previous year. The state allocates school funding based on enrollment, and districts stand to lose about $10,164 for every student they failed to keep. Gov. Tim Walz’s proposed education budget includes $25 million in one-time money to compensate. “COVID-19 has already robbed our students of so many milestones that make school memorable,” Education Commissioner Mary Cathryn Ricker said in a statement. “Now, our schools are potentially facing a huge loss in funding and resources, which will mean schools faced with eliminating learning opportunities and experiences for our students, especially students who need them most.” The “vast majority” of the decline in public school enrollment was among white students, the department said. It said the change was driven mostly by younger students, with public kindergarten enrollment dropping 9% even as private kindergarten enrollment rose 12.4%. And 49.5% more students were home-schooled.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: Neither rain, snow nor waterless pipes could prevent Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center from helping patients in need, as employees carried buckets of water drawn from a well to clean and sanitize during the city’s water crisis last week. The hospital’s clinics closed ahead of the winter weather and remained closed when the water shortage hit. “Water is for sure vital to the operation of the hospital,” hospital CEO?Charla Rowley said, noting that cleaning and sanitation is impossible without it and that many operations in the hospital could not function either. She said she was proud of the hard work of the maintenance staff for keeping the hospital operating during the storm and outage, noting that the dietary department also played a huge role in the hospital’s operations. With the closure of clinics and the cancellation of elective surgeries, Rowley said the hospital has taken a half-million-dollar hit a day, which could come back with some serious repercussions in the long run. “We have had tornadoes, hurricanes, COVID and now this freeze,”?she said. Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kevin Richardson said the lack of water could not stop the hospital from serving the community. “Mother Nature’s challenges were not enough to dampen the grit of our front-line providers,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s NAACP chapter filed federal civil rights complaints against the state over the lack of COVID-19 vaccinations for prisoners. No Missouri prisoners had been inoculated, a state corrections department spokeswoman told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday. The St. Louis NAACP filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division over the lack of vaccinations, the chapter president said in a Thursday news release. “While we are well aware that the CDC makes recommendations with respect to who should be offered COVID-19 vaccine first, and each state has its own plan for deciding who will be vaccinated first and how they can receive vaccines; that ‘Does Not’ exempt the State from long-standing civil rights nondiscrimination requirements when utilizing Federal assistance,” St. Louis NAACP President Adolphus Pruitt said in a statement, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said about 8,000 Missouri inmates, or roughly a third of the total imprisoned population, now qualify for the vaccine. Of those, 6,000 said they would like to be vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County residents ages 16-69 with underlying health conditions are now eligible to sign up for COVID-19 vaccination appointments. People eligible for the vaccine in Phase 1B include people 70 and older, people 16-69 with qualifying health conditions, and Native Americans and other people of color. Qualifying health conditions in Phase 1B include cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Down syndrome, heart conditions, immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, severe obesity, sickle cell disease, diabetes and other conditions on a case-by-case basis determined by medical providers. Proof of medical conditions is not required to make an appointment. As of Friday, 12,749 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in Cascade County, and 3,514 residents had been fully immunized, meaning they had received both doses. For more information and to schedule a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, visit www.benefis.org/COVIDvaccine.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts on Friday defended the state’s decision to prioritize the elderly for vaccination shots over people with underlying health conditions, noting that most residents who have died so far were at least 65 years old. Ricketts’ administration amended its COVID-19 vaccination plan last week. People who have cancer, diabetes and other major health problems were previously eligible in the current phase of the state’s vaccination plan, but they were removed from their spot on the list so health officials could focus on older residents. Essential workers such as first responders, teachers and corrections employees also qualify, but state officials have ordered local public health districts and pharmacies to give at least 90% of their available doses to senior citizens. Approximately 82% of the 2,043 people who have died from the coronavirus in Nebraska were at least 65 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal. Age isn’t the only risk factor, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that people with ailments such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart disease or obesity are at greater risk of getting severely ill. Ricketts said giving too many of the state’s limited doses to people besides seniors is a “less efficient” approach.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus in the Legislature have changed the nature of lobbying and raised new questions about how to regulate it. Public access to the legislative building has been restricted since lawmakers reconvened Feb. 1, leaving the normally bustling corridors empty aside from staff and reporters. But that hasn’t stopped advocates from pursuing their usual work, lobbying for and against the hundreds of bills that have already been introduced. Unlike other states, Nevada’s Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act only requires lobbyists to register if they lobby in person. With the building closed, no lobbyists have registered since lawmakers reconvened three weeks ago. Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson and Assemblywoman Brittney Miller introduced a bill last week that would require lobbyists to register whether they advocate on behalf of their clients in person or remotely. Many lobbyists say they support the bill. But Melissa Clement of Nevada Right to Life and three other lobbyists for conservative groups and causes filed a lawsuit Wednesday claiming the closure of the legislative building violates their First Amendment right to petition government.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A federal judge heard arguments Friday on whether medically vulnerable lawmakers should be given remote access to state House sessions this week or whether separate entrances for Democrats and Republicans and other safety measures would suffice. Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Republican House Speaker Sherm Packard last week, arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions. It also forces them to choose between risking their lives and not performing their duties as elected officials, attorney Paul Twomey said at a hearing Friday. If all 28 lawmakers with medical disabilities stayed home, nearly 100,000 residents across the state would lose representation, he said. Republican House leaders have said fully remote sessions are not possible because no rules exist to allow them, while blocking attempts to create such rules. But the Senate has been meeting remotely without an explicit rule, and the House has been holding “hybrid” committee hearings that allow for remote participation. Judge Landya McCafferty gave the parties more time to provide more background material.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: As debate mounts over how to reopen schools during the pandemic, some parents are taking to federal court, arguing that their children’s struggles with remote learning represent a violation of constitutional rights. The South Orange and Maplewood district joined the legal parade late last month, with parents asking a judge to end nearly a year of online-only instruction for its 7,000 students. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Newark stood out not only for its wrenching stories of students slipping behind as they study in isolation but also for the full-scale reversal it seeks: Parents asked the court to force the K-12 district for both towns, known locally as SOMA, to resume full-day classes, five days a week. The “arbitrary” closures during the pandemic violate students’ constitutional rights and have wreaked havoc on their psyches and academic performance, the lawsuit says. Two parents said their 7-year-old has struggled with digital lessons and “often says he is ‘stupid’ and ‘the dumbest kid in the class.’ ” But two Rutgers University law professors questioned whether the heartbreaking anecdotes will be enough to convince the courts that constitutional violations had occurred or that a judge should overrule local officials.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are sprinting amid the pandemic to come up with a framework for regulating and taxing recreational marijuana after voters ousted key opponents of pot legalization in 2020 elections. Four Democrat-backed proposals with a social-justice bent are competing for traction at the Legislature, along with a Republican proposal aimed at stamping out the illicit pot market. The Legislature has until March 20 to send a cannabis bill to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, an enthusiastic backer of marijuana as a tool of economic development and fiscal security for the state. The primary election in 2020 unseated several staunch legalization opponents, including the former top-ranked Senate Democrat. The New Mexico Constitution doesn’t allow for ballot initiatives, leaving cannabis legalization to the legislative process. A House panel last Monday advanced a bill that places an emphasis on economic and social issues by subsidizing medical marijuana for poor patients, underwriting grants for communities affected by drug criminalization, and expunging convictions for cannabis use and possession. Senate committees are poised to vet at least three separate proposals. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth, an arbitration attorney by trade, said he’s eager to bring a compromise bill to the floor.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s restaurants will be allowed to serve more customers indoors starting this Friday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced late last week that New York City indoor dining will be able to expand from 25% capacity to 35% capacity – in line with New Jersey’s current limit. His announcement came as the state sees a continued drop in COVID-19 hospitalizations. The rate of New Yorkers testing positive for the coronavirus has fallen to the lowest mark since before Thanksgiving, state officials said Saturday. Cuomo said the state’s seven-day rolling average positivity rate had fallen 43 straight days, hitting 3.5% on Friday. The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, meanwhile, fell below 6,000 for the first time since Dec. 14. The state said 97 New Yorkers died of the coronavirus Friday, bringing the state’s official death total to 37,776. Cuomo asked New Yorkers to remain patient with vaccinations, as the state’s distribution network and population of eligible recipients – 10 million – continues to far exceed supply coming from the federal government. The state now has the resources to vaccinate up to 100,000 New Yorkers every day, he said, but not nearly enough vaccines to do so.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: President Joe Biden’s administration told the state Friday afternoon that it will see further delays in shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses. North Carolina public health officials said they now expect more deliveries of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to resume at the start of the week. The state health department also warned that some providers may choose not to go forward with plans to vaccinate teachers and school staff once eligibility opens up to that group Wednesday. Severe winter weather has fueled delays across the country, causing tens of thousands of North Carolinians scheduled to be vaccinated last week to have their appointments pushed back. “What we are being informed by Operation Warp Speed is that shipments are being held by the producers and distributors until they are sure shipments won’t be delayed,” the department said in a statement. “To our knowledge, operations are being planned to help ensure spoilage isn’t an issue.” The delay could affect North Carolina’s transition to its third phase of vaccine distribution, which expands eligibility Wednesday to child care workers, pre-K-12 educators and school staff. A far more expansive group of “front-line essential workers” ranging from mail carriers to elected officials is scheduled to become eligible starting March 10.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Visitation to the state’s No. 1 tourist attraction fell last year, but it wasn’t all because of the coronavirus pandemic. Theodore Roosevelt National Park saw about 558,000 visitors in 2020, the fewest since 2013. Visitation fell 20% from 2019, but some months last year spiked substantially over the previous year – including December, which saw a 173% jump. Visitation is measured in an algorithm counting people who stop in visitor centers combined with an average of people in vehicles. Park Superintendent Wendy Ross said she sees “so many variables, especially this past year.” “I don’t put much stock in the fact that we were down 20%; in fact, I’m a little surprised we weren’t down more, but it was a very busy year. It felt like a ‘normal’ year,” Ross said. Annual visitation averaged about 700,000 people from 2015 to 2019. The emerging pandemic and reduced oil and gas activity likely brought more people to the park in February, March and April, according to Ross. Visitation in February and March leapt 253% and 106%, respectively, over the same months in 2019, The Bismarck Tribune reports.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legislative testimony made Wednesday in support of a GOP-backed effort to limit public health orders made by the governor was removed from YouTube after the service deemed it contained COVID-19 misinformation. The Google-owned platform said it removed content that was uploaded last week to the Ohio Advocates for Medical Freedom channel for violating the company’s terms of services. The video showed Thomas Renz, an attorney for Ohio Stands Up, a citizen group, making the opening testimony during a House committee hearing on a bill that would allow lawmakers to vote down public health orders during the pandemic. In the more than 30-minute testimony, Renz made a number of debunked or baseless claims, including that no Ohioans under the age of 19 have died from COVID-19 – a claim that has been debunked by state data. “We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” said Ivy Choi, a spokesperson for Google. “We removed this video in accordance with our COVID-19 misinformation policy, which prohibits content that claims a certain age group cannot transmit the virus.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 681,000 Oklahomans have now received COVID-19 vaccine shots, including more than 204,000 who have received both required doses, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The state ranked 12th in the nation Saturday with 14.3% of the population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control, and the state health department scheduled vaccination clinics over the weekend to replace those canceled because of a winter storm. There have been a reported 418,318 total coronavirus cases and 4,155 deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began, increases of 973 cases and 23 deaths since Friday, according to the health department. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state has fallen below 1,000 in the past two weeks, dropping from 2,215.7 per day to 932.4, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of deaths declined from 34.1 per day to 24.7 during the same period.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Despite historic winter weather across the country causing shipment delays and forcing mass vaccination sites to reschedule appointments, health officials said Friday that the state’s vaccination timeline remains on schedule. While more than 10,000 vaccine appointments were canceled earlier this month, beginning Monday people 70 and older will be eligible to receive doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, and people 65 and older will be eligible March 1. “I want to reassure every Oregon senior – nothing that’s happened in the past week will slow down our schedule,” Pat Allen, the director of the Oregon Health Authority, said during a news conference Friday. “It seems like every season brings a new test on top of the pandemic. Oregon’s vaccination clinics were no exception.” However, health officials said they do not expect that “these problems will have a long-term impact on our vaccination schedule.” During the past week, Oregon averaged more than 14,000 vaccinations per day. As of Thursday, 12% of the state’s population has been vaccinated with first doses, and 5% of residents had been fully vaccinated.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Department of Health announced a change Friday in its vaccine distribution plan that aims to ramp up the number of COVID-19 inoculations by distributing more doses to large hospitals and removing smaller physician practices and clinics from the provider list altogether. Tried-and-true distribution methods in Pennsylvania are insufficient for vaccines that require subzero transportation and storage temperatures and require people to come back for a second dose. Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said the four groups handling distribution going forward would be hospitals, federally qualified health centers, county health departments and pharmacies. Primary care doctors, long the mainstay of vaccination efforts, are being left out and left in the dark when it comes to battling the coronavirus, said Dr. Tracey Conti, a physician and president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Family Physicians. They have no information for the patients calling daily with pleas for the vaccine. Yet they believe their involvement is essential to counter the misinformation that could undermine the whole effort. “People would rather get vaccinated by their doctor,” Conti said. “It’s not clear they’ll accept it from anyone else.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: As part of the state’s plan to get vaccines to residents who cannot leave their homes, health officials on Friday launched a website to gather information about the housebound. The site does not allow people to sign up for a vaccination appointment – it is simply to collect information for planning purposes, the Department of Health said in a statement. The information in most cases is already being provided by cities and towns and home health agencies, but the state wants to make sure everyone limited to their homes is covered. Health care providers or family members can help fill out the form, the agency said. The state has been vaccinating residents 75 and older, and starting Monday, people 65 and older are eligible to make appointments. Also, the number of retail pharmacies in the state offering the vaccine will increase significantly by the end of the week, the agency said. CVS should be vaccinating at 14 locations, up from the current seven, while Walgreens should be vaccinating at 24 locations, up from the current 15. Nearly 127,000 people have received a vaccine first dose in Rhode Island, while 57,000 people have been fully vaccinated, according to health department data released Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The leader of the state agency that provides services for people with disabilities has been fired without explanation. After meeting privately and with no discussion Thursday, the board of the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs voted 5-1 to immediately fire Director Mary Poole, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. She had been at the agency for less than three years and made $171,400. Commissioner David Thomas of Greenville made the motion to dismiss Poole. A former state senator, Thomas told the newspaper he couldn’t say why she was fired because it was a personnel issue. He said Poole’s firing is for the good of the agency and hopefully will lead to the agency serving more people and serving them better. Poole said she has worked honestly and diligently for more than 30 years with people with disabilities and was not given an opportunity to discuss with the board any concerns with her work. “We found and corrected many long-standing and significant issues within the agency and provider network,” Poole said in a statement. “My only regret is that these efforts were cut short with so much work left to be done.” When Poole was hired in mid-2018, the department was suffering from years of abuse allegations with its providers, financial problems and long waiting lists.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials said Sunday that the number of hospitalizations due to the coronavirus continues to fall, although a virus research group ranks the state among the top 10 for the number of deaths relative to population. The state reported 140 new cases and four new deaths in the past day, raising the totals to 111,309 known cases and 1,863 fatalities since the start of the pandemic. The COVID Tracking Project ranks South Dakota seventh in the country in the number of deaths per capita. The update showed that the number of hospitalizations fell from 95 to 90. Of those patients, 17 were being treated in intensive care units, and nine required ventilators. There were about 230 new cases per 100,000 people in South Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks 38th in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. One in every 919 people in South Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents bought more guns in 2020 than ever before, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found. The state law enforcement agency found 740,580 gun transactions were performed last year, a 53% jump compared to 2019. Tennessee outpaced the national average in gun purchases, which saw about a 40% increase. TBI personnel track gun purchases and perform background checks on prospective gun buyers. Pam Beck, assistant director of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division, pointed to four main causes in the spike of firearms purchases: the coronavirus pandemic, talks of defunding the police, bouts of civil unrest and the 2020 election. “People feel like they have to protect themselves,” she said. According to data provided by TBI, the state saw the biggest jump in gun purchases in March, when residents purchased more than 77,000 firearms. This came at the start of the pandemic, when the first coronavirus case was discovered in Tennessee and when then-President Donald Trump declared a national emergency because of the virus. Some states began announcing lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, and grocery store shelves emptied as panic buying ensued.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of COVID-19 deaths across the state increased by more than 200 on Saturday, while the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus declined, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. There were an additional 227 COVID-19 deaths, more than 4,900 new cases and 7,535 hospitalizations, a decline of 222 people hospitalized, the department reported. Texas has recorded more than 2.5 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and more than 42,000 deaths due to COVID-19, the third-highest death count in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of new cases has fallen from nearly 18,980 per day to nearly 5,041, and the average of daily deaths has dropped from 305.7 per day to 127.3, according to the Johns Hopkins data. During the past two weeks, the rolling average of daily new cases in Texas has fallen by 13,849.3, a decrease of 74.7%, according to the Johns Hopkins figures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah State Parks has reported park visitation increased by 2.6 million between 2019 and 2020 despite safety restrictions implemented during the coronavirus pandemic. “Our state parks saw elevated visitation numbers throughout the traditional summer season,” Utah Division of Parks and Recreation Director Jeff Rasmussen said. “Not only that, but record-breaking visitation continued into the fall and winter and has not tapered off like it normally does.” The agency reported that the 44 parks across the state recorded 10.6 million visitors combined last year compared to the 8 million recorded in 2019, according to KSTU-TV. Officials said popular boating and off-highway vehicle areas statewide also saw increase use. Park officials announced in April last year that many state parks would reopen after weeks of being restricted to in-county residents to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some stayed closed based on local public health orders. “We never closed our doors to the public. While there was a time when visitation was restricted due to local health orders, we were always open,” Rasmussen said. Utah State Parks expects visitation to remain high this year as people continue to find outdoor spaces to escape during the pandemic.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is easing travel restrictions for Vermonters and visitors who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 starting this week, Gov. Phil Scott announced Friday. Two weeks after receiving their second dose of the vaccine, Vermonters do not have to quarantine after travel starting Tuesday, Scott said during his twice-weekly virus briefing. Out-of-state visitors also are exempt from quarantining if they can prove they have been fully vaccinated. “Of course they’ll still need to comply with all our other health guidance like masking and distancing,” Scott said. The state is also easing restrictions for fully vaccinated residents of long-term care facilities in areas where there are no current outbreaks beginning this Friday. The state is encouraging full vaccination status as a factor in planning for activities, such as eating together and participating in other group activities, and for having indoor visitors, said Human Services Secretary Mike Smith. Residents of all skilled nursing facilities have received the second dose of the vaccine, Smith said. A total of 93% of residents of all skilled nursing, assisted living and residential care facilities have gotten their first dose, and 74% have received their second dose, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers have passed bills that allow certain first responders to file workers’ compensation benefits for being disabled from COVID-19, but legislators still need to reach agreement on some differences. The measures would make COVID-19 an occupational disease for firefighters, emergency medical services personnel, and law enforcement or correctional officers and allow these individuals to file for workers’ compensation benefits. The workers’ dependents also would be eligible for benefits if the workers die from COVID-19. Occupational diseases arise out of and in the course of employment, according to state law, and include hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, tuberculosis or HIV. Senate Bill 1375, sponsored by Sen. Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax, and House Bill 2207, introduced by Del. Jay Jones, D- Norfolk, had mostly unanimous support. The main difference is that the House bill would extend the compensation to regional jail officers. The Senate also rejected an amendment by the House that would allow compensation for cases going back to March 2020. The bills would apply to persons diagnosed with COVID-19 on or after July 1 whose death or disability from COVID-19 occurred on or after that same date, Del. Kaye Kory, D-Falls Church, said in an email.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: More than $2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funding will be allocated across the state under a measure signed into law Friday by Gov. Jay Inslee. The legislation, which received strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate this month, spends $2.2 billion on various efforts, including vaccine administration, rental assistance and money for school districts. “The focus this year is relief, recovery and resilience, and this legislation will make big progress in all three,” Inslee said before signing the bill. It stipulates that $714 million will be allocated to schools as they move toward welcoming students back to the classroom. An additional $618 million will go toward vaccine administration, contact tracing and testing, and $365 million will go toward rental assistance to help renters and landlords affected by the pandemic. The bill also allocates $240 million to small-business assistance grants that will be administered through the state Department of Commerce and $70 million to assist undocumented immigrants affected by the pandemic who do not qualify for federal or state assistance. An additional $50 million is for grants to help child care businesses stay open and expand capacity, and $26 million is for food assistance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice has ordered the loosening of pandemic restrictions on businesses after a decline in coronavirus deaths and cases, and he sought the return of all elementary and middle school students to in-person learning. In a flurry of announcements, the governor on Friday said small businesses and grocery stores can double their allowed capacity, and the limit on social gatherings will go up from 25 to 75 people. Bars and restaurants can allow 75% of seating capacity, up from 50%, if social distancing is possible. Hours later, the state health department announced that the first three cases of the coronavirus variant from the United Kingdom have been detected in West Virginia. It is among one of three variants already found in other states that researchers believe may spread more easily. “While the presence of this COVID-19 variant in West Virginia is not surprising, it’s a good motivator for us to double down on the prevention efforts we’ve had in place for many months now,” Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state health officer, said in a statement. Justice said all teachers and school workers over age 50 who accepted the offer for a vaccine will be given their second doses this week. He said he is asking the State Board of Education to bring all students from kindergarten to eighth grade back to classrooms.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison warned of a recent spike in coronavirus cases Friday, a day after a more contagious variant of the virus was detected in the county, and the university system’s president said he wanted students to attend nearly all classes in person this fall. The warning emailed to students, faculty and staff told of a “significant increase” in COVID-19 cases among students on and off campus. There were 112 newly confirmed cases reported Wednesday and 99 more Thursday, according to the email from Jake Baggott, the head of University Health Services. “Equally concerning, contact tracing suggests that many of the students who have tested positive had attended gatherings, sometimes without wearing masks,” Baggott said. The seven-day average of new cases both on and off campus was up 13.2%, according to the UW dashboard. Although no immediate mitigation steps were being taken on campus, Baggott said the university was preparing to take action if necessary. He said that could include limiting access to or temporarily closing recreational facilities; placing residence halls under quarantine; increasing testing frequency for students off campus; and directing students to stay at home except for attending class and work.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: National weather issues prevented some shipments of vaccines against COVID-19, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. WDH said last week that it was not expecting any Moderna vaccine doses to be delivered to Wyoming locations due to weather problems in other states. Wyoming was slated to receive 5,700 first doses and 3,700 second doses for its distribution process. Shipments to the Walmart locations involved in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program were also affected. “At this point, we are awaiting updates from our federal partners about next week’s shipments,” said Angie Van Houten, Community Health Section chief with WDH. More than 93,000 residents have received their first dose so far when state and special federal counts are combined. Each of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines requires two doses for maximum effectiveness. Because some of the affected vaccine shipments included second doses, Van Houten said individuals who are delayed in receiving their second dose can still receive the vaccine when it is available. “There will not be a need to ‘start over,’ ” she said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/22"}]}

From miscaptioned videos to false claims about his conviction, viral claims have repeatedly misrepresented the president's son and his relationship with the law.\n\nIn the wake of Biden’s conviction on three federal gun charges, the USA TODAY Fact Check team recapped some of the false and misleading claims that have gone spread most widely — and what’s actually true.\n\nRead more: After Hunter Biden's guilty verdict, a look back at viral falsehoods\n\nJoe Biden doesn't address Hunter Biden case in first public comments since verdict\n\nJoe Biden gave remarks on gun violence in Washington on Tuesday, just hours after his son was convicted in his felony gun trial.\n\nThe president spoke at Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund’s “Gun Sense University,” where he called for banning assault weapons, instituting universal background checks and passing other gun control measures.\n\nJoe Biden was specifically addressing gun violence in his remarks. Hunter Biden was not accused of physically harming others in the felony case.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat kind of gun did Hunter Biden buy?\n\nThe gun Hunter Biden purchased and held onto for 11 days in 2018 is a .38 caliber Cold Cobra, known as a 38 special. The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense. The president's son told Delaware State Police he bought it for target practice in 2018.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nJoe Biden said he would not pardon Hunter Biden while he was on trial for federal gun charges last week, according to a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nABC anchor David Muir, interviewing Biden in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, asked whether he would accept the outcome of his son’s trial.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\nMuir also asked if he would rule out a pardon for his son.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the military?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge, which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHunter Biden's guilty verdict adds to Joe Biden's distractions\n\nHunter Biden's felony conviction on Tuesday could continue to distract President Joe Biden during pivotal weeks of his 2024 reelection bid, with the first presidential debate against former President Donald Trump fast approaching and the president's son's second federal criminal trial coming shortly before Election Day.\n\nAlthough not a part of his father's campaign and not on the ballot himself, Hunter Biden's conviction on three gun related charges could also complicate Joe Biden's campaign's labeling of his opponent, Trump, as a felon who should not return to the Oval Office.\n\n– Sarah D. Wire and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat's next for Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden’s conviction in his federal gun trial is not the end of his legal drama.\n\nStill pending are the 54-year-old's sentence, his potential appeal and a Supreme Court case that could overturn the law behind his charges. The president's son − a lawyer, businessman and author − also faces a second federal trial on tax charges set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for the three charges: lying on a federal screening form by denying, lying to a gun dealer and possession of a firearm while using or addicted to unlawful drugs. But sentences for first-time and nonviolent offenders are typically shorter than the maximum possible.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGOP lawmakers both celebrate and downplay Hunter Biden verdict\n\nFor the Republicans who have long sought to prove wrongdoing by President Joe Biden and his family, Tuesday’s jury decision finding the president’s adult son, Hunter, guilty on all charges was welcome news.\n\nHowever, the fanfare was somewhat muted – at least, less than one might expect from a Congressional cohort that has been probing the Biden family's business ties for more than a year and with a presidential campaign already in full bloom ahead of November's Election Day.\n\nHouse Republicans spearheaded an investigation in 2023 and early 2024 into Hunter Biden’s ties to foreign businesses as part of an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. They say Joe Biden benefited financially from Hunter Biden’s business deals, but have not unearthed evidence that supports that claim and the inquiry has largely fizzled out.\n\n– Riley Beggin and Ken Tran\n\nDavid Weiss speaks publicly after verdict\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss said in a three-minute statement that the verdict reflected that no one in the country is above the law. He thanked Attorney General Merrick Garland for ensuring his independence of the investigation.\n\n“Ultimately this case was not just about addiction,” Weiss said. “This case was about the illegal choices the defendant made while in the throes of addiction.”\n\nWeiss did not take questions from the media, noting DOJ has \"additional trial work to be done\" on the Hunter Biden case.\n\n– Bart Jansen and Isabel Hughes\n\nJuror: ‘Oh man, I don’t want to be here.’\n\nA couple of the jurors who heard the Hunter Biden trial are speaking publicly about their deliberations.\n\nOne woman who served said she feared the case would be politically charged once she realized the trial involved the president’s son.\n\n“Oh man, I don’t want to be here,” she said. “I was expecting all of us to be at each other’s throats because you know of who his father is and how the political climate is in this country,” she said.\n\nBut after being selected, evaluating the evidence and returning guilty verdicts, she said there was not a problem with deliberations.\n\n“It turned out much better than what I expected,” she said. “There was not fighting, none of that in the jury room.”\n\nAnother juror agreed that politics played no role in any jurors vote.\n\n“It was just following the evidence,” the juror said. “We just had to find out the truth.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Bart Jansen\n\nJurors: First vote was split even\n\nTwo jurors who presided over Hunter Biden’s criminal trial said they took an evenly split vote on count one shortly after receiving the case for less than an hour of deliberation on Monday afternoon.\n\nFrom there, they studied the elements of the charges in the jury instructions and talked, jurors said. They deliberated for about two hours after returning guilty verdicts.\n\n“We broke it down and heard other people’s opinions,” one juror said after issuing the verdict. “That is what moved me to guilty on all three.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJuror says Hunter Biden case was a 'waste of taxpayer dollars'\n\nA female juror who lives near New Castle, Delaware said she felt the case should not have been prosecuted. She said Biden needed rehab, “definitely not imprisonment.\"\n\n“In my opinion this was a waste of taxpayer dollars,” the woman said as she left the courthouse. “They could have just fined him.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHere's how Hunter Biden, his lawyer Abbe Lowell reacted to verdict\n\nBiden issued a statement thanking his family for their love and support during the trial while saying he was “disappointed by the outcome.”\n\n“Recovery is possible by the grace of God, and I am blessed to experience that gift one day at a time,” Biden said.\n\nHis lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said he respected the jury’s verdict, but he would “continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump advisor comments on Hunter Biden's conviction\n\nKash Patel, a national security advisor for former President Donald Trump, said in a statement Tuesday that \"Hunter Biden’s guilty verdict is a rare example of constitutional justice, one not where individuals receive biased treatment based on their last name. The jury was able to consider the prosecution and the defense evidence in full, in accordance with due process.\"\n\nPatel alleged without evidence that the former president did not receive the same treatment in his New York hush money trial, when he was convicted on 34 felony counts.\n\n– Erin Mansfield and Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden reacts to Hunter Biden's verdict\n\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement on Tuesday following Hunter Biden's conviction, saying that \"I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\"\n\nHe added that \"(first lady Jill Biden) and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRead Hunter Biden's verdict\n\nWhen will Hunter Biden be sentenced? Judge Maryellen Noreika doesn't immediately set date\n\nMaryellen Noreika, the judge who presided over Hunter Biden's case, didn't set a sentencing date for the president's son on Tuesday.\n\n\"Usually when we do sentencing it is 120 days out, but we will get in touch with you,\" she said before the courtroom adjourned.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat is Hunter Biden guilty of?\n\nThe president's son was convicted on three firearms felonies. In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n2024:Hunter Biden guilty verdict adds to president's distractions ahead of Trump debate\n\nHunter Biden looks to lawyer, wife after verdict announced\n\nHunter Biden pat Abbe Lowell, his lawyer, on the back after his felony conviction was announced. He then turned to look at his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden and hugged other members of his defense team.\n\nHe was holding his wife's hand as he was ushered into elevators after the court adjourned.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Esteban Parra\n\nWhat's next for Hunter Biden?Sentencing, likely appeal and looming trial on tax charges\n\nHallie Biden received texts about drugs from Hunter Biden\n\nHallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, testified during the trial about how her brother-in-law introduced her to drugs. She also walked the jury through a series of text messages in the days after Hunter Biden bought the gun on Oct. 12, 2018.\n\nA text the next day said he was behind a baseball stadium in Wilmington “waiting on a dealer named Mookie.”\n\nHallie Biden later texted Hunter Biden, stating that she tried calling him “500 times in the past 24 hours.” He eventually responded: “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”\n\nHunter Biden called Hallie Biden ‘stupid’ for trashing gun\n\nHallie Biden told the jury she found the gun in Hunter Biden's car 11 days after he bought it. Rather than risk their kids finding it, she put the gun in a leather case and drove to a grocery store, where she threw it into a trash can.\n\n“I realized it was a stupid idea now, but I was just panicking,” Hallie Biden said.\n\nHunter Biden confronted her when he discovered what she had done.\n\n“It’s hard for me to believe anyone is that stupid,” Hunter Biden said in a text. “Do you want me dead?” he asked in a later text.\n\nRetiree found gun in grocery store trash can\n\nAn 80-year-old retiree, Edward Banner, who scavenged trash containers for aluminum cans, found the gun outside Janssen’s Market in Greenville. A state police lieutenant tracked him down and asked whether he’d found anything unusual.\n\n“I definitely remember finding that,” Banner said.\n\nFBI chemist found cocaine residue on Hunter Biden gun pouch\n\nForensic chemist Jason Brewer testified that he found cocaine in the residue on the leather pouch that held Hunter Biden’s gun. Two spots on the pouch had a “minimal amount” of “off-white powder,” which Brewer pointed out in a picture prosecutors projected onto a screen in Biden’s trial on gun charges.\n\n“Cocaine was identified within the residual white particles I sampled,” he told the jury.\n\nHunter Biden trial followed collapse of plea deal for gun and tax charges\n\nA plea agreement that fell apart last July offered the possibility Biden could avoid jail time for all of the charges. Noreika rejected the deal because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about Biden’s protection from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware, David Weiss, a special counsel to continue an independent investigation. Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued unsuccessfully the charges should be dismissed because no new evidence had emerged since the plea agreement.\n\nThe gun indictment charged Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver. He was charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he was charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms. The three charges carried a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison.\n\nThe tax indictment charges Biden with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors. He allegedly engaged in a scheme in which he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed taxes from 2016 through 2019, and also evaded tax assessment for 2018 when he filed false returns.\n\nThe previous agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, which could have resulted in no jail time, and enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied.\n\nBut Republicans blasted the agreement as a sweetheart deal and Hunter Biden became a lightning rod for criticism of his father.\n\nWhere does Hunter Biden live?\n\nHunter Biden lives in southern California. There, he faces tax charges in a separate trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nHis felony gun trial took place in Delaware because in 2018 he purchased the revolver and ammunition from a gun shop in Wilmington.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son. He's faced three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form. The third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/10/hunter-biden-gun-trial-live-updates/74017406007/", "title": "Hunter Biden trial recap: Jury begins deliberations in felony gun case", "text": "WILMINGTON, Del. – Hunter Biden’s trial on federal gun charges is now in the hands of the jury of 12 Delaware residents who will decide whether the president's son illegally bought and owned a revolver while he was an unlawful drug user or addict.\n\nBiden, 54, faces a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted of all three felony charges: lying on a federal screening form, lying to a gun dealer and possessing the gun. But first-time offenders on non-violent charges are typically given shorter sentences. The trial is historic because Biden is the first child of a sitting president to be tried for a crime.\n\nBiden has acknowledged a four-year addiction to crack cocaine in his book “Beautiful Things.” But his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argued he didn’t “knowingly” lie because he had recently completed a rehabilitation program and wasn’t using drugs at the time he bought the gun in October 2018.\n\nEvidence in the trial from Biden’s electronic devices showed pictures of drugs in 2018 and texts about using drugs in the days after buying the gun.\n\nEmotional testimony from his former romantic partners described their concerns about his addiction and their searches for contraband, to prevent his children from finding drugs or paraphernalia.

Proceedings will continue on Tuesday.\n\n– Esteban Parra\n\nHunter Biden embraces his lawyer\n\nAfter Abbe Lowell finished his closing argument, and as the jury was being leaving for a break, Hunter Biden stood and walked over to Lowell and gave him a long embrace.\n\n– Esteban Parra\n\nJury begins deliberation\n\nAfter hearing the remainder of their instructions and taking an oath, the jury is heading back to the jury room to begin deliberating the case.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJurors receive final instructions\n\nJurors will now receive their final instructions before deliberations begin.\n\nIt is possible a verdict could come today, however the court typically adjourns at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nEvidence against Hunter Biden ‘overwhelming,’ prosecutor argues\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines concluded his rebuttal in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges by arguing the evidence for conviction was “overwhelming.”\n\n\"If this evidence did not establish that Hunter Biden is a crack addict or an unlawful user, then nobody is a crack addict or unlawful user,\" Hines told the jury.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor counters claim of cruelty toward Naomi Biden\n\nAfter the defense said prosecutors were “incredibly cruel” in questioning Hunter Biden’s daughter, Naomi, prosecutor Derek Hines countered by arguing the defense called her as a witness.\n\n\"Who called the defendant's daughter as a witness in this case?\" Hines asked the jury.\n\nHe told the jurors to recollect how uncomfortable she was on the stand and the \"anguish\" present when she testified.\n\n\"You know that she was up there completely uncomfortable,\" Hines said. \"She couldn’t vouch for the defendant’s sobriety through the month of October.\"\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor tells jury that 'choices have consequences'\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines rebutted defense lawyer Abbe Lowell’s assertion that prosecutors were attacking Hunter Biden for his addiction.\n\nHad Biden continued to use drugs but not decided to buy a gun, “we wouldn’t be here,” Hines said. “Choices have consequences and that is why we were here.”\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors begin rebuttal statement before case heads to jury\n\nDerek Hines will deliver the final word for the government. He started by rebutting Lowell's assert to the jury that Hunter's life is in their hands.\n\n\"You don't have his life in your hands. You are asked to make a determination of facts and apply the judge's law. That is it, nothing more, nothing less,\" Hines said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nDefense ends closing statement\n\nThere will be a restroom break, and prosecutors will issue the final statements before the jury begins deliberation.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors ‘cruel’ to Hunter Biden’s daughter: Lowell\n\nProsecutors questioned by Hunter Biden was trying to contact his daughter, Naomi, at 2 a.m. when they were both in New York in October 2018.\n\nProsecutors raised the possibility that Hunter Biden was meeting a dealer and asked Naomi Biden if she used cocaine. But defense lawyer Abbe Lowell said prosecutors made no effort to call the drug dealer as a witness.\n\n“That is reasonable doubt and extraordinarily cruel to his daughter,” Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘Hunter deserves those rights’: Abbe Lowell\n\nHunter Biden’s status as son of the president has cut both ways while he faced criminal charges over a gun and taxes.\n\nHouse Republicans blasted a plea agreement that collapsed last July as a sweetheart deal. But defense lawyer Abbe Lowell has argued Biden is being prosecuted more harshly since then.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines opened the trial by telling the jury: “No one is above the law, doesn’t matter what your name is.”\n\nLowell turned the phrase around in his closing argument.\n\n“He missed the point: it means Hunter deserves those rights and protections,” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden ‘incredibly stupid’ trashing gun: Lowell\n\nHunter Biden told his sister-in-law Hallie Biden to call police to report his missing gun after she threw it in a grocery store trash can in 2018, which defense lawyer Abbe Lowell said he wasn’t a danger to public safety.\n\n“On October 23, Hallie Biden did something incredibly stupid,” Lowell said.\n\nLowell quoted one of Hunter Biden’s texts to remedy the situation.\n\n“He said, ‘go inside and get the police,’” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden’s unfamiliarity with guns shows lack of intent to lie, defense lawyer argues\n\nHunter Biden was “killing time” when he bought a revolver in October 2018, spending 16 minutes buying bullets, a speed loader and a BB gun after store employees ran his background check, according to defense lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\nBiden didn’t know anything about guns or bullets, which employees explained to him, Lowell told jurors.\n\nBiden’s behavior showed that he didn’t go into the store “with the intent” to lie on a federal screening form or that he knew he would be prohibited from owning a gun, Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden was using alcohol at ‘critical time’\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell told jurors that Hunter Biden was using alcohol after his August time in rehab, but \"that is not against the law.\"\n\nBiden is charged with lying on a federal screening form when he bought a gun in October 2018 about not using unlawful drugs. But Lowell said drinking isn’t against the law.\n\n\"Kicking crack cocaine is hard. Kicking alcohol much harder,\" Lowell said. \"Even after rehab, he ended up drinking.\"\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nDefense calls leather gun pouch another prosecutorial trick\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell argued that nobody could say when cocaine residue was put on a leather gun pouch that held Hunter Biden’s revolver when his sister-in-law, Hallie Biden, threw it in a grocery store trash can, where it was retrieved by a scavenger.\n\nA chemist for the prosecution found residue of cocaine on the pouch. But Lowell said the “big piece of evidence” represented “suspicion and conjecture” because nobody could say when the residue was put on the pouch.\n\n“You don’t know when the residue was put there,” Lowell said. “You don’t know by whom. You don’t know where it was at the time.”\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nZoe Kestan’s photos show sobriety, Hunter Biden's lawyers say\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell walked the jury though examples of damning photos of drugs and paraphernalia implicating Hunter Biden’s drug addiction in the months leading up to September 2018.\n\nHe then drew their attention to photos from her visit with him that month, which include “no bongs, no other paraphernalia.”\n\nHe noted she was more than willing to spend Hunter Biden's money, introduce him to drug dealers while he was trying to recover in November 2018, was willing to use drugs with him and spent six hours \"rehearsing\" her testimony with prosecutors ahead of trial.\n\n“Once again, the lack of photos can speak more loudly than what was spoken by her under a grant of immunity,” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden defense accused prosecutors of sleight of hand\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell compared the prosecution’s case against Hunter Biden to a magician’s sleight of hand obscuring what happened in late 2018.\n\nLowell noted that Biden hadn’t written about drug use in his memoir after drug rehab in August 2018 or when he bought the gun in October 2018. But Lowell argued prosecutors sought to “squeeze” evidence from 2016, 2017 and early 2018 into the same time frame as the gun purchase.\n\n“Remember what the texts say about (rehab) to the time he bought the gun: nothing,” Lowell said.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers argue that case is built on speculation\n\nHunter Biden’s defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, told jurors that they needed to find he “knowingly” lied about his drug use to convict him but that “suspicion and conjecture” about his actions aren’t enough to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n“The word knowingly cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,” Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor urges conviction despite ‘sympathy’ over drug usage\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise said evidence in trial against Hunter Biden, which included testimony of unlawful drug use, may “provoke sympathy or disgust” but that he was “not charged with being an addict.”\n\n“Lying to buy that gun is a choice and that is why we are here,” Wise said. “He did that knowing exactly what he was doing is beyond a reasonable doubt.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘Don’t leave common sense behind’: Prosecutor\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise told jurors that it didn’t make sense for Hunter Biden’s defense to argue that his texts to Hallie Biden about waiting for a dealer and smoking crack were a smokescreen for avoiding her.\n\n“He didn’t have to make up this elaborate story about two drug deals,” Wise said. “You don’t leave your common sense behind when you come into the jury box.”\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\n'Can't use a credit card to buy drugs'\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise emphasized what he described as a pattern of cash withdrawals in which Hunter Biden withdrew some $150,000 between October and November.\n\n“You can’t use a credit card to buy drugs, that goes without saying,” Wise said.\n\nDefense attorneys have sought to say Biden was paying for his drug rehab and other things. Wise rebutted this by showing credit card receipts for rehab services.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor pokes holes in Hunter Biden rehab claim\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise argued that a witness contradicted Hunter Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, opened the trial telling jurors that he went to a rehab program in August 2018 and thus didn’t view himself as a drug user.\n\nWise noted the rehab stay was only about a week and then Biden supposedly lived with a sober coach. But Wise emphasized testimony from Zoe Kestan, a former girlfriend of Biden, who said he was smoking crack and had drug paraphernalia in different parts of the house.\n\n“She said it was all over,” Wise told the jury. “There was no sober companion there.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors emphasize Hunter Biden texts\n\nDefense lawyer Abbe Lowell has argued that Hunter Biden was not using drugs when he bought a gun in October 2018, but prosecutors contend his texts tell another story.\n\nProsecutors highlighted how Biden sent to messages in the days after buying the gun, with one saying he was waiting for a dealer and another saying he was smoking crack.\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise noted that a Hallie Biden text the same month he bought the gun said she wanted to help him get sober and her testimony stating that included by drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nTestimony about Hunter Biden’s drug use enough to convict, prosecutor argues\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise told the jury in Hunter Biden’s gun trial that the testimony from his former girlfriend, Zoe Kestan, would be enough to convict him on its own.\n\nKestan testified that Hunter Biden smoked crack in Los Angeles in September 2018, weeks before he bought the gun at issue in the trial.\n\n\"You could convict on those facts alone,\" Wise said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor outlines ‘central issue’ in Hunter Biden trial\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise said the “central issue” in the charges against Hunter Biden was whether he knowingly lied on a federal screening form and to a gun dealer about whether he used unlawful drugs when he bought a revolve in 2018.\n\n“He knew he was using drugs and he knew he was addicted to drugs, that is what the evidence showed,” Wise said.\n\nWise added that maybe if he had not been in rehab or had not used drugs weeks before, he could argued that he didn’t know he was an addict.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nFederal firearm form shows what Hunter Biden signed\n\nThe federal screening form that Hunter Biden filled out when he bought a gun in 2018 asked: \"Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug or any other controlled substance?\" Biden replied “no.”\n\n\"This is the statement that the evidence proves is false,\" Wise told the jury.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor says evidence is 'ugly' and 'overwhelming'\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise is now reminding the jury of the charges what the law requires for conviction.\n\n\"The central issue in this case was whether the defendant was an unlawful user of or addicted to controlled substances and whether he knew that fact,\" Wise told the jury.\n\nWise said the evidence proves Hunter Biden fit into both of those categories.\n\n\"It was personal and it was ugly and it was overwhelming,\" Wise said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutor appears to refer to first lady, Biden family members\n\nIn an apparent reference to first lady Jill Biden and other Biden family members' presence in the courtroom, Wise pointed to the gallery and referenced people jurors might know from the news, saying they don't matter.\n\n“The only evidence in this case is what came from the witness stand and the physical and documentary evidence that has been admitted by Judge Noreika,” Wise said, beginning his closing arguments.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJury gets instructions\n\nAs U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika read instructions to the jury, Hunter Biden and his lawyers read along with their copies.\n\nWhen she got to the instruction that Biden didn’t have to testify, the president’s son looked up and surveyed the jurors. He returned to looking at copies when the judge moved to another topic.\n\n– Esteban Para\n\nClosing statements begin in Hunter Biden's gun trial\n\nProsecutor Leo Wise will deliver closing statements for the government.\n\n–Xerxes Wilson\n\nHow many children does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nJill Biden, Ashley Biden attend Hunter Biden gun trial\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, Hunter Biden's sister, were in attendance Monday at his felony gun trial.

Proceedings will resume shortly after noon, when closing arguments − each side's last chance to make an impression on the jury − will begin.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nJudge reading portions of final jury instructions\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika is currently reading jurors portions of their final instructions.\n\nThe instructions offer an outline of legal definitions, the jury's role and its process for deliberating the charges. She will read the rest of the instructions after a lunch break and closing statements.\n\nThe most recent version of the jury instructions that have been made available to the public can be read below. The parties debated small changes to the instructions Monday morning and the final product has not yet been made available in court documents.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecution rests its rebuttal case, closing statements next\n\nAfter brief testimony from an FBI agent, prosecutor Derek Hines said prosecutors have no more rebuttal witnesses.\n\nThis means the case will shortly move to closing statments before jurors receive their final instructions and begin deliberation.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors focus on Hunter Biden's text messages implying drug use\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines asked FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen about Hunter Biden’s text messages that refer to a 7-Eleven gas station in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThe location is important because Hunter Biden mentioned the store in an October 2018 text message saying he was waiting to buy drugs. Defense attorneys have sought to discredit that message by saying Biden was lying to Hallie Biden, the recipient, because he did not want to see her.\n\n“There are messages where the defendant is referencing 7-Eleven both before and after (purchasing) the gun?” Hines asked Jensen, prompting her to confirm.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:The president's son in his own words: Hunter Biden's candor becomes prosecutor's weapon\n\nProsecutors call FBI agent after defense rests\n\nAfter Hunter Biden’s defense rested in his federal gun trial, prosecutors called FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen to rebut the defense case.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines began asking her questions about text messages Biden sent in October 2018, proximate to when he purchased the gun.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:'I am ashamed': Hallie Biden gives emotional testimony on finding Hunter Biden's gun, using drugs\n\nWhat happened to Hunter Biden’s plea deal?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss secured two indictments for gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement in July that aimed to resolve the investigation.\n\nWeiss, as a Donald Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware, had investigated Biden for years. Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who is David Weiss?

Lowell said the question asked “are you” a user or addict, which the lawyer argued he wasn’t at the time.\n\nThe form Biden filled out asked if he was “an unlawful user of a controlled substance or addicted to a controlled substance.” Evidence at trial showed pictures of drugs in April 2018 and texts about using drugs in the days after buying the gun.\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss’s team argued in a Monday filing that “a defendant is not entitled to a judicial narrative of his version of the facts.” Prosecutor Derek Hines said Biden hadn’t presented any evidence that he considered himself not addicted.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika must still decide how to instruct the jury.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWhat did Hunter Biden do?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies. In October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware, and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat kind of gun did Hunter Biden buy?\n\nThe gun Hunter Biden purchased and held onto for 11 days in 2018 is a .38 caliber Cold Cobra, known as a 38 special. The revolver is a rimmed, centerfire cartridge designed by Smith & Wesson that can range in price from a couple hundred to a thousand dollars.\n\nThe handgun is known for its accuracy and is often used for small-game hunting, recreational target shooting, and personal defense. The president's son told Delaware State Police he bought it for target practice in 2018.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nJoe Biden says he wouldn’t pardon his son if he is convicted\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he would not pardon his son Hunter Biden, who is on trial for federal gun charges, according to a wide-ranging exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nABC anchor David Muir, interviewing President Biden in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, asked whether he would accept the outcome of his son’s trial.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\nMuir also asked if he would rule out a pardon for his son.\n\n“Yes,” the president said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nCourt begins with arguments over final jury instructions\n\nThe parties started court early this morning as prosecutors, the defense and the judge discuss minor changes to the jury's final instructions.\n\nThe instructions will help guide jurors on important legal definitions and their final role deciding a verdict.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson\n\nMore:Judge sends jury home early in Hunter Biden trial; daughter Naomi Biden testifies\n\nWho is James Biden?\n\nJames Biden was involved in overseas business deals with Hunter Biden that drew the spotlight of House Republicans investigating whether President Joe Biden benefited.\n\nJoe Biden and the White House have dismissed the accusations as baseless partisan attacks. Justice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is prosecuting Hunter Biden, secured an indictment against an FBI informant, Alexander Smirov, for allegedly lying about Hunter Biden’s involvement in a Ukrainian energy deal.\n\nBut the foreign intrigue isn’t at stake in Hunter Biden’s gun trial. He is charged with lying about his drug use on a federal screening form when he bought the gun in October 2018.

But its more salacious contents, including explicit photos and videos of Hunter Biden, have continuously stoked the fire of controversy.\n\nJohn Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of The Mac Shop in Wilmington, Delaware, said a man identifying himself as Hunter Biden brought in three liquid-damaged laptops in April 2019.\n\nOne laptop was left behind, and Mac Isaac said at the time he shared the device with Robert Costello, Rudy Giuliani's lawyer who also testified at Trump's hush money trial, because he believed it would make him safer.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Xerxes Wilson\n\nFBI agent testimony delves into Hunter Biden messages\n\nAfter playing more than one hour of audio excerpts of Hunter Biden’s 2021 memoir, FBI agent Erika Jensen is now discussing text messages and emails sent to and from Hunter Biden.\n\nJensen told the jury that some of the communications were derived from hard drive backups directly from Apple.

But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\n\nHunter Biden's trial on federal gun charges in the family's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, could last more than two weeks.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said in court filings they will present photos, testimony and messages to show that Hunter Biden was an illegal drug user around the time he bought the gun and failed to disclose that as required on a federal gun purchase form.\n\nProsecutors also said they may use details gleaned from his phone, iCloud account and the infamous laptop that he allegedly abandoned at a repair store, including photos of Hunter Biden smoking crack and texts arranging meetings with illegal drug dealers.\n\n– Reuters\n\nTrial's key moment: Was Hunter Biden sober on Oct. 12, 2018?\n\nA large part of Hunter Biden’s trial will boil down to a single day in October 2018, when he bought a .38 Special revolver at a Delaware gun store and checked “No” on a federal gun form that asked about drug addiction or drug use.\n\nThe federal drug form asked: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?”\n\n“At issue here is Mr. Biden’s understanding of the question,” his lawyer Abbe Lowell recently wrote the court. “Someone like Mr. Biden, who had just completed an 11-day rehabilitation program and lived with a sober companion after that, could surely believe he was not a present tense user or addict.”\n\nSome drug treatment experts told USA TODAY they wouldn’t consider a patient cured of addiction after 11 days of treatment. But they said a person who had just completed treatment might consider themselves sober.\n\nMore: Hunter Biden trial: Why his gun case hinges on one fateful day when he wasn't using drugs\n\nHallie Biden, Lunden Roberts and Kathleen Buhle could testify\n\nProsecutors have said they'll call about a dozen witnesses as they make their case against Hunter Biden during the trial, according to multiple reports.\n\nThose may include Hunter Biden's ex wife, Kathleen Buhle, as well as the mother of his youngest daughter, Lunden Roberts. Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, is also expected to testify. She and Hunter Biden were in a relationship following Beau Biden's death.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden’s uncle, James Biden, will be a defense witness\n\nHunter Biden’s uncle, James Biden, will be a defense witness at his nephew’s trial on federal gun charges.\n\nJames Biden, who is President Joe Biden’s brother, has helped his nephew pay for rehabilitation and therapy to deal with his addiction to drugs, according to the defense.\n\nThe appearance threatens to attract more political attention to the trial. House Republicans have investigated Hunter and James Biden to see whether their foreign business deals benefited President Biden.\n\nHunter and James Biden have denied wrongdoing and the White House described the inquiries as baseless. A key witness has been charged with lying to the FBI.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCould Hunter Biden go to prison?\n\nThe charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, though Biden is likely to get a shorter sentence if convicted. It is atypical for defendants to get a maximum sentence when they are first-time offenders like Biden.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCourt breaks for lunch\n\nProceedings paused for a lunch break and will continue at about 2 p.m. ET.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Kevin Morris?\n\nKevin Morris is an entertainment lawyer and author who provided the president’s son nearly $5 million in loans to help pay his debts and living expenses. He was part of Hunter Biden's entourage present in court Monday.\n\nThree House committees questioned Morris while they investigated Hunter Biden’s finances for possible influence on his father’s presidential administration earlier this year.\n\nMorris told lawmakers he is not a registered lobbyist, he has no ulterior motive, and there is no corruption involved in their relationship.\n\n“He’s my client,” Morris said. “And he’s my very good friend.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nJury hears excerpts from Hunter Biden's memoir\n\nHunter Biden isn't taking the stand today, but the jury in Delaware is still hearing his voice. The jury is now listening to a series of excerpts from Hunter Biden’s memoir “Beautiful Things.” Passages from the book are displayed on a large screen in the courtroom as prosecutors play a narration of the book by Hunter Biden.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat did Hunter Biden do?\n\nThe president's son faces three firearms felonies in the case that kicked off on Monday.\n\nIn October 2018, Hunter Biden walked into a gun shop north of Wilmington, Delaware and purchased a revolver. People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his book and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nFBI agent takes the stand as first witness\n\nProsecutors called their first witness on Tuesday, questioning FBI special agent Erika Jensen. She's expected to discuss the investigation into Hunter Biden, including messages he exchanged in 2018, bank statements and other evidence.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nHunter Biden’s cash withdrawals for lack of credit card, not for drugs: defense\n\nProsecutors argued that Hunter Biden routinely withdrew large amounts of case, including $5,000 the day he bought a gun in October 2018.\n\nBut rather than paying for drugs, the president’s son didn’t have a credit card and was paying thousands for drug recovery programs, according to defense lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\n“He withdrew cash for lots of things, which are the opposite of buying drugs,” Lowell said. Biden spent “thousands and thousands” on recovery and rehab around that time, Lowell said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden’s defense disputes timing of drug abuse\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers at Hunter Biden’s trial disagreed about when he was using illegal drugs – and whether the timeline affects the gun charges against him.\n\nProsecutors said his drug abuse occurred before, during and after buying the gun in October 2018. Biden is charged with lying on a federal form and to the gun dealer about his drug abuse, which he chronicled in a 2021 memoir.\n\nBut his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, disputed the timing of his drug use. The federal form asked whether a person “is” using drugs rather than “have you ever been,” Lowell said.\n\n“Hunter was not using when he bought the gun,” Lowell said. “When the form wants to ask someone ‘have you ever done something,’ the form knows how to do that.”\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nGun shop cut corners to sell Hunter Biden a gun: defense\n\nThe gun shop that sold Hunter Biden the pistol at issue in his federal trial didn’t receive verification of his address, as they are legally required to do, according to defense lawyer Abbe Lowell.\n\n“A sale is a sale and that was their goal that day,” Lowell said. “You will hear they wanted it done quickly.”\n\nBiden’s defense is arguing he didn’t knowingly lie when he filled out the form in October 2018 denying he used illegal drugs because he had recently completed a rehabilitation program.\n\nLowell argued that the form defined terms such as fugitive, but not portions asking about drug use. He implored jurors to listen to testimony from the gun dealer, to determine whether they knew what the drug-related terms meant.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nProsecutors can’t prove Hunter Biden believed he was addicted: defense\n\nAbbe Lowell, one of Hunter Biden’s defense lawyers, emphatically told jurors that prosecutors can’t prove he knowingly lied on the gun form at the heart of the trial on federal gun charges against the president’s son.\n\nPounding the lectern, Lowell said nobody will dispute that Hunter Biden struggled with drug use.\n\nBut Lowell emphasized that much of the evidence prosecutors outlined deals with episodes well before or after the gun purchase in October 2018. Biden is charged with lying on a federal form, lying to the gun dealer and then possessing the gun for 11 days, all while addicted to unlawful drugs.\n\nLowell noted Hunter Biden had been in rehabilitation in California months before buying the gun. He emphasized that prosecutors can’t prove at the time he bought the gun, that he believed himself to be addicted or an unlawful user of drugs.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden granted immunity to testify about Hunter Biden’s drug use\n\nA prosecutor told jurors that Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden’s brother, would testify about his drug use and her own, under a grant of immunity.\n\nHallie Biden was married to Beau Biden, who died in 2015. She was then in a relationship with Hunter Biden after Beau Biden's death.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines said she had become a drug user at the time as well but ceased using months before October 2018, when Hunter Biden purchased the gun at issue in his federal trial. Hallie Biden is the one who threw the gun at issue in the trial into a grocery store trash can.\n\nHines said prosecutors will also call Zoe Kestan, Hunter Biden’s former girlfriend, to discuss his frequent use of crack cocaine. She is also testifying with a grant of immunity.\n\n“The agreement they have requires them to tell the truth noting more nothing less,” he said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nGun dealer unaware that Hunter Biden used drugs: prosecutor\n\nA prosecutor said the Delaware gun dealer who sold Hunter Biden a .38-caliber revolver in 2018 will testify that he watched the president’s son fill out a from stating he was not an unlawful drug user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines said the dealer, Gordon Cleveland, will testify that he didn’t know Biden used drugs. The defense is expected to argue that Biden considered himself sober at the time he bought the gun, after completing a stint in rehabilitation.\n\n“What Mr. Cleveland didn’t know was that Mr. Biden was an unlawful user and he lied,” Hines said.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWhat was Hunter Biden’s relationship with his brother's widow?\n\nHallie Biden is the widow of the president’s other son, Beau, and a key witness prosecutors have indicated they plan to call during the trial.\n\nTwo years after Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, she became romantically involved with Hunter, prompting a tabloid media frenzy. The two split in 2019.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nOne juror dropped from Hunter Biden trial\n\nA juror dropped out the day after being selected for Hunter Biden’s federal trial on gun charges because she didn’t have transportation from southern Delaware to the Wilmington courthouse, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said Tuesday.\n\nTwelve jurors – six men and six women – had been chosen Monday, along with four women alternates.\n\nNoreika said one of the jurors had been “lost” before the start of opening arguments Tuesday because she begged to be dismissed for living an hour away and not having a car, job or money for parking.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\n‘No one is above the law’: Hunter Biden prosecutor tells jury\n\nThe prosecution in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges told the jury Tuesday the reason the president’s son was in the courtroom was because of choices he made.\n\n\"No one is above the law, it doesn’t matter who you are or what your name is,\" special prosecutor Derek Hines told the jury.\n\n\"Each day in courtrooms like this one, defendants from all walks of life are tried because of the choices they make, not the people they are,” Hines added. “Choices they made to break the law. This case is no different.\"\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is Melissa Cohen Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is currently married to Melissa Cohen, a 38-year-old South African filmmaker. Within a week of meeting her in May 2019, he proposed.\n\nThe Biden family was not at the wedding, but he told The New Yorker of his father's support for the marriage.\n\nIn 2019 they welcomed a son together, Beau Biden IV, named after Hunter Biden’s late older brother.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow many kids does Hunter Biden have?\n\nHunter Biden has five children. He has three daughters with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle named Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden, and Maisy Biden. In 2019, he welcomed a son with his second wife Melissa Cohen, Beau Biden IV., named after his late older brother.\n\nIt was also revealed that he had secretly fathered another daughter with an Arkansas woman named Lunden Roberts in 2018. Her name is Navy Roberts. President Joe Biden first publicly acknowledged his granddaughter in 2023.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhy was Hunter Biden discharged from the Navy?\n\nLess than a year after he was commissioned in 2013, Hunter Biden was administratively discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine on a drug test.\n\nOn the presidential debate stage in 2020, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the Navy.\n\n\"Hunter got thrown out of the military,\" Trump said. \"He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\"\n\nAn administrative discharge is standard procedure after failing a drug test. It is different from a dishonorable discharge which is usually the result of misconduct.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWho is Abbe Lowell?\n\nHunter Biden’s main lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has a long history of working with Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLowell represented Ivanka Trump while she was a White House aide, chiming in as an ethics adviser. He also defended Jared Kushner when House members questioned his use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nNow, he is defending Hunter Biden who faces three felony charges related to purchasing a gun in 2018. Biden officially added Lowell to his legal team after a plea deal fell through in July that would have covered tax charges and the gun charges. It was seen at the time as a way to take a more aggressive response to the investigation into him, which have been going on for more than five years.\n\nHe was the chief minority counsel during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley\n\nHunter Biden also faces civil trial against his ex-wife over alimony\n\nHunter Biden isn't just facing sweeping legal problems over gun and tax charges. Axios reported last week that – in 2021 – a Washington court found he was in breach of an agreement with his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle. At the time, he owed her over $1.7 million in legal fees, spousal support and other costs from their 2017 divorce.\n\nSince then, Buhle and Biden's legal battle has continued, and her attorneys have argued he still owes her millions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is David Weiss?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the prosecution of Hunter Biden, was appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware by former President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nWeiss investigated Biden for years before reaching a plea agreement for the president’s son to admit two tax misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program to potentially erase a drug charge. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to rubber stamp because of disputes about whether it would protect Biden from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss as special counsel in August to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments on gun charges in Delaware, in the trial that started Monday, and on tax charges in California, with that trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss has been criticized by Republicans as going too soft on Biden by reaching a “sweetheart deal” in the plea agreement. Democrats have criticized him for being too hard on Biden by pursuing charges that are rarely enforced.\n\nGarland has defended Weiss as an independent prosecutor following the facts and the law.\n\n--Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nHunter Biden had family's support during jury selection\n\nHunter Biden, the president’s son, enjoyed the support of relatives as the jury selected Monday in his trial on federal gun charges.\n\nThe first lady, Jill Biden, sat in the front row on her birthday, paying rapt attention and taking notes. She had helped raise Hunter Biden after his mother was killed in a car crash when he was young. Hunter Biden’s wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and half-sister Ashley Biden also attended.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who remained in Wilmington during the jury selection, issued a statement supporting his son despite the political toll the charges have taken on his reelection bid.\n\n“Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support,” Joe Biden said.\n\n−Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Bart Jansen\n\nWho’s testifying at the Hunter Biden trial?\n\nWhile every witness in the case isn't set in stone, there have been reports about who's expected to testify at the Delaware trial.\n\nAt least two employees from the gun store at the center of the case are expected to testify at the trial. Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify.\n\nHallie Biden, who was married to President Joe Biden's other son, the late Beau Biden, is also expected to provide testimony. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were in a relationship in 2018, and she told law enforcement officials she found a gun in Hunter Biden's vehicle and threw it away outside of a Delaware store.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Hunter Biden?\n\nHunter Biden is President Joe Biden's youngest son. He's facing three firearms felonies in Delaware.\n\nThe first two relate specifically to the form he filled out to purchase a gun in 2018, accusing Biden of lying about this drug use on the form.\n\nThe third charge pertains to Biden's possession of a firearm while he was allegedly an unlawful user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika bars defense expert on drug addiction from trial\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika on Monday barred testimony from one of Hunter Biden’s proposed expert witnesses, who the defense sought to give a perspective about how people suffering drug addiction view themselves.\n\nDefense lawyers sought to have Elie Aoun, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry, to testify to testify about how people who have participated in rehabilitation programs are sometimes in denial about their addiction and view themselves as no longer addicted when they complete a program.\n\nBut Noreika barred the witness Sunday, in one of two decisions against the dense, by ruling the defense failed to provide prosecutors with a proper explanation about what expert opinions Aoun would offer.\n\nBiden’s defense also sought testimony from Michael Coyer, a forensic toxicologist, to answer questions about items including a white residue on a brown leather gun pouch that tested positive for cocaine years after it was taken into police custody. Noreika ruled that she would hear from Coyer without the jury present before deciding whether to allow him to testify.\n\n−Xerxes Wilson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/09/hunter-biden-gun-charges-appeal/73629996007/", "title": "Federal appeals court refuses to dismiss Hunter Biden's gun charges", "text": "A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected Hunter Biden’s request to dismiss his gun charges in Delaware, clearing the way for a June trial.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said he would keep fighting to dismiss the case. “In reviewing the panel’s decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,” Lowell said in a statement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika had refused to dismiss the charges against Biden, who allegedly lied about an addiction to drugs when buying a gun in 2018.\n\nBiden then appealed with three arguments, including that he shouldn’t face a trial after a plea agreement fell apart last July and that prosecutors are being vindictive because of political pressure from Republicans to prosecute the president’s son.\n\nBut a three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his three arguments unanimously because the case hasn’t reached a final judgment yet.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“Criminal defendants raising those challenges cannot appeal before final judgment,” Judges Patty Schwartz, Cindy Chung and Brooks Smith ruled.\n\nThe appeals judges ruled that nonprosecution agreements, such as the one that was abandoned for Biden’s gun charges, don’t prevent being charged in the future.\n\nBiden also asked the appeals court for special consideration under a policy for “extreme” and “extraordinary” cases with a likelihood of irreparable injury.

And he is charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nBiden has acknowledged he was a drug addict at the time.\n\nHe faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted − five years for the false statement to the dealer, 10 years for the false statement on the federal form and 10 years for possession of the firearm − but actual sentences typically are shorter than the maximum, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe plea agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied.

The instructions include some basic warnings, including not to speak to anybody about the case or do any independent research.\n\nIt also included some basic instructions about taking notes, the case's flow and jurors' role evaluating the evidence.

People who purchase firearms are required to fill out a standardized form that asks whether they are an unlawful user or are addicted to controlled substances, narcotics and other listed substances. Biden is accused of answering \"no\" to that question on the form.\n\nBut Biden has been open about his longtime struggles with crack cocaine addiction. He's written about it in his 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" and discussed it during a court hearing last year, stating he's been sober since 2019.\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted, although first-time and non-violent offenders are often given shorter terms.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\n‘You can’t swing a cat without hearing something’\n\nOne potential juror was asked by the judge if he had previously heard about the case.\n\n“I live in Delaware, you can’t swing a cat without hearing something,” he told the judge, though he added that he had only heard about the case on the news but hadn’t researched it.\n\nProsecutors moved to strike the man because he said he had a family member who suffered from addiction and he holds strong feelings about second chances.\n\n“I think after people have been recovering, they need a second chance,” he said. “Everybody needs a second chance.”\n\nHe said he wasn’t sure what time period that second chance should come and that it should be down to the individual. He said this belief would not impair his ability to judge the evidence and he was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n– Xerxes Wilson\n\nCan Joe Biden pardon Hunter Biden?\n\nThere's no rule that a president can't pardon a loved one. But if Hunter Biden is convicted on federal charges, it's not likely that his father would use his office to take action.\n\nThe White House last year ruled out President Joe Biden using his presidential authority to pardon his son. The president has given no indication that he planned to pardon Hunter Biden, but that hasn't stopped some critics from suggesting he might.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Joey Garrison\n\nCourt making progress selecting jurors\n\nSo far, the court has worked through more than three dozen potential jurors.

Hunter Biden and Melissa Cohen Biden have a 4-year-old son, Beau Biden, and he and his ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, have three adult daughters: Naomi Biden, Finnegan Biden and Maisy Biden.\n\nLunden Roberts, the mother of Hunter Biden's youngest daughter, is expected to provide testimony in the case. It's not clear if she would bring their 5-year-old daughter, Navy Joan Roberts, to the courthouse.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happened to Hunter Biden’s plea deal?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss secured two indictments for gun and tax charges against Hunter Biden after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected a plea agreement in July that aimed to resolve the investigation.\n\nWeiss, as U.S. attorney in Delaware, had investigated Biden for years. Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for nonpayment of taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program on a gun charge.\n\nBiden potentially could have stayed out of jail under the agreement, which congressional Republicans slammed as a sweetheart deal. But Noreika questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether the deal would protect Biden from future charges and the judge refused to “rubber-stamp” the agreement.\n\nThe collapse of the plea deal led to Biden’s indictment on three felony gun charges in Delaware, in a trial that started Monday, and nine tax charges in California, in a trial set for Sept. 5.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhich jurors could be selected?\n\nThe court ruled some jurors were qualified after they answered questions about potential hardship in attending the trial, their political work in the past and family members who have suffered addiction.\n\nOthers were quizzed about their local connections and encounters with the Bidens. One potential juror said they worked at the same college as First Lady Jill Biden for a period. He also supported current Superior Court Judge Farris Wharton’s campaign for Delaware Attorney General against Hunter Biden’s brother, Beau, two decades ago. He said those aspects of his life would not challenge his ability to fairly view the evidence in the case and was allowed to remain in the jury pool.\n\n“I’d listen to any testimony with an open mind,” he answered when quizzed about whether he’d be more apt to believe a police officer’s statement if it were in conflict with another person’s.\n\nAnother potential juror was a bartender at Two Stones Pub in New Castle County and said she served a Biden family member there from time to time, but didn’t know him.

Oberly\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nOver the past 40 years, I’ve prosecuted and overseen the prosecution of scores of gun cases and white-collar cases. In total, many thousands of cases in federal and state court – including some later in my career as a defense attorney.\n\nFrom those cases and what I recall of the Department of Justice’s standards, I’m one of many who have observed the DOJ’s prosecution of the president’s son with increasing disappointment.\n\nLike any Delawarean, I know many parties involved. Special counsel David Weiss was my first assistant (No. 2 in the office) when I was U.S. attorney in Delaware. As a prior three-term attorney general and former state prosecutor in Delaware, I have known President Joe Biden for decades, worked closely with his late son, Beau, and saw Hunter many times.\n\nEven accepting all the government’s allegations as true, it’s hard to understand why it is prosecuting the younger Biden: At the time he purchased a firearm, Biden was a nonviolent, 40-something struggling drug addict with zero criminal history. He proceeded to possess a firearm for 11 days and did not use it for any purpose (let alone in a crime).\n\nIt has been reported that he is charged with a crime that has almost never been prosecuted – an addict without criminal history misrepresenting his addiction on a firearm purchase form.\n\nAt Hunter Biden trial, laptop returns:Trump right about Hunter's 'laptop from hell,' though Biden claimed Russian disinformation\n\nWhy is Hunter Biden being prosecuted? Precedent doesn't explain it.\n\nModern prosecutors’ offices have developed simple guideposts for whether to prosecute gun possession:\n\nWas it used in a crime?\n\nWas the purchaser a felon?\n\nWas the purchaser a suspect in another (typically, violent) crime?\n\nDid the purchaser have a criminal record?\n\nWas the person a danger to the community?\n\nThat is: From all available information, in this time where violent crime is every office’s priority and nonviolent addicts are treated differently than they once were, I cannot conceive of an office spending any resources – let alone five-plus years, countless agents and numerous prosecutors – on a case with similar facts.\n\nTrump hush money case was a sham:Trump was found guilty in a case DA Bragg never should have prosecuted\n\nAs right-wing former Congressman – and former federal prosecutor – Trey Gowdy said last week, “We never prosecuted addicts for lying and buying on federal forms.”\n\nIndeed, the office prosecuting this case – the office I once led – now rarely prosecutes even the most violent gun offenders. Of the thousands of gun charges in Delaware, the U.S. Attorney’s Office prosecutes very few. When viewed against those statistics, the choice to make an example of the younger Biden raises, at a minimum, questions.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland may have missed the mark on fairness\n\nThe tax case, by contrast, raises questions for a different reason: The DOJ has a long history of engaging with nonviolent, middle-age men who fail to pay taxes – even those connected to politicians and presidents. As has been extensively reported, however, that engagement almost never results in criminal charges when the tax avoider pays what is owed.\n\nRoger Stone owed nearly $2 million in taxes and this same DOJ pursued that civilly, not via criminal charges. Rudy Giuliani owes $550,000 in taxes, and this DOJ has not charged him. Hunter Biden's lawyers said he repaid the back taxes, and he faces multiple felony charges?\n\nAs former Attorney General Eric Holder observed, this is not the type of case that the DOJ ever prosecutes.\n\nThe purpose of prosecutorial discretion is to make the law work for its intended purpose. Addicts and nonaddicts alike make mistakes every day; no office has the ability or desire to prosecute each infraction. And certainly no office should chase felony convictions and jail time in a misguided effort to appease either side in Congress.\n\nOn the federal side, this is where the attorney general’s guidance is important. Here, he has strained to stay far away from the case. I do not know his motives. But I fear his desire to tell investigating Republicans that he did not interfere has caused the pendulum to swing so far that this particular defendant is being targeted in a way that no other individual would – and in so doing, tarnishing the DOJ and its career employees’ reputations.\n\nIn his first address as attorney general in March 2021, Merrick Garland told the DOJ’s 115,000 employees, “The only way we can succeed and retain the trust of the American people is to adhere to the norms that have become part of the DNA of every Justice Department employee since Edward Levi’s stint as the first post-Watergate attorney general. ...\n\n\"Those norms require that like cases be treated alike. That there not be one rule for Democrats and another for Republicans; one rule for friends and another for foes; one rule for the powerful and another for the powerless; one rule for the rich and another for the poor; or different rules depending upon one's race or ethnicity.”\n\nAn eloquent and admirable standard, one that the attorney general has upheld through three tumultuous years – except as it relates to one defendant.\n\nCharles M.

Final jury instructions have not yet been approved by the court.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nGun shop cut corners to sell Hunter Biden a gun: defense\n\nDefense attorney Abbe Lowell noted that the people who sold Hunter Biden his gun did not receive verification of his address, as they are legally required to do.\n\nIt’s part of a defense that will emphasize that Hunter Biden did not knowingly lie when he filled out the form to buy the gun.\n\n“A sale is a sale and that was their goal that day,” Lowell said. “You will hear they wanted it done quickly.”\n\nLowell emphasized that the gun form defines things like fugitive, but not portions that pertain to drug use.\n\nHe implored the jury to listen to whether people who work at the gun store know what the drug-related terms actually mean and said the man who sold the gun to Hunter Biden did not explain what the terms meant.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nHunter Biden's defense: prosecutors can’t prove Biden believed he was addicted\n\nIn opening statements, defense attorney Abbe Lowell told jurors prosecutors can’t prove Hunter Biden knowingly lied on the gun form.\n\nPounding the lectern, Lowell said nobody will dispute that Hunter Biden struggled with drug use.\n\nBut he emphasized that much of the evidence outlined by prosecutors pertains to instances well before and after when Hunter Biden purchased the gun central to the case.\n\nHe noted Hunter Biden had been in rehab in California months before buying the gun. He emphasized that prosecutors can’t prove at the time he bought the gun, that he believed himself to be addicted or an unlawful user of drugs.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nGun dealer unaware that Hunter Biden used drugs: prosecutors\n\nIn opening statements Tuesday, Prosecutor Derek Hines outlined the evidence against Hunter Biden.\n\nHe told the jury about Biden going into a northern Delaware gun shop to purchase a .38 caliber revolver and how a gun shop employee will tell the jury he watched Biden fill out a federal form stating he was not an unlawful drug user or addicted to controlled substances.\n\n“What Mr. [Gordon] Cleveland didn’t know was that Mr. Biden was an unlawful user and he lied,” Hines said.\n\nHe laid out how Biden’s gun was tossed in the trash of a Delaware grocery store by Hallie Biden, his brother’s widow and his ex-girlfriend.\n\nHe said prosecutors will show that Biden was addicted and an unlawful drug user through his text communications, as well as excerpts from his memoir.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nHallie Biden granted immunity to testify about Hunter Biden’s drug use\n\nA prosecutor told jurors that Hallie Biden, the widow of Hunter Biden’s brother, would testify about his drug use and her own, under a grant of immunity.\n\nHallie Biden was married to Beau Biden, who died in 2015. She was then in a relationship with Hunter Biden after the death.\n\nProsecutor Derek Hines said she had become a drug user at the time as well but ceased using months before October 2018, when Hunter Biden purchased the gun at issue in his federal trial. Hallie Biden is the one who threw the gun at the center of the trial into a grocery store trash can.\n\nHines said prosecutors will also call Zoe Kestan, Hunter Biden’s former girlfriend, to discuss his frequent use of crack cocaine. She is also testifying with a grant of immunity.\n\n“The agreement they have requires them to tell the truth noting more nothing less,” he said.\n\n--Xerxes Wilson\n\nOne juror dropped from Hunter Biden trial\n\nA juror dropped out the day after being selected for Hunter Biden’s federal trial on gun charges because she didn’t have transportation from southern Delaware to the Wilmington courthouse, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said Tuesday.\n\nTwelve jurors – six men and six women – had been chosen Monday, along with four women alternates.\n\nNoreika said one of the jurors had been “lost” before the start of opening arguments Tuesday because she begged to be dismissed for living an hour away and not having a car, job or money for parking.\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\n‘No one is above the law’: Hunter Biden prosecutor tells jury\n\nThe prosecution in Hunter Biden’s trial on gun charges told the jury Tuesday the reason the president’s son was in the courtroom was because of choices he made.\n\n\"No one is above the law, it doesn’t matter who you are or what your name is,\" special prosecutor Derek Hines told the jury.\n\n\"Each day in courtrooms like this one, defendants from all walks of life are tried because of the choices they make, not the people they are,” Hines added. “Choices they made to break the law. This case is no different.\"\n\n— Xerxes Wilson\n\nWho is David Weiss?\n\nJustice Department special counsel David Weiss, who is overseeing the prosecution of Hunter Biden, was appointed the U.S. attorney in Delaware by former President Donald Trump in 2017.\n\nWeiss investigated Biden for years before reaching a plea agreement for the president’s son to admit two tax misdemeanors and enter a pretrial program to potentially erase a drug charge. But U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to rubber stamp because of disputes about whether it would protect Biden from future charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Weiss as special counsel in August to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments on gun charges in Delaware, in the trial that started Monday, and on tax charges in California, with that trial set to begin Sept. 5.\n\nWeiss has been criticized by Republicans as going too soft on Biden by reaching a “sweetheart deal” in the plea agreement. Democrats have criticized him for being too hard on Biden by pursuing charges that are rarely enforced.\n\nGarland has defended Weiss as an independent prosecutor following the facts and the law.\n\n— Kinsey Crowley and Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Abbe Lowell?\n\nHunter Biden’s main lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has a long history of working with Democrats and Republicans.\n\nLowell represented Ivanka Trump while she was a White House aide, chiming in as an ethics adviser. He also defended Jared Kushner when House members questioned his use of WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders.\n\nNow, he is defending Hunter Biden who faces three felony charges related to purchasing a gun in 2018. Biden officially added Lowell to his legal team after a plea deal fell through in July that would have covered tax charges and the gun charges. It was seen at the time as a way to take a more aggressive response to the investigation into him, which have been going on for more than five years.\n\nHe was the chief minority counsel during the impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.\n\n— Kinsey Crowley\n\nWho’s testifying at the trial?\n\nWhile every witness in the case isn't set in stone, there have been reports about who's expected to testify at the Delaware trial.\n\nAt least two employees from the gun store at the center of the case are expected to testify at the trial. Millard Greer, a former state police officer who authored the final investigative report on the incident included in court files, is expected to testify.\n\nHallie Biden, who was married to President Joe Biden's other son, the late Beau Biden, is also expected to provide testimony. Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden were in a relationship in 2018, and she told law enforcement officials she found a gun in Hunter Biden's vehicle and threw it away outside of a Delaware store.\n\nWho is Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa Cohen?\n\nHunter Biden is currently married to Melissa Cohen, a 38-year-old South African filmmaker.\n\nHe met her in May 2019 and less than a week later, he proposed.\n\nThe Biden family was not at the wedding. Hunter told The New Yorker of his father's support for the marriage.\n\n“I called my dad and said that we just got married. He was on speaker, and he said to her, 'Thank you for giving my son the courage to love again.'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/11/whats-next-hunter-biden-conviction-appeal-tax-trial/74048858007/", "title": "What's next for Hunter Biden? Sentencing, appeal – and another trial", "text": "WASHINGTON - Hunter Biden’s conviction in his federal gun trial is not the end of his legal drama.\n\nStill pending are the 54-year-old's sentence, his potential appeal and a Supreme Court case that could overturn the law behind his charges. The president's son − a lawyer, businessman and author − also faces a second federal trial on tax charges set to begin Sept. 5 in Los Angeles.\n\nTuesday's verdict comes after a plea bargain fell apart last July that would have resolved gun and tax charges likely with no prison time for Hunter Biden. Instead, he became the first offspring of a sitting president to be charged, face trial and be convicted.\n\nThe jury's judgment carries political implications as Democratic President Joe Biden campaigns for reelection against the presumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. Congressional Republicans have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, which fueled the tax charges pending in his second trial, for possible influence peddling. Joe Biden told ABC News he wouldn't pardon his son.\n\nHere is what we know about pending litigating affecting Biden:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nFederal sentencing guidelines for Biden range from 15 to 21 months\n\nBiden faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison for the three charges: lying on a federal screening form by denying, lying to a gun dealer and possession of a firearm while using or addicted to unlawful drugs. But sentences for first-time and nonviolent offenders are typically shorter than the maximum possible.\n\nBiden’s sentencing could be months or longer as officials prepare a report based on guidelines about the length of sentences in similar cases. Factors can lead to adjustments based on the defendant's criminal record and behavior that may be helpful in correctional treatment.\n\nTypically, a federal probation officer will interview the defendant and prepare a report before sentencing. Prosecutors and defense lawyers also file memos arguing what type of sentence the judge should impose.\n\nFederal guidelines call for a sentence of 15 to 21 months for Biden. Legal experts said defendants often get shorter sentences and are less likely to be incarcerated if they comply with rules of pretrial release.\n\nBiden expected to appeal gun conviction\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected several requests to dismiss the gun charges, but defense lawyer Abbe Lowell has said he would continue pursuing legal challenges.\n\nLowell accused Justice Department special counsel David Weiss of prosecuting Biden vindictively because few people are charged under the law wielded in Biden's case. House Republicans criticized the \"sweetheart deal\" the plea agreement offered Biden that Noreika rejected. Lowell has argued Weiss sought an indictment despite a lack of additional evidence because of the criticism, an accusation the prosecutor denied and called \"fiction designed for a Hollywood script.\"\n\nNoreika and Weiss were each appointed by Trump.\n\nThe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May that Biden had to wait until after the verdict to appeal several of Noreika's rulings against dismissing the charges.\n\nAppeals panel already rejected using failed plea bargain to dismiss case\n\nThe Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already rejected one of Lowell’s repeated arguments that the failed plea agreement should have prevented the later indictment and trial.\n\nThe plea bargain would have allowed Biden to avoid prosecution on a gun charge if he remained sober for two years and wasn’t charged again under a so-called diversion agreement. But prosecutors opposed granting Biden immunity based on the proposed agreement because the probation office never approved the agreement, rendering it moot.\n\n“Because the agreement never went into effect, the Government was free to withdraw it, which it did, in writing, on August 9, 2023,” prosecutor Leo Wise wrote in a filing.\n\nA three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled the abandoned agreement didn't prevent future prosecution.\n\n“Non-prosecution agreements do not implicate a right not to be tried or any other right that can be” appealed, a three-judge appeals panel ruled in May.\n\nThe decision cited previous rulings in appeals circuits including D.C., the New York-based 2nd, the St. Louis-based 8th and Denver-based 10th.\n\nThe appeals panel also rejected Biden’s request for review of the rejected plea agreement under a provision called “mandamus,” which the judges said is reserved as an “extreme” and “extraordinary” remedy to avoid irreparable injury.\n\n“The defendant does not meet that standard, so his request for a writ of mandamus is denied,” the panel ruled.\n\nSupreme Court decision pending in challenge to gun statute\n\nThe law that served as a foundation for the charges against Biden has been challenged by gun-rights advocates for years. A 2022 Supreme Court decision overturned a New York law by ruling any gun restrictions must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation,\" which opened the door to a flood of challenges to firearms regulations.\n\nIn one case, Zackey Rahimi’s lawyers appealed his conviction under a law – the same one used to charge Biden – prohibiting him from owning a gun because of a protective order his girlfriend got against him.\n\nThe law at stake in the court battles is 18 USC 922, which in nearly four out of five cases is used to stop convicted felons from possessing a firearm. But the section of code contains lesser-known provisions prohibiting gun possession for other reasons, such as for drug use or addiction, the charge against Biden.\n\nLike Rahimi, Lowell argued in Biden’s case the charges were unconstitutional. Despite his son's legal challenge, President Biden has advocated making gun background checks even tighter.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule this month in Rahimi’s case.\n\nBiden's tax trial starts Sept. 5\n\nWeiss declined to take questions after making a three-minute statement about the gun verdict because of the pending trial against Biden.\n\n\"Our work continues,\" Weiss said of prosecutors including Leo Wise and Derek Hines, who he said had been working seven-day weeks for months.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi set Biden’s trial in Los Angeles on nine tax charges for Sept. 5, after Lowell asked for more time to prepare between trials, after the tax case was initially set for June 20.\n\nThe plea agreement had called for Biden to admit two misdemeanors for not paying taxes in 2017 and 2018. But Weiss secured an indictment on three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanors.\n\nBiden allegedly engaged in a scheme in which he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed taxes from 2016 through 2019, and also evaded tax assessment for 2018 when he filed false returns, according to the California tax indictment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/11"}]}
