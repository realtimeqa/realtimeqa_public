Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, both agreed to participate in a debate hosted by the network on Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nAccording to CBS News, the network proposed four dates for a debate between the two vice presidential nominees: Sept. 17, Sept. 24, Oct. 1 and Oct. 8. Both campaigns soon agreed to the Oct. 1 date.\n\n\"See you on October 1, JD,\" Walz posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Aug. 14.\n\nVance accepted the Oct. 1 debate the following day, while also proposing a debate for Sept. 18 on CNN. Michael Tyler, the communications director for Harris' campaign, told CBS News later that day that Walz will only participate in the Oct. 1 debate.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nHere's what we know about the Oct. 1 debate between Walz and Vance, including how to watch and who is moderating.\n\nStart time, how to watch Oct. 1 vice presidential debate\n\nThe debate is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Oct. 1, the network announced last week.\n\nIt will be broadcast on CBS and livestreamed on all platforms where CBS News 24/7 and Paramount+ are available. The debate will also be made available to simulcast, CBS announced.\n\nWhere will the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate be held?\n\nThe debate is scheduled to take place at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.\n\nWho are the moderators for the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate?\n\nThe debate will be moderated by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and \"Face the Nation\" moderator and CBS News foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, the network announced.\n\nWill there be another presidential debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump declined a CNN invitation to debate Vice President Kamala Harris for a second time on Oct. 23, less than two weeks before Election Day.\n\nTrump told supporters at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Saturday that \"It's just too late − voting has already started.\" He also said he's \"already done two\" debates, and questioned whether CNN would be fair to him.\n\nHarris had accepted CNN’s invitation on Saturday, sharing in a tweet that she hopes the former president would join her.\n\n“Vice President Harris is ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump, and she has accepted CNN’s invitation to a debate on October 23,” said campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon in a press release. “Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules, and ratings.”\n\nThe former president wrote in a Truth Social post earlier this month that he wouldn’t debate Harris again, claiming he won the ABC face-off against her. However, when asked if he would reconsider a second debate with Harris last week, Trump told reporters, “Maybe if I got in the right mood.”\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off on the debate stage Tuesday, laying out their pitches to voters across the country in the final stretch of the 2024 election.\n\nThe vice presidential picks kicked off the debate by talking about America's role in crises in the Middle East and how the nation should address issues like immigration, inflation and abortion rights. They also explained how they would try to lower housing prices and reduce gun violence in schools if elected.\n\nThe Ohio senator and Minnesota governor actually agreed at several moments in the debate, particularly as they discussed the need to make childcare more accessible for families from coast to coast. But their sharpest disagreement came as they were asked about democracy and the deadly Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's latest updates.\n\nVice presidential debate fact check:What Tim Walz, JD Vance get right (and wrong)\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBlame it on the nerves\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, addressed Tim Walz's misstep when he talked about gun violence in schools. The governor said on the debate stage “I’ve become friends with school shooters,\" but he appeared to mean that he has become friends with victims of school shootings and their families.\n\n“I think that when you're talking about someone who is trained in this space, such as JD Vance, and you're talking about someone who's not necessarily trained in this space, this was a nerve wracking thing,” she told reporters in the spin room.\n\nShe added: “When you think about it, especially coming in as the Democratic nominee, we know that there was a complete shift of our ticket after a debate, that's a lot of pressure. And so, I mean, I think that, you know, the average person who knows that he didn't become friends with school shooters — half of them have been killed — but nevertheless, I mean, I know that they know that it was a mistake, and I don't think it's a big deal.”\n\n− Sam Woodward\n\nVance calls for “new direction” in America in closing statement\n\nVance in his closing statement blamed Harris for increased costs, crime and drug trafficking. He proceeded to hit the vice president, again, for not making the policy changes she’s campaigning on now. “Her policies have made these problems worse,” he charged.\n\n“We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well,” he said.\n\nVance ended on a more optimistic tone, saying that regardless of who Americans vote for, “I’m so proud to be doing this, and I’m rooting for you.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWalz ends on the ‘politics of joy’\n\nWalz closed by talking about Vice President Kamala Harris’ wide coalition, from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. to former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney and pop star Taylor Swift.\n\n“They don’t all agree on everything but they are truly optimistic people,” he said.\n\nHe argued Harris is bringing “the sense of optimism” that there can be an economy that works for everybody and “freedom really means something.” Vance, he said, made it clear he would stand with Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nHarris is “bringing us a politics of joy,” he said. “She’s bringing real solutions to the middle class. And she’s centering you at the heart of that.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWalz says paid family leave would ‘enhance’ workforce\n\nTim Walz said paid family and medical leave would help bring growth to the United States.\n\nWalz said leaders have to make it easier for people to get into child care businesses and to make it affordable for people who need to pay for family care.\n\n“We're still in crisis on this,” Walz said.\n\n“A federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want,” Walz said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance, Walz clash about threats to democracy\n\nJD Vance really didn't answer a question about Trump's ongoing protests of the 2020 election and the subsequent Jan. 6 near-insurrection − and did not answer Walz's direct question about whether Trump really lost the 2020 election.\n\nInstead, Vance said Republicans want to focus on \"the future,\" and accused the Democrats of seeking to censor free speech of people who have criticized the election system. Trump's claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election were rejected by courts across the country.\n\nWalz replied that the threat to democracy is real, and Trump backers wanted to hang then-Vice President Mike Pence and overthrow the 2020 election. He alleged Trump and his allies are \"laying the ground work\" for more protests and an another attempted overthrow if they lose this election.\n\n“That is a damning non-answer,” Walz told Vance.\n\n\"This has got to stop,\" Walz added. \"It's tearing our country apart.\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nVance says more child care options should be available for American families\n\nJD Vance said there is a “bipartisan solution” for paid family and medical leave. Vance laid out how he believes that there should be a family care model “that makes choice possible” – something that Walz seemingly shook his head in agreement with. But Walz stopped agreeing after Vance criticized Harris’ approach to the issue.\n\nVance said federal funding for how child care is promoted should be considered, including for families who seek child care at churches or with neighbors.\n\n“One of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids, that is an incredible burden to put on American families,” Vance said. “We're the only country that does it. I think we can do a heck of a lot better.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance defends Trump over ‘concepts’ of a health care plan\n\nJD Vance defended running mate Donald Trump’s answer on health care from the last debate when asked about Trump’s widely-panned remark that he had the “concepts” of a healthcare plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“You’re not going to propose a 900-page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears,” Vance said.\n\nHe said it also wouldn’t mean anything if Trump had because there would be a debate in Congress over any proposed legislation. Vance pledged in the answer that Republicans would continue to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nTim Walz, a former teacher, said that Trump’s health care answer “cracked me up,” because “my kids would have never given me that.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nVance says 'we have to do better' on gun violence\n\nJD Vance and Tim Walz almost found common ground on one key issue: curbing mass shootings. While both said more needs to be done to protect Americans from mass shootings, both outlined different policies to do so.\n\nVance, who has three children, said a lot of kids are going to experience the terrible epidemic of gun violence.\n\n“Our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff, and we do have to do better,” Vance said, before blaming higher amounts of illegal guns in the country because of smuggling at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHe advocated for more security in schools, saying doors and windows should be stronger. “I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that,” Vance said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\n'We owe it to them to get a fix'\n\nWalz said he and Harris “understand” the Second Amendment and are not trying to take firearms away from Americans. He added that in Minnesota he helped enhance background checks, and noted that there are “reasonable things” that the government can do to curb mass shootings.\n\nBut Walz criticized Vance’s suggestion of increasing security at schools.\n\n“Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills?” Walz said. “They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix.”\n\nWhen asked about supporting an assault weapons ban, Walz said he now supported it after meeting with families of victims of school shootings. He misspoke by saying he became “friends with school shooters” after highlighting how he met with families of Sandy Hook victims.\n\n“I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work,” Walz said. “Protect the Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.”\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance wants to “earn people’s trust” on abortion issue\n\nThe GOP has a trust problem when it comes to the issue of abortion, Vance conceded Tuesday. Vance cited the story of a woman who is “very dear to me” who told him “a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn’t had that abortion that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.”\n\n“I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party we’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don’t trust us,” Vance said.\n\nHe went on to argue that he and Trump are doing that by promoting pro-family policies, such as fertility treatments and helping families financially. He also defended Trump’s position that abortion regulation should be left up to the states.\n\nWalz said that leaving abortion up to the states has put pregnant women at risk, citing the case of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after a long delay in getting a procedure to clear fetal tissue from her body that hadn’t been fully expelled after she took abortion bills, according to ProPublica. A medical panel ruled Thurman’s death was “preventable.”\n\nWalz said Thurman’s death is the result of a basic right being “determined by geography.”\n\n“I agree with you Amber Thurman should still be alive,” Vance said.\n\n−Zac Anderson\n\nDonald Trump says he'd veto a federal abortion ban\n\nDuring the debate, Donald Trump said he \"would not support a federal abortion ban\" and that he would veto a national abortion ban if he's elected to a second term.\n\n\"IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS,\" Trump said in an all-caps post on X.\n\nTrump has previously said he supports states setting their own abortion rights or restrictions, but his ticket hasn't been clear about whether a Trump-Vance administration would block an abortion ban passed by Congress.\n\nWalz and other Democrats question that, saying Trump would placate his anti-abortion base if he gets back in the White House.\n\n− David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho's winning the debate? We're more than halfway home\n\nHalf-time is over at the 90-minute debate. Vance has had a more confident debate performance so far, but both nominees have laid out their ticket's priorities.\n\nThe CBS moderators kicked off the second half with a question about gun violence.\n\n−David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nVance: I was wrong to call Trump 'America's Hitler'\n\nOnce again, Vance apologized for his past attacks on Trump, including a claim that the then-2016 Republican candidate might become \"America's Hitler.\"\n\n\"I was wrong about Donald Trump,\" Vance said, arguing that he \"delivered for the American people\" during his term in office.\n\nAs for more recent criticism that has just been unearthed, Vance said the Trump administration did not do everything perfectly, and he hopes to help change that.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVance says some of Harris’ economic plan 'sounds pretty good,' but says Americans should question her trustworthiness\n\nJD Vance said that some of Harris’ economic plans “sounds pretty good” – but she could have enacted those plans if she wanted to as vice president.\n\n“If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion,” he said. “The fact that she isn’t, tells you about how much you can trust her actual plans.”\n\nWalz began the back and forth by saying that he and Harris’ proposal to give families with newborns a $6,000 tax credit and their agenda to provide entrepreneurs with up to $50,000 to start small businesses is a “philosophical difference” between the two presidential campaigns.\n\n“He took folks to Mar-a-Lago, said you’re rich as hell, I’m going to give you a tax cut,” he charged.\n\nHe then hit Trump for the up to 20% in tariffs the Republican has said he’d impose on imported goods, which he referred to a sales tax on the American people.\n\nLater in the debate, Vance slapped back, noting that Biden had continued some of the Trump-era tariffs.\n\n“It’s the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden’s record,” Vance jabbed.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWalz calls himself a 'knucklehead,' said he 'misspoke' on Tiananmen claim\n\nTim Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in the spring of 1989. Recently unearthed news reports contradict that, indicating that he was still in Nebraska and headed to China to teach high school in August 1989.\n\nAsked about that contradiction, Walz stumbled over his answer, saying he “misspoke” and that he has been “a knucklehead at times.”\n\n“I can get caught up in the rhetoric,” he said.\n\nWalz has repeated the claim for years, beginning a decade ago during a congressional hearing and as recently as February.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWalz slams Vance for baseless rumors of Haitian migrants eating pets: ‘There’s consequences’\n\nTim Walz criticized JD Vance for spreading baseless rumors that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating pets.\n\n“There's consequences for this,” Walz said, noting Ohio’s Republican Governor, Mike DeWine, said the claims were untrue. “There's consequences.”\n\nHe accused Vance of demonizing migrants coming to the United States because he does not want to solve immigration issues. There hasn’t been immigration reform since the Reagan administration.\n\n“I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point, and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings,” Walz said.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nVance says real family separation policy is 'Harris' wide open southern border'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has pledged to deport millions of people who are in the country illegally.\n\nAsked whether that plan would involve separating undocumented parents from their children who were born in the U.S., Vance said “the real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris’ wide open southern border.”\n\nHe argued that thousands children have been lost by the Department of Homeland Security, some of whom have been used as “drug trafficking mules” or been victim to sex trafficking. A Trump administration deportation policy would target migrants who have committed a crime in addition to crossing the border illegally.\n\n“And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers,” he said. “A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country.”\n\nWalz argued that Republicans do not want to solve the border crisis because they refused to pass a Senate-negotiated bipartisan border bill earlier this year.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWalz slams Trump for calling climate change a 'hoax'\n\nAfter Hurricane Helene ravaged a large swath of the Southeast U.S., Vance was asked what a Trump administration would do to address climate change, which is contributing to stronger storms.\n\nHelene quickly strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane in the unusually warmer water of the Gulf of Mexico and went on to inflict record storm surge flooding on parts of Florida, and catastrophic flood damage in parts of Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nVance said climate change is “a very important issue” and that people “are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns.” He added that bringing more manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. would help limit carbon emissions, and accused the Biden-Harris administration of failing to do that.\n\nWalz responded by noting Trump has called climate change a “hoax” and said it would create more beachfront property, a comment he made in an interview with Elon Musk on X this year.\n\n“Climate change is real, reducing our impact is absolutely critical,” Walz said, pointing to clean energy development in America, such as a solar manufacturing plant in Minnesota, where he serves as governor.\n\n− Zac Anderson\n\nIn slow debate start, Walz mixes up Israel and Iran\n\nTim Walz got off to a slow start in the debate, accidentally referring to Iran as Israel and Israel as Iran in his first answer of the night, in response to a question about how he would advise the president if he were the last in the Situation Room on a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran.\n\n“Iran, or I uh, Israel’s ability to be able to defend itself, is fundamental,” he said early in the answer.\n\nMoments later, he said, “But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States” to steady leadership there.\n\nIran fired more than 200 missiles into Israel on Tuesday in retaliation for the death of Hezbollah commanders and in an escalation of tensions in the region, prompting the query.\n\nAsked the same question, JD Vance argued that Donald Trump brought “stability” to the world that deterred nations such as Iran from attacks.\n\n“It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe, and we should support our allies wherever they are when they’re fighting the bad guys,” he said of a preemptive strike.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHow long is the VP debate?\n\nVance and Walz's debate, which kicked off at 9 p.m. ET, is expected to last 90 minutes.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWalz hits Trump over age\n\nIt didn't take long for Walz to reference Trump's age − the first response to the first question.\n\nAsked if he would support a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran, Walz began talking about the presidential debate and said that \"a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.”\n\nTrump is actually 78, younger than Joe Biden, but you get the point.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nVance, Walz start debate with a handshake\n\nJD Vance and Tim Walz shook hands at the start of the debate, and the Ohio senator told the Minnesota governor \"good to meet you.\"\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDiet Dew advertises ahead of debate\n\nCBS News aired a commercial depicting a worker wheeling a cart of Diet Mountain Dew into what appeared to be the broadcast center where the debate is being held telling others nearby that \"they\" requested it. At the end of the ad, \"The VP debate starts soon\" flashed on screen.\n\nBoth candidates have expressed their love for the drink on the campaign trail.\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nTrump questions brain injuries of US soldiers in Iraq\n\nAs Vance made final preparations, Trump made headlines by appearing to denigrate military personnel with brain injuries.\n\nDuring a news conference in Milwaukee, a reporter asked the former president if he should have been tougher on Iran after more than 100 U.S. soldiers reported brain injuries after a 2020 missile strike on Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq.\n\nTrump began his reply by talking about the soldiers rather than Iran.\n\n\"First of all, injured?\" he said. \"What does injured mean? Injured means, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort?\"\n\n−David Jackson\n\nWhat happened during the Trump-Harris debate?\n\nHarris and Trump met for the first time during ABC News’ Sept. 10 debate. A national poll by the outlet found that 58% of Americans thought Harris won the debate in comparison to the 36% who felt she lost to Trump.\n\nThe pair shook hands when they walked out stage, but quickly began sparring over Project 2025 and who presents a threat to democracy.\n\nMemorable moments from the first debate included Harris defending abortion access and Trump pushing false claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nPete Buttigieg, Tom Emmer step in for Tim Walz and JD Vance debate prep\n\nTim Walz and JD Vance have been prepping for tonight’s debate with the help of some high-profile figures.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg helped out Walz by acting as Vance during mock debates and practice. It wasn’t his first time acting as a Republican vice presidential contender, either. Buttigieg played former Vice President Mike Pence during debate prep for Kamala Harris back in 2016.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer, R-M.N., stood in as Walz, his fellow Minnesotan, for Vance’s debate preparation sessions.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDonald Trump: JD Vance is 'a warrior'\n\nDonald Trump gave a pre-debate shout-out to JD Vance, telling reporters in Milwaukee that his running mate will do well because \"JD is very much a warrior.\"\n\nThe former president also said he gave Vance some advice: \"I said, 'JD, have a lot of fun.'\"\n\n–David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden to Tim Walz: ‘Coach, I got your back’\n\nPresident Joe Biden sent a note of support for Gov. Tim Walz ahead of his face-off with Sen. JD Vance for the vice presidential debate.\n\n“Coach, I got your back tonight!” Biden wrote in a post on X. “Tonight, America will see the strong, principled, and effective leader I’ve known for years—and the contrast you and Kamala provide against the other team.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Tuesday would not say whether the president will be watching the debate, saying that he will be “very, very busy” as his administration addresses Iran’s attack on Israel and the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\n“He has complete confidence in Tim Walz,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nForeign policy top of mind after Iran strike\n\nForeign policy will be front and center during Tuesday’s debate after Iran launched a major missile strike against Israel.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does look like we are getting closer and closer to WWIII,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said. “That is not good for anybody, forget your politics or anything else. So, what's your vision and what's the strategy around global conflict to bring about world peace?”\n\nAlready, Republicans are trying to paint the Biden and Harris administration as culpable for turmoil in the Middle East. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said the attack placed a renewed importance on national security – and she predicted it would be one of the moderators’ first questions.\n\n“That raises the stakes, and it also provides an opportunity for JD Vance to compare the peace through strength, and the peace – specifically in the Middle East – under President Trump, versus this chaos and catastrophe that we're seeing around the world,” Stefanik said.\n\n– Haley BeMiller\n\nGOP lawmaker criticizes Joe Biden's response to Helene devastation\n\nBoth Walz and Vance are widely expected to address the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene across parts of the Southeast. But another leader, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., criticized President Joe Biden’s leadership ahead of the debate as relief efforts continue.\n\n“I think if there is a concern, the concern is, frankly, is President Biden equipped at this point to lead the federal government at this very perilous time for people in North Carolina and Georgia, in the Panhandle in northern Florida, the Big Bend area and parts of South Carolina and Tennessee? These are serious questions that need to be asked and answered.”\n\nHe continued to tell reporters in the spin room: “And I think a key question for the Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris is ‘can Joe Biden do that job, since he's no longer running for the election?’”– Sam Woodward\n\nTrump changes his mind, turns down '60 Minutes' interview\n\nDonald Trump, who has said he will not debate Kamala Harris again, is also passing up another campaign tradition: A pre-election interview with CBS' \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"After initially accepting 60 Minutes’ request for an interview with Scott Pelley, former President Trump’s campaign has decided not to participate,\" the CBS program said in a statement posted on the X social media site.\n\nIn announcing an interview with Harris to air on Oct. 7, \"60 Minutes\" said: \"For over half a century, 60 Minutes has invited the Democratic and Republican tickets to appear on our broadcast as Americans head to the polls.\"\n\nIt added that \"our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands.\"\n\nAsked about the dispute, Trump told reporters in Milwaukee that the program owes him an apology over its coverage of Hunter Biden, particularly materials from his laptop. \"I've asked them for an apology,\" Trump said. \"Let's see if they do it.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTeachers show up to support Walz\n\nGloria Winograd, a music teacher in New York City of 40 years, celebrated the day of her retirement right outside the CBS studio hours before the vice presidential debate.\n\nWinograd, along with a crowd of other teachers who are part of the American Federation of Teachers, gathered around the front of the building in New York City at 4:30 p.m. to show their support for Harris and Walz.\n\nShe said she is terrified of Project 2025 and what's in the document created by a conservative think tank.. “Can you imagine if they get rid of the Department of Education” she said to NorthJersey.com.\n\nThe educator, who has been a part of the American Federation of Teachers for decades, thinks Harris and Walz is the best option for teachers because she said they are “reasonable people.” Over 100 people turned out for the teachers' rally outside the event to chant and listen to speakers. The group started dispersing around 5:15 p.m.\n\n– Lucas Frau\n\nCan JD Vance overcome gender gap among voters?\n\nJD Vance has faced scrutiny for his comments about women and families, including criticism of \"childless cat ladies.” But Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., disputed that he's a liability for the Trump campaign on Tuesday.\n\n\"JD Vance has talked about his personal story, about how important women have been in his life,\" the lawmaker told reporters in New York. \"When it comes to his grandmother to help him set his goals. When it comes to his wife, Usha, who is incredibly well accomplished, graduated top of her class at Yale, is accomplished in her own right.\"\n\nTonight's debate, Stefanik said, is an \"an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about that.\"\n\nRecent polls in the swing states of Pennsylvania and Michigan found women overwhelmingly support Harris over Trump. Stefanik said the campaign has an advantage with male voters and is working to close the gender gap.\n\n\"I'm a believer, as the highest-ranking woman in Congress that all issues are women's issues – so economic issues, as well as border issues, as well as issues related to IVF,” she said.\n\n– Haley BeMiller\n\nWhat are the debate rules?\n\nThe candidates’ microphones will remain live during the debate, even when it is their opponent’s turn to speak, CBS News announced. The live microphones mark a departure from ABC News’ debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump whose microphones were muted when they faced off Sept. 10.\n\nLike the presidential debate, CBS News announced that there will be no live audience for the showdown between Vance and Walz. The network also said the candidates will stand for the event although vice-presidential hopefuls typically sit for their debate.\n\nBoth will be given two minutes to answer questions they will not receive ahead of time and two minutes to respond. They will each be given the opportunity to make a closing statement. Neither will be allowed pre-written notes or props.\n\n– Rachel Barber and Joey Garrison\n\nWalz may have been in Nebraska, not China, during Tiananmen Square protests: Reports\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz's time in China could be a point of contention during Tuesday's vice presidential debate in New York, particularly after recent reports alleged that he may have been misleading about being in the East Asian country around the time of the deadly Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.\n\nWalz has previously stated that he traveled to China for a teaching position in 1989, weeks before the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. He even recalled his time in the country during a 2014 Congressional-Executive Commission on China hearing honoring the 25th anniversary of the protests.\n\nDiscrepancies in Walz's account of his travels arose when the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news publication, shared conflicting reports placing the governor in Nebraska around the time of the protests.\n\nThe Alliance (Neb.) Times-Herald featured a photo of Walz touring a Nebraska National Guard storeroom on May 16, 1989. The photo's caption says Walz \"will take over the job\" of staffing the storeroom from a retiring guardsman and \"will be moving to Alliance,\" Nebraska, CNN reported.\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse\n\nWhat time is the debate? ET to CT, MT and PT\n\nLet's talk time zones. The vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz kicks off at 9 p.m. ET. That's 8 p.m. CT, 7 p.m. MT and 6 p.m. PT.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is Tim Walz? What to know about the Minnesota governor\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz, 60, is Minnesota’s governor.\n\nThe outspoken Midwestern statesman is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party who was elected to run the state in 2018 and won reelection in 2022.\n\nWalz was born in Nebraska in 1964 and moved to Minnesota in 1996. Before he entered politics, Walz served in the Army National Guard and worked as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nA moderate Democrat, he was elected to represent a red Minnesota district in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006. He was the ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee for two years and served in the chamber until he was inaugurated governor in 2019.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWho is JD Vance? What to know about the senator, 'Hillbilly Elegy' author\n\nJD Vance is Donald Trump’s running mate and a Republican senator from Ohio. Vance, who served in the Marines, was elected in 2022 with no prior political experience. Still, he has garnered plenty of name recognition from his 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nThe book, later turned into a Netflix feature film, detailed Vance’s journey from a childhood riddled by drug addiction and abuse to Ohio State University, and a Yale Law School degree that opened doors for him in Silicon Valley.\n\n– Rachel Barber and Haley BeMiller\n\nTrump name-calls Walz in hours before the debate\n\nTrump's personal insults against his Democratic rivals hit a new low Monday when he described Walz as a \"moron.\"\n\nThe latest rhetoric from the ex-president – who this past weekend called Harris \"mentally impaired\" – came as he argued that tonight's debate will be \"rigged\" against his running mate, Vance.\n\nTrump has long attacked Walz for his description of him and Vance: \"Weird.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCalm before the storm\n\nHours before JD Vance and Tim Walz are set to go head-to-head in their only scheduled debate, a small number of protestors lined the sidewalk out of CBS Studios in New York City. Around 40 pro-Harris demonstrators gathered holding signs and chanting for the vice president and the Minnesota governor.\n\nDown the block, a handful of pro-Trump supporters stood with signs and flags, including the Israeli flag and calling for peace in the Middle East.\n\nA police and security presence is growing as the clock ticks to 9 p.m. ET and politicians head to the Manhattan studio to defend their party's VP pick.\n\n– Sam Woodward\n\nUsha Vance is a 'spirit guide' to husband JD Vance and has evolved with him on Donald Trump\n\nJD Vance's criticisms of professional women – as childless cat ladies or “miserable” women who prioritize career over children – might suggest his own spouse would be a model traditional housewife.\n\nInstead, Usha Vance is a model high-achieving child of Indian immigrants.\n\nUsha Vance was one of the top students at Yale Law School (according to classmates) where she met her future husband, JD, now the junior senator from Ohio and Donald Trump's running mate. She held prestigious clerkships and worked as a corporate litigator for a white-shoe firm until July.\n\nBut Usha Vance is also a bit of an enigma to those who have followed her evolution from registered Democrat to reportedly believing Trump was responsible for inciting the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, to now potentially becoming the second lady.\n\nRead more here.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nWho are the debate moderators?\n\n“CBS Evening News” managing editor and anchor Norah O’Donnell, and “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan will moderate Tuesday's debate. Brennan is also the network’s chief foreign affairs correspondent.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nPre-debate, former presidents wish Jimmy Carter a happy 100th birthday\n\nAs they wait for the vice presidential debate, political observers across the world are pausing to honor former President Jimmy Carter on his 100th birthday – including most of his living successors.\n\nThe Carter Center, which has been posting video tributes to the 39th president all day, included statements by former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\n\"Mr. President, you've always been a moral force for our nation and the world,\" Biden said in a video featuring excerpts from ex-presidents - most of them.\n\nNot appearing in the video: Donald Trump.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCan I watch the debate without cable?

Viewers can also watch the event live on USA TODAY’s YouTube channel.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\n'I think he'll do well': JD Vance's old grocery store boss says ahead of VP debate\n\nMore than two decades before he was a vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance was a cashier in Ohio at Middletown's Dillman Foods.\n\nVance's stint as a 17-year-old grocery clerk influenced his political views. He wrote in \"Hillbilly Elegy\" that observing the habits of rich and poor shoppers and seeing how people \"gamed the welfare system\" with food stamps first made him realize liberal policies \"weren't all they were cracked up to be.\"\n\nSteve Dillman, Vance's boss at the grocery store, said Vance was a quiet, nice, typical teenager. When asked how he thinks Vance will perform in tonight's debate, he told The Enquirer: \"I think he'll do well.\"\n\n\"He was a neighbor kid from a neighbor family,\" said Dillman, who knew Vance's grandparents. \"He was a good employee. He was honest. He was dependable. He was always in a good mood. He was, fortunately for me, someone I didn't have to babysit.\"\n\n– Victoria Moorwood\n\nB-I-N-G-O!

It is unclear how many activists were arrested.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nPresidential polls today: Where do Harris, Trump stand in the polls?\n\nKamala Harris narrowly leads Donald Trump in most national and swing state polls.

Who is hosting the vice presidential debate tonight?\n\nCBS News is hosting the VP debate. The outlet originally proposed four dates to the candidates. Both accepted the invitation to debate Oct. 1.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCatch up before you tune in\n\nVance and Walz are set to take the stage at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Before they face off, here’s what to know.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNational and global backdrop for tonight's debate\n\nTuesday's debate comes days after Hurricane Helene made landfall, wreaking havoc in the Southeastern states, with many Appalachian residents still in the process of recovery.\n\nHelene’s death toll reached at least 100 on Monday, and hundreds of people are still missing. As of this morning, 1.5 million homes remain without power.\n\nTrump made a visit to Valdosta, Georgia, Monday, and Biden is expected to travel to hard-hit North Carolina on Wednesday.\n\nWalz said Monday he had been in touch with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and \"our hearts are just breaking.\" Vance and Walz may also address the disaster while on stage tonight.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, hours before the candidates are set to take the stage in New York, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel.\n\nThe attack follows Israel’s aggressive airstrikes and limited ground raids against the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow Vance, Walz are prepping for the debate\n\nVance and Walz are expected to face off in New York in what could be one of the most high-stakes VP debates in history - and both candidates are taking their prep very seriously.\n\nWalz has been focusing on cross-country campaigning while the governor and core staff have been informally prepping for the debate between stops. Formal work started this past week, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg playing Vance during mock sessions, according to a source familiar with their efforts.\n\nWalz took a walk through downtown Petoskey on Monday and toured several local stores with his wife and daughter as a short break from debate prep.\n\nHouse Republican Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has played Walz during mock sessions with Vance, according to ABC News.\n\n\"I've known Tim probably since he was first elected almost 20 years ago, and I worked with him directly for four years, I spent the last month just going back, all of his old stuff, to get his phrases down, his mannerisms, that sort of thing,\" Emmer said in an interview with \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. \"My job was to be able to play Tim Walz so JD Vance knows what he's going to see.\"\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi, Sam Woodward and Karly Graham\n\nTrump plans to blog the debate\n\nThe Vance-Walz debate will draw a ton of running commentary on social media, including from one particularly biased source: Trump.\n\n\"I will be doing a personal PLAY BY PLAY of the Debate,\" Trump said on his Truth Social account, though he made clear he's already decided the winner.\n\nTrump cast the contest as one between the \"Brilliant\" Vance and the \"Highly Inarticulate\" Walz.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat time will Vance and Walz debate?\n\nThe debate between the Ohio senator and Minnesota governor is scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Oct. 1.

Inside the VP face off between JD Vance and ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Republican JD Vance entered Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate with Democrat Tim Walz hoping to avoid a repeat of Donald Trump’s disastrous debate performance against Kamala Harris last month in Philadelphia.\n\nOn that score, Vance clearly succeeded during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York.\n\nVance did what Trump was unable to do by delivering a debate performance that mostly avoided the verbal missteps and the outrageous outbursts that characterized the GOP presidential nominee’s performance in his faceoff with Harris three weeks ago in Philadelphia.\n\nVance appeared to have an edge over Walz in terms of poise and command of policy.\n\nVance is a Republican senator from Ohio, but the debate likely marked the first time that many voters had seen him perform on the national stage. He used some of his answer to the first question of the night to introduce himself to voters, reminding them that he grew up in a middle-class background and went to college on the GI bill after serving in Iraq.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhat's true?

Sign up for USA TODAY's Checking the Facts newsletter.\n\nWho is JD Vance?7 facts about Donald Trump's running mate\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota, seemed to get off on the wrong foot right from the start when he mixed up Iran and Israel when asked about how he would advise the president on a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran.\n\n“Iran, or I, uh, Israel’s ability to be able to defend itself is fundamental,” he said initially. Moments later he said “the expansion of Israel and its proxies” is a fundamental necessity for the United States to steady leadership there.\n\nOther times, Walz seemed nervous and unsure of himself. He spoke so rapidly at times that he stumbled over his words.\n\nThe two candidates met on the debate stage in New York as polls show a close election with just 35 days to go. Most national polls give Harris and Walz a small lead nationally, but the race remains a tossup in several of the swing states that will determine the winner.\n\nHarris and Trump debated each other last month in Philadelphia, a faceoff that Harris was widely regarded as having won. Harris has been pushing Trump to agree to another debate later this month, but so far, he has been reluctant to commit to a rematch.\n\nTuesday’s event between Walz and Vance is the only scheduled debate between the vice-presidential nominees – and could possibly be the last debate of the presidential race.\n\nWho is Tim Walz?10 facts about Kamala Harris' VP pick\n\nEven before the nominees took the stage, the Harris campaign tried to lower expectations for Walz, who reportedly claimed to be a bad debater and was nervous about how he would perform. Trump, on the other hand, seemed to raise expectations for Vance.\n\n“He’s going up against a moron. A total moron,” Trump said during an interview with Kellyanne Conway, who managed his campaign in 2016 and worked as his senior adviser in the White House.\n\nDuring the 1½ hour debate, both candidates found themselves on the defensive.\n\nWalz was asked to explain why he has said he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in spring 1989. Recently unearthed news reports indicate he was still in Nebraska, his home state, and headed to China to teach high school in August 1989, several months after the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\nWalz stumbled as he tried to explain the discrepancy, eventually saying he misspoke and calling himself “a knucklehead” at times. “I can get caught up in the rhetoric,” he said.\n\nVance was put on the defensive over his past criticism of Trump, who he once suggested might be “America’s Hitler,” and over his false claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating cats and dogs.\n\nVP debate:6 important things to watch at the Tim Walz-JD Vance debate\n\n“I was wrong about Donald Trump,” Vance said, blaming what he called dishonest media reports that he said had distorted Trump’s record.\n\nVance repeatedly questioned why Harris hasn’t already implemented many of the policies she is advocating as a presidential candidate, given that she has been the vice president for more than three years.\n\nPresidents, not the vice president, set an administration’s policy. But Vance frequently referred to Harris’ “wide open southern border” and said some of her economic plans sound “pretty good” – but that she could have already enacted them if she wanted.\n\n“If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion,” he said. “The fact that she isn’t, tells you about how much you can trust her actual plans.”\n\nVance dodged when asked about Trump continuing to push false claims that he won the 2020 election and about the Jan. 6 mob attack on the Capitol by a group of Trump supporters trying to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory.\n\nVance said he and Republicans want to focus on the future and accused Democrats of trying to censor the speech of people criticizing the election system.\n\nWalz countered that the threat to democracy is real and warned that Trump and his allies are \"laying the groundwork\" for more protests and another attempt to overthrow the election if they lose in November.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

He has seen his poll numbers nosedive since receiving the VP nomination.\n\nAn Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey released this month finds about half of registered voters have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Vance, compared with the roughly 3 in 10 voters who have a negative view of Walz.\n\nAs of late, he has been scorched by liberal critics for spreading unfounded claims about Haitian migrants eating pets in his state and past comments criticizing childless Americans.\n\nAs Walz has taken the national stage, he has tried to position himself as Vice President Kamala Harris' plainspoken messenger whose energetic and quick-witted style caught voters' attention after he dubbed the GOP \"weird\" in the weeks before he was put on the ticket.\n\nThe Minnesota governor, however, isn't without weaknesses that Vance could exploit in an effort to show that the Democratic ticket is too liberal, namely Walz's progressive record since taking office in St. Paul in January 2019. He has faced similar scrutiny for making misleading statements, such as embellishing parts of his past military service record and criticism from conservatives on how he handled the 2020 riots after George Floyd died at the hands of police in Minneapolis.\n\nWith early voting underway and another presidential debate unlikely, here's what to look for ahead of Tuesday's showdown.\n\nHot mics allowed\n\nHow Walz and Vance interact − handshake, eye rolls, cross-talk bickering − will depend in part on the debate rules, and a significant difference from the Harris-Trump faceoff will be CBS News allowing hot microphones.\n\nThe Harris campaign wanted a rule change from the June debate on CNN between President Joe Biden and Trump by having the mics turned on even when a candidate was not speaking.\n\nMany political observers thought the reason Harris wanted this during the September presidential debate hosted by ABC News was to catch Trump in a viral moment. Harris' team ultimately folded to have the mics be muted when a candidate is not speaking.\n\nUnder these conditions, CBS News is reserving the right to mute either candidates' microphones, but otherwise every word between the two will be heard by the viewing audience.\n\nHaitian migrants and the immigration fight\n\nVance's stiffest questions from the moderators, CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, could stem from his willingness to spread unfounded rumors about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, eating household pets.\n\nThe small city has been thrust into the national spotlight and faced threats in recent weeks, but thus far the Republican senator has been unapologetic about publicly airing the claims, which include that Haitians are causing tuberculosis and HIV to rise in the area. He maintains it is about bringing attention to voters' concerns about immigration to the forefront even in the face of threatening calls and bomb threats in the area and racist rants by members of Congress.\n\n\"Kamala Harris calls anyone a racist if they complain about her open border,\" Vance said in a Sept. 23 post on X.\n\n\"You're not a bad person for wanting to stop the flow of mass illegal immigration and deadly fentanyl,\" he added. \"Americans who want a secure border have nothing to be ashamed of, but Kamala Harris sure does.\"\n\nWalz and his military service record\n\nOne area Walz might be vulnerable to attacks are questions around his 24 years of service in the National Guard.\n\nIn 2018, Walz spoke in favor of stricter gun laws after a mass shooting in Florida by asserting how the firearms used in that incident were similar to the weapons he \"carried in war.\"\n\nBut the Democratic governor was never deployed for combat, and he dodged a question about this misleading claim during his first sit-down interview since earning the VP nomination with CNN.\n\nThe Harris campaign later told USA TODAY that Walz \"misspoke\" in 2018 before defending how he did \"handle weapons of war\" while in the guard.\n\nVance, a retired Marine and Iraq War veteran, has accused Walz of ducking deployment by strategically retiring to run for Congress before his unit was called up in 2005.\n\nWalz's unit received its alert order to mobilize for Iraq in July 2005, which was about two months after he had retired. But he appeared to know as early as March 2005 that his battalion could be sent to Iraq, according to past press statements.\n\nInstead of responding, Walz has thanked Vance for his service on the campaign trail – but how he responds on the debate stage will be telling should he be pressed on the topic.\n\nTwo versions of the American everyman\n\nCall it the everyman debate, but much of the 2024 campaign has been about the gender divide and the two campaigns' dueling views on the role men play in U.S. society that are embodied by their respective VP picks.\n\nVance, in particular, has been at the center of this discussion mostly for his comments describing women without biological children as \"childless cat ladies\" who have \"no direct stake\" in America.\n\nYounger women are far more liberal than in years past, polling shows, and Harris often says the 2024 election is a referendum on the loss of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. in 2022.\n\nHer campaign isn't subtle about it. It used actor Sam Elliott in an ad encouraging men to \"be a man and vote for a woman,\" and it held a livestreamed town hall hosted by Oprah Winfrey that was reminiscent of her hit talk show, which made her an icon among female viewers.\n\nWalz, similarly, has positioned himself and been lauded by Harris supporters as the caring \"coach\" or protective \"dad in plaid,\" a foil to those who would deny women reproductive rights.\n\nThe Trump campaign, on the other hand, has been heavily courting younger male voters since the GOP convention.\n\nThe former president often appears at male-centered events, such as UFC fights with singer Kid Rock, and joining podcasts hosted by figures such as influencer Logan Paul, comedian Theo Von and online streamer Adin Ross.\n\nA survey by Blueprint, a Democratic polling firm, released findings this past week showing 55% of men think the Democratic Party has \"moved too far to the left.\"\n\n\"What really seems to be pushing them away from the Democratic Party are economic issues,\" said Evan Ross Smith, the pollster who did the survey. \"Men seem to be just drifting rightward on things like tax cuts and and all sorts of economic things where they just don't think the Democratic Party can can deliver as much anymore.\"\n\nThat plays out in how men and women view Harris' and Trump's running mates too, the survey finds.\n\nOf the roughly 1,200 men polled, Vance's net favorable ratings broke even, while Walz had a negative 4% rating, the poll shows. Among the approximately 580 female respondents, Vance had a negative 15% net favorable versus Walz, who held a positive 17% net favorable.\n\nAndrew T. Walker, a professor of Christian ethics and public theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said Vance in particular will be expected to defend the traditional family and gender roles in a way that doesn’t offend but also push back at language around \"toxic masculinity\" that he said a portion of men resent.\n\n\"There is a male population that feels like they have been told that they are the problem of society,\" Walker said. \"And (Vance) is trying to tap into this of silent male majority that feels elite cosmopolitan liberalism or progressivism has tried to scapegoat and accuse them of being guilty of all of these social crimes and social sins.\"\n\nLinking ‘Hillbilly’ bio to Harris record, economic concerns\n\nVance's chief goal will be casting the Democratic ticket too far to the left on a host of issues, namely inflation and illegal immigration.\n\nPart of that will be calling out Harris for changing her position on key issues but also anchoring the incumbent vice president to the Biden administration's record, especially by convincing poor and working-class voters that they were better off four years ago when Trump was in the White House.\n\nRowland, the debate expert, said that rather than launching into attacks at the outset, the senator's own life story, covered in-depth in Vance's bestselling book, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" could provide a softer approach that works in the first exchanges.\n\n\"Vance was picked in large part because of his biography and his narrative of overcoming poverty and familial dysfunction through hard work,\" he said.\n\nVance is expected to call out Walz, like Harris, as someone who has pretended to be a moderate while leading one of the most liberal states in the country. His mission is to do that while also avoiding his own gaffes.\n\n“Vance needs to not come across as weird and stay out of the 'Whoa, that dude is stuck in 1950' on social issues,\" Republican consultant Liz Mair said.\n\nWarning of Trump's return but fleshing out Harris' goals\n\nWalz is largely expected to frame the 2024 election as most Democrats have this year: as a last chance to halt Trump from returning to the White House.\n\nRepeatedly on social media, the governor ties the GOP nominee to the Project 2025 plan, written by the Heritage Foundation with help from more than 100 other conservative groups.\n\nBut what Walz is expected to do most on Tuesday is help Harris flesh out her agenda for voters who are still unsure about her goals and specific policy prescriptions.\n\nDemocratic strategist Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, said Walz may have a more difficult task than Vance in that regard.\n\n\"He does have to play to a much broader audience and set of voters because they are trying to build a new coalition,\" she said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Walz has managed to combine strong attacks against Trump and portray himself as a caring everyman by his skillful use of humor as a strategy.\n\nRowland said he expects the Minnesota Democrat to outline how Harris cares about ordinary people and explain how her policies would actually work while portraying Trump as someone \"who never cared about anyone but himself.\"\n\n\"Given his affable persona, I think there is less risk of Walz saying something truly horrible that shifts public opinion of him,\" Rowland said.\n\n\"But one reason debates are interesting is their unpredictability,\" he added. \"Either candidate could say something egregious that ends up shifting the race.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/02/full-transcript-vice-presidential-debate/75479146007/", "title": "Read the full transcript of the vice presidential debate between JD ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - Ohio Sen.

I'm Norah O'Donnell and thank you for joining us for tonight's CBS news vice presidential debate. We want to welcome our viewers on CBS, on other networks here in the US and around the world. We have a consequential night ahead, and our focus is the issues that matter to you, the voter. Let's introduce the candidates: Minnesota's democratic governor Tim Walz and Ohio's republican senator JD Vance. Tonight, meeting for the first time.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan. In order to have a thoughtful and civil debate, these are the rules that both campaigns have agreed to. Questions will be directed at one candidate who will have two minutes to respond. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes for rebuttal. Then each candidate will get another minute to make further points, with an additional 1 minute each at the discretion of the moderator. The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact check claims made by each other.\n\nNORAH O' DONNELL: CBS news reserves the right to mute the candidates microphones to maintain decorum. We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns. The stage is set. Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. Let's get started. Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises. The Middle East is on the brink of war. Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene and now a labor strike as 25,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing. We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel. But that attack failed thanks to joint US and Israeli defensive action. President Biden has deployed more than 40,000 US military personnel and assets to that region over the past year to try to prevent a regional war. Iran is weakened, but the US still considers it the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it has drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon. It is down now to one or two weeks time. Governor Walz, if you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining at home tonight. Let's keep in mind where this started. October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners. Iran, or, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute, fundamental necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today, where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack. But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment. But it's not just that. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. His Chief of Staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed humanity being he’d ever met. And both of his Secretaries of Defense and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he’s unfit for the highest office. That was Senator Vance. What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed. And as the Vice President said today, is we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, the same question, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: So, Margaret, I want to answer the question. First of all, thanks, Governor. Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate. And thanks most importantly to the American people who are watching this evening and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this Vice Presidential debate. I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are. I was raised in a working class family. My mother required food assistance for periods of her life. My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me. And she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life. I went to college on the GI bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in Iraq. And so I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams. And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable. I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again. Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States’ global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world. Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who… we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in in the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. And when Iranian missiles did fall near US troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April. Both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong, and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, the US did have a diplomatic deal with Iran to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program, and President Trump did exit that deal. He recently said just five days ago, the US must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran because the consequences are impossible. Did he make a mistake? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word, but I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary. You, yourself, just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. And, Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump, who has been the Vice President for the last three and a half years, and the answer is your running mate, not mine. Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure. Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now, and you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world. Donald Trump has already done it once before. Ask yourself at home, when, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American President didn't have a major conflict, breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was President.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, we have a lot to get to. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Margaret, thank you. Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene. The storm could become one of the deadliest on record. More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing. Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall. Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, seven in ten Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the US taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Sure. So first of all, let's start with the hurricane because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy. I just saw today, actually, a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six year old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives. And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them. And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild. I mean, these are communities that I love, some of them I know very personally. In Appalachia, all across the Southeast, they need their government to do their job. And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster. And Norah, you asked about climate change. I think this is a very important issue. Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true. Well, if you believe that, what would you, what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world. What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to? More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world. When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening. Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane, and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the Governors. I serve as co-chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements. Governors know no partisanship. They work together to… all of the Governors and the emergency responders are on the ground. Those happen on the front end. The federal government comes in, makes sure they're there, that we recover. But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused. Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen. Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past, Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in. What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration is, we've seen this investment, we've seen massive investments, the biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, has created jobs all across the country. Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio. Taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here. Two hundred thousand jobs across the country. The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sits in Minnesota. But my farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods, back to back. But what they're doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, “Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind.” We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We're also producing more clean energy. So the solution for us is to continue to move forward, that climate change is real. Reducing our impact is absolutely critical. But this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country. That's exactly what this administration has done. We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current. And that's what absolutely makes sense. And then we start thinking about, “How do we mitigate these disasters?”\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Senator. I want to give you an opportunity to respond there. The Governor mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, look, what the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing. So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this. If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies. Now, something Governor Walz said, I think is important to touch upon, because when we talk about “clean energy,” I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here. I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership. And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make the economy dirtier. We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America.\n\nTIM WALZ: We are. In Minnesota.\n\nJD VANCE: Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the components that go into those solar panels. So if you really want to make the environment cleaner, you've got to invest in more energy production. We haven't built a nuclear facility, I think one, in the past 40 years. Natural gas. We got to invest more in it. Kamala Harris has done the opposite. That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing worse by the climate.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor, would you like to respond?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have. There's no moratorium on that. We're producing more oil. But the folks know, and my… like I said, again, these are not liberal folks. These are not folks that are green, new deal folks. These are farmers that have been, drought one year, massive flooding the next year. They understand that it makes sense. Look, our number one export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms. We saw it in Minnesota this summer. And thinking about, “How do we respond to that?” we're thinking ahead on this and what Kamala Harris has been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things. The infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future. How do we make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines? How do we make sure that we're protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of. But to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign and I'll let you do whatever you want. We can be smarter about that. And an all above energy policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate. Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. We're going to turn now to immigration. The crisis at the US-Mexico border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters. Senator Vance, your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the US military to do so. Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work? For example, would you deport parents who have entered the US illegally and separate them from any of their children who were born on US soil? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: So first of all, Margaret, before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, decriminalizing illegal aliens, massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates. And what it's meant is that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country. I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction and has gotten clean. I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels. So you've got to stop the bleeding. You've got to re-implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations. And that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do? So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks, and then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work. And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation. Right now in this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost. Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris’s wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, “You know what? I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.” I wish that she would do that, it would be good for all of us.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, do you care to respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the Vice President is, quote, “letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things…”\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … regarding children?\n\nTIM WALZ: The drug mule is not true. But I will say about this, about the fentanyl, because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis. And the good news on this is the last twelve months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history, 30% decrease in Ohio. But there's still more work to do. But let's go back to this on immigration. Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of the largest state and a border state in California. She's the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions. But look, we all want to solve this. Most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the Border Patrol Agents, that's the Chamber of Commerce. That's most Americans out here. That's why we had the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation’s seen. It was crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford. I know him. He's super conservative, but he's a man of principle, wants to get it done. Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation. The Border Patrol said, this is what we need in here. These are the experts. And the Chamber of Commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, pass this thing. Kamala Harris helped get there. Fifteen hundred new border agents, detection for drugs, DOJ money to speed up these adjudications on this. Just what America wants. But as soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said “No,” told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue. It gives him, what would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things? And they need to be done by the legislature. You can't just do this through the executive branch. So, look, we have the options to do this. Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big, beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime. But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator, dehumanizing people and telling them what he was going to do. As far as a deportation plan, at one point, Senator Vance said it was so unworkable as to be laughable. So that's where we're at. Pass the bill. She'll sign it.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, the question was, will you separate parents from their children, even if their kids are US citizens? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Margaret, my point is that we already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris’ open border. And I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules, I said that she enabled the Mexican drug cartels to operate freely in this country, and we know that they use children as drug mules, and it is a disgrace and it has to stop. Look, I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test. For three years, Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country. And now, now that she's running for President, or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the Vice President, when she became the appointed border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop, and it will when Donald Trump is President again.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, what about our CBS news polling, which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50%, support mass deportations?\n\nTIM WALZ: Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary. But the issue on this is this is what happens when you don't want to solve it. You demonize it. And we saw this, and Senator Vance, and it surprises me on this, talking about and saying, “I will create stories to bring attention to this.” That vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican Governor said, “It's not true. Don't do it.” There's consequences for this. There's consequences. We could come together. Senator Lankford did it. We could come together and solve this if we didn't let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue. And the consequences in Springfield were the Governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergarteners to school. I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this. But by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\n\nJD VANCE: Tim…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor. Governor, your time is up. Senator, I'll give you 1 minute, but let me just ask you the question first. The governor has made the point, and I think as a sitting lawmaker, you know that Congress controls the purse strings and any funding. So you have said repeatedly that Donald Trump would, through executive action, solve this. Do you disagree that Congress controls the purse strings and would need to support many of the changes that you would actually want to implement? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job. I've been to the southern border more than our Borders are, Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol Agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job. Of course, additional resources would help. But most of this is about the President and the Vice President empowering our law enforcement to say, “If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels.” Now, Governor Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield. Look, in Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border. It is a disgrace, Tim. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, you have 1 minute to respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, it is law enforcement that asked for the bill. They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was… that's because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything. On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree. It should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done. This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then you start to make a difference in this and you start to adhere to what we know. American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, “To the least amongst us, you do unto me.” I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded, it's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Governor. And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status. Norah.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Margaret, Margaret, I think it's important because…\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, senator. We have so much to get to.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: We're going to turn out of the economy. Thank you.\n\nJD VANCE: Margaret. The rules were that you guys were going to fact check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on. So there's an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\n\nJD VANCE: That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. And Kamala Harris opened up that pathway.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to.\n\nTIM WALZ: Those laws have been in the book since 1990.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen. We want to have -\n\nTIM WALZ: The CBP app has not been on the books since 1990. It's something that Kamala Harris created, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret. The economy is a top concern for voters. Each of your campaigns has released an economic plan, so let's talk about the specifics. Governor Walz, Vice President Harris unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing and a renewed child tax credit. The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by $1.2 trillion. How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit? Governor, I'll give you two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Thank you. And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's where we come from. We both grew up in that. We understand. So those of you out there listening tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth. And it's good. It's healthy. That's what this is supposed to happen. You should be listening. “How's this going to impact me?” The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is, one, is talking about this housing issue. The one thing is there's 3 million new houses proposed under this plan with down payment assistance on the front end. To get you in a house. A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It's foundational to where you're at. And then making sure that the things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's fairness in that. Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin. They were charging $800 before this law went into effect. As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, 12% more houses in Minneapolis, prices went down on rent, 4%. It's working. And then making sure tax cuts go to the middle class, $6,000 child tax credit. We have one in Minnesota, reduces childhood poverty by a third. We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families and then getting businesses off the ground. The law, as it stands right now, is $5,000 tax credit for small business, increasing that to $50,000. Now, this is a philosophical difference between us. Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this. He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago. He said, “You're rich as hell. I'm going to give you a tax cut.” He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top caste. What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever. Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in. Everyone agrees, including businesses. It would be destabilizing it. It would increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession. Look, this is simple for you. Where are we going? Kamala Harris has said to do the things she wants to do. We'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. When you do that, our system works best. More people are participating in it, and folks have the things that they need.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, I want to give you a moment to respond on that. But similarly, the Wharton School has done an analysis of the Trump plan and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion. My question is the same for you. How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, you're going to hear a lot from Tim Walz this evening, and you just heard it in the answer, a lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it. Because she's been the Vice President for three and a half years, she had the opportunity to enact all of these great policies. And what she's actually done instead is drive the cost of food higher by 25%, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60%, open the American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. And the fact that she isn't, tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans. Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record. A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans, and they have PhDs, but they don't have common sense and they don't have wisdom, because Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take home pay in a generation in this country, 1.5% inflation, and to boot, peace and security all over the world. So when people say that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say “Look at the record he delivered: rising take home pay for American workers.” Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the Trump tax cuts. But if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017, and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country. That is a record that I'm proud to run on and we're going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again. I know a lot of you are struggling. I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills. It's going to stop when Donald Trump brings back common sense to this country.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, do you want to respond to that? What has Kamala Harris done for the middle class?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Yeah, well, Kamala Harris’ day one was Donald Trump's failure on COVID that led to the collapse of our economy. We were already before COVID, in a manufacturing recession. But 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great Depression, 9 million jobs closed on that. That was day one. Whether it was the Infrastructure Act or other things, we moved. Now, you made a question about experts, said this, I made a note of this. “Economists don’t, can’t be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted.” Look, if you're going to be President, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does. My pro tip of the day is this, if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump. And the same thing goes with this and I ask you out there, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, whatever, how is it fair that you're paying your taxes every year and Donald Trump hasn't paid any Federal Tax 10 to last 15 years, in the last year as President? That's what's wrong with the system. There's a way around it. And he's bragged about that. We're just asking for fairness in it, and that's all you want.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: You have a minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Governor, you say trust the experts, but those same experts for 40 years said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that. They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere, it would make the middle class stronger. They were wrong about that. They were wrong about the idea that if we made America less self-reliant, less productive in our own Nation, that it would somehow make us better off. And they were wrong about it. And for the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, we're not doing it anymore. We're bringing American manufacturing back. We're unleashing American energy. We're going to make more of our own stuff. And this isn't just an economic issue. I mean, I've got three beautiful little kids at home: seven, four and two. And I love them very much. And I hope they're in bed right now. But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our children are manufactured by nations that hate us. This has to stop. And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts. We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump governed on.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor Walz, can you address that? I mean, voters say they trust Donald Trump on the economy more. Why?\n\nTIM WALZ: If you're listening tonight, and you want billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what the numbers were. Look, I'm a union guy on this. I'm not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand that, look, we produce soybeans and corn. We need to have fair trading partners. That's something that we believe in. I think the thing that most concerns me on this is, is Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China. So the rhetoric is good. Much of what the senator said right there, I'm in agreement with him on this. I watched it happen, too. I watched it in my communities and we talked about that. But we had people undercutting the right to collectively bargain. We had right to work states made it more difficult. We had companies that were willing to ship it over, and we saw people profit. Folks that, folks that are venture capital, in some cases, putting money into companies that were overseas, we're in agreement that we bring those home. The issue is Donald Trump is talking about it. Kamala Harris has a record. Two hundred fifty thousand more manufacturing jobs just out of the IRA.\n\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Yes.\n\nJD VANCE: So, appreciate that. So if you notice, what Governor Walz just did is he said, “First of all, Donald Trump has to listen to the experts.” And then when he acknowledged that the experts screwed up, he said, well, “Donald Trump didn't do nearly as good of a job as the statistics show that he did.”\n\nTIM WALZ: No, that's a gross generalization.\n\nJD VANCE: So what Tim Walz is doing. And I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay. Which, of course, he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which, of course, he did. And then you've simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense, economic principles.\n\nTIM WALZ: I hope we have a conversation on health care then.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator. Governor.\n\nJD VANCE: Please.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to ahead, gentlemen, on many topics. But right now I want to talk about personal qualifications. The Vice President is often the last voice the President hears before making consequential decisions. We want to ask you about your leadership qualities, Governor Walz. You said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew up in small, rural Nebraska, town of 400. Town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China, 35 years ago, be able to do that. I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. The issue for that was, was to try and learn. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They, look, I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for twelve years. And in Congress I was one of the most bipartisan people. Working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits. And then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice. So look, my commitment has been from the beginning, to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this right. I will say more than anything, many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life. I learned a lot about China. I hear the critiques of this. I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us. I guarantee you he wouldn't be praising Xi Jinping about COVID. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing. So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is. My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?\n\nTIM WALZ: No. All I said on this was, is, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest, went in, and from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, governor. Senator Vance, in 2016, you called your running mate, Donald Trump, unfit for the nation's highest office, and you said he could be America's Hitler. I know you've said, you've been asked many times, and you've said you regret those comments and explained, you then voted for Donald Trump in 2020. But the Washington Post reported new messages last week in which you also disparaged Trump's economic record while he was President. Writing to someone in 2020, quote, “Trump thoroughly failed to deliver his economic populism.” You're now his running mate, and you've shifted many of your policy stances to align with his. If you become Vice President, why should Americans trust that you will give Donald Trump the advice he needs to hear, and not just the advice he wants to hear? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, because I've always been open and sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the President, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans. A secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it. It's one of the reasons, Margaret, why I've done so many interviews is because I think it's important to actually explain to the American people where I come down on the issues and what changed. Now you pointed out to messages from 2020. Margaret, I've been extremely consistent that I think there were a lot of things that we could have done better in the Trump administration the first round, if Congress was doing its job. I strongly believe, and I've been a United States Senator, that Congress is not just a high-class debating society. It's not just a forum for senators and congressmen to whine about problems. It's a forum to govern. So there were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they governed the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern. And I want to talk about this tariff issue in particular, Margaret, because, you know, Tim just accused this of being a national sales tax. Look, the one thing, and you're not probably surprised to hear me praising Joe Biden, but the one thing that Joe Biden did is he continued some of the Trump tariffs that protected American manufacturing jobs. And it's the one issue, the most pro worker part of the Biden administration. It's the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden's record. Think about this. If you're trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you're going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you're not accessing our markets unless you're paying middle class Americans a fair wage.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Norah.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. Now to the issue of reproductive rights. Governor Walz, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, you signed a bill into law that made Minnesota one of the least restrictive states in the nation when it comes to abortion. Former President Trump said in the last debate that. You believe abortion, quote, in the 9th month is absolutely fine. Yes or no? Is that what you support? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: That's not what the bill says. But look, this issue is what's on everyone's mind. Donald Trump put this all into motion. He brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe versus Wade, 52 years of personal autonomy. And then he tells us, oh, we send it to the states. It's a beautiful thing. Amanda Zaworski would disagree with you on it's a beautiful thing. A young bride in Texas waiting for their child at 18 weeks. She has a complication, a tear in the membrane. She needs to go in. The medical care at that point needs to be decided by the doctor. And that would have been an abortion. But in Texas, that would have put them in legal jeopardy. She went home, got sepsis, nearly dies, and now she may have difficulty having children. Or in Kentucky, Hadley Duvall, a twelve year old child raped and impregnated by her stepfather. Those are horrific. Now, when got asked about that, Senator Vance said, two wrongs don't make a right. There is no right in this. So in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe v. Wade. We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care. But look, this is not what, if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley, you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies. It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access to infertility treatments. For so many of you out there listening, me included, infertility treatments are why I have a child. That's nobody else's business. But those things are being proposed, and the catchall on this is, is, well, the states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works. This is basic human right. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, do you want to respond to the governor's claim? Will you create a federal pregnancy monitoring agency?\n\nJD VANCE: No, Norah, certainly we won't. And I want to talk about this issue because I know a lot of Americans care about it, and I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us. And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, would you like to respond and also answer the question about restrictions?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, the question got asked, and Donald Trump made the accusation that wasn't true about Minnesota. Well, let me tell you about this idea that there's diverse states. There's a young woman named Amber Thurmond. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography? There's a very real chance, had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade. When you listen to Vice President Harris talk about this subject, and you hear me talk about it, you hear us talking exactly the same. Donald Trump is trying to figure out how to get the political right of this. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vance said about what's happening. His running mate, though, does not. And that's the problem.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. Senator, let me ask you about that. He mentioned it was, I think, referring to a national ban. In the past, you have supported a Federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks. In fact, you said if someone can't support legislation like that, quote, you are making the United States the most barbaric pro-abortion regime anywhere in the entire world. My question is, why have you changed your position?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I never supported a national ban. I did during, when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial birth abortion ban in this, in place in this country at the federal level. I don't think anybody's trying to get rid of that, or at least I hope not, though I know that Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance. But, Norah, you know, one of the things that changed is in the state of Ohio, we had a referendum in 2023, and the people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position. And I think that what I learned from that, Norah, is that we've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women would love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships. And we have got to earn people's trust back. And that's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing pro-family policies. Making childcare more accessible, making fertility treatments more accessible, because we've got to do a better job at that. And that's what real leadership is.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, your response?\n\nTIM WALZ: I'm going to respond on the pro abortion piece of that. No, we're not. We're pro women. We're pro freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to not be that women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may be prosecuted for providing that care. And as far as making sure that we're educating our children and giving them options. Minnesota's a state with one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. We understand that, too. We know that the options need to be available, and we make that true. We also make it, we're a top three state for the best place to raise children. But these two things to try and say that we're pro-children but we don't like this or, or you guys are pro abortion, that's not the case at all. We are pro freedoms for women to make their choices. And we're going, and Kamala Harris is making the case to make options for children more affordable. A $6,000 child tax credit. But we're not going to base out on the backs of making someone like Amber Thurmond drive 600 miles to try and get health care.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator.\n\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that? First of all, Governor, I agree with you. Amber Thurmond should still be alive. And there are a lot of people who should still be alive, and I certainly wish that she was. And maybe, you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me, but as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion, where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion. That is, I think, whether it's not pro choice or pro abortion, that is fundamentally barbaric. And that's why I use that word, Norah, is because some of what we've seen, do you want to force catholic hospitals to perform abortions against their will? Because Kamala Harris has supported suing catholic nuns to violate their freedom of conscience? We can be a big and diverse country where we respect people's freedom of conscience. And make the country more pro baby and pro family. But please.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Yes, Governor, please respond.\n\nTIM WALZ: Look, this is one where there's always something there. This is a very simple proposition. These are women's decisions to make about their healthcare decisions and the physicians who know best when they need to do this, trying to distort the way a law is written, to try and make a point. That's not it at all.\n\nJD VANCE: What was I wrong about? Governor, please tell me. What was I wrong about?\n\nTIM WALZ: That is not the way the law is written. Look, I've given.\n\nJD VANCE: But how.\n\nTIM WALZ: I've given this advice on a lot of things that getting involved, getting, that's been misread. And it was fact checked at the last debate. But the point on this is, is there's a continuation of these guys to try and tell women or to get involved. I use this line on this. Just mind your own business on this. Things worked best when Roe v. Wade was in place. When we do a restoration of Roe, that works best. That doesn't preclude us from increasing funding for children. It doesn't increase us from making sure that once that child's born, like in Minnesota, they get meals, they get early childhood education, they get healthcare. So the hiding behind we're going to do all these other things when you're not proposing them in your budget? Kamala Harris is proposing them. She's proposing all those things to make life easier for families.\n\nJD VANCE: I asked a specific question, Governor. And you gave me a slogan as a response.\n\nTIM WALZ: It's not the case. It's not true. That's not what the law says. So they fact checked it with President Trump.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss. We have to move on. And we're going to be right back with much more of the CBS news Vice Presidential debate in just a moment.\n\nSecond Segment\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS news Vice Presidential debate. We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic, the leading cause of death for children and teens in America is by firearms. Senator Vance, you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi automatic rifles, including AR-15s. So let me ask you. Earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison. Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, Norah, on that particular case, I don't know the full details, but I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions. I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes, and in some cases the answer is going to be no. And the details really matter here. Of course. For example, if a kid steals a gun, that's going to be different than if a parent hands over a gun knowing that their kid is potentially dangerous. Look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids, and our oldest is now in second grade. And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school. And we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence. And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we do have to do better. And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Now, here's something that really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence. The gross majority, close to 90%, and some of the statistics I've seen of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms. And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris’s open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel. So that number, the amount of illegal guns in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years ago. But what do we do about the schools? What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and a school that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security. But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So we've got to make our schools safer, and I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, you have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare. Look, I got a, I got a 17 year old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you.\n\nJD VANCE: Awful.\n\nTIM WALZ: As a member of Congress. I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Oak parents, and they were looking at my seven year old picture on the wall. Their seven year old were dead. And they were asking us to do something. And look, I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The Vice President is. We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out. In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence. And this idea that we should just live with it. And I, here's what I do think and this is a good start to the conversation. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know there are things that worked. I've spent time in Finland and seen some Finnish schools. They don't have this happen even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country. There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there. It just doesn't make any sense. Kamala Harris, as an Attorney General, worked on this issue. She knows that it's there. No one's trying to scaremonger and say, we're taking your guns. But I ask all of you out there, do you want your school's hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go… when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills? They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix. These are things that shouldn't be that difficult. You can still keep your firearms, and we can make a difference. We have to. If you're listening tonight, this breaks your heart.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator?\n\nJD VANCE: Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17 year old witnessed the shooting. And I'm sorry about that. And I hope,\n\nTIM WALZ: I appreciate that.\n\nJD VANCE: Christ, have mercy. It is awful. And I appreciate what Tim said, actually, about Finland. ‘Cause I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly weird differences between our own country's gun violence problem and Finland is. Okay, first of all, we have way higher rates of mental health abuse or mental health substance abuse. We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem. But I do think it's a big piece of it. Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids. It doesn't earn as many headlines, but is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets. I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, but I do think at our schools, we've got to talk about more security.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Senator, thank you. Governor, you previously opposed an assault weapons ban, but only later in your political career did you change your position. Why?\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA. I was the NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety. I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at. The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides. And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves. And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that. But I want to be very careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it. But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Gentlemen, thank you. Margaret.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent. There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States and this contributes to the high housing crisis. Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit. They also promise to build 3 million new homes. Where are you building these new homes and won’t handing out that kind of money just drive up prices higher?\n\nTIM WALZ: No, it's not handing out. First, let me say this, this issue of housing. And I think those of you listening on this. The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity. It can be bought up. It can be shifted. It can be moved around. Those are not folks living in those houses. Those of you listening tonight, that house is a big deal. I bought and owned one house in my life. My mom still lives in the house where I was. And when I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight Mass, where you go with your family. We need to make it more affordable. And one of the things, as I said, this program that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching. This is something we're doing in Minnesota from that lead. We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing. It starts to make it easier. We cut some of the red tape. Local folks, look, we can't do at the Federal level, but local folks make it easier to build those homes. And then that down payment assistance. I can tell all of you out there, one of the, certainly for me, using the GI bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment. Those are things that make it there. Now, look, you're going to pay it back and you're going to pay your mortgage. Those are things that we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it. And I will give Minneapolis an example. Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates. We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in. And we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance. We get it back from people, because here's what we know. People with stable housing end up with stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to get to school. All of those things in the long run, end up saving our money. And that's the thing that I think we should be able to find some common ground in. But we can't blame immigrants for the only reason that's not the case that's happening in many cities. The fact of the matter is, is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kickstart it, create that, create that base.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, as far as your campaign's position, the promise is to seize federal lands to build homes, remove regulation, provide tax breaks, and cut back on immigration, which you say pushes up prices. Where are you going to build all the new homes you're promising? And what part of any of this plan will provide immediate relief? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices. But we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country…\n\nTIM WALZ: Pass the bill.\n\nJD VANCE: …which does drive up costs, Tim. Twenty-five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It's why we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien, alien populations under Kamala Harris's leadership. Now, Tim just mentioned a bunch of ideas. Now, some of those ideas I actually think are halfway decent, and some of them I disagree with. But the most important thing here is Kamala Harris is not running as a newcomer to politics. She is the sitting Vice President. If she wants to enact all of these policies to make housing more affordable, I invite her to use the office that the American people already gave her, not sit around and campaign and do nothing while Americans find the American Dream of home ownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked Margaret what would immediately change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices. As Donald Trump says, “Drill, baby, drill.” One of the biggest drivers of housing costs, aside from illegal immigration, is think about it: if a truck driver is paying 40% more for diesel, then the lumber he's delivering to the job site to build the house is also going to become a lot more expensive. If we open up American energy, you will get immediate pricing release, relief, for American citizens, not, by the way, just in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods too.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, you still have 23 seconds there. Do you want to answer?\n\nTIM WALZ: Can I have it?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where, Governor, we will get to you in a moment. But, Senator, where are you going to seize the federal lands. Can you clarify?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, what Donald Trump has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything. They're not being used for national parks. They're not being used. And they could be places where we build a lot of housing. And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country. We have a lot of land that could be used. We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the Vice President is letting in migrants\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, of course, that's not true. And again, you have the facts. I guess we agreed not to fact check. I'll check it. That, look, crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. But it's, again, blaming and not trying to find the solution. I was going to ask, though, on this question, are we going to drill and build houses in the same federal land. And I think when people hear federal lands, these are really important pieces of land. Now, Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands. I know in the western part of the countries we do. There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example. So the issue is, I don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this. And I worry about this as someone who cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands. Look, Minnesota, we protect these things. We've got about 20% of the world's fresh water. These lands protect. They're there for a reason. They belong to all of us. But again, this is when you view housing and you view these things as commodities, like there's a chance to make money here. Let's take this federal land and let's sell it to people for that. I think there's better ways to do this. We've seen it in Minnesota. We're able to refurbish some of these houses. We're able to make some investments, that gets people in. And I'm still on the fact, on this, economist, Senator Vance, you said you don't like the economist, which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the cost.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, governor, your time is, your time is up.\n\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, there's a Federal Reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate. We'll put it up on social media. Actually, that really drills down on the connection between increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration, and higher housing prices. Now, of course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices. It's also the regulatory regime of Kamala Harris. Look, we are a country of builders. We're a country of doers. We're a country of explorers. But we increasingly have a Federal administration that makes it harder to develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says that they have to do. And what that means is that you have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes. I actually agree with Tim Walz. We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity. But the thing that has most turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be here.\n\nTIM WALZ: What are the federal regulations? I deal with this as a Governor.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can very quickly reply.\n\nTIM WALZ: I'm sorry. I get this as a Governor, and I don't necessarily disagree with that, that in some cases, many of those are local, many of them are state. I don't know which ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them. I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire. I think you want to make sure that it's fireproof and those types of things. So which are the regulations? Because the vice president's not responsible for those. Congress writes those.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you, gentlemen. We have a lot to get through. You're passionate about the housing crisis. I can tell. But Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care. Senator Vance, at the last Presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing the Affordable Care act. In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan. Since then, Senator, you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance. Can you explain how that would work? And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions won't pay more? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care, I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least, for the first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time, under Donald Trump's leadership. And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this “concepts of a plan” remark. I think it's very simple common sense. I think, as Tim Walz knows from twelve years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900 page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of bipartisan negotiation. Now, when Donald Trump was actually President, and again, he has a record to be proud of, prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time. Under Kamala Harris's leadership, prescription drugs are up about 7%. Under Donald Trump's entire four years, they were up about one and a half percent. He introduced pricing transparency. Think about healthcare. You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs. That price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also drive down costs. And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking about. Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non chronically ill. It's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along. I think this is an important point about President Trump. Of course, you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done, but when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and healthcare costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care. It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more that we can do. But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies. He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor.\n\nTIM WALZ: All right, here's where being an old guy gives you some history. I was there at the creation of the ACA, and the reason it was so important is I come from a major healthcare state, home of the Mayo Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those. We understand healthcare. It's why we're ranked first on affordability and accessibility and quality of health care. And so what I know is under Kamala Harris, more people are covered than they have before. Those of you listening, this is critical to you. Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants you… go back and remember this. He ran on, the first thing he was going to do on day one, was to repeal Obamacare. On day one, he tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA. He signed onto a lawsuit to repeal the ACA, but lost at the Supreme Court. And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill. Now fast forward. What that means to you is you lose your pre-existing conditions if you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad. If you're a woman, probably not. Broke your foot during football, might kick you out. Your kids get kicked out when they're 26. Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare. We have ten drugs that will come online, the most common ones that'll be there. But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, “I've got a concept of a plan,” it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have never given me that. But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept, because what he explained is pre-Obamacare. And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have done this for a long time. What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more? So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure. Because guess what happens? You pay your premium. It's not much. They figure they're not going to have to pay out to you. But those of you a little older, gray, you know, got cancer? You're going to get kicked out of it. That's why the system didn't work. Kamala Harris will protect and enhance the ACA.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, thank you. Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions, or laid out that plan.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations in place, in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better. Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true. A lot of what happened and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy people were leaving the exchanges. Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had preexisting conditions. But again, something that these guys do, is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes President, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue. But in reality, Donald Trump was President. Inflation was low, take home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. He did his job, which is govern in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about problems, but actually solve them.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up under the Trump Administration?\n\nTIM WALZ: It's higher now that we've seen it go up. Look, people are using it. The system works. And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual mandate piece of this. And Republicans fought tooth and nail, saying, well, Americans should be free to do this. Well, then what happens?\n\nJD VANCE: You think the individual mandate's a good idea?\n\nTIM WALZ: I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone, that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn’t, it collapses. You are asking pre-ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on healthcare. People expect it to be there. And when we are able to make it, and we are making it this way, when we incentivize people to be in the market, when we help people who might not be able to afford it get there, and we make sure then when you get sick and old, it's there for you. Because I heard people say, well, I don't want to buy into Medicare or whatever. Good luck buying healthcare once you get past 70. So look, the ACA works. We can continue to do better. Kamala Harris did that. The way she made everything better was negotiating those ten drugs on Medicare for the first time in American history.\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Thank you. Margaret?\n\nJD VANCE: Can I address that?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: We’re, I apologize. We're out of time. We have a number of subjects to discuss. Margaret?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about families in America. There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents. Governor Walz, you said that if Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you. How long should employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns? You have two minutes.\n\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, that's negotiable. And that's what Congress worked. But here's what the deal is. Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company. Look, we're home in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Kamala Harris knows that in California. Those companies provide paid family medical leave. One is, I think they're moral and they think it's a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy. We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave. You have a child. You, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born. This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time. What we know is that gets the child off to a better start. The family works better. We stay in their employers. We get more consistency in that. So Kamala Harris has made it a priority. We implemented it in Minnesota, and we see growth. That's how you become a pro-business state. But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, those big companies are able to offer it. Those of you out there who don't have it, just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick. We know what happens. You end up staying home. In some places, that means no paycheck, because you've got no protection on that. This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us. He's willing to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest, he's willing to say, “Bust those unions up. Do whatever.” What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us. And so a paid family medical leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them. As far as childcare on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side. You can't expect the most important people in our lives to take care of our children or our parents, to get paid the least amount of money. And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that. We were able to do it in Minnesota, and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state. We're still in crisis on this. A Federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, do you support a national paid leave program? And if so, for how long should employers be mandated to pay their employees while they are home taking care of their newborn? You have two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, too, have worked on this issue, and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us care about this issue. I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her. But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult. And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective. She actually had access to paid family leave because she worked for a bigger company. But the cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want. A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately. Some would like to spend a little time home with the kids. Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids. We should have a family care model that makes choice possible. And I think this is a very important substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’s approach. I mean, look, if you look at the Federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the community development block grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money from the federal government. These programs only go to one kind of childcare model. Let's say you'd like your church, maybe, to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide childcare in the way that makes the most sense. You don't get access to any of these federal monies. We want to promote choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote childcare because, look, it is unacceptable. And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight weeks. And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids. That is an incredible burden to put on American families. We're the only country that does it. I think we could do a heck of a lot better.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you. You have also said, Senator Vance, many things about the American family. The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on childcare as they do on housing each month. So I want to get your thoughts on this. President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in. Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described? You have 1 minute.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. Cut taxes for American workers and American families. Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of America. But penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. That's the heart of the economic proposal. And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, childcare options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify how that will solve the childcare shortage?\n\nJD VANCE: Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don't have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options. And we're going to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money. We're going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing this very essential service.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, your ticket also has some childcare tax credit proposals. Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and $3,000 credit for children over the age of six, as your campaign has promised? Is that realistic?\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and this is the biggest issue everybody listening tonight knows. I mean, I'm sure they were shocked to hear it's not that expensive. And let's be clear whether it's $5000 or $6000, that pays you about three or four months. Let's be clear of where we're at on this. It's because we got out of an imbalance on this. We thought we were going to get by by not paying people. I don't think Senator Vance and I are that far apart. I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options. We've done scholarships, types of things. I think we need to be open to making the case. But the issue here is, the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs. That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less. So not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole. That's Wharton School. That's his alma mater. And so I think the issue here is those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not here. When I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometimes. But they will lead with childcare and they will lead with housing, because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you. We need to move on. Norah?\n\nNORAH O’DONNELL: Let's talk about the State of Democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy and inflation. After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results. Judges, including those appointed by President Trump and other Republican Presidents looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread fraud. The Governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th. Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last Presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors. That has been called unconstitutional and illegal. Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every Governor certifies the results? I'll give you two minutes.\n\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I think that we're focused on the future. We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris's policies. Make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're focused on. But I want to answer your question because you did ask it. Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020. And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square. And that's all I've said. And that's all that Donald Trump has said. Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the President. Donald Trump left the White House. And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration. I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens. And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation. I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years. Now I’m really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong leaders in the democratic coalition. And of course, they don't agree with me and Donald Trump on every issue. We don't have to agree on every issue, but we're united behind a basic American First Amendment principle that we ought to debate our differences. We ought to argue about them. We ought to try to persuade our fellow Americans. Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale. She did it during COVID, she's done it over a number of other issues. And that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January 6th.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor.\n\nTIM WALZ: Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here. And I'm sympathetic to misspeaking on things. And I think I might have with the Senator, but…\n\nJD VANCE: Me too, man.\n\nTIM ", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/12/when-is-the-next-debate-vice-presidential-candidates-tim-walz-jd-vance-debate/75171222007/", "title": "When is the next debate?

Harris attended Trump's State of the Union addresses as a California senator, but aside from that, the two have never been in the same room together. And the much anticipated meeting between the presidential candidates was filled with some sharp barbs as they discussed election security, immigration, and the economy, but muted microphones helped maintain civility.\n\nThe debate, moderated by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, allowed Harris to introduce herself and the policies she would focus on during her tenure in the White House if she would win, which many wondered about after she took over the Democratic nomination after Biden bowed out in July.\n\nUnlike after the June debate, where people wondered if Biden should run, this debate put both candidate's qualifications and stances on different policies into the spotlight.\n\nA question that remains is if we will see another Trump, Harris face-off again before the general election in November. While that decision is still up in the air, Americans will get the chance to see their running mates, Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz debate in October.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhen is the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz?\n\nWalz and Vance will take part in a debate on Oct. 1 that will be moderated by CBS News and will take place in New York City, according to CBS News.\n\nStart time, rules and broadcast details will be announced at a later date.\n\nWho are the moderators for the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate?\n\nThe vice-presidential debate will be moderated by \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and \"Face the Nation\" moderator and CBS News foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan, the network announced last month.\n\nWho is Kamala Harris' vice president pick?\n\nHarris's campaign for the White House came together quickly after Biden stepped aside as the presumptive candidate for the Democrats in July after mounting pressure from the party for him to step aside after his first debate with Trump.\n\nHarris, who was Biden's VP pick before his departure, chose her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Walz, just ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nWho is Donald Trump's vice president pick?\n\nTrump announced his vice presidential selection at the start of the Republican National Convention on July 15.\n\n\"After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others, I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio,\" Trump shared in a post on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nWill there be another presidential debate between Harris and Trump?\n\nBefore the Sept. 10 debate, the former president floated dates for other debates ahead of the general election.\n\n\"I think they'll be very revealing,\" Trump told reporters during a snap news conference at his Florida Mar-a-Lago estate on Aug. 8. \"We'd like to do three debates.\"\n\nBut in the week following the debate, Trump has decided that he won't be participating in any other debates. The former president took to Truth Social to announce that there wouldn't be another debate, while also attacking Biden and Harris.\n\n\"KAMALA SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post while also claiming he won the Sept. 10 debate.\n\nAt a campaign stop in North Carolina, Harris told the crowd, \"we owe it to the voters to have another debate,\" in response to Trump's unwillingness to meet her on stage again before the November election.\n\nABC News/538, citing three national polls and one swing-state poll, reported that \"57 percent of debate watchers nationally said Harris turned in the better performance; only 34 percent said Trump did.\"\n\nAnother poll from CNN/SSRS found 63% to 37% of debate watchers said that Harris performed better on stage in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen is election day 2024?\n\nThe general election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/01/what-time-is-debate-tonight/75452516007/", "title": "What time is the VP debate tonight?

Read more.\n\nDockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas are officially on strike after the clock struck midnight with no new labor deal in hand.\n\nThirty-six East Coast and Gulf Coast ports shut down as 45,000 union workers walked off the job after labor negotiations over higher pay and protections against automation stalled between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, or USMX. The strike only exacerbates some temporary port closures in places like Florida, the Carolinas and Georgia in the wake of Hurricane Helene.\n\nThe ILA strike is the first at these ports since 1977 and has the potential to cost the economy up to $5 billion a day, upend holiday shopping for millions of Americans and dictate whether many small- and medium-size businesses and farmers turn a profit or lose money this year, experts said.\n\n“Every idle day that a ship does not get into the port costs money and sometimes a lot of money ... that ultimately gets passed onto consumers,” said Stamatis Tsantanis, chairman and chief executive of shipper Seanergy Maritime and United Maritime, in a statement.\n\nLength matters\n\nNow that the strike is on, experts will turn their focus to how long the strike may last. Each day of the strike could cost the economy up to $5 billion a day as imports and exports are blocked, some economists estimated.\n\n“It’s not just about the shutdown but also, about the recovery period and how long it takes to get things up back and running,” said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation.\n\nFor each day of the strike, it takes about three to five days to clear the backlog and resume normal operations, he said. “The longer it goes, the more it gets compounded,” he said.\n\nA port closure in 2002 went for 11 days before the Bush administration invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force the ports to reopen. The Act allows the federal government to seek a court injunction against a strike to allow both parties to continue negotiations during an 80-day cooling off period. It took six months to recover from those 11 days, Gold said.\n\nDespite many industry groups calling for intervention, the Biden administration said it doesn’t intend to invoke Taft-Hartley. Instead, it encouraged continued negotiations and said in a statement that it would carefully monitor supply chain disruptions and “respond swiftly to help minimize potential disruptions in the event of a prolonged strike by engaging extensively with the ports, state and local officials, industry, labor, ocean carriers, rail and trucking companies.\"\n\nThe state of work in America: Sign up for USA TODAY's The Daily Money newsletter for exclusive financial content.\n\nWhat to expect:A port strike could cost the economy $5 billion per day, here's what it could mean for you\n\nWhat’s affected by the strike?\n\nImports: With about half of U.S. ocean imports passing through the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, a wide range of products are affected, including produce, cars, auto and machinery parts, clothing, pharmaceuticals, wine and spirits, holiday goods like toys, and seafood, experts said.\n\n“Any strike that lasts more than one week could cause goods shortages for the holidays,” said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund. “Retailers are running lean currently so inventory would get drawn down, and prices of shipping, and goods prices would go vertical for a period of time. We could get the kind of inflation for 6 months similar to or worse than peak inflation levels a year ago.”\n\nSmall and medium-size businesses could suffer most, some said.\n\n“Large businesses with dedicated procurement departments and considerable access to capital have been preparing for this strike for some time and many have ordered excess materials which they were able to finance with lower-cost debt,” said Ben Johnston, chief operating officer at small business lender Kapitus.\n\n“Small businesses, however, are less likely to have been able to order early and in bulk and are less likely to obtain the capital required to order larger quantities of supplies in advance,” he said.\n\nExports: Businesses that sell products to international markets would suffer, experts said. For example, agricultural exporters of soybeans and poultry won’t be able to send their goods overseas and could end up losing market share, or worse, lose money because their goods are perishable, they said.\n\nJobs: Companies keeping lean inventories to keep costs low might have to shut down assembly lines amid a prolonged strike, for example, Gold said. This would come at a time when the job market is already cooling.\n\nWhat are port workers demanding?\n\nThe ILA is seeking a 61.5% pay increase over six years, according to CNBC. It also wants protections against automation.\n\n\"They (USMX) don’t care about us,\" said ILA President Harold Daggett in a post on Monday. \"They would love to see automation up and down the whole East and Gulf Coast, trust me when I tell you that if it was up to them, we would have no jobs.\"\n\nOn Monday, USMX said in a statement it had offered to increase wages by nearly 50%, triple employer contributions to employee retirement plans, \"strengthen our health care options, and retain the current language around automation and semi-automation.”\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Read more.\n\nAlmost 25,000 dockworkers at various ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are striking to ask for higher pay and protections from having their jobs automated out of existence.\n\nMarking the first such strike in almost 50 years, members of the International Longshoremen’s Association walked off the job on Tuesday. In a social media post, the union's president Harold Daggett said the union was fighting for “the kind of wages we deserve.”\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the union blamed the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents docks and ocean carriers, for continuing to block an agreement that would end the strike.\n\n“The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,\" the statement said.\n\nWhile 14 ports in the East and Gulf Coast are seeing striking workers, West Coast ports have not been affected as a different union represents its workers. Back in 2023, the West Coast union negotiated wage increases for its workers.\n\nYour money questions, answered. Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nWhat do dockworkers make? What wages are they proposing?\n\nThe wages negotiated by the West Coast dockworkers union is one of the reasons for the current strike. ILA workers make significantly less than their counterparts.\n\nThe ILA contract that expired on Monday shows that the starting pay for dockworkers was $20 per hour. Pay rises to $24.75 after two years, $31.90 after three and tops out at $39 for workers with at least six years on the job.\n\nMeanwhile, the ILA is demanding a 77% increase over the duration of the contract, with a $5 increase each year of the contract. Workers would make $44 the first year, $49 the second and up to $69 in the final year.\n\nIn recent days, the U.S. Maritime Alliance proposed a smaller increase, nearly 50%, which the ILA rejected.\n\n\"They might claim a significant increase, but they conveniently omit that many of our members are operating multi-million-dollar container-handling equipment for a mere $20 an hour. In some states, the minimum wage is already $15,\" the ILA said.\n\nThe current top wage amounts to about $81,000 per year, but according to a Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor report about a third of local longshoremen made $200,000 or more a year.\n\nHowever, that pay may come with extreme hours. The ILA president, Harold Daggett, told the Associated Press that many of the workers earning high wages work up to 100 hours a week.\n\n“Our members don’t work typical 9-to-5 jobs; they work extraordinary hours, sacrificing time with their families. Our position is firm: we believe in the value our incredible rank-and-file members bring to this industry and to our great nation,” the ILA said in a statement.\n\nThe average U.S. salary was about $59,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

See their demands\n\nDockworkers are seeking a new labor contract focused on wages and automation. The two key jobs of dockworkers, according to the Washington Post, are operating cranes and moving shipping containers. Due to advances in automation, both tasks can now be done without humans.\n\nAnother group striking at the Port of Philadelphia included a message board on the side of a truck, courtesy of a union. The Associated Press reports the board read, \"Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.\"\n\nThe ILA had an opening offer of a 77% pay raise over the next six years of the new contract. President Harold Daggett says this raise would balance out inflation and years of small raises. ILA members currently have a base salary of $81,000, but large amounts of overtime can allow some to reach $200,000, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAs of Monday evening, USMX, the group representing the ports, had offered 50% pay raises for the new contract and promised to limit automation rather than the complete ban dockworkers are demanding. The union responded Tuesday morning by rejecting the offer, saying it \"fell far short of what ILA rank-and-file members are demanding in wages and protections against automation.\"\n\nPort strike could cost $5 billion each day\n\nNow that the strike is on, experts will turn their focus to how long the strike may last.

Read more.\n\nAmericans could face high prices and shortages again this holiday season but this time, it would be because of a worker strike instead of a global pandemic.\n\nAs of Thursday, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) said labor talks with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) remain at a standstill, and about 45,000 of its union workers at 36 East coast and Gulf Coast ports are ready to walk on Oct. 1 for the first time since 1977. The ILA is looking for higher wages and protections against automation.\n\nA strike could lead to shortages of certain items and boost prices for voters already frustrated with housing and food inflation, experts said. The ports handle about half of U.S. ocean imports, including food, clothing, auto parts, cars shipped via container and holiday toys, experts said.\n\n“A supply chain disruption would undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and would impact consumers’ ability to find the toys they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead,” said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of The Toy Association.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\nDiversification didn’t work\n\nAfter clogged post-pandemic ports on the West Coast kept more than 150 container ships waiting to dock in February 2022, according to the Department of Transportation, companies began shipping more of their wares through the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, experts said.\n\nSimultaneously, to cut their reliance on China, which was slow to reopen and faced more intense government scrutiny after the pandemic, companies began sourcing from different countries, especially southeast Asia, said Chris Tang, distinguished professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in supply chain management.\n\nMany companies shipping goods from southeast Asia use East Coast ports because they’re closer, he said.\n\n“Because of these changing dynamics, the East Coast (strike) impact is more pronounced,” Tang said.\n\nWhat products will be affected?\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,” Tang said. “And air ship is very expensive.”\n\nElectronics, like cell phones and computers, now come from southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, Tang said.\n\nPharmaceuticals, although these are easier “to ship by air because they are a higher value product, but there could be drug shortages if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so,” Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore, Maryland, leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. The East Coast ports also surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, said Jason Miller, interim chair of Michigan State University's department of supply chain management. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nCan companies reroute shipments?\n\nJonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy for the National Retail Federation trade group, said some companies prepared early by:\n\nTaking cargo in earlier than normal\n\nRerouting some shipments to West Coast ports\n\nHowever, those steps are limited. “Retailers can’t bring everything in,” he said.\n\nSome companies may face inventory space constraints, while perishable food products and other goods don’t have any good alternative routes, Tang said. The Panama Canal operations are recovering from droughts, Red Sea ships have been attacked by Houthi rebels, and the Cape of Good Hope takes much longer, he said.\n\nBesides, “given the long lead time for toy products, significant quantities are already in transit with shipping logistics having been in place for months,” Ahearn said. “This makes it extremely difficult to rework scheduled shipments or product already undefined to the U.S. market through the East Coast or Gulf ports.”\n\nFlashback:Black October is here: Transport delays, labor shortages slow supply chain as holiday shopping begins\n\nIf there’s a strike, length is important\n\nThe period that follows a strike can also be disruptive, some experts said.\n\n“It’s not just about shut down but also about the recovery period, and how long it takes to get things up back and running,” Gold said.\n\nGenerally, one strike day would take three to five days to catch up, and “the longer the strike goes, the more that’s compounded,” he said.\n\n“In 2002, when we had an 11-day lockout on the West Coast because of labor negotiations, that cost (the economy) a billion dollars a day and took six months to recover and get stuff out,” Gold said. “Trade is higher now than in 2002 so it could take even longer.”\n\nBack then, the Bush administration invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force the ports to reopen. The Act allows the federal government to seek a court injunction against a strike to allow both parties to continue negotiations during an 80-day cooling off period.\n\nWill the Biden administration help?\n\nThe Biden administration has declined to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act. Instead, White House officials encouraged ongoing discussions despite pleas for help from retail, agriculture, commerce, auto care, toy and other groups for months.\n\n“It’s an election year so Biden may intervene to help (Democratic presidential nominee Kamala) Harris,” Tang said. “On the outside, he may not say it but behind the scenes, he might help negotiations because it’s important to Harris. Any chaos could affect the election.”\n\nCharacterizing US supply chains and the economy as \"more resilient than they were when we came into office,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said, \"the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force is up and running – and is prepared to respond swiftly to help minimize potential disruptions in the event of a prolonged strike by engaging extensively with the ports, state and local officials, industry, labor, ocean carriers, rail and trucking companies.\"\n\nNo matter what, the story ends with higher prices\n\nIf port workers strike, Americans may see price increases soon, experts said.\n\nIf port workers agree to a deal, “labor costs go up,” Tang said. “So down the road, consumers still pay a higher price. Consumers will have to learn to adjust and adapt, but unfortunately, things will be more expensive.”\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

We could get the kind of inflation for 6 months similar to or worse than peak inflation levels a year ago.”\n\nSmall and medium-sized businesses could suffer most, some said.\n\n“Large businesses with dedicated procurement departments and considerable access to capital have been preparing for this strike for some time and many have ordered excess materials which they were able to finance with lower-cost debt,” said Ben Johnston, chief operating officer at small business lender Kapitus.\n\n“Small businesses, however, are less likely to have been able to order early and in bulk and are less likely to obtain the capital required to order larger quantities of supplies in advance,” he said.\n\nExports: Businesses that sell products to international markets would suffer, experts said. For example, agricultural exporters of soybeans and poultry won’t be able to send their goods overseas and could end up losing market share, or worse, lose money because their goods are perishable, they said.\n\nJobs: Companies keeping lean inventories to keep costs low might have to shut down assembly lines amid a prolonged strike, for example, Gold said.

A joint statement late Thursday did not specify what wages were agreed upon or the other terms that required negotiation.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all current job actions will cease and all work covered by the Master Contract will resume,\" the statement said.\n\nThe tentative agreement is for a wage increase of about 62% over six years, The Bergen Record, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, reported.\n\nThe union had been seeking a 77% raise, while the employer group had raised its offer to a nearly 50%.\n\nThe deal ends the biggest work stoppage of its kind in nearly half a century, which blocked unloading of container ships from Maine to Texas and threatened shortages of everything from bananas to auto parts and triggered a backlog of anchored ships outside major ports.\n\nAgreement praised by Biden, Retail Federation\n\nPresident Joe Biden praised the agreement in a statement released by the White House moments after the agreement was announced.\n\n\"I want to thank the union workers, the carriers, and the port operators for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding,\" Biden said. \"Collective bargaining works, and it is critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.\"\n\nThe Biden administration sided with the union, putting pressure on the port employers to raise their offer to secure a deal and citing the shipping industry's bumper profits since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"With the grace of God ... it's going to hold,\" Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland after a storm damage tour of Georgia and Florida.\n\nTaxes:IRS doubles number of states eligible for its free Direct File for tax season 2025\n\nThe administration repeatedly resisted calls from business trade groups and Republican lawmakers to use federal powers to halt the strike − a move that would undermine Democratic support among unions ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nOne of those trade groups echoed the president's praise in the wake of the tentative agreement.\n\n\"The decision to end the current strike and allow the East and Gulf coast ports to reopen is good news for the nation’s economy,\" National Retail Federation CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement.\n\nThe federation had called on the Biden administration to \"use any and all available authority and tools\" to end the strike in a statement Monday.\n\nMake your spending smart: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nStrike effects began at ports; deal avoids them hitting consumers\n\nAt least 45 container vessels that have been unable to unload were anchored outside the strike-hit East Coast and Gulf Coast ports by Wednesday, up from just three before the strike began, according to Everstream Analytics.\n\nThe union launched the strike by 45,000 port workers, its first major work stoppage since 1977, Tuesday after talks for a new six-year contract broke down.\n\nThe strike affected 36 ports − including New York, Baltimore and Houston − that handle a range of containerized goods.\n\nBack to hoarding toilet paper?Amid port strike, some consumers are panic-buying goods\n\nEconomists have said the port closures would not initially raise consumer prices because companies had accelerated shipments in recent months of key goods.

Cars, seafood, electronics and holiday goods are among the other products that may be squeezed in a port strike.\n\nFlashback:Wilmington is port of call for a world of fruit\n\nPort operators blame the union for the standoff and have filed a complaint over what they allege is a bad-faith break in negotiations. The union calls this a \"publicity stunt\" and says what's at stake is both fair wages and an existential threat to jobs in the form of artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nHere's what we know about the looming labor strike at the East Coast's largest ports.\n\nWhen is the contract deadline and how likely is a strike?\n\nThe union and port operator group the United States Maritime Alliance must reach an agreement by midnight Monday to avoid a walkout.\n\nOtherwise, the ILA has said it's prepared to strike.\n\nBoth sides are publicly playing hardball, and it's not clear an agreement is near. The Maritime Alliance representing port operators filed a complaint on Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the union had illegally broken off negotiations.\n\nThe two sides have reportedly not met in person since June after the ILA said they discovered that a port gate in Mobile, Alabama, had violated the current ILA agreement by using automated technology to process trucks without union workers.\n\nBut the union publicly derided at the notion they were the ones negotiating in bad faith and called the port operators' labor complaint part of a \"weak publicity campaign designed to fool the American public.\" Union president Harold Daggett said in September he fields \"low-ball\" offers from the port operators \"several times each week.\"\n\nHe began warning of a potential strike as early as July.\n\n\"As we get closer to our contract deadline, you may hear more about the possibility of a strike,\" wrote Daggett's son, union vice president Dennis Daggett, in a July statement. \"We want you to know that we are doing everything in our power to reach a fair agreement without disrupting the flow of goods you rely on. But in all honesty, we are prepared to stand up for what is right, even if it means taking drastic measures.\"\n\nWhat are workers asking for in a new contract?\n\nIn part, the usual thing: money.\n\nWorkers at East Coast ports have noted publicly that they are ill-paid compared with their counterparts on the West Coast, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Under the latest West Coast contract, longshoremen top out at a reported base pay of nearly $55 an hour, compared with $39 an hour for East Coast employees, according to the contract set to expire Oct. 1.\n\nUnion president Daggett has signaled his union is seeking a $5 increase in hourly rate each year, over the six-year life of the contract.\n\nUnlike the West Coast port workers' union, the ILA is also holding out against automated technologies already in use at West Coast ports. Safeguards against automation that threatens jobs are one of the main public sticking points in ILA negotiations with port operators.\n\n\"We will never allow automation to come into our union and try to put us out of work as long as I’m alive,\" said union president Daggett in a July statement.\n\nAt the Port of Wilmington, workers for multiple unions serving the port told nonprofit news organization Spotlight Delaware that hours and jobs had been cut since port operator Enstructure took over the port in 2023.\n\nHow is Wilmington's port responding to a potential strike?\n\nOfficials from port operator Enstructure didn't devote much time to a potential strike in their public report to Delaware's Diamond State Port Corp. on Friday. Instead, they touted the port's success at bringing in expanded port shipments since taking over port operations in July 2023 – and in handling the increased ship traffic after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore this spring.\n\nHowever, Enstructure has begun preparations for a potential work stoppage, according to spokespeople.\n\n\"Over the next few days, Port Wilmington is preparing for a possible work stoppage impacting major ports on the East and Gulf Coasts beginning on Tuesday, October 1,\" reads a statement from the company. \"Port Wilmington will continue to operate business as usual until the potential work stoppage. If an ILA strike occurs, we will continue to provide support services for our customers until regular operations resume.\"\n\nWhat products would be affected by an East Coast port strike?\n\nThe ILA has said its workers will continue to handle all military ship traffic, and that cruise ships would also not be affected by a strike. As storm clouds began to gather, retailers such as Costco have also been scrambling to expedite shipments.\n\nBut broad swaths of the economy would likely be drastically snarled up by a lasting East Coast port strike, according to industry observers – particularly among holiday goods that have yet to arrive on these shores.\n\n“A supply chain disruption would undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and would impact consumers’ ability to find the toys they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead,” Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,\" UCLA professor and supply chain expert Chris Tang told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nElectronics, like cellphones and computers, now come from Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, according to Tang.\n\nPharmaceuticals. Though air shipping is possible, drug shortages may result if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so, Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. East Coast ports surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, according to Michigan State University's Jason Miller. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations that call the First State home.

Executive compensation has grown in line with those profits and profits have been returned to shareholders at record rates. It’s only fair that workers, who put themselves at risk during the pandemic to keep ports open, see a meaningful increase in their wages as well.\n\n“As our nation climbs out of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, dockworkers will play an essential role in getting communities the resources they need. Now is not the time for ocean carriers to refuse to negotiate a fair wage for these essential workers while raking in record profits. My Administration will be monitoring for any price gouging activity that benefits foreign ocean carriers, including those on the USMX board.\n\n“It is time for USMX to negotiate a fair contract with the longshoremen that reflects the substantial contribution they’ve been making to our economic comeback.”\n\nMore:Staunton NAACP to host local candidate forum at Blackfriars Playhouse\n\nThe Port of Virginia impacts over half a million jobs across the Commonwealth\n\nThe Port of Virginia directly employs over 450 people, including approximately 2,600 longshoreman and around an equal number of truckers and there are nearly 9,500 jobs supported directly by the port and harbor operations.

The formal oath was administered privately by the city clerk.\n\nBass will be tasked with easing rising crime rates, restoring trust in a City Hall shaken by racism and corruption scandals and addressing the issue of over 40,000 people living in trash-strewn encampments or rusty RVs that have spread into virtually every neighborhood.\n\nStriking a tone of unity, Bass said the many, disparate arms of government must come together to confront homelessness.\n\nTo move in a new direction “we must have a single strategy” that brings together government, the private sector and other stakeholders,” Bass said, speaking in a downtown theater near City Hall.\n\nShe said if people link arms rather than point fingers, lives will be saved.

Kennedy’s presidential inaugural address in which he said, “Ask not what your country can do for you –- ask what you can do for your country.”\n\n“I call on the people of our city to not just dream of the L.A. we want, but to participate in making the dream come true,” Bass said.\n\nBass — who was on President-elect Joe Biden’s short list for vice president — claimed the post last month after overcoming more than $100 million in spending by rival Rick Caruso, a billionaire developer and Republican-turned-Democrat who campaigned as a centrist and promised a strong emphasis on public safety.\n\nLAPD INVESTIGATING INCIDENT:Video shows LA Councilmember brawling with local activist at Christmas event amid racist audio fallout\n\nCaruso would have represented a turn to the political right for the heavily Democratic city.

She has signaled she will seek to marshal “all of the resources, all of the skills, the knowledge, the talent of the city” to get homeless people into housing.\n\nDetails on the emergency order have yet to emerge, though she has said she intends to get over 17,000 homeless people into housing in her first year through a mix of interim and permanent facilities.\n\nShe also will contend with entrenched urban problems that include a housing shortage, crumbling streets and some of the nation’s worst traffic.\n\n“The mayor’s first priority and likely the main one for some time to come is homelessness,” said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles.\n\n'CITY IS STILL GRIEVING':Los Angeles City Council elects new president after leaked racist audio rocked city\n\n“The voters don’t expect a miracle but will be looking for a clear and credible path toward measurable and visible improvement,” Sonenshein said. “It’s an opportunity for an energetic reset on a crisis that has seemed stuck, and also a chance to restore confidence in local government in Los Angeles.”\n\nShe replaces beleaguered Democrat Eric Garcetti, who ends two bumpy terms with his nomination to become U.S. ambassador to India stalled in the Senate, apparently over sexual misconduct allegations against a former top Garcetti adviser.\n\nBass takes office as the City Council contends with a racism scandal that led to the resignation of its former president and a powerful labor leader, while one councilman snared in the scandal has resisted calls to resign.

These include prosecutors’ allegation that he led a “criminal network” that interfered with public institutions such as the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Housing and Peru’s state-run oil company to control public bidding processes and benefit specific companies and close allies.\n\nProsecutors are also investigating whether the former President led efforts to peddle influence in the process of promoting officers in both the armed forces and national police.\n\nThese investigations also look into Castillo’s family, including his wife and sister-in-law. Former first lady Lilia Paredes is being investigated on suspicion of allegedly coordinating the criminal network.

Both men have previously publicly expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, which has prompted questions over what the coalition’s approach to Russia will be.\n\nAnd just this week – days before consultations on forming the government were set to begin – secretly recorded audio was circulated in which Berlusconi appeared to lay the blame for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine at Kyiv’s door, and boasted of having reestablished relations with the Russian leader.\n\n“I reconnected a little bit with President Putin, quite a bit, in the sense that for my birthday he gave me 20 bottles of Vodka and a very sweet letter, and I responded with giving him bottles of Lambrusco,” said Berlusconi in the clip, released by Italian news agency LaPresse on Tuesday. The 86-year-old billionaire and media magnate was speaking with Forza Italia party members at the time.\n\nA party spokesperson denied Berlusconi was in touch with Putin, saying he had been telling parliamentarians “an old story referring to an episode many years ago.” Berlusconi defended his comments in an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Thursday, saying they had been taken out of context.\n\nAmid backlash over the comments, Meloni, who has been a strong supporter of Ukraine as it battles Moscow’s invasion, sought to clarify where she and and the coalition would stand once in power.\n\n“I have and always will be clear, I intend to lead a government with a foreign policy that is clear and unequivocal. Italy is fully part of Europe and the Atlantic Alliance. Anyone who does not agree with this cornerstone will not be able to be part of the government, at the cost of not being a government. With us governing, Italy will never be the weak link of the West,” she said.\n\nNonetheless, liberals within Italy and the European Union are fearful of what the promised rightward turn may mean for the country and its future – while conservative constituents feel only a strong-arm politician, like Meloni, can lead the country out of crisis amid soaring energy costs and high youth unemployment.\n\n“Meloni is not expressing the vote choices of radical right-wing voters, because we have data that shows that she has been voted for by mostly the center-right,” political science professor Lorenzo De Sio of the Luiss Guido Carli University told CNN.\n\n“I would say that the motto for Meloni is to be a sort of new conservative – that is to say, conservativism for the 21st century. She might bear some far-back connection to the post-fascist legacy, but clearly that’s not the core of her political platform now.”\n\nGiorgia Meloni attends a meeting with the newly elected parliamentarians of her Brothers of Italy party in Rome on October 10. Antonio Masiello/Getty Images\n\nDiffering views\n\nMeloni grew up in the working-class Roman neighborhood of Garbatella, a historically left-wing part of southern Rome that was built during Benito Mussolini’s fascist dictatorship. She got her political start in the movement Youth Front, a political organization with fascist roots.\n\nShe went on to create her own political party, Brothers of Italy, which in just four years went from taking 4% of the vote to winning 26% in last month’s election. While that doesn’t represent the majority of Italians, thanks to her partnership with Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and Salvini’s League, the coalition has enough seats in parliament to govern the country.\n\nBack in the Garbatella neighborhood, among the fruit and vegetable stands that Meloni would go to with her mother, some locals remember her as a child, long before she embraced politics. Opinions on what she will be like as a leader vary widely.\n\n“I know her very well. I knew her since she was little,” said Aldo, a fruit and vegetable vendor from Garbatella who has run his market stand for decades. “Her mother would come shop here. She always had a book in her hand to study. If she goes forward like she did when she was little, she’ll be strong.”\n\nHe added: “You have to have a strong fist. Period. You understand? That’s how you move forward. Otherwise Italy, kapoof, it goes away!”\n\nGloria, a lifelong Garbatella resident, said she is worried about her children's future freedoms after Giorgia Meloni's victory. Valentina DiDonato/CNN\n\nJust across the market, Gloria, who was born and raised in Garbatella and helps her son at his Roman food stand, has very different views.\n\n“What she has said until now terrifies me,” she told CNN.\n\n“There are many people that connect with these kinds of conservative ideals because they are racist, because they are not progressive. I have three children and I wonder, will my daughter have the freedom to have an abortion if she wants, to be a lesbian?”\n\nMeloni has sought in recent times to distance her party from its neo-fascist roots. Her policy proposals have also evolved over time, including walking back some of her more anti-EU ideas.\n\nBack in 2014, she said, “Italy has to leave the euro!” and called for Congress to revoke sanctions on Russia. Now, according to her proposed plan for government and latest comments, she wants Italy to be a “protagonist within Europe.”\n\nEmiliano, a local who was shopping at the Garbatella market, said he didn’t bother to vote in the latest election. “Neither the left nor the right deserve a vote. Before, politicians ate but we ate also. Now only they eat,” he said.\n\nFears over rising costs\n\nWith the skyrocketing cost of energy, the risk for Italian businesses and households is high. The agricultural sector, which represents 1.96% of Italy’s GDP, is facing a shortage of everything from fertilizers, to diesel, to electricity and glass, causing prices to rise rapidly with a devastating impact on farm budgets, according to Coldiretti, the largest association for agricultural assistance in Italy.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Coldiretti, rising production costs have forced many small agricultural businesses to shut down for the season because they can’t cope.\n\nSabina Petrucci manages her family’s olive oil company, Olio Petrucci, and is also a member of Coldiretti’s European council for young agricultural workers. She feels hopeful and believes the only way to fix the present issues is through strong political leadership.\n\n“We need a very concrete government who helps us with energy costs and also to achieve the financial aid and financial help we may need in the future,” said Petrucci. “Many of the producers in the area are stopping their production, they really are frightened about the increasing costs.”\n\nShe describes rising energy costs as “the major threat for us,” adding: “We have opened our mill, but the production costs have risen throughout the summer.”\n\nSabina Petrucci, the manager of her family's olive oil company Petrucci Oil, said many in her industry are alarmed by rising energy and production costs. Valentina DiDonato/CNN\n\nItaly has the third oldest population in the world, but Meloni and her party have been working to connect with Italy’s youth, the next generation of voters. She herself became involved in politics at 15, after registering with Youth Front, the youth wing of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), a party established by Giorgio Almirante, who was a minister in the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini’s government.\n\nFrancesco Todde is a leader of the National Youth movement, a political movement put in place by Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party in 2014 to connect with a younger generation of politically interested Italians who have been frustrated with the political status quo.\n\nFrancesco Todde, Elisa Segnini Bocchia and Simone D'Alpa are members of the Brothers of Italy's youth movement. Valentina DiDonato/CNN\n\n“Giorgia Meloni comes from a political youth path, so she always paid a lot of attention to the youth and made reforms for the youth. At the start of her political career she was minister of youth,” he told CNN.\n\nElisa Segnini Bocchia, another committed member of the National Youth movement, responds to why some are quick to associate this movement with fascism, saying: “Our past isn’t our future. So, we don’t look at the past. We look for the new future.”", "authors": ["Valentina Di Donato Ben Wedeman Antonia Mortensen", "Valentina Di Donato", "Ben Wedeman", "Antonia Mortensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/joe-biden/2021/01/20/joe-biden-oath-president-inauguration/4178642001/", "title": "Joe Biden sworn in as 46th president of the United States", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. became the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, sworn in to an office that had eluded him for decades at the site of a violent insurrection just two weeks before.\n\nHe took the oath of office with his history-making vice president, Kamala Harris, on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, where on Jan. 6 a violent mob stormed into the halls of Congress, creating a dark day in American history.\n\nCOVID-19 and safety concerns led to an unprecedented level of security. The streets surrounding the Capitol and the National Mall were filled with armed National Guard members, not thousands of Americans as in previous inaugurations.\n\n\"This is America's Day. This is democracy's day,\" Biden said as he began his inaugural address. \"A day of history and hope. Of renewal and resolve. It's a crucible for the ages. America's been tested anew, and America has risen to the challenge.\"\n\nBiden, at 78 the oldest president to take office in the country’s history, is the first Delawarean and second Catholic to hold the country’s highest office. It’s a job he has coveted since he was senior class president at Archmere Academy before graduating in 1961.\n\nTo be sworn in, Biden placed his hand on a thick Bible bearing a Celtic cross that has been in his family since 1893. It was also used each time he was sworn in as a U.S. senator and when he became vice president in 2009 and 2013. Son Beau also used that Bible when he was sworn in as Delaware attorney general.\n\n\"Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause – a cause of democracy. The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden said, as those assembled cheered.\n\nIt was in Delaware where Biden first established his brand of retail politics, and where his life became marked by tragedy, losing his first wife and daughter in a car crash, and later his son, Beau, to cancer.\n\nKNOWING BEAU: A Delaware connection, on Inauguration Day\n\nAll this helped shape a politician known for his empathy.\n\nIn a goodbye to Delaware on Tuesday, Biden was overcome with emotion, declaring: “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart.”\n\nKamala Harris became the country’s first female and first woman of color to serve as vice president on Wednesday. She was sworn in before Biden.\n\nSpeaking near the sites of Dr. Martin Luther King's fabled \"I Have a Dream\" civil rights speech in 1963 and women's suffrage marches in 1912, Biden said, \"Don't tell me things can't change\" in reference to Harris.\n\nBiden’s presidency comes 50 years after he was first elected to New Castle County Council. With four decades in the U.S. Senate, eight years as vice president and two failed presidential attempts, Biden found his moment as the country’s commander-in-chief.\n\nHe will now lead a nation in a state of grieving likely rivaled only by the Great Depression, some historians say.\n\nFacing the Washington Monument honoring the first president, Biden referred to the \"sacred oath\" 45 before him had taken and said the responsibility is on \"We, the people, who seek a more perfect union\" to rectify ongoing problems together.\n\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities,\" Biden said. \"Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain.\"\n\nBiden presented himself during the campaign as a foil to former President Donald Trump. Biden has vowed to bring normalcy back to the White House and has expressed his belief that bipartisanship still exists in Washington.\n\nFIRST 100 DAYS:Biden unveils ambitious COVID-19, economic relief plan\n\nAlthough Democrats now have control of Congress, it is by a razor thin margin. It remains to be seen how quickly the Biden administration will be able to enact its ambitious agenda – administering 100 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 100 days and passing a $1.9 trillion relief package – as an impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump still looms in the U.S. Senate.\n\nBiden is expected to sign 15 executive orders on Wednesday, many of which will overturn policies created by the Trump administration.\n\nFour years ago, Trump gave an inaugural address remembered for his pledge to end “American carnage.” Yet in that time, the country has seemingly become more divided and has struggled to defeat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic fallout.\n\nMost recently, many point to Trump's rhetoric after the election, when he spread unproven claims of a rigged outcome, as inciting the violence at the U.S. Capitol as lawmakers were certifying the Electoral College results.\n\n\"We must reject the culture,\" Biden said, \"in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.''\n\nTrump did not attend Biden’s inauguration, defying decades of tradition by outgoing presidents. Instead, former Vice President Mike Pence was the sole representative of the Trump White House.\n\nEMPATHIZER IN CHIEF:Americans are grieving. How Joe Biden is uniquely qualified for this moment\n\nBy the time Biden took the oath of office, Trump had returned to his home in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"We come together as one nation, under God indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power, as we have for more than two centuries,\" Biden said after mentioning the recent siege on the Capitol, where he served 36 years in the Senate. \" . . . We set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic cast a somber shadow over the festivities, as the virus is reaching new heights in parts of the country.\n\n\"We are entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus,\" Biden said. \"We must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.\"\n\nOn the eve of the inauguration, Biden led a vigil for the 400,000 victims of the pandemic in front of the Reflecting Pool at the Lincoln Memorial. During Wednesday's oration, he briefly paused so he and those watching could offer them a silent prayer.\n\nQuoting Lincoln on Wednesday, Biden said that when the 16th president signed the Emancipation Proclamation he had stated \"My whole soul is in it.\"\n\nFAMILY HEIRLOOM: Biden Bible dates to 19th century\n\n\"Today,\" Biden said, \"on this January day, my whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation, and I ask every American to join me in this cause.\"\n\nTuesday's was the first national ceremony honoring those who died from the virus. In the past year, Biden has spoken openly of his own grief, particularly the death of his son Beau Biden.\n\nThe Delaware Attorney General died of brain cancer in 2015, and had urged his father to run in 2016. While Biden delivered his inaugural addrress Wednesday, a man in uniform kneeled at Beau Biden's grave at St. Joseph on The Brandywine church in Greenville\n\nDELAWARE'S POTUS:The story of Joe Biden, Delaware's most prominent politician\n\nHis memory played a significant role in Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. He was mentioned in almost every speech, and his son’s friendship with Harris also factored into him choosing her as his running mate.\n\nBiden frequently touched on racial strife and injustice during his address.\n\n\"The cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,\" he said. \"The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\"\n\nBiden then brought up the \"cry for survival\" from the planet, referring to climate change, and \"the rise of political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism\" that must be confronted and \"we will defeat.\"\n\nBiden referred to the \"constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal, and the harsh ugly reality of racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.\"\n\nHe urged Americans to become unified to forge \"our historic moment.\"\n\n\"We must meet this moment as the United States of America,\" he said, emphasizing the word \"united.\"\n\nLooking beyond U.S. shores, he said, \"the world is watching,\" Biden also vowed to \"repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.\"\n\nWhile people could access the blocked off streets on foot, much of D.C. was empty Wednesday as National Guard soldiers with weapons by their sides patrolled the edges of the secure zone. Capitol police and National Guard members were the only people in the streets as a few others in the area waited patiently for the presidential motorcade to come through.\n\nThe capital still tried to create a patriotic air. American flags adorned lamp posts, twisting and tangling as cold winds swept them about. Rows of flags stood just behind barricades. At the White House, the bitter wind made trees sing and punctuated an otherwise quiet area. Early morning rain and even a moment of snow added a bit of surprise to an already historic inauguration.\n\nFollowing the oath of office, the Bidens and Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThey will be joined by President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, President George W. Bush, Laura Bush, President Bill Clinton, and Secretary Hillary Clinton.\n\n“With purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time,\" Biden concluded in his address, \"sustained by faith, driven by conviction, devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts.”\n\nStaff reporters Kevin Tresolini, Marina Affo and Patricia Talorico contributed to this article.\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

Now suburban New Jersey towns are targets ...", "text": "WESTFIELD — Donna Vallario knows the so-called blue wave of support for Democrats has washed over this suburban Union County town. She's part of it.\n\n“I vote blue no matter who, honestly,\" the 53-year-old marketing director said. \"I just feel like the Republicans have done nothing good in a really long time.\"\n\nVallario has lived in Westfield, an affluent town of about 30,000 residents in the suburbs of New York City, for 18 years. In that time, the town and voting districts around it have shifted from a Republican stronghold to within reach for Democrats.\n\nIt is suburban communities like Westfield that are undergoing a political shift and will take center stage in the 2020 contests, not only in New Jersey but across the nation. They're home to grassroots groups that gathered in response to President Donald Trump's election and then got out the progressive vote in 2018 — with a momentum they pledge to carry forward to 2020.\n\nGroups like Westfield 20/20, NJ 11th For Change and NJ7 Forward helped elect four new Democrats from New Jersey to Congress in 2018, building a 11-1 majority that mimicked the blue wave of Democrats unseating Republicans across the country.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThese groups and their voters have helped fuel a gradual — but not absolute — transformation in towns like Westfield. The town swore in its first female mayor, a Democrat who bested the longtime Republican incumbent, last year. Over the course of the last two elections, Democrats have won near total control of the Town Council.\n\nThe Legislative district around this town was a target for Democrats who hoped to flip the state Assembly seats in last week's election, though the incumbent Republicans, Minority Leader Jon Bramnick and Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz, declared victory. The result evoked conflicting messages from party leaders, with Democrats focusing on local victories in towns and counties, and Republicans saying they saw building momentum for next year.\n\nBramnick and Munoz tallied about 3,000 more votes than their challengers, a margin that's giving hope to Democrats. Though the largest group of voters in this district are unaffiliated with either party, the number of registered Democrats has overtaken the number of Republicans in the last four years, according to New Jersey Division of Elections data.\n\n“You can’t necessarily get it all done in one day,\" Gov. Phil Murphy, a first-term Democrat, said last week, speaking about the Assembly district that includes Westfield. \"But I'm incredibly proud, staying with the Legislature for a minute, that we were really competitive.\"\n\nStory continues below the graph\n\nState GOP Chairman Doug Steinhardt has put the area on his list of five congressional districts his party will seek to flip next year. Westfield is in Congressional District 7, where Republicans claim a slight registration edge, of about 2,500 votes, over Democrats. Last week's state election, in which Republicans gained two state Assembly seats and one Senate seat in South Jersey while staving off Democratic challengers in districts like the one surrounding Westfield, is a good sign, Steinhardt said.\n\n“I hope people view it as a bit of an appetizer and it makes them hungry for more victories going forward,\" he said. \"It’s going to take everybody rolling up their sleeves.”\n\nBut Bramnick, a moderate Republican who lives in Westfield and has distanced himself from Trump, and Munoz holding their seats last week may not be a bellwether of what's to come, experts say. The presidential election will likely bring significantly larger voter turnout than when Assembly races were the top draw.\n\n\"One of the things we already know about next year is that Trump supporters and Trump opponents are going to be really fired up about Election Day in 2020,\" said Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.\n\n\"It’s the suburban voters that can really swing back and forth,\" Rasmussen said. \"If they vote for Bramnick and Munoz, are they willing to vote to Trump?\"\n\nNew Jersey as a whole is reliably blue. Hillary Clinton won 550,000 more votes here in 2016 than Donald Trump. In that race, 68 percent of New Jerseyans eligible to vote cast ballots. In 2015, the last time Assembly races were the top of the ticket, turnout was 22 percent of eligible voters.\n\n“With Trump at top of the ticket, its an entirely different calculation,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"The fact that Republicans didn’t win in blowouts in those districts, it suggests [Democratic Reps. Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill] are in decent position.\"\n\nWhile nothing is guaranteed, he said, \"it just means they’re not going to be easy Republican pickups.”\n\nRepublicans' gains in South Jersey could signal a \"hard time\" for freshman Democratic Reps. Jeff Van Drew and Andy Kim, Murray said. Van Drew was one of two congressional Democrats who voted against advancing impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\nRasmussen expected voters to stick to party lines and vote as they did in 2018 in support of Van Drew and Kim. That year, Van Drew won his seat by about 20,000 votes, while Kim ousted incumbent Republican Tom MacArthur by just 4,000 votes.\n\nLegal weed, immigrant driver's licenses:These issues may see action now that NJ election is over\n\nFor subscribers:NJ lawmakers cost you millions by holding a second public job.

Grassroots group Westfield 20/20 hopes to grow the margin next year, helping Malinowski defeat challenger Tom Kean Jr., a Republican state senator who lives in Westfield.\n\nThe purpose of Westfield 20/20, co-founded by Lillian Duggan and Marci Bandelli after the 2016 election, is \"to try and get people together to try and figure out a way to respond, make change, go in the other direction,\" Duggan said.\n\n\"People needed a place to go. We gave it to them,\" said Bandelli, a 52-year-old psychotherapist.\n\nThey have grown to more than 2,300 Facebook members. This year, they endorsed the Democratic challengers in the Assembly contests, and on Election Day, Bandelli and Duggan waved signs, manned phone banks and canvassed for their candidates.\n\nDespite defeat in the Assembly races, they're gearing up for 2020 with a goal of getting Trump out and keeping Malinowski in, said Duggan, a 51-year-old freelance editor.\n\n“There’s a lot of energy. Tom [Malinowski] has great support here,\" she said. \"We'll definitely continue to fight for him.”\n\nBut while Westfield's progressives are gaining momentum, and now registered Democrats in town outnumber Republicans, conservative voters are holding their ground.\n\nHarold Star has lived in town for 30 years and typically votes Republican, including for the Bramnick-Munoz ticket.\n\n\"I’ve always been a staunch Republican in terms of platform,\" said the 67-year-old retiree, who designed office spaces for a living. \"But now, I think what we need to do is have both parties move to the center, where we can get some things done.”\n\nStar said he will likely vote for Trump next year, though he doesn't talk about his vote that way.\n\n\"Would I vote for Trump? No, I’ll vote against the Democrats,\" he said. \"Do I like everything [Trump] does and how he does it? No. Has he gotten some things done that he promised he would do? Yes.”\n\nJennifer Melvin, a Republican who voted for Trump in 2016, has lived in Westfield for nearly 20 years. Melvin, a 50-year-old mother of three, last week voted for a Democrat for Town Council at the same time she voted to keep the Republican incumbents in the state Assembly. She knew the candidates personally, she said, noting she's seen the political shift in her town.\n\n\"Most of our friends are Democrats — not that we get into big political debates, but it comes up,\" she said. \"There's [a] possibility of change. This was a close race for Bramnick.\"\n\nMelvin doesn't yet know how she'll vote in 2020, but Trump is a possibility, she said.\n\n\"I have to see who the candidate is going to be,\" she said. \"I think for a lot of people I could say Republicans are not happy with the words that come out of his mouth. I roll my eyes and try not to look at that so much as things he’s actually doing and getting done.\"\n\nVoters like Vallario, the marketing director who now votes along party lines, say there has to be change. Vallario said she didn't always vote with Democrats, but now she does because of the conduct of the country's commander in chief.\n\n\"I'm not sure I could stay here if Trump gets elected again,\" she said. \"I really don’t think I can take another four years.\"\n\nStacey Barchenger: @sbarchenger; 732-427-0114; sbarchenger@gannettnj.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/12"}]}

Terry McAuliffe lost his reelection campaign, at least in part because his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, repeatedly declared that McAuliffe’s reelection would lead to the widespread teaching of critical race theory in schools across the Commonwealth. Simply put, attacking critical race theory helped the now-governor of Virginia secure his win.\n\nCritical race theory is a set of concepts seeking to explain the structural underpinnings of inequality and racism in the United States. But the term has been attacked by its critics as unfairly pinning blame on White Americans for some of society’s most pernicious ills.\n\nClassroom discussions about race, and what I like to call “truth teaching,” haven’t been as much of a talking point as they were a year ago, and critical race theory isn’t being debated as much in this year’s midterm campaigns. It doesn’t have to be. For the most part, conservatives have already succeeded in banishing talk about racism from the classroom.\n\nAfter a campaign of intentional misinformation and fear mongering, critical race theory quickly became one of our nation’s most contested and misunderstood education issues. Conservative strategists successfully convinced millions of Americans, including concerned parents of school-aged children, that it was being taught in K-12 districts across the country. No evidence exists to confirm that this was actually the case.\n\nAs of last month, elected officials in 42 states have introduced legislation that broadly aims to ban the teaching of racial and social justice topics in public schools, according to data compiled by Education Week. Similar bills have passed in 17 of those states. Many more school boards have enacted local bans. In addition, books about race have been banned in numerous districts.\n\nThe campaign to eliminate critical race theory succeeded mostly because White parents and state lawmakers were led to believe that White school children were being made to feel badly about being White. Where’s the proof that teachers, nearly 80% of whom are White, were doing this? They weren’t, certainly not in any widespread fashion.\n\nWith no credible evidence of an actual problem and no opportunity to vote on the issue, citizens who recognize the value of teaching our children the truth about America’s racial past and present won’t have a voice in the upcoming election.\n\nThere’s at least one state where voters will decide this fall what gets taught in the classroom. West Virginians will consider a ballot question known as the Education Accountability Amendment, which if passed, would amend the state constitution to give the majority-Republican legislature more control over just about every aspect of public schooling.\n\nUntil bans on truth teaching are lifted, our democracy will become increasingly susceptible to the exacerbation of the racial tensions, inequities, injustices and violent acts of racism that have always kept America from reaching its full potential. Educators, meanwhile, will have unchecked authority to lie to school children about race. One recent example of this is educators’ failed attempt to change slavery to “involuntary relocation” in Texas schools.\n\nThose who truly care about the advancement of our democracy must insist that its full truth be taught. Unfortunately, we may have to wait a while before that discussion resumes in our public schools.\n\nShaun Harper is a professor at the Rossier School of Education and the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.

Having taught for over 20 years, my greatest joy is participating in a democratic institution that is for everyone.\n\nI stand for all my students by committing myself to perpetual learning and growth. I continue to update instructional strategies, let go of old projects that no longer serve my current students and adapt my curriculum and language to ensure my approaches are culturally sensitive.\n\nI teach well-rounded history to the best of my ability as I continually strive to keep my background knowledge robust. I am here to hold space for all my students regardless of their identity, political positions or other affiliations. To do this, I must rigorously and regularly examine my biases, consider what and whom I am centering and why.\n\nThat’s why it was so disheartening to see laws like House Bill 2 (sometimes referred to as the “divisive concepts” law) pass in New Hampshire. The disrespect and lack of trust it communicates to the hundreds of honorable educators I know and work with cannot be overstated.\n\nThe measure, formally known as the Right to Freedom from Discrimination in Public Workplaces and Education bill, was written with the mistaken idea that discrimination is somehow endorsed or practiced in public spaces and classrooms.\n\nThe new law bars educators from teaching that any particular group is inherently racist, sexist or otherwise oppressive. It purports to promote teaching about people without regards to their race, gender, disability or other differences. But the language is so vague that it discourages teachers from having classroom conversations about race, racism and discrimination.\n\nLegislation like HB2 and similar laws in other states are obstacles to growth, student well-being and compassionate practices. HB2 prohibits schools in New Hampshire from creating mandatory equity training for faculty because someone might “feel bad.”\n\nBecause I teach social studies, I’ve developed a healthy resilience around complex conversations and divergent opinions. My entire career has been centered around navigating one tricky topic or another. I’ve mediated dialogues around presidential elections, the events of September 11, different wars and conflicts, and facilitated a variety of debates.\n\nThrough it all, I’ve dedicated myself to building a foundation of trust, joy, understanding, respectful discourse, care and acceptance in my classroom. Some of us are finding that harder to achieve under the new legislation. For example, a colleague who teaches in a nearby school district was told that if she openly said slavery was a “bad practice,” she must make it clear to her students that she is expressing an “opinion.” It’s an experience other teachers in my state have spoken about as well.\n\nAt what point did we decide it’s divisive to take a stance on cruel and dehumanizing activities? Who are we harming by taking a hardline on the concept of slavery? Our silence is an endorsement. That is our ethical crisis. That is what fear-mongering yields.\n\nTeachers deserve better: Shame and blame have been imposed upon a profession that is filled with loving, kind, compassionate and principled people. Choosing a career in education is almost always driven by a heart-centered desire to make a positive difference. I have never encountered a teacher in four districts, two states and 22 years who displayed devious political intentions.\n\nThe conflation of equity and inclusion work with “critical race theory” has led to wildly inaccurate and unfounded accusations. This “threat” has taken seed in the imaginations of some legislators and families.\n\nFuture voters must understand that disagreement is normal and healthy. Changing your mind in light of new evidence is logical and admirable. Nothing could be more American, patriotic or democratic than striving for a more just society.\n\nFeeling discomfort and dissonance often accompanies growth and learning; this is something I strive to normalize for my students. Teachers teach critical thinking and analysis by asking students to wrestle with challenging ideas and evidence. At some point, we have confused feeling uneasy with a lack of safety. There is a crucial difference.\n\nPoorly constructed laws were drafted to stop good, productive work under the guise of being “anti-critical race theory” and have resulted in the oppression of free thought, critical thinking and children. I know we can do better.\n\nMy message to lawmakers? Trust teachers. Asking them to be thoughtful, sensitive and inclusive is always reasonable. You’ll find that’s what they generally already are.\n\nValerie Wolfson, a middle school social studies teacher, was named the 2020 New Hampshire Social Studies Teacher of the year.\n\nNeal McCluskey: American schools have a diversity problem\n\nNeal McCluskey Neal McCluskey\n\nPublic schooling struggles with diversity. From early battles over the Bible to current fights over race, gender identity, prayer and more, public schooling – in which all must fund a single system of government schools – inevitably pits people with diverse values, needs and backgrounds against each other.\n\nBut why are conflicts burning especially hot now?\n\nCovid-19 set the conditions, creating clashes over in-person instruction and masking that many saw as having literally life-and-death stakes.\n\nThe murder of George Floyd added fuel, prompting many public school officials to target systemic racism – discrimination built into American institutions – and conservatives to demand colorblindness and an emphasis on America’s basic goodness. Graphic novels, such as “Gender Queer,” with graphic depictions of sexual activity, and other books on hot-button topics sparked dueling accusations of “hate” and “indoctrination.”\n\nThis all happened amid rapid demographic and social change.\n\nIn 2000, the US population was 71% non-Hispanic white. By 2020, that was down to about 58%. Gay marriage support skyrocketed from 27% of Americans in 1996 to 77% in 2021, while the share of people belonging to a church, synagogue or mosque plummeted from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020.\n\nWhat can deescalate education politics?\n\nNot “parents’ rights,” a term that can encompass useful things like requirements that districts share curriculum information, but sometimes seems invoked so that just one group of parents will get what it wants.\n\nGiving parents more say does nothing to change a system that forces diverse people, including parents, to fund – and fight to control – government-run schools.\n\nFreedom is the answer: Attach money to students – as many other countries do – and let families choose among diverse options. This can be accomplished through universal education savings accounts, such as Arizona recently enacted, scholarship tax credits and other choice vehicles.\n\nRegardless of how it is done, the goal of choice is to enable diverse families to access education they think is right rather than forcing neighbor to defeat neighbor to control public schools.\n\nNeal McCluskey directs the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute and is the author of “The Fractured Schoolhouse: Reimagining Education for a Free, Equal, and Harmonious Society.”\n\nDenise Forte and Randi Weingarten: How we can recover ground lost to Covid-19 closures\n\nDenise Forte Courtesy Denise Forte\n\nRandi Weingarten AFT\n\nAmerican students’ steady progress in reading and math has become the latest casualty of the Covid-19 era.\n\nIn the first results since the pandemic began, the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) showed steep declines in the math and reading scores of fourth- and eighth-grade students. It’s not hard to see why. The pandemic has disrupted three years of students’ lives.\n\nMore than 200,000 children in the United States are grieving the loss of at least one parent to Covid-19. The economic fallout of the pandemic exacerbated food and housing insecurity. People were, and still are, stressed and scared. And remote learning has always been an inadequate substitute for in-person instruction, although NAEP results show comparable drops in student performance in school systems that were quicker to reopen.\n\nSome critics see this as a chance to point fingers and to use kids as political pawns. We see it as an urgent call to institute short-term and long-term investments and proven strategies to support students’ emotional development and to accelerate learning, especially for Black and Latino students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were underserved and behind their peers prior to the pandemic.\n\nWhat we must not allow is for students and educators to be dragged into bad-faith battles over bathroom access and participation on sports teams as an unwelcome distraction from ensuring that every student receives a great education and the supports needed to thrive academically and socially.\n\nThe good news is that we know what works from research and experience, and there is historic federal funding to accelerate learning and to start to remedy long-standing inequities. Resources from the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan and the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund can be directed so students have better access to experienced, diverse and certified teachers, high-quality summer and after-school programs, engaging and relevant curriculums and mental health supports.\n\nBoth our organizations are engaged in longer-term strategies to address the needs of kids, families and communities, but there are interventions that can help students right now.\n\nIn the short term, targeted, intensive tutoring has large positive effects on both math and reading achievement. Teachers tend to be the most consistently effective tutors; however, recent studies have found that paraprofessionals (teaching assistants), AmeriCorps volunteers and others who are trained to support student learning can be just as effective when tutoring one-on-one or in small groups.\n\nMany states are using state and federal funds to invest in strategies to increase the diversity of the workforce. Access to a racially and culturally diverse teacher workforce is beneficial for all pre-K-12 students, particularly for students of color, who often thrive in classrooms led by teachers who share their racial and cultural background.\n\nThe pandemic’s impact on children cannot be measured by assessments alone. But we hope that the alarm over the steep drop in NAEP scores creates urgency to address the conditions that contributed to the decline, many of which far predate the pandemic.\n\nEducators didn’t need to see declines in test scores to know what to do right now: focus like a laser on helping our kids recover and thrive.\n\nSafety was required to return to in-person teaching and learning. Now is the time to double down on proven strategies, using the resources we are fortunate to have, to deliver on a promise the US has not yet fulfilled—providing every child access to a high quality public education, without exception.\n\nDenise Forte is the CEO at The Education Trust. Randi Weingarten is president of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nJay Richards: The battle over parents’ rights in education is just getting started\n\nJay Richards The Heritage Foundation\n\nIt should come as no surprise that parents have been fighting for their rights so vociferously when it comes to public education. They’re fighting because they sense that those rights are under attack.\n\nIt started with the lockdowns in 2020. For the first time, many parents suddenly saw, courtesy of online conferencing apps like Zoom, what their kids were being taught. And they didn’t like it: Toxic and divisive ideas about race – disguised as lessons on slavery and racism – contradicted the belief in racial equality that most Americans – whatever their politics – shared with civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nBut critical race theory is far less shocking than the radical gender ideology that seems to have overtaken our nation’s schools. It teaches children that “some people are boys, some people are girls, some people are both, neither, or somewhere in between”’ – as one popular children’s book puts it.\n\nSchools are promoting the notion that some kids – perhaps many kids if recent trends continue – are born in the wrong body. Suddenly, from Florida to Texas to Wyoming, parents are discovering that schools are teaching, seemingly across the curriculum, that an internal sense of gender trumps biological sex. Worse, some schools are changing, at their students’ request – but without their parents’ knowledge or consent – their students’ names and pronouns to conform to a child’s surprising new “gender identity.”\n\nWhen parents come to school board meetings to complain, far too many are met with silence or risible accusations that they are politicizing education. Parents have the primary right and responsibility to raise and teach their children.\n\nMany parents delegate part of the teaching task to schools, in an act of trust. Rather than acting as faithful stewards of that trust, too many schools have decided that it’s their job to alienate kids from “regressive” views of their parents.\n\nIs it any wonder that this has proved controversial?\n\nWe could dissipate some of the heat by increasing the rights of parents over their children’s schooling. States should connect school money to children, rather than to school buildings. Universal school choice for everyone – rich and poor, conservative and liberal – would not just make schools better and more competitive. It would make them less of an arena for the culture war that is otherwise roiling our culture.\n\nJay Richards is the William E. Simon Senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, where he is also director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family.\n\nAkilah Alleyne: The education investments we need to make\n\nAkilah Alleyne Akilah Alleyne\n\nBook bans and censorship debates have always existed, but America’s children are facing an unprecedented moment in history. Today, school resources are stretched thin, schools are facing teacher and staff shortages and districts are still grappling with the long-term effects of the pandemic on student learning, as individuals’ rights to quality education are under increasing threat.\n\nImportant investments toward providing more supports for teachers, classroom aid and salary increases – such as by passing the RAISE Act – are needed now more than ever. That measure would provide teachers tax credits totaling as much as $15,000 each year.\n\nRather than addressing the real challenges facing teachers, many MAGA extremists have taken aim at books, racial and gender inclusion and more. Defunding the Department of Education, an ongoing federal level tactic among other changes in public school funding, should not be a topic of debate. However, it has also been central to MAGA Republicans’ federal policy agenda and could have devastating consequences for students nationwide.\n\nWhile parents are working with teachers and librarians to ensure that every child is acknowledged in school curricula and has a chance to thrive in school, regardless of who they are or where they live, far-right MAGA extremists are increasingly running for vacant school board seats or for reelection to gain control and power over decision-making at all levels of government.\n\nStudents and teachers want safer schools that reflect the diversity of their families and teach truthful history. They can be best supported through policy making that increases equity and understanding in our school systems by supporting their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, not denying them.\n\nAkilah Alleyne is the director for K-12 Education at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington, DC.\n\nRoss Wiener: Restoring trust in public schools should be a national priority\n\nRoss Wiener Courtesy Ross Wiener\n\nPublic schools educate approximately 90% of young Americans. The society we are, and the one we will become, is profoundly shaped by public education.\n\nIt has made America more inclusive, improving outcomes across lines of race, gender and ability status. The result has been overwhelming bipartisan support for public schools over generations.\n\nBut the evidence of a crisis in our public schools is overwhelming: Hundreds of thousands of students have disappeared from school rolls, derailing their futures and foreshadowing budget woes when emergency Covid-19 relief funds expire. The Nation’s Report Card reported historic declines in reading and math scores, not surprising given pandemic disruptions.\n\nWhat’s more, educator morale is low, exacerbating staff shortages. Classrooms are targets in the culture wars, leading to book bans and speech codes that never end well. Young people report epidemic levels of anxiety and depression.\n\nThe pandemic and broader turmoil afflicting the nation have left public education in peril. Every one of us has a stake in reversing this decline because, whether we’re talking about growing the economy or strengthening democracy, every path to redeeming the promise of America runs through public schools. Addressing lost learning is important, and so is addressing the lack of trust in public education.\n\nPublic education has played an enormous societal role: In the 19th century, common schools forged shared identity when government of the people, by the people, for the people was a novel idea. In the 20th century, universal high school fueled the growth of the middle class.\n\nOver the last several decades, the broad vision that propelled America’s public schools has dwindled into a narrow, technocratic policy frame.\n\n“A Nation at Risk,” a major report on education released by the Reagan administration in 1983, used fear-based arguments to argue that reading and math test scores were essential for national security. This logic eventually transformed test scores from one critical indicator (which they are) to the very purpose of public schools (which they are not).\n\nEarly accountability reforms led to gains among low-income students and students of color, but progress plateaued a decade ago. Test-and-accountability reforms over-promised and under-delivered and no longer command broad bipartisan support.\n\nRenewing the promise of public education starts by rebuilding trust. Local education leaders were left holding the bag on school closings that should have been shared with health officials and political leaders.\n\nSchools were expected to arrange meals, computers and broadband access – burdens they often shouldered alone. This was thrust on school systems where teachers already felt beleaguered and disrespected; in truth, our schools have operated in a low-trust environment for years. This led to schools being closed for far too long with continuing consequences, not only in diminished learning but also in diminished public support.\n\nWe must recommit to the mission of public education.\n\nThe Aspen Institute recently convened a bipartisan group of state policymakers to ask: What do we want to be true about the opportunities our public schools offer? After reflecting on values and reviewing research, these policymakers authored “Opportunity to Learn, Responsibility to Lead.” The principles they developed refocus attention on the core purposes of education in a diverse democracy and market-driven economy. It presents an evidence-informed vision for schools as engines of opportunity, which could galvanize the political middle to coalesce around a more positive approach.\n\nState leaders should call for a public conversation about the future of their state and the role of public education in realizing that future. Unspent federal Covid-19 relief can be a perfect catalyst for this work. Grants to community-based organizations and PTAs, after-school providers, 4-H Clubs and faith-based youth groups can support stakeholders in articulating what they want to be true about their public schools and identifying opportunities in their communities. Universities, chambers of commerce and other civic organizations can use their own resources to sponsor similar inquiries.\n\nExperience demonstrates there is much common ground to be found in efforts to strengthen public schools. Channeling Americans’ shared commitment to opportunity is the ideal antidote to the cynicism and division currently plaguing the policy and politics of public education.\n\nRoss Wiener is executive director of the Education & Society Program at the Aspen Institute and the author of “We Are What We Teach.”\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard: We can fix America’s teacher shortage\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard Teach for America\n\nTeacher shortages are not new, especially in schools serving predominantly students from low-income backgrounds, who are disproportionately young people of color. Yet cracks in the system before the pandemic have become gaping crevasses: In February 2022, there were nearly 600,000 fewer educators in public schools than there were in January 2020, and National Center for Education data showed less than half of schools serving majority Black and brown students were fully staffed.\n\nThe organization I lead, Teach For America, has 33 years of experience attracting talented individuals early in their careers to teach in rural and urban classrooms. Our research into the priorities of current college students finds that they want to have an impact on what matters most in the world, and the issue of quality education for all children is in their top five.\n\nHowever, they also want to preserve their mental health and have financial stability, and the teaching profession’s low pay and structures that challenge work-life balance are deterrents – especially when the average student-loan debt is nearly $30,000 and many other professions offer flexible schedules and remote work options. This disconnect affects the profession at large, which has been struggling for years. Between 2008 and 2019, the number of graduates from traditional teacher education programs fell by more than a third.\n\nWe can tackle these issues in a number of ways: by increasing teacher pay; creating financial incentives for effective educators to teach in schools serving low-income communities; expanding student loan forgiveness for teachers, especially in hard-to-staff schools and subjects; ensuring teachers’ have sufficient resources and planning time, proper administrative help and the support of counselors and nurses; and fostering educator wellbeing by offering mental health supports and addressing sources of occupation-related stress.\n\nThese policies and practices will make teaching more desirable and accessible and will work to increase the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the teaching workforce, a move that research shows has a positive impact for students.\n\nAs essential as these efforts are, they are not sufficient to address teacher shortages in the long term. Our country must think boldly at this moment about another problem that needs solving: What if the real issue is not that young adults don’t want to teach, but that the purpose of education has changed drastically and our education system has not kept up? What if we’ve reached the limits of this outmoded system and the conventional role of the teacher?\n\nIt’s time to expand the traditional definition of learning to include all the skills and mindsets that students want and need to thrive in our 21st century world and careers of the future: qualities like developing empathy, sustaining mental health and wellbeing, building relationships and applying learning to solve real-world problems.\n\nRedefining learning opens the door to a more diverse set of adult leaders to work alongside educators and students: professionals in various fields who can support the development of students’ workplace skills; college students who can support digital literacy and serve as tutors and mentors; and any number of community leaders who can support students’ sense of belonging.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor example, technology could allow expert educators to teach multiple classes virtually while a colleague who is expert in creating productive learning spaces – where every student is valued and feels they belong – focuses there. Many teachers excel at both roles – we just don’t have enough of them to staff every classroom in our country. This shift is not only about making teachers’ jobs more sustainable, but also about positioning teachers to further develop their areas of greatest expertise.\n\nFundamental changes of this magnitude don’t happen quickly. But, for too long, we’ve expected teachers to carry the weight of an outmoded education system. We can’t just replenish this system. We must redefine what and how students learn and reimagine the role of the teacher to inspire a new generation of purpose-driven young people to get involved and reinvent the system for a stronger, more equitable future.\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard is the CEO of Teach For America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving educational access, opportunity and outcomes for young people in low-income communities.

Colorful pills drive new warnings about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new wave of concern has spread across the United States over multi-colored “rainbow fentanyl” pills, powders and blocks – that look similar to candy or sidewalk chalk – being sold and used in several states, and potentially posing a threat to young people.\n\nBut parents of young children should not overly panic, and the emergence of this new product is one small part of the larger ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nRainbow fentanyl comes in bright colors and can be used in the form of pills or powder that contain illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, making them extremely addictive and potentially deadly if someone overdoses while trying to achieve a high off of the drugs.\n\nThis multi-colored fentanyl may appeal to young people or fool them into thinking it’s safe, but experts say illicit fentanyl has been hiding in what appears to be other products for a long time, and fentanyl is fentanyl – it’s all dangerous, rainbow or not.\n\n“Colored fentanyl pills have been around for a few years. Typically, they’ve been blue pills labeled ‘M30’ to counterfeit oxycodone, which is a much weaker opioid,” Joseph Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, who has studied trends in illicit fentanyl, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“I think the big difference people are concerned about is with regard to accidental ingestion. People are worried that their kids will take one of these pills thinking they’re another drug or even thinking they’re some sort of candy,” Palamar said. “I don’t think the color of the pills greatly increases danger to people who don’t use fentanyl, but there is always a possibility of someone who uses fentanyl leaving their pills around in the reach of children.”\n\nHe added, “We need to keep in mind that these pills cost money so people aren’t going to be throwing them on the ground for kids to find. I don’t think people will be giving these pills out as Halloween candy.”\n\nWhere rainbow fentanyl warning originated\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning in August advising the public of this “alarming emerging trend” of “colorful fentanyl available across the United States.”\n\nAt the time, the agency said that it and its law enforcement partners seized the brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills across 18 states. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the nation, according to the DEA.\n\nBut the DEA did not specify in its announcement whether rainbow fentanyl had led to overdoses or deaths among young people.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the August announcement.\n\nSince then, some colleges and universities are cautioning students about the presence and dangers of rainbow fentanyl, and the California Department of Public Health has alerted K-12 school administrators in the state about rainbow fentanyl being “a new trend.”\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, physicians have been seeing more fentanyl exposures among both young children and adolescents, Dr. Sam Wang, the hospital’s pediatric toxicologist, told CNN on Friday. While he and his colleagues are aware of rainbow fentanyl warnings, he hasn’t heard any patients or parents mention it.\n\nAfter all, the bottom line, he said, is that fentanyl is fentanyl, whether it comes in the form of rainbow-colored pills or simply a white powder.\n\n“It’s just coming out in a different form to potentially be more attractive, more quote unquote ‘fun’ to use because it looks potentially fun to take,” said Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nAnd when young people use illicit drugs, they sometimes don’t know what they really contain, or how dangerous those substances might be.\n\nWhen it comes to rainbow fentanyl, “the fentanyl itself is going to be the same issue as the counterfeit pharmaceutical fentanyl. We don’t know how much is in it – it can vary. We don’t know the type of fentanyl,” Wang said. “And so those concerns transmit, still, over to this product. It’s just now this looks like it has a potential danger for young children and then also, it’s going to be more attractive for people to use and have consequences from that.”\n\nThe rise of fentanyl\n\nThe United States has been facing an opioid overdose epidemic – and waves of opioid overdose deaths – for decades, starting with a rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the early 2000s, followed by a rise in heroin overdose deaths beginning in 2010 and, most recently, a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths that started in 2013, fueled by potent fentanyl.\n\nPharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe latest data suggest that annual drug overdose deaths have jumped 44% from before the Covid-19 pandemic. There were about 76,000 deaths reported in the 12-month period ending March 2020. The CDC’s latest provisional data show that more than 109,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022.\n\nSynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths in the year ending March 2022. Deaths involving synthetic opioids increased by a staggering 80% over the past two years, CDC data shows.\n\nRainbow fentanyl has been receiving attention due to the bright colors of the products, but the illicit fentanyl that the products contain represents a continuation of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The only difference between rainbow fentanyl and the fentanyl products of the past appears to be the coloring.\n\n“The reason it’s colored is just to differentiate products. If we had a regulated market, they would be differentiated in different ways – we do not. It has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever,” said Maya Doe Simkins, co-founder of the Opioid Safety and Naloxone Network and co-director of Remedy Alliance, a collection of harm reduction groups that work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nSimkins likened the different colors of rainbow fentanyl to how people used food coloring in heroin in the past, and she said the colors are sometimes used to differentiate batches.\n\n“It’s just a differentiation between your product, my product or this batch and the next batch,” she said.\n\nIncreasing fentanyl seizures\n\nIllicit fentanyl has long been hiding in drugs, and its presence appears to be on the rise.\n\nA study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in May, found that the number of fentanyl-containing powder and pills seized by law enforcement in the United States rose between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe weight of powder fentanyl seizures increased from 298.2 kilograms in 2018 to 2,416 kilograms in 2021, and the number of pills seized increased from 42,202 in 2018 to 2,089,186 in 2021, according to the study, of which Palamar was the lead author.\n\n“We found that not only has fentanyl seizures been increasing, but the proportion of pills seized to overall fentanyl seizures has been increasing. The proportion of pill seizures increased from 14% in early 2018 to 29% in late 2021,” Palamar wrote in his email to CNN.\n\n“We don’t have information regarding what these seized pills were purported to be, but we think many were disguised as oxycodone or even Xanax,” he wrote. “Seizures of these counterfeit pills have been increasing at a rapid rate, suggesting increasing availability, and availability is going to continue to increase.”\n\nWith this increase, counterfeit pills have been more difficult to identify, but Palamar said that people can use test strips to detect traces of illicit fentanyl if they have concerns.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“People can purchase fentanyl test strips for as little as a dollar. Most of these strips are meant for urine testing but they can detect the presence of fentanyl if used correctly,” Palamar wrote.\n\n“I highly recommend that anyone who plans to use an illegally purchased pill or an illegal powder like cocaine test the drug before using,” he added. “There are also hundreds of newer fentanyl analogs and other opioids that can be very dangerous that test strips can’t detect. I do worry that test strips will give some people a false sense of security, but they’re something.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/12/read-iowa-gov-kim-reynolds-2021-condition-state-speech-full-text-transcript/6637040002/", "title": "Transcript of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds 2021 Condition of the State ...", "text": "Des Moines Register staff\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds is giving her 2021 Condition of the State speech. This is the transcript of the speech as prepared for delivery:\n\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Governor, legislative leaders and members, justices and judges, my fellow Iowans:\n\nOur state constitution says that, every year, the governor must communicate to the general assembly the condition of the state. That usually happens in the morning on the second day of the legislative session, but tonight I’m breaking with that tradition so that I may speak directly to Iowans.\n\nIt’s been a year — and I’ll let you fill in whatever adjective you want. Covid-19. Civil Unrest. A drought. A derecho. We’ve been beaten and battered in about every way imaginable and some unimaginable. But together, we’ve met every challenge with bravery and outright grit.\n\nWe’re told that “tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance, character.” From what I’ve seen, there’s no shortage of character in the people of Iowa. And despite what we’ve been through—or maybe because of it—the condition of our state has never been stronger.\n\nWe live in a place where 82-year-old Blanche Chizek from Britt sewed over 1,000 masks and baked dozens of pastries for healthcare workers. Where 17-year-old Tanner Kenin recruited his friends to start a grocery delivery company for the elderly. Where an anonymous donor gave out more than $80,000 in gift cards from local businesses to every resident of Earlham. And where countless other Iowans donated food, time, and resources.\n\nThousands of Iowans—truck drivers, manufacturers, grocery store clerks, meat-processing workers, and so many others—showed up to work everyday to make sure that the people of this state, and the world, were fed. Police officers, social workers, and government employees worked around the clock to deliver PPE and make sure Iowans continued to receive the services they depend on. Small businesses adjusted their hours and often how they operate to protect their employees and customers.\n\nAnd nowhere was the dedication and commitment to others more evident than in our healthcare system.\n\nNurses, doctors, technicians, janitors, pharmacists, EMTs, social workers, and the thousands of direct care workers in our senior living communities: In 2020, you worked some of the longest hours, in the most uncertain conditions. Your actions saved lives. Your spirit inspired us.\n\nAnd you didn’t just provide medical care. Your patients often couldn’t be with their loved ones, so you also provided them comfort and company. You sat with them when no one else could. You held their hand, facilitated calls to family, and in some cases stood by them while they took their last breath. While many of us were shielded from the worst of the pandemic, you were on the front lines everyday.\n\nWe cannot sufficiently express our gratitude, but we will try. Please join me in thanking these heroic Iowans.\n\nIowans are well-accustomed to the extremes of Mother Nature’s temper, but the derecho in August was unlike anything we’ve seen. Hurricane-force winds recorded as high as 140 miles an hour raged across our state. Over one-third of our counties impacted; 584,000 households left without power; thousands of homes damaged. Millions of acres of crops were flattened, and as grain bins crumpled, we lost over 100 million bushels of grain storage. It was a disaster of unprecedented scope.\n\nIn Marshalltown, the derecho left behind three times as much debris as the F3 tornado that ripped through the city’s downtown in 2018. And the scars will be evident for generations to come in places like Cedar Rapids and Marion, where they lost more than half of their tree canopy.\n\nWe praise the dedication of the more than 200 National Guard members who deployed to help remove debris; the local police, fire, public works departments, and emergency managers, who stepped up and served their neighbors tirelessly; and the dedicated staff of state agencies like DHS, DNR and DOT, who pressed ahead where their state needed them.\n\nWe thank the thousands of line workers who came from across the country to supplement the crews from Alliant, MidAmerican, and our other utilities to restore electricity with astonishing speed, often to the applause of Iowans.\n\nI spoke with some of the line workers from out of state, and heard not only that our disaster was as bad as the aftermath of hurricanes whose names have been retired, but also that Iowans showed more hope, more patience, and more gratitude than people from anywhere else.\n\nGood corporate citizenship was put on display not only by our power companies, but by essential suppliers like Hy-Vee and Fareway that donated food, water, and supplies. It was shown by small-business owners like Willie Ray Fairley, whose Willie Ray’s Q Shack gave away hundreds of meals a day to people whose own refrigerators and stoves weren’t working. Willie Ray didn’t just fill hungry stomachs, he fed a sense of community. And that’s what makes a disaster bearable.\n\nWhat happened this year went beyond Iowa nice. You showed a humanity that rivals what most of us have seen in our lifetime.\n\nOur job now is to hold on to that humanity. 2020 left its mark on everyone, but not evenly. There are people across this state who are still hurting. Many lost their job or their business or even their home.\n\nAnd many lost loved ones to this horrible pandemic. For them, and for anyone who lost someone this year, whatever the cause, saying goodbye was even harder than it usually is. You may not have been able to be with them while they were sick, to hold their hand one last time, or to fully celebrate their life at a funeral with all of those they loved.\n\nWhether you’re in the chamber or watching at home, please take a moment, bow your head, and remember all of those we lost this year and the loved ones they leave behind.\n\nThank you.\n\nWhen I stood here last year, our fiscal health was strong. We had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, incomes were going up, and our economy was roaring. Then 2020 happened.\n\nWe took a hit like everyone else, but we didn’t falter long. Because of conservative budgeting practices, Iowa’s diverse economy, the decision to keep over 80% of our businesses open, and the tenacity of our people, Iowa isn’t facing a massive budget shortfall like many states.\n\nAs I stand here tonight, our unemployment rate has returned to 3.6%, one of the lowest in the country, and our GDP grew over 36% in the third quarter of 2020, outpacing the nation. Iowa’s coming back, and we’re coming back strong.\n\nIowa’s success has always been about turning obstacles into opportunities and overcoming adversity together. The post-Covid world won't be the same as the pre-Covid world. And it shouldn’t.\n\nWatch live:Gov. Kim Reynolds calls on Iowa Legislature to ‘immediately’ send in-person education bill to her desk\n\nBe bold to solve the 'challenges facing our economy'\n\nWe’ve learned a lot. Entire sectors of our economy were forced to innovate overnight and adapt to survive. We can approach Iowa’s economic recovery in a number of ways. We can return to where we were, which is a realistic but still ambitious goal. Or we can take what we’ve learned and the innovation that’s been applied over the past ten months and capitalize on the opportunity to reimagine, modernize, and possibly restructure everything from healthcare and education, to our workforce and quality of life.\n\nIt’s about ensuring our future prosperity is widespread and reaches all people and all parts of Iowa, including those that too often feel left out when times are good.\n\nThat’s why I formed the Economic Recovery Advisory Board this summer. Chaired by Ruan Transportation CEO Ben McLean, the 15-member board and 350 working group members volunteered their time and talents to meet my charge to be bold, innovative and direct about the challenges facing our economy. I want to thank them for their diligent work to make sure that we support every part of Iowa and every Iowan.\n\nThe report will be released soon, but there are a few big issues that we can begin to address tonight.\n\nThe need for universal broadband is one of them. As we’ve seen during the pandemic, high-speed internet is as vital to our communities as running water and electricity; if they don’t have it, they can’t grow.\n\nEvery year I’ve been governor, I’ve focused on expanding broadband to every Iowa community, and we’re making progress. But not enough.\n\nAbout a third of our counties are still broadband deserts, where high-speed internet is rarely offered. And for many Iowans, it’s just not affordable. Iowa also has the second lowest broadband speeds in the country.\n\nI’m done taking small steps and hoping for big change. This is the time for bold action and leadership. Let’s plant a stake in the ground and declare that every part of Iowa will have affordable, high-speed broadband by 2025.\n\nWe’ll get there by committing $450 million over that time period, which will leverage millions more in private investment, giving Iowa the biggest buildout of high-speed internet in the country.\n\nIowa has more households with all parents working than any other state, yet we’ve lost one-third of our childcare spots over the last five years. When schools abruptly closed last spring, a system already under stress was pushed even harder.\n\nSome families were able to adapt by working from home. Others leaned on grandparents, aunts and uncles, and family friends for support. In Pottawattamie County, a group of daycare providers and other partners teamed up to provide free daycare for essential workers.\n\nBut many parents weren’t so lucky and struggled to find ways to care for their children and still show up for work—often in roles that are essential to all of us. Even when the coronavirus is a distant memory, Iowa will still need an abundance of high-quality child care so that families can prosper and children can grow.\n\nMany of our communities and businesses are working together to address this issue. In Stuart, seventeen local businesses joined together to purchase an empty building, with plans to renovate and lease it to a childcare provider.\n\nIt’s in our state’s interests to encourage these types of public-private partnerships, which is why we created the Child Care Challenge Fund last year. It’s an innovative program that encourages employers, community leaders, and others to collaborate in developing child care facilities.\n\nThis year, we need to fund that program, so I’m allocating $3 million to jump-start these public-private partnerships. I’m also using $25 million of child care development block grants to further promote child care startups. Every community has different needs and different resources. Just as the leaders in Stuart found a solution that fits their hometown, we want to facilitate local solutions in other places, too.\n\nLet’s remove the obstacles to high-quality, affordable child care so that Iowa families can nurture their kids while parents maintain the maximum freedom to enter and remain in the workforce.\n\nAs our economy comes back, we’re facing a familiar problem: more job openings than there are people who have skills to fill them. That’s why we need to continue the work we started with Future Ready Iowa, a program that is designed to increase the number of Iowans with education or training beyond high school.\n\nEducation or training. That’s worth repeating. We have exceptional universities, colleges, and community colleges in this state. But not all skills are learned in a classroom. On-the-job training and reskilling are some of the most valuable ways to advance our workforce and increase Iowan’s wages. We need to continue to find ways to recognize this type of experience.\n\nWe took a big step in June by passing a significant licensing reform package. It didn’t get a lot of attention at the time, but at the beginning of this session we should stop to recognize how important it was: Iowa now has the most flexible licensing reciprocity and recognition laws in the nation, which sends a signal to the country that Iowa is open for business.\n\nAnd we’re not done. This year, we’ll begin the task of reviewing each of our licensing boards and commissions to make sure they are serving their purpose.\n\nWe must also continue the great strides we’ve made by integrating work-based learning into the K-12 curriculum. We know that many kids think of education differently when it involves real-life experience. They see why education matters and it can be key in helping them choose and prepare for a career that fits them.\n\nMany schools across the state are offering these work-based learning experiences. Let’s make sure that every high-school student gets that same chance. I’m calling on the legislature to make that an expectation of all our schools.\n\nWhen Iowa families come together after work and school, they need a place to call home. Unfortunately, we have a growing mismatch between where job opportunities are thriving and where people can find affordable places to live.\n\nSome communities have rallied to buck this trend. Forest City hadn’t seen a new affordable apartment complex in more than 25 years, so community leaders raised $4 million in financing by leveraging local and state resources. And a new apartment complex was built in 2017.\n\nIn Davenport, leaders used the same public-private partnership to convert an old, vacant school building into 41 affordable apartments, which were rented within two months. This project brought new housing to the historic riverfront and served as a catalyst for redevelopment.\n\nForest City and Davenport exemplify the spirit of Iowa communities. But the reality is, there aren’t enough resources to go around. Last year alone, Iowa communities requested more than three times what was available.\n\nWe must expand initiatives like these that address pent-up demand for affordable housing, helping our communities thrive and our families move where opportunities await them.\n\nThere’s a lot to do this year, but if we tackle issues like broadband, childcare, workforce training, and affordable housing, we’ll set Iowa on a solid path for economic prosperity for years to come.\n\nAnd remember, that unlike many states we’re starting from a good financial position. We aren’t looking at tough budget cuts and we’re certainly not looking at raising taxes. If anything, we need to continue the conversation about cutting taxes, and we can start by getting rid of the unnecessary triggers that were put in place in 2018. Let’s make Iowa more competitive and guarantee our taxpayers that they can keep more of their hard earned money.\n\nKids should be in schools; 'School choice shouldn’t be limited'\n\nA high-quality education system is the foundation of our state. Historically, we’ve had some of the best schools in the nation. And I believe we still do. What many of our teachers and administrators did this last year was nothing short of amazing.\n\nIn Clear Creek Amana, Barb Hunt’s special-education students were struggling with virtual learning, so she worked with transportation director Denny Schreckengast to convert a camper into a classroom. Since the kids couldn’t come to the classroom, they brought the classroom to them.\n\nIn Hinton, when the school went to a hybrid model for a few weeks, teachers spent hours holding individual Zoom calls with students, sometimes going into the evening, to make sure they weren’t falling behind.\n\nAt West Sioux, teachers personally went to the homes of Spanish-speaking families who needed help setting up internet service.\n\nIn Clarinda, the district was short on bus drivers so Josh Porter, a school administrator with a CDL, jumped behind the wheel to make sure his kids could be in the classroom.\n\nAnd in Cedar Rapids, Noreen Bush, Superintendent of the second largest school district in the state, and her team, made heroic efforts to get her kids back into the classroom just weeks after many of their schools were ripped apart by the derecho, and she did it while receiving chemotherapy.\n\nThere are stories like this from all across the state. Teachers and administrators put their students first in uncertain and difficult times, especially as they implemented plans to safely and responsibly reopen schools.\n\nBut that hasn’t been the case everywhere. Over the last few months, I’ve heard the frustration from many parents, students and teachers who didn’t have the opportunity to go back to school. Let me give you just a sample of those frustrations.\n\nI talked to a passionate teacher whose student hasn’t logged in for class in nine weeks, and there is nothing she can do about it.\n\nI visited with the parent of a child with special needs who is devastated by seeing her daughter’s education and social progress fade because a computer screen isn’t a substitute.\n\nI spoke to a middle-school student who has to watch her younger siblings during the day and complete her own school work at night.\n\nAnd I heard from numerous parents whose kids’ school day consisted of just 60 to 90 minutes of online instruction per day, at most.\n\nNicole, a mother of three elementary students who, since March, have spent less than a week in the classroom, told me she’s struggling to facilitate her children’s online learning while keeping up with her job. She said she feels like she’s failing as a parent, a spouse, and an employee.\n\nThese stories are heartbreaking. And let me assure you Nicole, it’s not you who’s failing.\n\nThe vast majority of our schools found a way to safely and responsibly reopen, all day, Monday through Friday. It’s past time that every district makes that happen. As one parent told me: “Options are good. But if some parents get the option to go 100% online, why don’t my kids get the option to be 100% in the classroom?”\n\nI agree, so tonight I am asking the legislature to immediately send a bill to my desk that gives parents the choice to send their child back to school full time. We can’t wait any longer. Our kids can’t wait any longer.\n\nIf there’s one thing the pandemic has taught us about education, it’s that our parents need choice. And it’s not just in-person versus virtual. Sometimes it’s about which school to attend altogether.\n\nWhen some schools remained closed or went part-time this fall, a lot of parents sent their kids to private school or open enrolled. But not everyone had that option. Many parents can’t afford private school. And because some of our larger districts prohibit open enrollment, they won’t let you transfer to another public school.\n\nOne parent I talked to said that a school administrator actually recommended that she buy a house in the neighboring district if she wanted her son to go to school in-person.\n\nWe need to fix that. School choice shouldn’t be limited to those who have the financial means or are lucky to live in a district that’s confident enough to allow open enrollment. So let’s make choice an option for everyone.\n\nWe can do that by making open enrollment available in all districts and by allowing our communities more flexibility to create public charter schools where there is a need for an alternative. And we should create education savings accounts for students who are trapped in a failing school; let’s give them another choice by making sure money isn’t their barrier.\n\nMake no mistake, it’s imperative that we have a strong public school system—which is why we have and will continue to prioritize school funding while many other states are cutting their education budgets. But school choice isn’t a zero sum game. It has the potential to raise the quality for all schools. And for those schools that do fall behind, it ensures our children don’t fall with them. Let’s work together to make sure every child receives a quality education, regardless of income, and no matter their zip code.\n\nReynolds: Protect law enforcement, march toward racial justice.\n\nIn 2020, we saw an overwhelming call for racial justice in Iowa and across the nation.\n\nWe heard that call and, with a bipartisan effort, passed the More Perfect Union Act to improve police work in Iowa. I’m proud of that legislation, and we’re continuing to make criminal justice reform a priority.\n\nI’m also very proud of our law enforcement. They put their lives on the line every day—something we should never forget. And if we needed a reminder, last year’s civil unrest and last week’s attack on the Capitol provided it. Violence and anarchy is not acceptable. Period.\n\nOur prayers are with the families of the Capitol Police Officers, who sacrificed their lives to defend the beacon of our democracy and the people in it. And our prayers are with every other officer who defends us against those who are intent on violence.\n\nThis summer, when protests gave way to rioting and looting in the Quad Cities, three Davenport police officers were ambushed. Thirty-two rounds of gunfire were pumped into the truck that Sgt. Lansing, Lt. Behning, and Detective Sievert were in.\n\nThe truck windows were shattered, Sgt. Lansing was shot in the leg, and multiple bullets struck his headrest. The truck took so much fire that it could barely accelerate, but Sgt. Lansing navigated it to safety.\n\nIn her Quad-City Times column, Barb Ickes eloquently wrote that this nightmare scene is “precisely what police train for,” but that “the resulting courage cannot be taught.” “Their escape is astonishing,” she said. “Most of us can’t even imagine it.”\n\nI couldn’t agree more; please join me in thanking these brave officers, who are with us tonight.\n\nWe should never take this bravery for granted, but in cities like Minneapolis, Portland, and New York, they have. They’ve embraced the attacks on law enforcement, and now their violent crime rates are rising for the first time in a generation.\n\nThat’s not going to happen in Iowa; not on my watch. We should never be afraid to talk about ways to improve policing, but there will be no talk of defunding the police here. Our men and women in blue will always have my respect, and I will always have their back.\n\nTo that end, I’ll be introducing a bill that protects law enforcement and continues our march toward racial justice.\n\nThe bill will make clear that if you riot or attack our men and women in uniform, you will be punished. We won’t stand for it.\n\nThe bill will also ban racial profiling and other forms of disparate treatment. Because no actions should ever be taken based upon the color of someone’s skin. As Martin Luther King Jr. recognized, “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”\n\nLet’s come together again, like we did last year, to support our law enforcement and racial justice. Let’s make Iowa a safer place for everyone.\n\nWhen Iowans come together, we do big things. We’ve grown our economy, protected life and our second amendment, lowered the tax burden on Iowans, supported our farmers and producers by increasing demand for biofuels, protected our environment by promoting renewable energy, and so much more.\n\nLike this past year, when we watched healthcare in Iowa transform from a collection of competing hospitals and clinics to a single statewide healthcare system committed to collaborating for the sake of all Iowans.\n\nAs we move forward, let’s build on this collaborative and innovative spirit. In my budget, I’m proposing $1 million to encourage hospitals and clinics to start what’s called a Center of Excellence. It’s a program that aligns rural physicians with specialists, creating regional hubs that provide highly-skilled care closer to where patients and their primary-care providers live.\n\nWhether you’re dealing with the trauma of an accident or the joy of childbirth, it’s not just the quality of the team that matters—it’s the proximity. I want a better system of care for all Iowans, regardless of where they live.\n\nI also want to be sure that when Iowans call 911 for an emergency, there’s a quick response. I know members in this chamber are already working on a bill to improve rural EMS services; I look forward to working with you this session.\n\nWe must also continue our focus on mental health. While the virus threatened our physical wellbeing, the realities of last year placed unimaginable stress on so many Iowans. Seniors were isolated from friends and loved ones; kids were kept out of the classroom and away from the stability it provides; and thousands of Iowans had their livelihoods turned upside down.\n\nIn the last three years, we have reformed our mental health system and we’re continuing to make it better. I’m proposing to increase mental health funding by $15 million this year, and another $15 million next year, to fully fund those reform efforts. And I know that our mental health regions are working on innovative solutions to address the unique needs of children who have been affected by the pandemic.\n\nAnd because of the legislation we passed last year, which allows schools to host behavioral health sessions by using telehealth services, kids no longer have to leave school for hours to receive quality treatment.\n\nThat’s a lesson many of us learned over the last ten months: telehealth is a powerful tool that we should continue to encourage and expand. And it’s not just for mental health. Thousands of Iowans experienced it first-hand this year, receiving treatment and check-ups from their own home.\n\nIn 2020, we asked so much of our healthcare providers. And they’ve met those expectations at every step of the way. Many of our hospitals were at the forefront of developing treatments for Covid-19, and the University of Iowa has been key in the development of vaccines.\n\nThe availability of vaccines marks the most significant turning point since the pandemic began. And I’m proud to say that Iowa is one of the states leading the nation in administering the vaccine.\n\nTo date, nearly 100,000 Iowans, including our healthcare workers, have received their first dose, and several thousand have now received their second. By the end of the week, everyone at the Iowa Veterans Home, our largest nursing facility in the state, will be vaccinated. And by January 25, all 90,000 nursing-home residents and staff will have received the vaccine, ensuring that Iowans most at risk are among the first to have this protection.\n\nI know we are all eager to be vaccinated and turn the corner, and wider distribution to more Iowans is imminent.\n\nBut as we begin to put 2020 behind us, I have two requests for my fellow Iowans.\n\nFirst, let’s not forget those neighbors who are still hurting. Reach out. Keep volunteering; continue to stock food banks. Continue to show the country that it doesn’t take a pandemic or a derecho to lend a helping hand.\n\nSecond, let’s not return to normal. Let’s be better. Let’s think bigger. Be bolder.\n\nIf anything, this year has shown us what we can accomplish, and how fast we can do it. Hold onto that spirit. To that ingenuity and collaboration. To the feeling that we’re working for the greater good, and not ourselves.\n\nIf we can do that—if we can work with and for each other—then we will do great things.\n\nI believe in this State, because I believe in you. I’ve seen what you’ve done; I’ve watched, sometimes with tears of pride in my eyes. And that’s how I know that the condition of our State is strong. Because you are strong—stronger than you ever imagined.\n\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the great state of Iowa.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/06/27/critical-race-theory-education-equity-michigan-school-board/7778869002/", "title": "Critical race theory in education divides Michigan school boards", "text": "The idea that schools will bring critical race theory — a framework that considers racism's hold in all areas of society — into classrooms has brought rancorous debates to Michigan school board meetings over the past month.\n\nIn Grand Ledge on the western side of the state, more than 100 people turned up at a school board meeting scheduled after a meeting the week before could not continue because of disruptive public comments.

The decision drew sharp criticism from opponents who said the language could prevent honest conversations and lessons about history and race. The Alabama State Board of Education voted 7-2 on Thursday to put the measure in the state administrative code, news outlets report. It instructs schools to follow a previous resolution that bans “concepts that impute fault, blame, a tendency to oppress others, or the need to feel guilt or anguish to persons solely because of their race or sex.” It also bans theories that promote political ideologies or “one race or sex above another.” The Rev. Rayford Mack of Montgomery called the resolution an “anti-truth” measure, al.com reports. “It is a dangerous step backwards that has emerged from a coordinated national effort to suppress our nation’s history and to deny the experience of Black people and other people of color,” he said. Board members in August first approved the measure in August. Alabama Superintendent Eric Mackey said critical race theory is not currently taught in Alabama schools, but board members wanted to take action that would be preventative.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives’ annual convention, the largest gathering of Indigenous people in the state, will be fully virtual this year, organizers announced Friday. The decision was made after federation leaders consulted with state federal and tribal health officials and reviewed current COVID-19 data trends, according to a statement. The federation decided to go all-virtual out of concern for the safety of the thousands of people from across the state who normally attend in person, the statement said. Organizers cited the continuing high rates of COVID-19, transmission, hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in Anchorage, the statement said. Alaska currently has the highest number of cases in the past seven days per 100,000 population among the 50 states, the state health department said Thursday in its weekly case update. “The incidence of COVID-19 in the Municipality of Anchorage appears to have either plateaued or be increasing. Regardless of the trajectory, intense community transmission is continuing to occur and is causing significant illness, death, and demand on the health care system,” the report says. “Safety is paramount to our decision,” said Sheri Buretta, chair of Alaska Federation of Natives convention committee, who also noted social distancing guidelines would be hard to meet.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has rejected the Republican-controlled state Senate’s contention that it can withhold a raft of communications between its leaders and private contractors they hired to conduct an unprecedented review of the 2020 election results in the state’s most populous county. The ruling released Thursday evening is the latest in a series of losses for the Senate stemming from its efforts to keep secret records showing how the review was conducted. A watchdog group called American Oversight had sued to compel their release and repeatedly won. The Arizona Republic has a separate lawsuit seeking records from the election review. The Senate has already released tens of thousands of records after court rulings in the American Oversight case found they were covered by the state’s public records law. It was trying to shield more than 1,000 other texts and emails. American Oversight said it is fighting for the public’s right to know how the partisan audit was funded and how Cyber Ninjas and other private contractors hired by the Senate conducted the review. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp’s ruling said the Senate’s position that the records were covered by legislative privilege was flat wrong. He said that privilege is intended to protect debate about pending legislation.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State Attorney General Leslie Rutledge raised $190,970 over the past three months in her bid for governor, her campaign said Friday, as she continued trailing former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in fundraising for the state’s top office. Rutledge’s campaign said the latest contributions brought her total fundraising haul to more than $1.6 million since she announced her candidacy last year. Rutledge spent $259,134 during the quarter and reported having more than $1 million cash on hand. Sanders a day earlier reported raising $2.1 million during the quarter and having $7 million in the bank for her bid. The two are running in next year’s Republican primary. Friday was the deadline for candidates to file their quarterly fundraising reports with the state. Rutledge said more than 80% of her contributions are from Arkansans. All but $3.7 million of the $11 million Sanders has raised total has come from out-of-state donors. “I will continue to keep my campaign focused on Arkansas and issues that are important to Arkansans,” Rutledge said in a statement. The two are running to succeed Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. Chris Jones, a Democratic candidate, on Thursday reported raising more than $384,000 during the quarter.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state has added the Pacific leatherback sea turtle to its endangered species list, guaranteeing more protections for a rapidly dwindling population. The California Fish and Game Commission voted Thursday to add the turtles under the state’s Endangered Species Act. The world’s largest turtle species has been on the federal endangered species list since 1973. But scientists now know more about how crucial California is to its survival, according to Catherine Kilduff, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. A subpopulation of leatherback sea turtles hatches on beaches in Indonesia. Once fully grown, the reptiles swim nearly 6,000 miles to eat jellyfish off the California coast. Adult leatherback sea turtles weigh an average of 1,000 pounds. Scientists say these sea turtles have declined by about 5.6% in California each year for the past three decades. About 50 sea turtles visit the California coast each year, compared to about 178 turtles in the 1990s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Adding turtles to California’s endangered species list will make them a conservation priority for state agencies. It will also increase the state’s cooperation with federal agencies to protect the sea turtle population.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: The fire, floods and massive debris flows of the past year in Glenwood Canyon could help answer an aeons-old question – where exactly does the underground source of water that feeds Hanging Lake begin? The U.S. Forest Service is working with scientific consultants from the renowned Ozark Underground Laboratory out of southwest Missouri to conduct an experiment that may answer the question once and for all. The team recently placed special carbon samplers at key locations in Hanging Lake and at points where multiple springs emerge at the lake and Spouting Rock above the lake, as well as in nearby surface streams. Then, they traveled into the Flat Tops above Glenwood Canyon to place nontoxic fluorescent tracer dye into the water at various potential source points. The idea is that the dye will travel through the canyon’s extensive karst system of caves and sinkholes. Whichever color dye or dyes come out at Hanging Lake should identify the source. Water travels through limestone deposits deep underground and eventually pools amid the steep cliffs at what’s become one of the most popular hiking destinations within the White River National Forest. That passage through the travertine formation and the unique vegetation in and around the lake give Hanging Lake its unique turquoise-green color.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPreston: The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe, which owns and operates Foxwoods Resort Casino, is seeking to develop a luxury RV resort on land the tribal nation has owned since 1994. The tribe and Blue Water Development Corp., of Ocean City, Maryland, recently filed plans for the proposed park in Preston, to include camping sites, a pool, a water slide, a splash pad, tennis and volleyball courts, a playground, a camp store and a picnic pavilion. The project, located just north of Foxwoods, will be discussed Tuesday at the Inlands Wetlands and Watercourses Commission meeting. Blue Water has completed eight projects of similar size and scope in various states. This latest project comes after a record number of recreational vehicles were sold over the past year in the U.S. “We have waited many years to find the best use and environmentally-conscious partner for this property as we look to thoughtfully enhance our resort experiences,” said Jason Guyot, president and CEO of Foxwoods, in a written statement. He has said previously that Foxwoods has long considered a high-end RV park option for its patrons.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The city’s two municipal beaches, formerly known as Beach 1 and Beach 2, are getting brand-new names. Beach 1, which sits at the end of Savannah Road, will now be known as Savannah Beach. Mayor Ted Becker said the geographic name seems “intuitive.” Just down the coast, the former Beach 2 has officially been renamed Johnnie Walker Beach – a nod to a prominent Black business owner who opened a restaurant there and created a welcoming atmosphere for Black families during segregation. While many people recall that the small port city of Lewes was largely known as a diverse and welcoming area in the 1950s and ’60s, Jim Crow laws still segregated significant parts of life – including the resort town’s two beaches. But Johnnie Walker’s, a restaurant and open-air pavilion where live music often played, was a place where people ate fish sandwiches and french fries, teenagers danced until their shoes were worn out, and families found a sense of belonging, according to people who shared stories from this time. Becker said the city is working with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to possibly recreate the Johnnie Walker pavilion on that beach.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Indigenous groups and other environmental activists marched to the Capitol on Friday as they continued a weeklong protest demanding that Congress and the Biden administration stop new fossil fuel projects and act with greater urgency on climate change. Nearly 80 people were arrested on the fifth day of the “People vs. Fossil Fuels” protest, bringing the total arrested during the week to more than 600, organizers said. Under a banner declaring “We did not vote for fossil fuels,” activists pressed President Joe Biden to stop approving new pipelines and other fossil fuel projects and declare a climate emergency. Demonstrators urged members of Congress to “listen to the people” who sent them to Washington and take urgent action to phase out fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Capitol Police said 78 people were arrested on obstruction or crowding charges. Three of those arrested also were charged with assault on a police officer. The Capitol protest followed a sit-in Thursday at the Interior Department in downtown Washington. The protest was part of “a historic surge of Indigenous resistance” in the nation’s capital that started last Monday, Indigenous Peoples’ Day, outside the White House, said Jennifer Falcon, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, part of the coalition that organized the protest.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The gunman who killed 14 students and three staff members at a Parkland high school will plead guilty to their murders, his attorneys said Friday, bringing some closure to a South Florida community more than three years after an attack that sparked a nationwide movement for gun control. The guilty plea would set up a penalty phase in which Nikolas Cruz, 23, would be fighting against the death penalty and hoping for life without parole. Cruz attorney David Wheeler told Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer that he will plead guilty Wednesday to 17 counts of first-degree murder in the February 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The pleas will come with no conditions, and prosecutors still plan to seek the death penalty. That will be decided by a jury, with the judge hoping to start the trial in January after choosing a jury from thousands of prospects starting in November. Cruz will also plead guilty to 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. He was not initially present during the hearing but later entered the Broward County courtroom to plead guilty to attacking a jail guard nine months after the shooting. Cruz said he understood that prosecutors can use the conviction as an aggravating factor when they later argue for his execution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: One of the world’s largest elevator towers will soon be opened to test elevators of the future as well as current ones high above the Atlanta suburbs. TK Elevators’ 420-foot tower is set to become fully operational early next year, company executives said during a tour of the new research lab and elevator testing facility. “This is going to transform our industry,” said Kevin Lavelle, CEO of the company’s North American operations. It’s the largest elevator test tower in the Western Hemisphere, according to the company and general contractor Brasfield & Gorrie, which built it. The tower with its multiple elevator testing shafts looks down into the Atlanta Braves’ stadium nearby and offers stunning views of the Atlanta skyline. It’s next door to the company’s new North American headquarters in Cobb County, just northwest of the city. Construction on the tower began in 2019 with 3,000 tons of steel, and the structure is now in place, with interior work still ongoing as TKE prepares to fully open it in February. Among concepts being tested in the high-rise: twin elevators, which use the same elevator shaft but operate independently, with one car above the other, Lavelle said. Twin elevators save space and are able to carry passengers more efficiently, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state can expect above-average rainfall during the upcoming wet season and potentially have more floods like last winter, the National Weather Service said Friday. Even so, Maui County and the Big Island may remain in drought and at greater risk for wildfires because the leeward sides of their islands won’t get as much rain. The strength of this year’s La Nina weather event will likely influence rainfall patterns across the island chain. La Nina is a cooling of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures near the equator and the flip side of a warmer El Nino pattern. Kevin Kodama, the weather agency’s senior service hydrologist in Honolulu, said La Nina is expected to be moderate this year. That will mean heavy rainfall on the windward sides of the islands and drier leeward sides during the wet season, which runs from this month through April. That’s similar to the last wet season. Under this scenario, Kauai and Oahu, which have some areas of moderate drought, will likely recover, but drought is expected continue on Maui County and the Big Island. Ranchers in leeward Maui County – areas currently in extreme and severe drought – have recently lost cattle due to the dry conditions. A lack of vegetation in the forests has pushed invasive Axis deer into farms, leading to agricultural losses.\n\nIdaho\n\nAmmon: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin held a news conference Thursday to defend her decision to refuse to release public records until she lost a lawsuit over the matter, criticizing the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and accusing several news organizations of lying in their coverage of the civil case. Her remarks at an elementary school in Ammon included campaign talk that may have violated a state law against campaigning on public school grounds. McGeachin held the event with Republican Attorney General candidate Art Macomber, of Coeur d’Alene, saying she wanted to “set the record straight” regarding the lawsuit from the Idaho Press Club. She refused to take any questions. “I know the media is very busy writing lies about me and my office,” she said. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. The panel was ordered to investigate allegations of “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system, something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” The journalists requested public feedback forms and other documents.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that she took her fight with the head of the city’s police officers union to court, arguing that his call for officers to ignore the order to report their COVID-19 vaccination status was illegal. The mayor said in a statement that the city’s law department filed a complaint in Cook County Circuit Court for injunctive relief against Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara, whom she accused of “engaging in, supporting and encouraging work stoppage or strike.” A judge on Friday evening granted the city’s request for a temporary injunction barring Catanzara from making any public comments that encourage FOP members to disobey the city’s vaccine mandate until the next hearing on the city’s lawsuit Oct. 25. Judge Cecilia Horan ruled there was potential irreparable harm if Catanzara continued such statements. City attorneys argued they were tantamount to him advocating “sedition” and “anarchy” because he was directing members to disobey an order from their superiors. Lightfoot said that by urging union members not to report their COVID-19 vaccination status by Friday’s deadline, Catanzara put the public in danger.\n\nIndiana\n\nKnox: An Israeli company has started work to build a solar energy farm that’s planned to cover some 13,000 acres across two northern Indiana counties when completed. Executives of Doral Renewables took part in a groundbreaking ceremony Thursday with Gov. Eric Holcomb and local officials for the project that is estimated to cost $1.5 billion to build over the next few years. The project, dubbed Mammoth Solar, will see solar panels erected in Starke and Pulaski counties, generating electricity that Doral will sell under a long-term agreement to American Electric Power for the Columbus, Ohio-based utility company to increase its renewable energy capacity. The solar farm’s first phase is expected become operational by mid-2023 and will produce 400 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 75,000 households, according to the company. Construction is planned to start next year on other phases of the farm, which will ultimately generate 1.65 gigawatts of electricity as those portions begin operating in 2024. Proposals for large solar farms have faced opposition in some places over loss of farmland. But Starke County Commissioner Mark Gourley said he was excited about the project coming to the rural area about 50 miles southwest of South Bend. “I’ve never in my life seen anything like this project here,” Gourley said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Republican leaders are calling for a new round of tax cuts after a state panel projected Friday that Iowa would take in more money this year than previously expected. Iowa’s three-member Revenue Estimating Conference, which sets the revenue projections that lawmakers use to form the state budget, has increased its revenue estimate for the next two budget years after the state saw an 11% year-over-year growth the year before. Panel members expect state revenues will continue to grow but at a more modest rate – about 1.5% – for each of the next two years. Iowa Republicans credited their budgeting practices and pandemic policies and immediately pointed to the results as reason to cut taxes. But Democrats said the credit for the state’s recovery should go to the federal pandemic relief package that Republicans opposed, and any new tax cuts should be sustainable and focus on middle-class families. Rep. Chris Hall, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, didn’t rule out agreement on tax cuts, but he said in a statement that Republicans need to also focus on investing in areas that will attract and keep families in Iowa. “Any tax changes made next session must be targeted to middle class families, not just the wealthy and special interests,” he said in the statement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A task force formed three years ago to investigate clergy sexual abuse in Catholic dioceses across the state has received 215 tips and opened 122 cases, according to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Robert Jacobs, executive officer of the KBI, reported on the work of the agency’s Catholic Clergy Taskforce last week during a hearing of a state legislative committee. He said investigators set up a phone line and email address for people to report abuse, The Kansas City Star reports. The task force has been working with Catholic dioceses to review almost 40,000 diocesan records since its work began in 2019, Jacobs said. Along with considering a specific allegation, investigators are working to determine if the allegation was made to the diocese or to law enforcement “and what the follow-through was on that claim when it was initially made.” State Sen. Jeff Pittman, D-Leavenworth, questioned why no prosecutions had arisen from the investigation. “Why, with 40,000 different records, there doesn’t seem to be any action on this?” Pittman said. “Is the pursuit not revealing anything? I mean, it seems like there’s a lot in the news about this. What’s the story?” Jacobs said one issue has been that some of the alleged acts took place years ago. “Obviously, we run into time constraints,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Saying the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the necessity for accessible health care, Gov. Andy Beshear marked a milestone Friday for the state’s relaunched health insurance exchange, where consumers now can shop for health coverage for the coming year. Kentuckians can find out if they qualify for Medicaid and compare private plans on the state’s health care marketplace on the web portal, known as kynect, ahead of the enrollment period that begins Nov. 1. Open enrollment for existing recipients of Medicaid started Friday. In a state with high rates of cancer and other diseases, the portal signed up hundreds of thousands for health coverage before it was shut down by the previous governor. Beshear had already relaunched the state-run portal, and Friday marked the first day consumers could go on the website to review coverage plans for 2022. “People deserve easy access to information about their health plans and their benefits,” Beshear said. “It shouldn’t be hard to secure something that keeps you healthy and, in a pandemic, alive.” The Democratic governor was joined by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in promoting kynect, which offers a centralized place for Kentuckians to apply for health insurance coverage and other benefits.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Once-endangered alligators are thriving in the wild, so state authorities are proposing a deep cut in the percentage that farmers must return to marshes where their eggs were laid. “Over the past 50 years, alligator nest surveys have increased from an estimate of less than 10,000 in the 1970s and 1980s to well over 60,000 nests in recent years,” the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission said in a notice published Wednesday. “This increase in nesting has produced a population that can now be sustained with a much lower farm return rate.” The commission is taking comments until Jan. 4 on a proposal to cut that rate from 10% to 5%. The big armored reptiles don’t breed well in captivity, so farmers are allowed to collect eggs from nests as long as they return a percentage to the same area as youngsters big enough to foil predators other than people and much bigger alligators. Alligator hides are made into luxury leather for products including watchbands, boots and purses. The meat is used in sausages; companies also sell roasts, steaks, ribs, nuggets, jerky and even whole skinned alligators. Forelegs are marketed as “alligator wings.” Uncontrolled hunting nearly wiped out American alligators before Louisiana barred all hunting in 1962.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A law banning obscenities from license plates on Maine’s roads and highways goes into effect Monday, but removing such profanities in a state where such regulation has been unusually lax won’t happen overnight. Currently, there are license plates with salty language including f-bombs, references to anatomy and sex acts, and general insults. One license plate says simply “F---Y0U” – except it’s plainly spelled out. Now, rule-making is getting underway to ensure the law protects First Amendment rights while getting rid of obscene language. The process, which includes public comment, could take two to four months, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said. Requests for so-called vanity license plates that are deemed to be potentially offensive will be on hold in the meantime. Eventually, the state will begin recalling previously issued plates, likely this winter. A majority of states have restrictions on license plate messages that are considered profane, sexually suggestive, racist, drug-related, politically objectionable or religiously offensive. But Maine became the “wild, wild, wild west of vanity license plates” when the state dropped its review process in 2015. “Our anything-goes approach was unusual,” Bellows said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan proposed a $150 million boost in public safety spending Friday. The Republican governor dubbed the plan the “Re-Fund the Police Initiative” and decried “an all-out assault on the entire law enforcement community” at a news conference announcing the plan, The Baltimore Sun reports. The name is a play on the call to defund police, a tactic supporters say aims to address systemic problems in policing and direct spending to other needs, but Hogan called the idea “dangerous far-left lunacy.” The plan would put $45 million toward local law enforcement and $50 million toward state police agency raises and bonuses. It would also spend $24 million on body cameras and training and $10 million on neighborhood grants for safety improvements like lighting and security cameras. Hogan’s proposal would spend $20 million on victim protection, including $14 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to restore funding for victim services providers after federal cuts. The proposal also includes $1 million for the state’s police chief and sheriff’s associations. The governor is set to speak at a joint meeting of the two groups Monday. The General Assembly would need to approve most of the spending Hogan is proposing.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A high-tech buoy designed to enhance maritime safety is being installed in Buzzards Bay, state environmental officials said. The buoy that measures wave height, wave period, wave direction and surface water temperature every 30 minutes will be placed about 4 nautical miles southwest of Cuttyhunk Island, according to a statement last week from the state Department of Environmental Protection. The buoy is a joint project involving the state, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems. “The waters of Buzzards Bay and Cape Cod Bay are precious natural resources in Massachusetts, and we must continue to make strong efforts to protect them for both the public and marine species to benefit from,” state Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Kathleen Theoharides said. “Adding this new buoy in Buzzards Bay will expand Cape Cod’s marine safety network and help ensure safe passage for mariners traveling through these important waters.” The state is providing about $900,000 to purchase, install and operate the buoy. The money is coming from the Oil Spill Prevention and Response Trust Fund, established after a barge spilled 98,000 gallons of oil into the bay in 2003.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state must serve kosher meat, dairy and cheesecake to prisoners observing the Jewish Sabbath and holidays, a federal appeals court said, rejecting arguments that a special menu would be too costly and disruptive. The Corrections Department typically offers a vegan meal to anyone with religious dietary needs. But the appeals court said it was a “substantial burden” on the rights of prisoners who said they instead need meat and dairy to practice their Jewish faith. In a 3-0 opinion this week, the appeals court affirmed a decision by U.S. District Judge Linda Parker. The court analyzed the case under a federal law that protects the exercise of religion in a confined setting. Gerald Ackerman and Mark Shaykin sued after the state in 2013 adopted a vegan religious meal and said Jewish organizations could no longer send food for four holidays. Prisoners can purchase small kosher meat and dairy products at the commissary, but the food can’t be brought into the chow hall. Ackerman and Shaykin said they must eat the special food as meals, not snacks. They also believe they must eat kosher cheesecake on Shavuot, which recalls the ancient harvest of wheat and the delivery of the Torah to Jews. The appeals court said the “cheesecake issue is trickier” than meat and milk, but it affirmed the trial judge’s findings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: Gov. Tim Walz said Friday that he’ll use the Minnesota National Guard to help alleviate staffing shortages at care facilities that are struggling to cope with the surge in COVID-19 cases among unvaccinated residents. “These folks need respite care. They’re at a breaking point. They can’t go anymore,” Walz said. The governor went to North Memorial Health Hospital to announce plans for relieving overstretched staffs at long-term care facilities that prevent hospitals from discharging patients into transitional care centers. More than 400 Minnesota hospital patients are currently waiting for beds to open up for incoming patients, he said. Walz said the number of soldiers who will provide that relief and their exact roles have yet to be determined, but it would be a “fairly large contingent.” “We’re not going to send untrained National Guard into an ICU unit, but we can give them the training necessary to provide … the long-term care for the other folks,” he said. Hospitals across Minnesota are at or near capacity, treating just over 1,000 COVID-19 patients. But officials say the problem is due not only to the coronavirus but also to other conditions such as heart attacks, strokes, trauma, scheduled surgeries and a backlog of procedures that began building up earlier in the pandemic.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Russell C. Davis Planetarium is undergoing renovations and expected to reopen at the end of 2023 with a fresh look and more extensive exhibits. This is the first renovation in decades at the site in downtown Jackson. Mike Williams, the planetarium manager, said the city is creating a world-class center for science and technology. “This is going to be something we can present to the world that is in diametrically opposed to a lot of the negative ideas people may have about our state,” Williams said. He said visitors will see interactive exhibits, including some using augmented and virtual technology. Exhibits will showcase recent space missions and projects by NASA and space travel by private companies, he said. He said he hopes new and updated exhibits will inspire students to explore science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers. “It’s a total investment in our kids and the people of our state,” Williams said. The planetarium closed in April 2018 because of a roof leak and interior damage. After the roof was repaired, the city announced in June 2020 that the planetarium would undergo renovations. Those are expected to cost $12 million or so, and plans include establishing a $2 million operational endowment, said John David Lewis, the city’s deputy director of cultural services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three months after creation of a commission to identify cybersecurity risks in state government, Gov. Mike Parson has yet to appoint any members. A state lawmaker said Friday that vulnerabilities exposed on a state website prove the need for just such a panel of experts. Rep. Ashley Aune, D-Kansas City, helped write the section of Senate Bill 49 that created the Missouri Cybersecurity Commission. Parson, a Republican, signed the bill into law in mid-July. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch journalist uncovered a security flaw on a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s web application that allowed the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. The newspaper found that the Social Security numbers of perhaps 100,000 teachers and other school officials from around the state were in HTML source code. The Post-Dispatch alerted the department Tuesday, and the agency removed the pages. The Post-Dispatch said it gave the state time to fix the problem before publishing a story Thursday. But Parson on Thursday announced a criminal investigation, alleging the journalist was “acting against a state agency to compromise teachers’ personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines for their news outlet. We will not let this crime against Missouri teachers go unpunished.” Aune accused Parson of a “smear campaign” against the Post-Dispatch journalist when it was Parson’s administration that stored the private information and left it unprotected.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University celebrated the grand opening of its American Indian Hall over the weekend, saying it will serve as a bridge between Native American culture and all other cultures on campus. The event Saturday began with a procession from the current American Indian Center – just over 1,000 square feet in the basement of Wilson Hall – to the new $20 million, 31,000-square-foot building. The procession was led by a Native American honor guard followed by flag-bearers with the state flag and others from Montana’s tribal nations, along with tribal dancers. The building will house the university’s Department of Native American Studies and a working space for the Senior Diversity and Inclusion officer. Classes will start there in January. It also has a kitchen, a drum room, and rooms for tutoring, counseling, advising and cultural ceremonies. Native American art is displayed, and there are furnishings crafted from trees removed from the site where the building now stands. The building is surrounded by gardens with indigenous plants that were planted by MSU Native American students and staff and is heated and cooled by 24 geothermal wells.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s attorney general said Friday that he won’t seek disciplinary action against doctors who prescribe controversial, off-label drugs to treat and prevent coronavirus infections, as long as they get informed consent from patients and don’t engage in misconduct. The office of Attorney General Doug Peterson released a legal opinion saying it didn’t see data to justify legal action against health care professionals who prescribe ivermectin, a decades-old parasite treatment, or hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that former President Donald Trump took to try to prevent a COVID-19 infection. “Based on the evidence that currently exists, the mere fact of prescribing ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 will not result in our office filing disciplinary actions,” the Republican attorney general said in the opinion. Many health experts and leading medical groups have been trying to stop the use of both drugs, arguing that they can cause harmful side effects and that there’s little evidence that they help. It’s also unclear whether many doctors are actually prescribing them in Nebraska or elsewhere, although a few isolated cases have emerged nationally.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The COVID-19 pandemic helped expose the growing vulnerability of Lake Tahoe’s increasingly tourism-dependent economy as housing costs balloon, year-round residency declines, and more workers commute from afar or seek jobs elsewhere, a new report says. The Tahoe Prosperity Center says the findings in the study it commissioned with the help of a grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration underscore the need to better diversify Tahoe’s economy, build more affordable housing and utilize an increasingly skilled workforce. “Exorbitant home prices, the high cost of living, long-haul commuters, a shortage of workers, and a flat to down economy over the past 10 years point to an economy that is not healing itself, nor resilient to disruptive changes that impact visitor-based economies more deeply,” the study said. Tourism now accounts for more than 60% of Lake Tahoe’s $5 billion regional economy – up from 40% in 2010, according to the nonprofit center’s research released last week. The report also pointed to the effects of climate change, which scientists say has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive, along with shifting snow and precipitation trends affecting the region’s ski resorts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Mental health advocates are praising the state’s decision to expand services for children by purchasing a private, 111-bed psychiatric hospital. An association that represents the state’s 10 nonprofit community mental health centers called the news “a major milestone in our system.” “This is truly an investment in the future and will ensure that we strengthen our continuity of care,” said Brian Collins, president of the Community Behavioral Health Association. The cost of buying Hampstead Hospital and other details haven’t been determined, but it will be covered by federal pandemic relief funds pending approval of the legislative fiscal committee and Executive Council. The facility has had contracts with the state during the coronavirus pandemic to treat children in mental health crises. “Band-Aids and short-term solutions are not going to cut it,” Gov. Chris Sununu said while announcing Thursday that the state is in the final stages of the purchase. In late March 2020, for the first time in eight years, no one in New Hampshire was waiting in a hospital emergency room for an inpatient psychiatric bed. But the numbers went back up during the pandemic. By May 2021, more than 80 mental health patients, including record numbers of children, were waiting on any given day.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Orange: An apartment complex from which 45 families were abruptly evacuated due to a rock slide stemming from the remnants of Hurricane Ida will be demolished, according to the lawyer representing the property owner. Attorney Steven Eisenstein handed evacuees checks for returned security deposits, October’s rent and an extra $1,250 per unit to help cover relocation costs during a community meeting Thursday, NJ.com reports. Eisenstein said three engineering firms had recommended to owner John Jakimowicz that the Ron Jolyn Apartments in West Orange be demolished. “It’s not that he has any choice,” Eisenstein said. The red brick garden apartment complex was evacuated late last Monday hours after a township employee opened an email sent Friday night warning that a steep, rocky slope behind the apartments was unstable and could result in property damage and “possible loss of life.” Mayor Robert Parisi said the township would go on paying for the hotel accommodations of evacuees while they sought new permanent housing. Evacuees voiced anger and frustration with the evacuation conducted from 10 p.m. Monday to 1 a.m. Tuesday with no warning to tenants, who had little time to gather what belongings they could carry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A judge on Friday denied a request by dozens of scientists and others at Los Alamos National Laboratory to block a vaccine mandate, meaning workers risked being fired if they didn’t comply with the lab’s afternoon deadline. The case comes as New Mexico extends a mask mandate for indoor spaces across the state, citing persistently high levels of community spread. While the vaccination rate among adults in New Mexico continues to hover below 72%, the lab confirmed Friday that 96% of employees are fully vaccinated. It’s not known how many workers have requested exemptions or how many could end up being fired for declining the shots. The legal challenge was backed by 114 scientists, nuclear engineers, research technicians, designers, project managers and other workers at the lab. Some are specialists and have high security clearance for the work they do, which ranges from national defense to infrastructure improvements and COVID-19 research. The workers claim that the mandate is a violation of their constitutional rights and that lab management has created a hostile work environment. Attorneys for the lab argued in court Thursday that being vaccinated was a condition of working at Los Alamos. State District Judge Jason Lidyard agreed, saying unvaccinated employees will have to find work elsewhere.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Democrat who will likely become the next mayor says he does not intend to get rid of the city’s program for gifted and talented students, nipping plans that outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said in an interview on CNN on Friday that de Blasio can’t get rid of the program in the nation’s largest school district until next year, when a new mayor is in place. Adams said he would preserve the program and expand opportunities for advanced learning. In response, the city’s department of education noted that Adams’ plans to expand accelerated learning in schools match the goals of de Blasio’s plan to replace the gifted and talented program. De Blasio, in a radio interview Friday, again defended his plan that would begin next year to phase out the program, which critics say favors white and Asian American students, while enrolling disproportionately few Black and Latino children. De Blasio said the district, with about 1 million students, would next year stop administering a screening test to 4-year-olds that’s used to identify gifted and talented students. Instead, he said the public school system would work to offer accelerated learning to all kindergarteners.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nElizabeth City: A northeastern North Carolina judge changed her voter registration from Democrat to Republican the day after she was sworn in to the job for which Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper appointed her. District Court Judge Jennifer Karpowicz Bland switched her registration Sept. 3, according to Dare County elections records. The former assistant district attorney was sworn in Sept. 2, the week after Cooper announced Bland would succeed now-Superior Court Judge Eula Reid, The Daily Advance of Elizabeth City reports. There’s no requirement that someone of the governor’s or departing judge’s political party is picked by the governor. Historically, however, governors have often favored someone of their own party to fill vacancies. Bland said her political views never came up during two pre-appointment interviews with Cooper. Bland said she didn’t contact Cooper’s office about her party switch before completing it. “I’ve always been conservative,” Bland said recently. “It’s the party that best represents my values.” In response to the switch, Cooper’s office focused on criticizing the GOP-controlled Legislature for passing laws in the 2010s to make judicial elections officially partisan again. “It’s still wrong now,” spokesperson Jordan Monaghan said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is offering license refunds to nearly 30,000 deer hunters due to an outbreak of a viral disease in the western part of the state. It’s the second straight year that North Dakota’s Game and Fish Department is offering refunds to thousands of hunters. The department says it has received nearly 1,000 reports of dead deer after epizootic hemorrhagic disease, known as EHD, surfaced in late August. The disease, transmitted by biting gnats, seems to be affecting a larger portion of the state than usual, Wildlife Chief Casey Anderson said. Game and Fish Wildlife Veterinarian Charlie Bahnson said one theory could be that prolonged drought conditions in the state and record-breaking heat in October created conditions favorable to midges and more viral spread. The heaviest concentration of reported deaths is along the Missouri River, especially to the north and south of Bismarck and Mandan, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Last year’s outbreak was in the southwest and west central parts of the state, and Game and Fish offered license refunds to more than 9,000 hunters. Only about 400 sought refunds. Bahnson said nearly 30,000 hunters are potentially affected this year. Hunters and landowners are asked to report any dead deer, along with photos, through an online wildlife mortality reporting system.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Democrats in the state House are calling for action on legislation that would remove time limits restricting when sexual assault victims could file lawsuits against perpetrators. The lawmakers are also urging that hearings be held on a bill that would lift caps on pain-and-suffering awards in lawsuits brought by rape victims. The bills in question focus on separate issues encompassing sexual assault. One involves lawsuits brought by long-ago survivors of sexual abuse, a measure backers say could assist both victims of priest abuse and – in a recent high-profile case – abuse perpetrated on hundreds of student-athletes by former Ohio State team doctor Richard Strauss. That bill would also eliminate the spousal exception for marital rape. The other bill involves recent state Supreme Court rulings dramatically reducing jury awards to child survivors of rape. The issue is not partisan, said Rep. Tavia Galonski, D-Akron. “We have a combining of victims now coming forward, and survivors, friends of survivors, family of survivors, combining with the Strauss victims who’ve been reaching out to our office to contact us,” she said at a Thursday news conference. A separate Republican bill meant to assist survivors of Strauss is stalled, and a GOP lawmaker last week suggested it was never meant to pass but only pressure Ohio State to settle. A federal judge dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits against Ohio State last month, agreeing with OSU’s argument that the legal window for such claims had passed.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health says it will reconcile its tally of COVID-19 deaths with those reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, resulting in more than 1,000 additional deaths. “This is part of our annual review process that we do every year for reportable diseases,” not just COVID-19, state epidemiologist Dr. Jolianne Stone said. The review is required of all states and, in Oklahoma, will result in an estimated 1,053 COVID-19 deaths when the CDC publishes the data Monday, Stone said Thursday. The update will also result in an estimated 1,366 additional coronavirus cases in the state, she said. The department, which investigates each death, has for months reported the CDC’s provisional death count based on death certificates. The health department on Friday reported a total of 10,826 deaths due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, based on the CDC’s provisional death count.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals has reversed a lower court’s decision to throw out an age discrimination lawsuit against a gun retailer, declaring it illegal to deny gun sales to buyers between the ages of 18 and 20. Brandy Dalbeck filed a $10,000 lawsuit against Bi-Mart in 2018 after the company’s Florence store refused to sell her a hunting rifle when she was 18. Bi-Mart had announced that year it would no longer sell guns and ammunition to people under the age of 21. Companies like Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods made similar changes around the same time after 17 students and staff members were killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports federal law bans firearms retailers from selling handguns, but not rifles or shotguns, to anyone under 21. Oregon law allows residents to buy shotguns or rifles starting at age 18. Lane County Circuit Judge Charles D. Carlson dismissed Dalbeck’s case without a trial in 2019. In his order for dismissal, Carlson said Oregon’s anti-discrimination law did not prohibit places like Bi-Mart from discriminating against people between the ages of 18 and 20 based on age – and even if the law did, Bi-Mart could adopt a policy against selling firearms to those under 21 as a matter of public safety. Oregon’s appeals court disagreed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nUpper Darby: A woman was raped by a stranger on a commuter train in suburban Philadelphia in the presence of other riders, who a police official said “should have done something.” Superintendent Timothy Bernhardt of the Upper Darby Police Department said officers were called to the 69th Street terminal about 10 p.m. Wednesday after the assault on the westbound train on the Market-Frankford Line. An employee of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority who was in the vicinity as the train went past called police to report that “something wasn’t right” with a woman aboard the train, Bernhardt said. SEPTA police waiting at the next stop found the woman and arrested a man. The woman was taken to a hospital. Bernhardt called the victim an “unbelievably strong woman” who provided police with a lot of information. She did not know her attacker, he said. “She’s on the mend,” Bernhardt said. “Hopefully she will get through this.” The entire episode was captured on surveillance video that showed other people on the train at the time, Bernhardt said. “There was a lot of people, in my opinion, that should have intervened; somebody should have done something,” Bernhardt said. “It speaks to where we are in society; I mean, who would allow something like that to take place?”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation is providing a $250,000 grant to purchase thousands of opioid overdose prevention kits until a more sustainable source of state funding is in place. The grant announced recently to the University of Rhode Island will enable the Community First Responder Program at its College of Pharmacy to purchase approximately 3,000 Narcan kits for distribution to community-based recovery and harm reduction organizations across the state, the foundation said in a statement. There is a critical need for the kits. Supplies of Narcan, also known as naloxone, are seriously depleted as drug overdoses rise. According to state Department of Health figures, 384 Rhode Islanders died of a drug overdose last year. “Narcan kits are a simple solution to a deadly problem. While our funding will save lives, it’s just a large, yet critically needed Band-Aid until a sustainable funding source is put in place,” foundation President and CEO Neil Steinberg said. The funding will provide about a two-month supply of Narcan. The Rhode Island Foundation is the largest and most comprehensive funder of nonprofit organizations in the state.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An elementary school teacher surrendered to authorities Friday after being accused of having marijuana edibles in a student prize box in her classroom. The 27-year-old teacher from Lexington was behing held on a charge of possession of a Schedule I drug. Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon said the teacher bought a mixed bag of candy to give to her students at Rocky Creek Elementary School, and two students were allowed to get a prize from the candy box Sept. 23. “Marijuana edibles are cannabis-based food products. They come in many forms, but the items in this case were candy,” Sheriff Jay Koon said, adding that while they looked similar to traditional candy brands in wrappers with bright colors, they are illegal in South Carolina. According to the arrest report, one student grabbed a pack of “Stoney Patch Kids” gummies, believing they were “Sour Patch Kids,” and though the teacher told the student to get something else, the child still left with marijuana edibles. The other student grabbed a lollipop. After getting the prize, the student with the gummies went to an after-school day care program and asked his teacher there to help him open the pack. The teacher saw that the candy was not “Sour Patch Kids,” did not open the pack, and contacted the child’s school, the deputy’s report said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpearfish: A junior mineral exploration company is making a new push to find gold in the Black Hills. Solitario Zinc Corp. arrived in Spearfish in July. Todd Christensen, a geologist with Solitario, said the company was invited to evaluate some claims from a group of investors, and “we saw it as an opportunity to get our foot in the door and to evaluate exploration potential.” Solitario will be combing through 580 mining claims that make up about 11,600 acres of land in Lawrence County. Christensen said the company plans to conduct a multiyear surface exploration program and intends to look for deposits like the Homestake deposit. The former Homestake Mine near Lead became the largest and deepest gold mine in North America and generated 40 million ounces of gold during its 126-year life. In 2002, it closed and became an underground research facility. Homestake’s origins were in the Black Hills gold rush of the 1870s. “Currently, we’re collecting samples to get an understanding of the geology and the mineralization potential,” he said. Christensen told the Black Hills Pioneer that Solitario has focused on zinc in recent years but expanded to gold after a geologist with South Dakota roots gave a presentation at a mineral exploration conference in Toronto.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge has limited the ability for now for the nonprofit running Oak Ridge National Laboratory to place employees on unpaid leave who receive exemptions to a COVID-19 vaccine requirement. U.S. District Judge Charles Atchley in Knoxville issued the temporary restraining order Friday barring UT-Battelle from placing employees on indefinite unpaid leave or firing them after they receive a religious or medical accommodation to the vaccines. The six workers who sued have argued they were told the unpaid leave would be indefinite. Their employer said in a court filing that the leave will last 60 days – with health benefits intact – and then will be reevaluated. Those with security clearances will maintain them for 90 days, the filing said. The judge wrote that he will decide by Oct. 29 whether to let the order expire or keep it while the case plays out. He reasoned that “preventing their (employees’) placement on unpaid leave for a matter of two weeks simply will not harm” the organization, while the unpaid leave presents a “functional loss of employment” and other damages for the workers at the lab, which is about 25 miles west of Knoxville. The judge wrote that the order shouldn’t be interpreted that he is inclined to block the order permanently.\n\nTexas\n\nSouthlake: A school district administrator told teachers that if they have books about the Holocaust in their classrooms, they should also have books that offer “opposing” or “other” viewpoints on the subject. Gina Peddy, the executive director of curriculum and instruction for the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, issued the directive this month during a training session about which books teachers can have in their classroom libraries. A staff member secretly made an audio recording of the training session and shared it with NBC News, which broke the story. In the recording, Peddy told the teachers to remember a new Texas law that requires teachers to present multiple perspectives when discussing “widely debated and currently controversial” issues. She said: “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust that you have one that has an opposing – that has other perspectives.” “How do you oppose the Holocaust?” one teacher asked. “Believe me,” Peddy said. “That’s come up.” Texas and some other Republican-controlled states this year moved to regulate what can be taught about race-related ideas in public schools and colleges amid the nation’s racial reckoning after last year’s police killing of George Floyd.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city received more than $1million last year to develop the community from a grant program run by the federal government but only spent about two-thirds of the money. Each year, the city of St. George is given money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make community improvements, especially for moderate- to low-income residents. In the most recent year, the city only used 66% of those funds on community projects. Some went to donations to public service organizations and to purchase fire protective equipment. The Community Development Block Grant funds are meant to be used on providing housing, a suitable living environment and expansion of economic opportunities, according to HUD. “There is a lack of decent affordable units across the board,” said a report in which CDBG detailed the housing situation in St. George. Although the city didn’t use any CDBG funds on creating more affordable housing, the CDBG report indicates the city is trying to remove barriers to accessing affordable housing primarily through encouraging a mix of housing choices such as single-family homes and single-bed apartments and promoting various lot sizes in developments to allow for increased densities.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A group of housing advocates are promising to camp outside the Statehouse until the state does more to help homeless people, one of the advocates said Friday. Brenda Siegel, of Newfane, and others want the expanded eligibility for housing assistance to stay in place through the end of the year. Begun amid the pandemic, the aid is set to expire Thursday. The advocates also want the state to accept federal funds intended for that purpose. “Any measure taken must include people who are on the street now and may be in the future,” Siegel said in an email Friday. In July, the state extended the hotel voucher program, which is used to provide shelter for some of those who experienced homelessness during the pandemic, through mid-September. Gov. Phil Scott later moved to keep the program running for 30 days, until Oct. 21, so a replacement could be developed. On Friday, Rebecca Kelley, a spokesperson for the governor, said in an email that the replacement plan is nearing completion and that a further extension would be included, without providing details. Meanwhile, Siegel said in a text Friday that the advocates would be using sleeping bags to camp in the front of the Statehouse “until appropriate action is taken.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBurke: A man who works for the sergeant-at-arms of the U.S. House of Representatives has been charged with possession of child pornography, according to police. Stefan Bieret, 41, of Burke, was arrested Wednesday and charged with 10 felonies related to possessing child pornography, Fairfax County police said. The Washington Post reports he’s being held without bond and is expected back in court next month. Bieret’s attorney did not return calls seeking comment. The investigation began when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was notified of a potentially illicit image uploaded to a Dropbox account, police said. The matter was reported to a task force on internet crimes against children. The owner of the account was found to live in Fairfax County. County detectives took over the investigation in August. A search warrant on the Dropbox account turned up additional images of child sexual abuse, and subsequent search warrants led detectives to identify the owner of the account as Bieret, officials said. On Wednesday, Fairfax detectives executed a search warrant on Bieret’s home and recovered multiple electronics. Bieret works as a program manager for the sergeant-at-arms, the chief law enforcement and protocol officer for the House of Representatives.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools is suspending 142 school bus routes beginning Monday. District officials said the cuts are necessary because of a national bus driver shortage and because some drivers are choosing not to follow the state-mandated COVID-19 vaccine rules for public employees, The Seattle Times reports. District spokesman Tim Robinson said out of the 18,000 students who are eligible for bus rides, about 6,740 could be affected by the bus route cuts. The 142 bus routes being suspended will not affect students in special education classes, students with individualized education programs, or Section 504 plans that include public transportation services, students experiencing homelessness and foster students. Schools at interim sites or those that serve “high proportions of historically underserved students” also won’t be affected, an email sent to parents Friday said. The district doesn’t know how many students will actually be affected by route shortages because the number of students who ride the bus fluctuates every day, Robinson said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state is ready to move forward with a plan to expand long-sought broadband access in rural communities at a potential cost of more than $1 billion, Gov. Jim Justice announced Friday. The plan, which Justice called the largest investment in broadband in the state’s history, will combine federal and state funding with private-sector investments and aims to bring broadband availability to at least 200,000 additional homes and businesses. “We’re going to change the trajectory of West Virginia in a bigger and better way,” Justice said at a event announcing the program. The plan will combine the state’s $236 million commitment with $362 million in funding from the Federal Communication Commission and $120 million from other state and federal resources, the governor’s office said in a news release. Most of the state funding comes from its share of federal American Rescue Plan allocations. The statement said the money will be allocated through competitive programs that draw additional matching funds from private-sector and local government partners. State Economic Development Director Mitch Carmichael said the plan will boost the ability for rural areas to offer distance learning, remote work and telehealth options.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources policy board plans to vote this week on whether to hire its own attorneys in a pair of lawsuits seeking to block the fall wolf hunt, underscoring the deepening rift between the board’s Republican members and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul. The department announced Friday that the board will convene remotely Monday to take the vote. Board Chairman Fred Prehn said he’s not sure Kaul’s Department of Justice will represent board members’ pro-wolf management position in court because its attorneys aren’t talking to board members. “We haven’t met with them; they haven’t talked to any board members or talked strategy,” Prehn said. “The board feels it’s not being consulted.” Prehn has been at odds with Evers since his term on the board expired in May. The governor appointed Sandra Naas to replace him, a move that would give Evers appointees majority control of the panel. Prehn, who was appointed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, has refused to step down. He maintains he doesn’t have to leave until the Senate confirms Naas. Republicans control the Senate and have made no moves toward a confirmation vote, ensuring the board remains under GOP control.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A 103-year-old man has set a record for the oldest adaptive paraglider to fly in America. Fred Miles doesn’t speak much, but he can hum his way around a melody, and the one coming out of his mouth this past summer as he looked down from the top of the Bridger Gondola at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort was “Take Me Home, Country Roads,” by John Denver. But Miles, 103, wasn’t going home via a car or a road just yet. First he was going tandem adaptive paragliding. It would be his first experience flying, seated in a wheeled cart with a paraglider behind him. It would also be the record-setter for the oldest adaptive paraglider to fly in America.But as his son, Greg Miles, reminded his father just before the flight, it would be far from his first time navigating the skies, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. “Part of the reason you’re not going to have a problem is because of your flying experience,” Greg, a former town councilor, told his father. The senior Miles first piloted a plane 81 years ago after joining the United States Army Air Corps, which eventually became the Air Force. He joined the force after graduating from Syracuse University with an engineering degree and flew in World War II, again in the Korean War and afterward for some time, for a total of 30 years.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/09/01/memorial-island-wildlife-upside-theater-troubles-news-around-states/113639240/", "title": "Memorial island, wildlife upside: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Montgomery Public Schools will use school buses to deliver meals to students along nine bus routes twice a week, in addition to the current designated pickup sites. Every Monday and Wednesday, the buses will deliver meals at 7:15 a.m., or meals can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 16 schools. The student’s name or cafeteria PIN is required.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: The University of Alaska Fairbanks hockey team and other student athletes are in quarantine or isolation after athletes tested positive for COVID-19 following an off-campus party, administrators said. The 37 University of Alaska Fairbanks students, including the entire hockey team, were placed in isolation after six hockey players and an athlete from another university team tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said. Multiple athletes from different sports attended the Aug. 22 gathering, University of Fairbanks Chancellor Dan White said. There were no university staff members at the party, but head hockey coach Erik Largen was also quarantined because he had close contact with players, officials said. The university does not know if every member of the hockey team was at the party. Officials expect hockey games and practices will be postponed, although that was not immediately confirmed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two popular bars in Old Town Scottsdale have had their liquor licenses suspended for violating requirements to reopen under coronavirus protocols. The Arizona State Health Department officials said Bottled Blonde and Casa Amigos were served noncompliance notices Saturday to immediately close as mandated by Gov. Doug Ducey’s executive order issued June 29. Authorities said the bars were both in violation of social distancing, masking, dancing, standing and table occupancy limitations. “Detectives will continue to enforce public health orders and take immediate actions against licensees who are observed showing general disregard for the welfare and safety of others,” Department of Liquor Director John Cocca said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 12 more deaths and 478 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday as the state heads into the second week of in-person school for K-12 students. The total number of confirmed cases of the virus stood at 60,856 on Sunday, though the true number of cases in Arkansas is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 784 virus deaths have been reported in Arkansas since the pandemic began. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said on Twitter that Sunday’s numbers were encouraging compared to Saturday’s, when nearly 800 new cases and 16 deaths were reported. “These are difficult times but so proud of our teachers, students, and athletes for a good start to the school year,” he said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nVentura: A study shows the state’s stay-at-home order in response to the coronavirus seems to have saved some wildlife, as decreased traffic resulted in fewer collisions with mountain lions, deer and other large animals. A study by the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis found traffic declined by about 75% after the emergency health regulation went into effect in March. The number of animals struck and killed by vehicles also fell, including a 58% decrease in fatal crashes involving mountain lions between the 10 weeks before and 10 weeks after the order was in place. The report was one of four released by the center concerning traffic-related impacts of the state’s stay-at-home order, including two studies of vehicle accidents and another of fuel use and climate change. Using carcass and crash reports, researchers found California’s count of 8.4 large wild animals per day killed by vehicles decreased 21% to 6.6 animals.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has reported more than 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to people who attended an annual motorcycle event in Sturgis, South Dakota, last month. The pandemic was expected to reduce attendance by about half at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, KCNC-TV reports. But the event drew some 462,000 people Aug. 7-16, down just 7.5% from the previous year. Some visitors wore masks and practiced social distancing in spite of the large crowds. State officials in Colorado are now asking those who attended the rally and have symptoms to be tested immediately, and they have recommended those without symptoms be tested a week after suspected exposure. “No one that we went with or knew up there has had any symptoms,” said Kevin Bolser, co-owner of Lucky Horsehoe Customs in Englewood. Bolser said members of his group took special precautions to camp in a remote area and self-quarantine after the event.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Connecticut Department of Public Health has fined two nursing homes for failing to test dozens of employees for the coronavirus. Avery Nursing Home in Hartford and Hamden Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in Hamden were both fined $1,140, acting Public Health Commissioner Deidre Gifford said. An executive order signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in June requires weekly testing of nursing home staff until no employees or residents test positive for the virus. Inspectors said Avery Nursing Home did not test 37 employees including nurses and dietary staff in late July and early August. Avery officials told inspectors they have since made testing mandatory. The home’s nursing director told inspectors that vacations had affected the testing process there. The Hamden nursing home failed to test 39 staff members during the same time period, according to the Public Health Department.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Events throughout the weekend commemorated the hundreds of people the state has lost in recent years to the disease of addiction – an epidemic that has continued to surge locally as COVID-19 has spread. So far this year, the state has recorded 254 suspected overdose deaths and seen record spikes in recent months as the pandemic stretches on. Throughout the weekend and at events slated for Monday, International Overdose Awareness Day, those lives were remembered. More than 100 people gathered Friday night at Banning Park, braving the torrential downpours to hang photos of their loved ones inside a covered pavilion and encourage others to seek help. The event, “Overdose Awareness – Remembrance and Prevention,” was largely put on by Delaware Recovery Advocacy Project and Banyan Treatment Centers, which is slated to open a location in Delaware soon.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As of Monday, D.C. is averaging just 50 new cases of the coronavirus a day, WUSA-TV reports. That’s the city’s lowest average since July 10. However, the district has not been able to maintain the sustained downward trend it needs to move to Phase 3.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Some coronavirus restrictions started easing up Monday in parts of South Florida. In Miami-Dade County, restaurants were allowed to welcome back diners to indoor seating for the first time in almost two months, provided masks were worn and the establishments operated at 50% capacity. In Palm Beach County, officials issued an order allowing tattoo and body piercing parlors, as well as tanning salons, to reopen starting Monday. Miami-Dade County also is allowing casinos to reopen, provided food and drink are consumed in eating-only designated areas, and drinking and eating is prohibited at gaming tables and slot machines. Meanwhile, the state’s largest school district resumed classes Monday, though Miami-Dade County Public Schools’ classes will remain online for at least a few weeks. But the remote learning got off to a rocky start. The school district posted on Twitter that its website was having connectivity problems.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s largest teachers group told Gov. Brian Kemp that teachers should be able to decide whether to return to school without being quarantined for COVID-19 exposure if the Republican governor decides to allow that. But the group said Kemp should make sure rapid coronavirus testing is available to teachers. It also wants districts to provide more paid leave, publish coronavirus testing results and let educators with high-risk health conditions work from home. The Professional Association of Georgia Educators sent recommendations to Kemp on Wednesday, a week after the Republican governor acknowledged he was considering declaring teachers “critical infrastructure workers.” Such a designation would mean they would be exempted from the legal requirement to quarantine for 14 days after COVID-19 exposure. The non-union group is still expressing skepticism about the move, in the face of a heavy push by local school superintendents.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Directors leading the state’s health and public safety departments are retiring amid a surge in coronavirus cases on Oahu and an ongoing outbreak at the state’s largest jail. Gov. David Ige announced Monday the retirements of Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Anderson and Department of Public Safety Director Nolan Espinda. Anderson will retire Sept. 15. Dr. Libby Char, an emergency physician, will take over. Espinda will take personal leave through September and will officially retire Oct. 1. Maria Cook, the deputy director for administration, will be interim director, and Espinda will be available for advice before October. The Department of Health has been criticized over its contact tracing efforts as Hawaii has seen an alarming surge in reported coronavirus cases in recent weeks.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Educational officials in the state have approved a temporary regulation allowing schools to use their full-time equivalent enrollment numbers instead of average daily attendance to calculate state funding as several students have started remote learning during the pandemic. The Idaho State Board of Education unanimously approved the change, which is already in effect, the Lewiston Tribune reports. The regulation will provide school districts the ability to count students who may not physically be in classrooms by measuring the amount of minutes students spend in their courses, Associate Deputy Superintendent Tim Hill said. Several legislators had previously disagreed with the approved change, arguing for a legislative decision. Others have said the districts can’t afford to wait until January for the next legislative session. The board is scheduled to revisit the rule after a 21-day comment period.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Some road construction projects scheduled to be completed this year could be delayed until next year because of lower-than-anticipated gas tax revenues during the coronavirus pandemic. State Transportation Department Secretary Omer Osman said the department hasn’t yet assessed how many projects might be pushed back, the (Springfield) State Journal-Register reports. He told lawmakers during a Senate Transportation Committee hearing Thursday that the department will prioritize projects related to safety improvements. “I can’t afford to lose a bridge, but I could live with a little bit of potholes,” Osman said. Gas tax revenues used to fund road projects were much lower than originally projected because people are driving less during the pandemic, Osman said. According to the Illinois Department of Transportation, from March through June, motor fuel tax revenues are down $82 million from the same period last year.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A nonprofit group has launched a marketing and social media campaign aimed at luring people back to the city’s downtown, where businesses are suffering amid the coronavirus pandemic and social unrest that left its mark on the area. The citywide “Back Downtown” initiative announced Thursday by Downtown Indy Inc. in partnership with Section 127 encourages residents to patronize downtown businesses to help reinvigorate the heart of Indiana’s capital. The campaign by the private, nonprofit group that works to boost downtown Indianapolis includes banners that will be installed around downtown and a short video to convince people to return to the area to shop, dine and play. “This concept serves as a rallying cry and inspires residents to discover downtown again,” Downtown Indy said in a news release.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state continued Monday to record a high number of new positive coronavirus cases as it struggles with the virus spreading in several counties, including those with university campuses. Data from the Iowa Department of Public Health showed 611 new positive cases, sending the total to 64,713. Two additional deaths were reported, raising the total to 1,112 deaths. With many K-12 schools back in class, some districts also are struggling with high levels of county virus activity. Twelve counties had a positivity rate of 15% or higher, the threshold Gov. Kim Reynolds has set for schools to request to go to online teaching. The rate is three times the 5% rate recommended by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Five counties have positive rates above 20%, the data shows. On Saturday, the state’s 14-day rolling total of positive cases reached an all-time high of 11,091.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The coronavirus is hitting fraternities and sororities in the state particularly hard, with 10% testing positive at the University of Kansas and outbreaks linked to four sororities at Kansas State University. The University of Kansas said Friday that it has conducted 21,719 tests, and 474 have been positive, for a positive rate of 2.18%. But among sororities and fraternities, there have been 270 positives among 2,698 members tested. The university began testing every student, faculty and staff member for COVID-19 as they returned to campus last month. At Kansas State, health officials announced six cases at Alpha Delta Pi, six at Alpha Xi Delta, five at Chi Omega and five at Kappa Delta, The Kansas City Star reports. The cases have resulted in quarantines.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Trump administration’s immigration squeeze and the hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic threaten to leave the horse racing industry short of workers, officials warn as they prepare for a reconfigured Kentucky Derby. The racing world’s premier event, rescheduled to take place Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, hasn’t been severely hampered by the looming labor shortage so far. But trainers and advocates say President Donald Trump’s executive order extending the federal government’s March suspension of certain types of work visas has added to an air of uncertainty in a business that relies heavily on an immigrant workforce. The number of available workers is difficult to determine, as is the impact of the coronavirus. The visa ban through the end of the year and the pandemic have made crossing the border tougher, and the outbreak also has limited travel from countries like Mexico and Guatemala, from which many workers hail.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMonroe: The state reported 19 more COVID-19 deaths Monday, but hospitalizations declined for the first time since Wednesday. The Louisiana Department of Health reported 326 new cases Monday, the lowest single-day total since June 8, but the state closed community drive-thru testing sites last week because of Hurricane Laura. Louisiana has reported 148,193 cases since the first confirmed case was recorded in the state in March. Hospitalizations dropped by 21 Monday to 881, while the number of patients who needed ventilators dropped by 11 to 132. Louisiana’s COVID-19 death toll since March is 4,787.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: Aquaboggan Water Park says “strict and inconsistent state regulations” have forced it to close for the season. Park officials said an update to Maine coronavirus safety guidelines reduced the number of people allowed in the park from 1,500 to 100. Police showed up Friday to serve managers with a cease-and-desist letter. Aquaboggan officials said the water park in Saco should be treated the same as beaches and other open spaces. But they chose not to defy the state. “We plan to confront the inconsistency of the guidelines by working to create policy change rather than operate against them, but unfortunately this takes time,” Aquaboggan posted on social media. The park was one of a handful of entertainment venues that had remained open this summer in Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBelair: Harford County Public Schools will not be issuing laptops to most of its elementary school students when school starts this month, even though schools are starting the semester with online classes for all students. School system Superintendent Sean Bulson said Friday in a message to families that the district doesn’t have enough laptops because of high demand and a manufacturing shortage. As a result, computers will only be issued to those in fourth grade or higher. Teachers in kindergarten through third grade will still conduct live, online classes “for any student who can access it.” The school system learned last month that its laptop order couldn’t be filled on time. The system asked families who could do so to opt out of receiving a school-issued computer, but the system still faces a shortage, Bulson said. The school system hopes it will have more computers available by mid-October.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is joining the city of Boston and three suburban communities to create up to 14 miles of dedicated bus lanes it is hoped will improve reliability and reduce on-board crowding during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, officials said. Several of the bus routes selected for the project that includes Somerville, Everett and Chelsea provide critical connections for people heading to essential jobs and are among the agency’s busiest, the T said in a statement. Bus lanes can reduce crowding on buses and limit the amount of time riders spend in close proximity to others while on the bus, officials said. The new lanes will help the economy reopen and help the region recover from the pandemic. The program will start this fall and run through the spring, according to a statement from the T. Emergency response vehicles and school buses will also be allowed to use the bus lanes.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: An island park in the city has become an extraordinary memorial garden, with cars packed with families slowly passing hundreds of photos of residents who have died from COVID-19. Mayor Mike Duggan declared Monday Detroit Memorial Day to honor the 1,500-plus city victims of the pandemic. Hearses escorted by police led solemn all-day processions around Belle Isle Park in the Detroit River after bells rang across the region at 8:45 a.m. Radio station WRCJ, which plays classical music and jazz, added gospel to its playlist and read the names of the deceased. “It is our hope that seeing these beautiful faces on the island today … will wake people up to the devastating effect of the pandemic,” said Rochelle Riley, Detroit’s director of arts and culture. More than 900 photos submitted by families were turned into large posters and staked around Belle Isle, revealing the crushing breadth of the virus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: When K-12 students in the metro area return to school this year, upward of 2,800 will do so virtually, even if their school district is reopening in person. In the St. Cloud school district, roughly 1,600 students – more than 17% of the student population – are opting for distance learning this year. About 10% of students in Sartell-St. Stephen and 12% of students Sauk Rapids-Rice are choosing distance learning. When the state announced reopening guidelines for public school districts July 30, it mandated districts offer distance learning throughout the year regardless of which learning model districts implemented. Districts are selecting learning models – in-person, hybrid or distance – based on the 14-day case rates of COVID-19 in their respective counties, as well as other factors such as whether buildings provide enough space for social distancing.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Health care advocates are renewing a push for Medicaid expansion in this state where Republican leaders have long been opposed. They say the changing tide has followed rising income inequality, joblessness and pressure from hospitals in economic turmoil – issues exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Medicaid is a government health insurance program for the needy, aged, blind and disabled, paid by state and federal money. Because Mississippi is poor, the federal government pays nearly 78% of the cost. Under expansion, the federal government pays 90% of the cost in any state. Roy Mitchell, executive director of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program, said hospitals are in desperate need of the dollars. “Let’s face it, providers are businessmen. Despite their marketing, they are inherently out to make a profit, and they are going to have to wake up in Mississippi,” Mitchell said. “I’m sure COVID did a good job of doing that.”\n\nMissouri\n\nHillsboro: A county just south of St. Louis revoked a mask mandate just one day after passing it. The Jefferson County Health Center Board of Trustees voted unanimously Friday to revoke the ordinance. The county said the decision was made after residents raised concerns about whether the board had appropriately notified the public before discussing the ordinance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The board had approved the ordinance Thursday, 3-2, after a contentious meeting that lasted more than five hours. The board said it had not determined a date for a future meeting to consider the order again. State Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, raised concerns Friday about potential Sunshine Law violations. She said she was preparing to file a lawsuit against the board Friday afternoon, before she learned about the emergency meeting to revoke the ordinance.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The first case of a rare, COVID-19-related inflammatory disease in the state has been reported in a child from Teton County, health officials said. The patient was treated at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, or MIS-C. It is a condition in which different body parts become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cause is unknown, but many of the children previously had the virus that causes COVID-19 or had been around someone with the respiratory virus, a CDC official said. The family of 14-year-old Kyona Yeager of Fairfield has reported she was hospitalized in intensive care in Salt Lake last month with a high fever and an enlarged liver, spleen and gallbladder and fluid in her lungs – an illness believed to have followed a COVID-19 infection.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska State Penitentiary has been placed under quarantine after 29 inmates tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Sunday. The cases were identified by tests that were done Friday. Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Scott Frakes said the cases included inmates in four different housing units, so the entire prison was placed under quarantine. Officials said roughly 600 inmates were initially offered tests under the voluntary program, and 332 agreed to be tested. Frakes said most of the inmates who tested positive have not had any symptoms. Warden Michele Wilhelm said the entire facility will be under quarantine for at least two weeks. Frakes said prisoner visits will remain on hold across the agency while the penitentiary is in quarantine. There have also been 64 corrections department employees who have tested positive for COVID-19 since the outbreak began. Of those, 54 have recovered.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials in the city are launching a drive-thru coronavirus testing blitz, with help from the federal government and a goal of reaching 60,000 people. Appointments are not required but are encouraged at three “Stop, Swab & Go” sites that opened Monday at the Fiesta hotel-casino in Henderson, the Texas Station hotel-casino in North Las Vegas, and Sam Boyd Stadium in southeast Las Vegas. Tests are free, and no proof of health insurance or identification is required. Health officials have reported about 69,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 illness statewide and more than 1,300 deaths. More than 59,000 of those cases have been in the Las Vegas area, along with at least 1,125 deaths. Testing will be conducted 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday, with self-administered nasal swabs. All three locations will be closed on Labor Day. Appointments can be made online at www.DoINeedaCOVID19Test.com.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBedford: School is continuing as scheduled in the local school district after one student tested positive for COVID-19, triggering a contact tracing effort and cleaning at the school. WMUR-TV reports the Riddle Brook School student in Bedford who tested positive is suspected to have contracted the virus at a sports camp in another town. The student had been in the building Friday. Half of the class was at the school, which is on a hybrid learning system. The test for the student, who was asymptomatic, came back positive Saturday. Families were notified Sunday with an email and voicemail. None of the students at Riddle Brook met the exposure criteria of being within 6 feet for 10 minutes or more within a 4-hour period, officials said. Administrators believe protocols in place such as masks, distancing and reduced class sizes prevented further transmission.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Indoor dining will resume and movie theaters will reopen Friday, both with limited capacity, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Movie theater attendance will be capped at 25% capacity or 150 people, whichever is less. Restaurants will only be able to have 25% capacity under the new rules, which includes maintaining social distancing between tables. Masks must be worn except when eating or drinking. “Reopening responsibly will help us restore one of our state’s key industries while continuing to make progress against #COVID19,” Murphy, a Democrat, wrote in a tweet Monday announcing the updated regulations. On Tuesday, gyms and health clubs are cleared to reopen, also at 25% capacity and with a mask requirement. The state is in the second of three stages of reopening.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Democratic Party of New Mexico hopes to broaden participation in the Nov. 3 election as it launches a daytime telephone hotline and online resources about balloting. State Democratic Party Executive Director Chelsey Evans said the initiative that began Monday aims to inform voters about new options and deadlines for requesting and casting absentee ballots. The coronavirus pandemic already reshaped voting in New Mexico, with absentee voting by mail or drop-off delivery soaring in popularity during the June primary. Evans said the voter education project sponsored by Democrats will publicize key deadlines such as Oct. 20, the last date when absentee ballot requests can be received by county clerks. Hotline operators won’t ask callers about party affiliation and are available to help anyone with voting questions, she said. The party has scrapped door-to-door canvassing operations in response to COVID-19.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Nurses on the front lines of the state’s COVID-19 pandemic are calling for the state to enact minimum staffing standards ahead of another wave of infections. Health care industry leaders, though, warn that passing such a law would saddle facilities with billions of dollars in extra costs they can’t afford. Under legislation now before a legislative committee, the state would for the first time set minimum nurse-to-patient ratios, including a standard of one nurse for every two patients in intensive care units. California now has such a law. Other states don’t. Supporters say the legislation would boost the quality of care, reduce staff burnout and let the state hold health care facilities accountable for inadequate staffing. Minimum staffing ratios also might have helped last spring, they say, when hospitals and nursing homes in the New York City metropolitan area were overwhelmed with a flood of COVID-19 patients.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Four people who were at the Republican National Convention in the city have tested positive for the coronavirus, health officials in Mecklenburg County said. WBTV reports those who tested positive at the event were immediately isolated. Meanwhile, one of the state’s U.S. senators, Thom Tillis, said he “fell short of my own standard” by failing to keep his face mask on in the White House crowd while listening to President Donald Trump accept the Republican nomination. Tillis, who is in a tough reelection bid against Democrat Cal Cunningham, has been consistently talking up face coverings as a chief method to slow the spread of COVID-19. At dozens of virtual town hall meetings, he’s urged participants to wear them when near others. But media outlets showed images of Tillis within the tightly packed, largely unmasked crowd, also not wearing a mask.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The mayor has ordered bars to close early due to a spike in coronavirus cases among young adults. Mayor Brandon Bochenski issued an emergency declaration temporarily modifying closing hours for bars, bars/restaurants and off-sales to 11 p.m. The order took effect Saturday night. Normal bar closing in Grand Forks is 2 a.m. Bochenski attended a round table discussion in Fargo on Saturday with Gov. Doug Burgum and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, about how to stem the spread of the virus. The mayor said the recent spike has made it necessary to limit mass gatherings of people in close quarters. “With the exponential increase in positive COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks among the 20-29 age population, this is a necessary action,” Bochenski said in a statement. He said his order “will help us slow the spread and get us back.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Performing arts groups financially devastated by the coronavirus shutdown received good news last week, tempered by a harsh economic reality. A public health order from Gov. Mike DeWine greenlighted performances again, while setting strict audience caps that theater groups say aren’t economically viable – a position with which even the governor himself agrees. Outdoor entertainment facilities are limited to at most 1,500 people or 15% of a venue’s capacity, whichever figure is smaller, according to a public health order issued Wednesday by DeWine’s interim health director Lance Himes. Seating in indoor facilities is limited to 300 people or 15% of a venue’s capacity, whichever is less. In reality, those indoor limits could be even smaller with social distancing. DeWine’s guidelines came despite recommendations by theater directors and arts advocacy group Ohio Citizens for the Arts that he should consider less strict limits or leave decisions up to theater groups altogether.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Despite warnings from state and federal health officials, a recent survey shows more than one-third of Oklahoma’s public school districts don’t require staff and students to wear masks. The informal survey of public schools released Thursday shows that about 65% of districts require either all or some students or staff to wear masks, but more than 35% of districts do not. A White House Coronavirus Task Force report, released last week by state officials, shows Oklahoma has the eighth-highest coronavirus positivity rate in the nation and 12th-highest number of new cases per capita. The report urges Oklahoma to impose a statewide mask mandate and order the closure of bars, but Gov. Kevin Stitt has resisted those calls. State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister proposed a mask mandate for schools in counties with a high number of coronavirus cases, but the Board of Education voted to defer that decision to districts.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The statewide metrics required for in-person schooling to resume still have a ways to go when it comes to weekly COVID-19 cases. Though declining since July, the latest data show Oregon has about 40 cases per 100,000 people statewide, compared to the goal of 10, which has to be met three weeks in a row. The state is much closer when it comes to the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests. The state’s positivity rate is 5.1%, hovering just over the state target of 5% or less. This metric has also been declining since late July. Patrick Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority, and Dean Sidelinger, health officer for the state, said the collective actions of Oregonians using face masks, isolation, limited social gatherings and social distancing have had a positive impact on lowering cases. The state is modeling its school reopening requirements after other countries that have done so successfully, without a resurgence of cases.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Temple University announced a two-week halt of in-person classes as city officials called on all college and university students to avoid all social gatherings with people outside their households. Temple officials said Sunday that new test results over the weekend had pushed the number of active COVID-19 cases from the 58 reported Friday to 103 active cases, most of them among people with no symptoms and a small number with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. University president Richard Englert said officials believe they are seeing “new cases that result from small social gatherings happening off campus.” He said that prompted the two-week “pause” on in-person classes and a contact tracing effort. Temple said in-person classes would go online starting Monday and continue online through Friday, Sept. 11, with only classes deemed essential by college deans held in person.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Foundation has distributed another $1 million from its COVID-19 Response Fund to 19 nonprofits to help ensure that residents can pay for food, rent, utilities and other essential expenses during the pandemic, the organization announced Monday. The fund has now distributed more than $7 million. The Blackstone Valley Community Action Program in Pawtucket will use most of its grant to help clients with rental assistance and to stock its food pantry. Commercial Fisheries of R.I. in South Kingstown; the Refugee Dream Center in Providence; the Rhode Island Community Food Bank in Providence; the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center in Newport; and Westbay Community Action in Warwick are among the organizations receiving grants in the latest round of funding.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: City officials shut down a pool party Saturday at an apartment complex near the University of South Carolina, saying at least 200 people were crowded around without masks, violating rules meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “The pool was fully loaded,” Columbia Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins told WLTX-TV. “They had people in the pool; they had people around the pool; they had people on top of the pool house.” Jenkins said he arrived at the Apartments at Palmetto Compress about 6 p.m. Saturday and, after talking to a security guard and the complex manager, persuaded them to close the pool for several days. “That was just a perfect storm to spread the virus. If someone in the crowd had it, it was just a perfect storm,” Jenkins said. Complex residents include a number of University of South Carolina students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Active coronavirus cases continue to climb in the state, with 187 new positive results, the Department of Health reported Monday. At the same time, hospitalization rates remain well below their peak in May. The 76 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Monday’s report were two fewer than Sunday. No new deaths were reported, leaving the state’s total at 167. Kim Malsam-Rysdon, the Department of Health secretary, said fatalities in the previous week were 33% lower than the week before. “Our death rate is, in fact, on a downward trend,” she said. South Dakota hasn’t reported a decrease in active cases since Aug. 18. At the time, there were 1,163 active cases. As of Monday, there were 2,730. People under 30 accounted for 95 of the new cases, including 63 people in their 20s. State epidemiologist Dr. Joshua Clayton said 105 cases among South Dakotans have been connected with the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin: In response to the county’s mask mandate expiring over the weekend, Franklin Mayor Ken Moore issued an advisory to city residents asking them to continue wearing face coverings in public. Overnight Saturday, the mandatory mask mandate expired in Williamson County, after Mayor Rogers Anderson said cases of the novel coronavirus were low enough to justify the change. Moore said he respected the decision but still wanted Franklin residents to consider wearing masks when out in public to combat the virus. “As mayor of Franklin, my first priority is to protect the well-being of our community,” he said. “As your mayor and as a medical doctor for more than 50 years, I am imploring Franklin citizens to continue to do their part to fight COVID-19.” Moore said the data in Williamson County showed progress in combating COVID-19, but there was “still work to do.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State health officials on Saturday reported the number of deaths due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, has surpassed 12,500, and the number of reported cases is now above 610,000. There are 610,354 coronavirus cases and 12,510 deaths, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The true number of cases in Texas is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The number of reported cases rose by 3,759, and the total COVID-19 deaths were up by 90 from Saturday, the department said. The department also reported an estimated 98,326 active cases, a decline of 2,863 from the 101,189 reported Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: Utah State University quarantined nearly 300 students for COVID-19 after wastewater samples from four dormitories showed elevated levels of the coronavirus, according to school officials. The college said Sunday that 287 students would be tested who live in the Rich, Jones, Morgan and Davis dorms on the campus in Logan. There have been no reported positive tests for COVID-19 in those residence halls so far. Students in those dorms must quarantine until the test results are available, which could take up to four days. They are also asked to fill out a form to ensure they receive academic support, food deliveries and other resources. Classes were scheduled to begin Monday for about 28,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Utah State is among the schools around the country using wastewater sampling to help safeguard against a COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Public health officials said the state is considering becoming the second to mandate flu shots as a way to ease the burden of influenza amid the coronavirus pandemic. Vermont Health Commissioner Mark Levine said Friday that the rate of flu in the state needs to be as low as possible to avoid a situation he called a “twindemic.” He said last year less than 43% of children age 5 to 12 received the flu vaccine. “Our primary focus will be to increase the rate of vaccination, especially among children and teens,” Levine said. “We can and must do better.” Levine said a decision has not been reached about whether to require universal flu vaccines for all students. He said the decision about whether to require flu shots will be “driven, as always, by data and science.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia announced it is moving ahead with plans to offer in-person instruction for the fall semester. In a statement posted on the school’s website, UVA officials said they had initially delayed the start of in-person undergraduate classes by two weeks to allow for more assessment of the spread of COVID-19. They also said they delayed the decision in order to take a look at how other schools have fared since opening. UVA said it is now proceeding with plans to welcome students to residence halls starting Thursday and to begin in-person instruction for undergraduates Sept. 8. “We know some will be delighted to hear this news and others will be disappointed,” the statement said. Among other factors, including the value of in-person instruction, the school said a majority of UVA students will be in Charlottesville, living in private houses and apartments, regardless of how classes are conducted.\n\nWashington\n\nPullman: The number of coronavirus cases in Whitman County has nearly tripled in the past week, one of the highest growth rates in the nation. The county is home to Washington State University, and students have been pouring into Pullman in the past week for the start of the school year. The Spokesman-Review reports the county’s COVID-19 case count rose to 422 on Saturday. The county said in a press release that of 58 new positive cases reported in the county Saturday, 22 were in people 19 or younger, and 36 were in people ages 20 to 39. Pullman ranks fifth in the United States for metro areas where new cases are rising the fastest, on a population-adjusted basis, according to a New York Times case tracker. The Times reported Pullman had only 14 new confirmed cases of the virus the week before last and 222 last week. Pullman Police Chief Gary Jenkins has said officers will issue tickets for violations of pandemic restrictions.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: The State Fair of West Virginia is off this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the tradition of a limited-edition basket continues, officials said. The baskets are made by Jamit Baskets of Sinks Grove. Orders are being accepted through the end of September. “Even though there is a lot about this year we’d rather forget, it is a part of our history,” CEO Kelly Collins said. “This also gives a chance to celebrate and promote one of our local artisans, which is an important part of what we do.” This year’s basket is available in four different colors and may only be purchased ahead by special order. More information is available through the State Fair Office. The 96th State Fair is scheduled for Aug. 12-21, 2021.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A crucial Phase 3 clinical trial of a vaccine against COVID-19 begins this week at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health and its teaching hospital, UW Health. On Tuesday afternoon, the first of an expected 2,000 participants in the trial will be injected in the shoulder, either with the vaccine developed by the English drug company AstraZeneca or with a placebo. The trial of the vaccine, known as AZD1222, is taking place at scores of sites around the world. “It’s kind of a pivotal moment in attacking COVID-19,” said William Hartman, an assistant professor of anesthesiology who will lead the UW portion of the trial. “It’s an honor for UW now to be able to contribute to the effort to find a vaccine, to do our part in helping bring the world back to normal.” The vaccine being tested uses a manipulated version of a weakened virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Donations to the University of Wyoming were up last year compared to the year before but down compared to the five-year average. The $43.6 million raised over the fiscal year that ended June 30 was slightly more than $42.3 million in recently announced cuts to address declining state revenue due to downturns in the coal, oil and natural gas industries. The university foundation raised $41.6 million in the 2018-2019 fiscal year. The five-year annual fundraising average is above $50 million, the Laramie Boomerang reports. “Even during these historic times of hardship and uncertainty, our alumni and friends, along with our corporate and foundation partners, continue to prioritize support for Wyoming’s university,” university foundation President and CEO Ben Blalock said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/16/vaccine-relief-cooking-virus-drive-legislating-news-around-states/115155706/", "title": "Vaccine relief, 'cooking the virus': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Regulators have loosened rules to make it easier for out-of-state doctors to work in Alabama as the coronavirus pandemic both fills hospital beds and strains medical staff by sickening doctors and nurses, officials said as the first doses of vaccine arrived. With an average of more than 2,100 people hospitalized daily over the past week with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners and the Medical Licensure Commission decided to let qualified physicians from other states and Canada seek temporary emergency licenses to work in the state. The Alabama Hospital Association has reported staffing shortages caused by an inadequate number of beds in places and a lack of staff to treat patients, partly because medical workers are among the ill. Dr. Mark LeQuire, chairman of the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners, said in a statement that hospitals are dealing with a doctor shortage as the number of COVID-19 patients increases. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Lawmakers who each year relocate to a capital city accessible only by plane or boat are facing challenges in getting settled ahead of what is expected to be a difficult legislative session overshadowed by COVID-19. The Baranof Hotel, a 1939 art deco showpiece in downtown Juneau with about 200 guest rooms, laundry service and a restaurant just blocks from the Capitol, is closed through the winter due to the pandemic. Short-term housing rental offerings have been sluggish compared to last year, officials say, though they expect more places to become available as the session approaches and plenty of hotel options, as many events have been waylaid by the virus. Still, with just over a month before session is set to begin, some lawmakers are waiting to lock down digs. One factor is uncertainty about how – and for how long – lawmakers plan to meet. “If I need to, I’ll sleep in my office,” Sen. Scott Kawasaki, a Fairbanks Democrat, said with a laugh. For years, he has shared a place with a fellow lawmaker. But he said the place they had last session is booked, and he was wary about signing a contract on a fallback option if lawmakers end up deciding to take an extended recess, as they did earlier this year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: With all its sensitive electronic equipment, the cockpit of an airplane is a difficult place to clean with chemicals. A new study released by the University of Arizona suggests heat is an effective way to kill the novel coronavirus on the surfaces of the flight deck. The study is part of several between scientists in Tucson and Seattle-based airplane manufacturer Boeing who are studying whether different cleaning practices are effective against the virus that causes COVID-19. An earlier study showed that the chemical disinfectants airlines are using, including electrostatic foggers and ultraviolet wands, are effective in removing the coronavirus from airplane surfaces. Boeing wanted to study whether thermal disinfection – heating an area at a high enough temperature for a long enough time – would kill the virus in areas where chemical components might damage sensitive equipment. “We’re basically cooking the virus,” Dr. Charles Gerba, a University of Arizona microbiologist who is leading the research, said in a press release. The tests showed more than 99.9% of the virus was destroyed after three hours of exposure to temperatures of about 120 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s first person vaccinated against COVID-19 was Sherian Kwanisai, the Arkansas Health Department’s nursing director for local public health. “I’m excited,” said Kelley Garner, program manager with the department’s Healthcare Acquired Infections Program, who was the second to get vaccinated. “I know this is the first step to getting back to normal.” The first doses of vaccine arrived Monday morning as COVID-19 continued to surge. Arkansas’ confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,355 to 187,057 on Monday, and 45 more people in the state died from COVID-19, bringing its total fatalities since the pandemic began to 2,990. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dropped by seven to 1,050. Twenty-seven percent of the state’s 8,943 hospital beds were available, and 7% – or 81 – of the state’s 1,160 intensive care unit beds were available, according to the Department of Health. There were 372 COVID-19 patients in ICUs around the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: As coronavirus surges out of control across the state with an average of more than 31,000 cases reported a day, Gov. Gavin Newsom applauded Monday as he watched an intensive care unit nurse in Los Angeles receive one of the first doses of vaccine in the state. Newsom noted that the 33,000 first doses to arrive in California roughly matched the number of cases the state was seeing each day. The COVID-19 vaccine couldn’t have come soon enough with hospitals facing an onslaught of patients, ICUs in jeopardy of being overwhelmed in most of the state, and additional hospital beds being set up in an arena, a gym and a convention center, among nearly a dozen overflow sites. “Protect me,” ICU nurse Helen Cordova said as a colleague rolled up the right sleeve of her scrubs and jabbed her in the shoulder to a round of applause from Newsom, Mayor Eric Garcetti and other workers who gathered for the cheerful event. Cordova said she had initially been reluctant to get the vaccine but changed her mind after discussing it with colleagues, reading research and considering the misery she’s witnessed at work, where even some patients who recovered have struggled.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado has sued a county sheriff, claiming jail inmates went months without access to masks as confirmed COVID-19 cases increased in the facility. The group filed the 36-page complaint in U.S. District Court on Sunday against El Paso County Sheriff Bill Elder alleging widespread failures at the jail and “deliberate indifference” to the dangers of the virus resulting in more than 1,000 inmates contracting COVID-19 in late October, The Gazette reports. The lawsuit alleges the sheriff’s office had “disordered, mismanaged” policies that allowed sick and healthy inmates to intermingle with newly arrived inmates without quarantining. “We have heard from prisoners whose masks get broken or damaged that they can’t get replacement masks,” ACLU Legal Director Mark Silverstein said. “They’re told, ‘We don’t have enough masks to give you a replacement. We don’t have enough masks to give you two to wear one while the other’s being washed.’ ” The lawsuit seeks improvements, including better medical care for the infected inmates and two free cloth masks for each inmate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Hospitals in New Haven and Hartford received their first deliveries of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, the second day of distribution in Connecticut. Yale New Haven Hospital and Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford each received about 2,000 doses and planned to begin vaccinating health care staff in the several hospitals run by their parent organizations. “We’re so proud. We’re ready to crush COVID,” said Stacy Vaeth, executive director of pharmacy at Yale New Haven Hospital. “It’s a bright day for us, and we’re very excited to be a part of this movement.” First priority for the vaccine in Connecticut is being given to front-line health workers who treat COVID-19 patients. From mid-January to May, about 1 million people in the state are expected to get vaccinated. They include critical workers, people living in other congregate settings, people over age 65 and those under age 65 who are at high risk. All others are expected to have access to a vaccine in June.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The first COVID-19 vaccination in the First State took place Tuesday morning, marking a significant turning point in the response to a pandemic that has infected more than 45,000 Delawareans and killed more than 800. After receiving the shot, Elisabeth Cote, a progressive care unit nurse at Bayhealth Hospital’s Kent Campus in Dover, took a deep breath, lowered her shirt sleeve, stood up and walked away. “This is a moment of hope for Delaware and for our country,” Gov. John Carney said in a statement. Cote works on a COVID-19 unit at Bayhealth. In an interview posted by the governor, she said her motivation for getting vaccinated is to be able to emerge from isolation to spend time with her grandfather, who is at high risk for the disease, and her parents. “I would love to be able to go and hug my mom and hug my grandfather and spend more time with my family,” she said. “To think we’ve been here since March, it’s exhausting.” The vaccine arrives as Delaware faces the strongest surge of the coronavirus to date. Over the past week, the state has reported 821 new cases per day. As of Sunday evening, 373 people were hospitalized, the most ever.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University Hospital received its first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines Monday, and its CEO said she would be taking the shot to send a message to the Black community, WUSA-TV reports. The hospital planned to begin inoculating health care workers Tuesday, including CEO Anita Jenkins. “It’s been a hard fight, and I want us to win,” Jenkins said. Jenkins took over the helm at Howard University Hospital just one month before the country’s COVID-19 lockdown. Her career in D.C. has been shaped by the stress and price of the pandemic. “Health care disparities, research, all of that has not necessarily been a smooth ride for Black and brown people in the United States,” Jenkins said. “That’s why this COVID vaccine is met with skepticism. But let’s please understand, we are losing the battle with COVID. Black and brown people are dying about three times more from this disease than others, or even our country at large.” Jenkins said people of color simply cannot afford to sit this one out. The CEO wants people to trust the vaccine, so she will be the first in line to receive one of the hospital’s 725 doses.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Officials in tourism-dependent central Florida are hoping bodybuilders and show dogs help kick-start a rebound for convention business that was laid low this year by the pandemic. The Orlando Sentinel reports Joe Weider’s Olympia Fitness and Performance Weekend, a gathering of muscle men and women, is expected to bring about 3,000 people to the Orange County Convention Center this week. They will follow thousands of dogs and handlers who were at the Orange County Convention Center last week for the AKC National Championship dog show. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace,” Convention Center Executive Director Mark Tester told local tourism officials at a meeting this month. “But we feel that we’re in a really solid place as it relates to a lot of our competitors.” Some of Orlando’s biggest convention competitors have not hosted a gathering since the COVID-19 crisis erupted in early spring. Indeed, the body-building competition was originally scheduled to be held in Las Vegas but was moved to Orlando because Nevada’s more-restrictive attendance rules would have limited crowds to 250 spectators.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The first coronavirus vaccines in the state were administered Tuesday as new infections continued to soar, and many schools closed in-person classes for the remainder of the last week before Christmas. Gov. Brian Kemp and Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey visited Savannah as the first four shots were administered to representatives of the Chatham County Health Department and Savannah’s three hospitals, who will in turn give the shots to co-workers. The Republican governor warned the state is “not out of the woods.” Georgia’s rolling seven-day average of confirmed and suspected virus cases surpassed its summer peak for the 13th straight day, with the state now averaging nearly 6,000 cases a day. At least 14 Georgia school districts have sent all students home, according to the Georgia Department of Education, canceling in-person classes for the remaining week. Others have sent groups of students, like all those in high schools home, or have closed individual schools. Nearly 3,000 people were hospitalized statewide with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, with more than 20 hospitals saying their intensive care units or entire hospitals were full. The state has recorded more than 10,000 confirmed and suspected deaths.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell agreed to delay the enforcement of a plastic utensils ban on businesses on Oahu by 90 days. Businesses on the island that serve prepared food will now have until March 31 to use up their existing stock of plastic utensils under the mayor’s extension announced Thursday. The Hawaii Restaurant Association and Hawaii Food Industry Association had been asking Caldwell to delay enforcement of the ordinance that was scheduled to begin Jan. 1 because of economic issues throughout the industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “The restaurant industry is one of our largest industries here in urban Honolulu,” Caldwell said. “It employed, prior to the pandemic, 55,000 people, generating billions of dollars in revenue, and they’re really hurting. Many of them hang on by their fingernails hoping for that brighter summer that is coming, but they need to get to that summer.” The ban had been approved by the Honolulu City Council in December 2019. The ordinance also includes plans to ban the distribution of plastic plates, bowls and other food items starting in 2022, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: The first COVID-19 vaccine in the state has been administered to an eastern Idaho physician. Gov. Brad Little said on social media Monday that Dr. Russ McUne in Rexburg was the first Idahoan to receive the vaccine. The state Department of Health and Welfare said it is expecting 13,650 doses of the new COVID-19 vaccine to arrive by later in the week. The vaccine advisory committee discussed the state’s needs recently and determined that health care workers would be receiving the first doses, CBS-2 reports. “As an ER physician working front lines, working with a lot of COVID, this is a vaccine that we’ve been waiting for for a long time,” McUne told the Post Register. “So this is definitely something we need people to see, we need people to be able to do, and I want to set an example that this is not something to be afraid of. This is going to help us. We really really need this vaccine in people.” Hospitals in Idaho are near capacity as infections, hospitalizations and deaths linked to COVID-19 continue rising.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Health care workers in Chicago and Peoria received the first COVID-19 vaccinations Tuesday during ceremonial events attended by top elected officials. Five health care workers, including emergency room nurses, rolled up their sleeves and received shots at Loretto Hospital, located in Chicago’s Austin neighborhood, a largely Black enclave that has been hit hard by COVID-19. Applause followed each shot. “You can see and feel the buzz of excitement because of this historic day,” Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “This is truly an exciting and important moment in our city’s history.” Later in the morning, four health care workers received shots at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria. Gov. J.B. Pritzker called it a beginning for the state. Pritzker has said he expects Illinois to receive about 109,000 doses initially within the next few weeks. Chicago officials expect about 20,000 to 25,000 of those in the city. Lightfoot said that despite the hopeful news, widespread availability of a vaccine is still months away. She cited an uptick in cases following Thanksgiving.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Supreme Court issued an order Monday suspending jury trials statewide until March 1 because COVID-19 cases continue to surge. The court said that “in-person jury trials pose an exceptional risk to everyone involved – even if every precaution is taken.” “We must act now,” Chief Justice Loretta Rush said. “Since March, we have been balancing the requirement to keep courts open with the need for public health. The worsening pandemic creates urgency for us to halt jury trials as we maintain all other court operations.” The Supreme Court has given local courts authority to adjust operations since the beginning of the public health emergency, most recently in a Nov. 10 order. This authority has included holding remote proceedings and streaming public hearings online. In addition, a task force released guidance on managing court proceedings as conditions change, guidance on safely resuming court operations, and protocols for mitigating in-court exposures. Indiana’s coronavirus death toll has reached 6,840, including both confirmed and presumed infections.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ administration is using $10 million in federal pandemic relief funds to pay the salaries of state police officers, who have played only a small role in Iowa’s virus response. A state report claims the money will support payroll expenses for employees “whose services were diverted to a substantially different use as a result of COVID-19.” Department spokeswoman Debra McClung said the money is mostly for salary costs for its roughly 550 sworn officers, who include road troopers and criminal investigators. They have largely carried on their routine duties during the pandemic, including enforcing traffic laws and helping local police investigate crimes. McClung did not provide examples of how any duties had changed. Instead, she said the spending appears to be allowable under revised guidance from the Treasury Department, which said in October that payroll expenses for public safety employees are presumed to qualify as pandemic-related. The same guidance document, however, says qualifying expenses are intended for employees who “have been diverted to substantially different functions” as a result of the emergency, such as a police officer who has been reassigned to enforce a stay-at-home order.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Health care workers on Monday began receiving the first of the state’s coronavirus vaccines amid a surge in cases that has left hospitals stressed. The Ascension Via Christi health care system gave shots to 115 physicians and employees at its St. Francis hospital, spokeswoman Roz Hutchinson said. The first group of five late Monday morning included a critical care nurse, a housekeeper for a COVID-19 unit and a respiratory therapist. Gov. Laura Kelly said during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas had received its full, initial shipment of the first of two doses of a vaccine made by Pfizer for 23,750 people. “We’ve a seen a rollout of a few vaccinations,” Kelly said. “We expect that we’ll continue to see that ramping up and that Wednesday, you’ll see sort of an across-the-state vaccination program beginning.” At the Wichita hospital, Kristen Garrett, a registered nurse in the intensive care unit, was the first to receive the vaccine. She said she was concerned people would let their guard down as vaccinations become available, The Wichita Eagle reports. “I do worry that with the vaccine coming out, people will think it’s over,” she said. “It’s not.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear explained “the general tenets” Monday for how schools in “red zone” counties with high COVID-19 case rates can get students back in the classroom next month. However, the state Department for Public Health now recommends K-12 schools not resume in-person classes until Jan. 11, instead of Jan. 4, Beshear said. The governor also said he thinks educators could start to receive the new COVID-19 vaccine at the beginning of February, if not sooner. Schools in red zone counties should “aggressively” implement a hybrid model that features a mix of in-person and virtual classes each week if they wish to bring students and staff back to classrooms next month, Beshear said. Every school must also offer “meaningful virtual options that cannot negatively impact students’ GPA, class rank, ability to take advanced placement classes or any other educational opportunity or recognition,” under the state’s updated guidance. Schools “must accommodate all educators who fall into a high-risk category with virtual options,” per the new requirements.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A day after coronavirus vaccinations began, the state’s education superintendent said Tuesday that he’s asked Gov. John Bel Edwards and health leaders to prioritize child care workers and school teachers, staff and bus drivers when divvying up future vaccine shipments. Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said the estimated 166,000 employees at Louisiana’s day care centers, pre-K programs and K-12 schools are front-line workers who are essential to the functioning of the state. “Keeping schools open with face-to-face instruction is critical not only for students, but also for parents and guardians who are struggling to balance staying at home with their children and meaningful employment,” Brumley wrote in a Dec. 11 letter to Health Secretary Courtney Phillips that was also sent to Edwards. The superintendent discussed the letter at a state education board meeting Tuesday. After health workers, next up for vaccines are people who live and work at nursing homes, state-run veterans homes and long-term care facilities. Those first groups include an estimated 208,000 people, exceeding the number of vaccine doses the state expects to receive this month.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s public university system said it plans to use a new task force to assist with distributing the coronavirus vaccine and recommending changes to the system’s immunization requirements. University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy is charged with appointing the Vaccine Planning and Partnership Task Force, university system officials said in a statement. The task force will also be responsible for “contributing to student and public awareness about the efficacy and safety of FDA-approved vaccines.” The task force will include University of Maine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy as its chair, and it’s scheduled to issue a report Jan. 25. “The most ambitious vaccination campaign in the history of the world is now underway,” Malloy said. “FDA-approved vaccines for COVID-19 will end the pandemic and restore normalcy if enough people choose to be immunized.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s first doses of the new COVID-19 vaccine arrived Monday at two Baltimore hospitals as health care workers at one of the facilities began to get inoculated. A shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine arrived at the University of Maryland Medical Center, where two physicians, a nurse, a respiratory therapist and an environmental service worker received their first of two required doses. On Monday evening, Johns Hopkins Medicine announced it had received its initial doses and expected to administer vaccine to front-line workers beginning Wednesday. “I am a nurse on the frontlines of caring for COVID patients and I believe in the science behind the vaccine,” Shawn Hendricks, the University of Maryland center’s nursing director of medicine, cardiac services and tele-sitter program, said in a statement. “I want my family and I to be safe from getting COVID. Unless people start to get vaccinated, I think this pandemic will last longer, and get worse.” Hendricks oversees units with patients sickened with the coronavirus. Her mother, brother and brother-in-law were previously diagnosed with the virus. Her mother’s recovery lasted two months.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A World War II veteran was among the first VA patients in the country to receive a coronavirus vaccine. VA Bedford Healthcare System said on Twitter that 96-year-old Margaret Klessens received the inoculation about noon Monday. The former Somerville resident, who served in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, is currently a resident in the Community Living Center at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford. Klessens enlisted in 1943 when she was 19 years old, according to The Boston Globe. She went through basic training and worked a clerical job at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia through the war. VA Bedford said a housekeeper was the first of its employees to get the vaccine, shortly after Klessens received her shot. The Bedford facility is one of 37 VA sites selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to receive initial doses of the vaccine.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: More than half of households with children in the state reported lost employment income since March, and 15% said they were struggling to put food on the table, according to a report released Monday. The “Kids Count” report, by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, looks at how families with children across the U.S. are dealing with “pain points” like hunger, housing, health insurance and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it offers policy recommendations. Data comes from the Census Bureau’s weekly Household Pulse Survey. Last week, 20,000 Michigan residents filed for unemployment benefits. The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is about 5% as of October, down from a historic high of 24% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, many families are struggling, the report finds, and will continue to bear the brunt of the crisis, absent further intervention. “We have known since the coronavirus pandemic hit Michigan that it was going to hit families with children particularly hard, but this report gives us concrete data to show how parents are faring and where help is most needed,” said Kelsey Perdue, Michigan Kids Count project director at the Michigan League for Public Policy.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Legislature voted Monday night to pass a $216 million relief package aimed at businesses and workers who took the biggest hit from a four-week “pause” ordered by Gov. Tim Walz as increasing coronavirus cases threatened to overload hospitals. The Senate voted 62-4 to approve the bill and sent it to the House, which passed it 117-13 late Monday night and sent it to the governor for his signature. Legislative leaders from both parties agreed last week on a key component of the package, a grant program for businesses such as bars and restaurants that the governor shut down last month for all but takeout and delivery service. They agreed Sunday on the other major component of the bill, extending unemployment insurance for affected workers for 13 weeks starting Dec. 27. But negotiations on some details continued into Monday evening. The package does not include some proposals that lawmakers floated earlier in the discussion stages, such as $500 one-time stimulus payments to low-income families sought by Democrats or any easing of liquor laws to let restaurants and bars sell larger containers of beer or cocktails to go.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves sparked a debate Tuesday morning after asking the public whether state leaders should be among the first to receive a vaccination for COVID-19. In a tweet, Reeves said he’s received several messages from skeptics asking him why he hasn’t taken the vaccine himself if he’s adamant that residents across the state take it. The governor said he is ready to receive a vaccination but has not received one because he does not want to “be accused of cutting in line.” Many residents suggested the governor and other elected officials should get the shot to lead by example. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs, along with State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers and other health leaders in Mississippi, had their vaccinations livestreamed during a news conference at the Mississippi State Department of Health on Monday. Dobbs said he wanted to be among the first to receive the vaccine to prove its safety and encourage others to take it as well. But other residents felt if those leaders are not part of a group that is at higher risk of complications from the virus, they should wait in line along with their constituents.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city is extending its mask requirement until April 9, citing the fast-rising number of hospitalizations and deaths in Missouri’s third-largest city, and leaders are warning that violators will face punishment. “We are quite literally in the middle of the darkest days when it comes to virus exposure, positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths,” Mayor Ken McClure said at a news conference Tuesday, a day after the City Council voted to extend the ordinance originally passed in October. The law also sets occupancy restrictions and social distancing requirements. The decision comes amid worries that that number of people requiring hospitalizations will only get worse as people gather for the holidays. Statistics released Tuesday by the state showed inpatient bed capacity across Missouri was at 24%. Intensive care unit bed space was at 22% statewide and below 20% in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. Hospital leaders in Springfield told the City Council last week they had so many COVID-19 patients that they were only able to take about two-fifths of the patients seeking transfer from smaller hospitals.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shipments arrived in the city Tuesday, and local health care entities plan to begin administering them as early as Wednesday. Benefis Health System received a shipment of vaccines Tuesday morning and will distribute them among its health care workers, Great Falls Clinic health care workers, Emergency Medical Services and other community providers, according to the Cascade City-County Health Department. Great Falls Clinic plans to begin administering vaccines Wednesday afternoon. Benefis plans to begin the vaccination process Thursday morning, and the Indian Family Health Clinic will administer vaccines this week as well. Sen. Jon Tester called the arrival of the first vaccines in Montana an “extraordinary moment.” Sen. Steve Daines pledged to “continue working to ensure all Montana communities get access” to the vaccine. Gov. Steve Bullock on Tuesday joined St. Vincent Healthcare employees in Billings at an event to administer some of the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to health care workers.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in the state has been steadily declining over the past several weeks, but it remains at a high level that worries health experts. Dr. James Lawler with the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security said it appears more Nebraskans are doing things like dining out less often and wearing masks in public. And he said it helps that a number of cities recently passed mask mandates. But he said it’s important for Nebraskans to remain vigilant about maintaining social distancing because virus trends could turn negative before vaccines become widely available to the general public in the spring. “We have a vaccine rolling out, but that doesn’t change the overall picture,” Lawler told the Omaha World-Herald. “Things could still turn south pretty easily.” Nebraska said 693 people were hospitalized with the virus Monday. That number has been generally decreasing since the state set a record of 987 on Nov. 20, but it is still three times higher than it was Oct. 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gov. Steve Sisolak’s decision to extend the state’s coronavirus-related business restrictions until at least Jan. 15 rather than expand them has left some local business leaders mildly optimistic about the future of the industry. Most business leaders said they were grateful the governor did not add restrictions in his announcement, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. “Closing businesses, as they have in other states, would be a death knell,” said Cara Clarke, a spokeswoman for the Vegas Chamber. Sisolak extended orders Sunday to limit capacity for most businesses in the state at 25%, while retail and grocery stores will continue to limit capacity at 50%. The president of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, Peter Guzman, said the fact that the governor did not implement harsher restrictions gives businesses “a fighting chance to keep their doors open.” “People will be able to buy Christmas gifts and have somewhat of a Christmas and a holiday season,” Guzman said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives is tentatively planning to hold a drive-in-style meeting in January at the University of New Hampshire in the wake of its speaker dying of COVID-19. Dick Hinch, who was sworn in Dec. 2 as leader of the state’s newly Republican-led House, died Wednesday. He was 71 and had been starting his seventh two-year term in the House. His death prompted Democrats to call for the Jan. 6 meeting to be held virtually. Lawmakers are expected to elect a new speaker, adopt rules and introduce bills. “The Democratic Party wants to go virtual, and we are having trouble with that. We are just looking at safety and getting everyone together,” Acting Speaker Sherman Packard told the Associated Press. The meeting would be held in one of the UNH parking lots, Packard said. Leaders are trying to work out additional details, including how lawmakers would be vote. “This is a concept to see if we can do it,” Packard said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWoodland Park: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of a North Caldwell Catholic priest and a Lakewood rabbi who sued Gov. Phil Murphy over coronavirus restrictions on worship services, with the court reversing a lower court ruling that was in Murphy’s favor. The move comes less than a month after the high court ruled in favor of houses of worship that challenged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pandemic restrictions. Tuesday’s action was not a ruling on the merits of the New Jersey case but an unsigned order remanding it to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals and ordering judges there to reconsider their decision in light of the Cuomo ruling. Lawyers for the New Jersey priest and rabbi called the decision “a huge victory for religious freedom.” They had argued to the Supreme Court that Murphy’s orders restricting attendance at religious services but allowing larger crowds to gather at casinos, retail locations and outdoor protests are unconstitutional.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Lawyers representing students say the state’s attempts to provide internet access and learning devices to children are “woefully insufficient.” With in-person learning banned by state officials until mid-January and plans for hybrid learning scrapped for the vast majority of students earlier this year, the inability to access remote classes has been a challenge for many rural and low-income students, particularly Native American children living on tribal lands. “We were hopeful children could return to in-person learning in early fall, but that didn’t happen,” said Maria Archuleta with the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty, which has been involved in the case. “Access to technology was essential before the pandemic and will be when the pandemic is over.” In response to the motion, the Public Education Department highlighted state efforts to support increased internet access during the pandemic. But thousands of children are still offline, and an untold number have limited internet connectivity that doesn’t allow them to upload or download video. Some students have relied on their parent’s cellphone hotspots, which can run out of data or can’t be left at home when the parent goes to work.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Recent COVID-19-related restrictions that shuttered indoor dining in New York City and limited them in other parts of the state may not be enough to slow the coronavirus’ rapid spread, state leaders are warning. Hospitalizations due to the coronavirus continue to grow, hitting 5,700 cases Sunday – the most in New York since mid-May, state data shows. And while the spring surge was largely in New York City, it is now more spread out, hitting parts of upstate, hardest most recently in the Finger Lakes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. The concern is that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with little relief from other parts of the state, as had been the case in the spring, he said. The issue comes even as the state got its first batch of vaccines Monday, but it will take months for the vaccine to get to most New Yorkers. So Cuomo warned of broader shutdowns akin to the March lockdowns that shuttered all nonessential businesses for two months that then slowly reopened in late spring. “If we do not change the trajectory, we could very well be headed to shutdown,” Cuomo said at his Monday briefing at the state Capitol.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s education department failed to monitor sufficiently whether more than $140 million in federal coronavirus relief money was used properly or met its intended purposes, according to a report from the State Auditor’s office. The performance audit looked at portions of the $316 million in federal pandemic aid that the General Assembly allocated to the Department of Public Instruction through a state law in early May. In an examination of virus-related costs from March through August, State Auditor Beth Wood’s office found that DPI distributed $76 million to local school districts, charter schools and other education units without enacting a method to detect the misuse of money. The department also failed to establish methods to ensure that $31 million for summer learning programs helped improve student ability and to measure results from $37 million spent for nutrition services such as breakfast and lunch for vulnerable students, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials on Tuesday reported 13 additional deaths due to complications from COVID-19 and 340 new cases. The North Dakota Health Department report came a day after the state received its first doses of a coronavirus vaccine and quickly set about giving it to hospital workers on the front lines of the fight against the disease. The deaths confirmed Tuesday bring the statewide death toll from the virus to 1,170 since the pandemic began. The state’s death count is ranked 41st in the country but is the fifth highest per capita at 152 deaths per 100,000 people, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project. The state said there were 277 people hospitalized with COVID-19 on Tuesday – no change from Monday. The most recent data shows 37 staffed intensive care unit beds and 347 staffed inpatient beds available statewide. North Dakota had been one of the worst-affected states in recent months, registering the highest rate of infection for many weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Agents in the city seized 6,080 counterfeit 3M masks from Hong Kong earlier this month, according to a release from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If the masks had been genuine, they would have been worth more than $6,500, the release said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers held incoming freight from Hong Kong for inspection Dec. 6, according to the release. During routine operations, officers discovered a shipment of 38 boxes of masks labeled as 3M Disposable Respirators Model 8210. The information provided with the shipment did not meet authentication requirements, and the boxes were labeled as made in the U.S. despite being imported. “With the current health concerns nationwide, our officers have amplified their efforts to find fake medical supplies that can have potentially deadly consequences,” Cincinnati Port Director Richard Gillespie said. “Counterfeit masks like these are not tested using the same quality control standards as the genuine product, and it is unlikely they will perform in the same manner as the genuine product was designed to do.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An emergency room nurse became the first person in the state to receive Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine. Hannah White, 31, laughed before the vaccination and again afterward as she hugged the person who injected her at Integris Baptist Medical Center on Monday. She showed no reaction as the needle entered her arm. “I don’t have any burning at the site; I have no pain. I didn’t feel it,” White said. She encouraged others to get vaccinated as they become eligible based on the state’s four-phase plan. After front-line health care workers have a chance to get a shot, long-term care providers and residents, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, and pharmacy staff who will administer the vaccine in long-term care facilities are also slated to be among the first inoculated. The first phase of vaccinations does not include public school teachers, who are currently due to be vaccinated in the third phase, but that could change, Gov. Kevin Stitt said, but “we are looking at our K-12 teachers to move them up the list.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown is calling lawmakers back to the Capitol for a one-day special session, asking them to approve hundreds of millions of dollars to aid people and communities struggling with the pandemic and the effect of this summer’s devastating wildfires. In a statement Tuesday, Brown said the Legislature would convene Dec. 21 and consider $800 million in relief funding. “Oregon families are struggling with unemployment, housing, food insecurity, and paying their bills – and those most impacted are the same people who are often left behind, including rural, Black, Indigenous, Latino/Latina/Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Tribal communities,” the Democrat said in a statement. Since the start of the pandemic in Oregon, more than 95,000 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, and 1,161 people have died. Shutdowns and restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 have also caused widespread job losses and business closures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will receive an initial shipment of more than 110,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Department of Health announced Monday as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center began giving the shots to its health workers. Nearly 90 hospitals across the state will receive an initial 97,500 doses directly from Pfizer, the health department said. Philadelphia is getting its own allotment of 13,650 doses. The vaccine is going to hospitals that have the ability to store it, with the first shots to be given to health workers, first responders, and residents and staff in nursing homes and other congregate settings, the health department said. The state health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, issued an order that requires vaccine providers to report demographic information on people who get the shots, including gender, race and ethnicity. UPMC, which was among the first to get a shipment, said it began administering the shots Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Health on Tuesday reported 15 coronavirus-related deaths and 1,166 additional cases of COVID-19. That brings the total toll in the state to 1,570 deaths and 75,237 known cases. There were 455 coronavirus-positive patients in Rhode Island hospitals at last count Sunday, up from 433 reported the day prior. Fifty-three were in intensive care; 29 were on ventilators. In addition to the 1,166 new cases, the Health Department reported 11,175 negative tests, for a 9.4% positive rate. If only those testing negative for the first time are counted, the positive rate was 29.0%. Rhode Island has reported an average of 1,167 new coronavirus cases a day over the past seven days, down from 1,309 cases per day a week ago and up from 736 cases per day a month ago.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s public school districts are getting more than $84 million in federal aid to help get facilities reopened amid the coronavirus pandemic, officials announced this week, as some of the state’s largest districts shut off in-person learning due to rising case numbers. According to the Department of Education, the funding from the Coronavirus Relief Fund may be used for safety measures and personal protective equipment, hiring of school nurses, hiring of staff to provide one-on-one instruction and support services for struggling students, and technology equipment to support online learning. The funding is beginning to be allocated this week, officials said. “Our teachers, nurses, and school staff have gone above and beyond to support students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman said in a statement. “These funds are to be used to maintain and support their efforts to welcome additional students back safely for face to face instruction and meet the needs of those that are struggling both online and in the classroom.” More than $194 million in federal pandemic relief has already been allocated to districts, state Education Department officials said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota Wing of the Civil Air Patrol is assisting the state Department of Health in delivering the first allocation of coronavirus vaccines. The Civil Air Patrol said it’s flying the Pfizer vaccine to smaller communities with its fleet of single-engine Cessna aircraft, flown by its volunteer pilots and crews. Other volunteer members will assist with mission planning and logistical support, the patrol said. “We are proud that the State of South Dakota asked us to help them with this life-saving mission,” said Col. Nick Gengler, SDWG commander. “Since the early days of World War II, the South Dakota Civil Air Patrol has helped the state and nation with missions important to our safety and security.” The South Dakota patrol has more than 400 members in units in Sioux Falls, Tea, Brookings, Mitchell, Miller, Pierre, Rapid City, Spearfish and Custer. The Civil Air Patrol is the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State Rep. David Byrd has been placed on a ventilator while battling COVID-19, a concerning outcome he previously cautioned was looming, barring a “miracle.” The Republican, who in the past week has repeatedly posted on Facebook asking friends for prayers, was hospitalized Dec. 5 with pneumonia. Byrd, 63, was among the nearly 70 House Republicans in attendance at a caucus meeting in the House chamber Nov. 24, a week and a half before he was hospitalized. He could be seen at one point on the House floor not wearing a mask. Days before that, he hosted a dinner for dozens of fellow caucus members at a restaurant to kick off a multinight House Republican retreat. Byrd is at least the second House Republican who has been hospitalized with the virus, along with Rep. Mike Carter. Byrd and Carter in June voted in support of a House resolution stating that “mainstream media has sensationalized the reporting on COVID-19 in the service of political agendas.” Byrd, a former teacher, principal and girls basketball coach, in 2018 was accused by three former students of sexually assaulting them in the 1980s.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Five University Medical Center of El Paso nurses were the first people in the county hard-hit by the coronavirus to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, hours after it arrived in El Paso. UMC emergency room nurse Crystal Molina was the first to get the vaccine about 2 p.m. “As a health care worker, I am super excited,” Molina said. “I am hopeful for the vaccine. As a human being, I am not going to lie; I was a little bit nervous but overall excited, and, hopefully, it will do its job and protect us.” Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the El Paso city-county health authority, attended the vaccinations of the nurses and said Tuesday was “a day of hope.” “Even though it is just the beginning, we know that a lot of people in our community will benefit from the vaccine,” Ocaranza said. “More so our health care providers who are taking care all the vulnerable people and our loved ones in the hospital. Now they will be able to continue working tirelessly.” He added that while the vaccine will be distributed to health care workers and later to the community, it still is vital to take safety precautions.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Hospitals in Salt Lake City and Provo received the state’s first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine Monday, with several others also set to get some later this week, including Dixie Regional Medical Center in St. George. Health care workers at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo were expected to get the state’s first set of administered vaccines Wednesday, said Dr. Kristin Dascomb, the medical director of infection prevention for employee health at Intermountain Healthcare. Two boxes of the vaccine arrived Monday, each containing 975 doses of a vaccine developed by Pfizer, Dascomb said. Some 23,400 doses of the Pfizer vaccine are scheduled to arrive in Utah this week, with 154,000 doses total set to arrive by the end of the month, according to the Utah Department of Health, just days after the vaccine received emergency authorization from the federal Food and Drug Administration. “Today, we come to you with optimism and with hope,” Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, an infection disease physician for Intermountain, said during a press conference. “Today marks the beginning of the end of this pandemic.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: An emergency department nurse was the first person in the state to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. Cindy Wamsganz of the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington gave a thumbs-up Tuesday after receiving the vaccination that was livestreamed by the hospital. “I am humbled and honored to be asked to be the first health care worker in the state to receive this vaccine. I am fearful of the virus, not the vaccine, and believe it is our pathway to protection and living life again,” Wamsganz said in a statement distributed by the hospital. Vermont received its first doses of the vaccine Monday and is expecting to receive 5,850 doses a week for the next several weeks. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said if, as expected, a second COVID-19 vaccine is approved for use over the next few days, Vermont could receive a total of about 34,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of the month. Gov. Phil Scott said the good news about the vaccine comes as Vermont has recorded its 100th death from COVID-19 since the pandemic started.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Health care workers started receiving the state’s first doses of a coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, kicking off what is likely to be a months­long process of inoculating people against the potentially deadly disease. The Ballad Health system broadcast live video of registered nurse Emily Boucher getting her first shot. “I will never stop trying to convince everyone about the reality of COVID-19,” Boucher said before pulling up her left sleeve at Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon, in southwestern Virginia. Boucher works in the hospital’s COVID-19 intensive care unit. She spoke of patients “who are alone and lonely and scared” and the health care workers who sometimes hold up phones to patients’ ears “so they can hear a familiar voice.” Several health care workers at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in the eastern part of the state also received injections. “My heart really goes out to our front-line health care workers, those that have come in every day,” said Gov. Ralph Northam, who attended the event in Norfolk.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee has stopped an effort to dissolve the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department by signing a proclamation Monday that pauses the termination of health departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. “This proclamation puts a pause, in effect, on efforts to terminate a health district or a city-county health department, such as what is currently taking place in Pierce County,” Inslee said at a news conference. Members of the Pierce County Council proposed earlier this month to end the decades­long partnership between the county and the City of Tacoma. That plan was met with concern and requests to reconsider, but the council voted to move forward, KNKX reports. The Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department released a statement Monday, thanking those who have advocated for the agency “remaining an independent, neutral, public health department.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in the state pushed past 1,000 with the announcement Tuesday of a record 34 deaths. Health officials said the deaths broke the one-day mark of 31 deaths reported last Wednesday. At least 1,012 people in West Virginia have died from the virus since the pandemic began. The number of deaths has more than doubled since early November, along with virus-related hospitalizations. The number of virus patients in hospitals reached 774 as of Monday. That’s up 124, or 19%, in the past week alone and includes a record 207 patients in hospital intensive care units, up from 180 a week earlier. There are more than 21,000 active cases of the virus in the state. The state began administering a vaccine for the virus Monday, focusing on health care workers and people in long-term care centers, though the governor also received his first shot.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State officials hope to have the majority of nursing home residents vaccinated for COVID-19 by the end of January, but the process for most facilities won’t begin for at least two weeks. The state provided the federal government with the two-week notice required to begin vaccinations at most Wisconsin nursing homes Monday, said Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The federal government has partnered with Walgreens and CVS to deliver and administer COVID-19 vaccines to most nursing homes and long-term care facilities in the country. While vaccinations at Wisconsin hospitals began Monday, they likely will not start at most nursing homes until Dec. 28 at the earliest. Willems Van Dijk said in order to begin nursing home vaccinations, the state would need to be ready to commit “a significant portion” of its vaccine allocation to nursing homes. There are an estimated 55,000 to 60,000 nursing home residents and staff in Wisconsin, said John Sauer, president and CEO of LeadingAge Wisconsin, a statewide association of long-term care providers.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A registered nurse who does coronavirus testing and contact tracing got the state’s first COVID-19 vaccination Tuesday. Terry Thayn’s regular job is overseeing maternal and child health matters for the Cheyenne-Laramie County Health Department. This year, she has been busy working to contain the virus. “I was excited for the vaccine,” Thayn said after getting the shot at a health department news conference. Thayn is set to get a follow-up shot of the Pfizer vaccine in three weeks. Her initial dose came from a shipment of 975 in a box that arrived Monday at the health department. Three-quarters of the doses were headed to Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, one of Wyoming’s biggest hospitals where health care workers were set to get their first shots Tuesday. The remaining doses were destined for health department employees, firefighters and other front-line workers in the Cheyenne area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/02/12/feeding-front-line-whooping-cranes-stadium-crowds-news-around-states/115463634/", "title": "Feeding the front line, whooping cranes: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Vaccines against COVID-19 will soon be available at more than 70 Walmart and Sam’s Club stores across Alabama, the company and the state announced. The retailer said people who meet the state’s eligibility requirements can begin signing up for appointments, and the immunizations begin Friday. Part of the program’s aim is to get the vaccine into areas without adequate medical services, the company said. That includes the south Alabama town of Brewton, which the company said was chosen to get the vaccine because other immunization sites are so far away. More than 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies in Alabama and 21 other states are receiving federal vaccine allocations this week. Gov. Kay Ivey said the state was grateful for the doses but urged patience since each store will have a limited supply of vaccine. The state on Monday expanded vaccine eligibility to include everyone 65 and older, school workers, grocery store employees, some manufacturers, public transit workers, agriculture employees, state legislators and constitutional officers. As many as 1.5 million people now qualify for shots, up from about 700,000 previously.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is expanding eligibility for COVID-19 vaccinations to people 50 and older with high-risk medical conditions, prekindergarten through grade 12 teachers and child care workers, and those 50 and older in jobs considered essential who work in close proximity to others. The state health department announced the expansion Wednesday. It said people in those groups can start making appointments Thursday. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, in a statement, said many Alaskans in the 65-and-older age group who wanted to receive vaccinations have, “and now it’s time to open up vaccinations to a new group of Alaskans.” Individuals previously eligible can still get vaccinated, officials say. Dr. Anne Zink, the state’s chief medical officer, said factors such as Alaska’s remaining allocation for February and estimates on how much vaccine the state might receive for March were weighed in making the decision to expand eligibility. The new tier includes people living or working in congregate settings who weren’t previously eligible, including homeless and domestic violence shelters and those in correctional settings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Facing complaints from advocates for people with disabilities, the state Senate is eyeing legislation that would bar hospitals from considering a person’s potential lifespan, quality of life or disability when the facilities are forced to ration care during the current or any future pandemic. The proposal from Sen. Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, instead would require hospitals that are assessing patients under state-adopted crisis standards of care to assess only a patient’s ability to survive the current hospitalization. Barto said at a hearing Wednesday that the current standards, adopted last year to address the COVID-19 pandemic, could discriminate against disabled people. But not everyone who testified at the Senate Health and Human Services Committee hearing backed the change. Dr. Patricia Mayer, director of clinical ethics at the Banner Health hospital chain, who was involved in drafting the current COVID-19 guidelines, said putting the new requirements into law could lock out future updates to the standards, which have been in place for nearly a decade. She said preventing doctors from judging who gets treatment without being able to consider their realistic lifespan could lead to absurd results.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Senate on Wednesday approved a measure allowing medical providers to refuse to treat someone because of their religious or moral beliefs, a move critics say will allow them to turn LGBTQ patients away. The majority-Republican Senate voted 27-6 in favor of the measure, which says health care workers and institutions have the right to not participate in nonemergency treatments that violate their conscience. The proposal now heads to the House. Supporters of the bill said it would protect health care workers from being forced to perform something that goes against their conscience. “This bill is about elective things, things you can take time to find a provider who’s willing to offer the service rather than a force a provider who doesn’t believe in doing it,” said Republican Sen. Kim Hammer, who sponsored the measure. Opponents said it would give wide berth to medical providers to use religious, moral or philosophical beliefs to deny care to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients. One opponent said it’s written so broadly that it could even allow someone to be denied service because of their political affiliation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden State has edged past New York in the grim statistic of the number of deaths due to COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University data reported Thursday. California’s death toll reached 45,496, surpassing New York’s toll of 45,312, even as coronavirus trends are showing improvement in California. Meanwhile, a surge of coronavirus cases at the University of California, Berkeley has prompted school officials to extend a lockdown on about 2,000 students living in residence halls and ban them from outdoor exercise as part of strict new measures to curb the spread of infections. More than 400 people, mostly undergraduate students, at UC Berkeley have tested positive for the virus since an outbreak that started in mid-January, according to the university’s coronavirus dashboard. All students living in dorm-style residence halls were ordered to “self-sequester” in a lockdown initially put in place from Feb. 1-8. But this week, school officials extended the lockdown through at least Monday. “You may NOT leave your room for solo outdoor exercise,” an email said, noting this was a change from the previous week’s rules. The ban goes beyond strict guidelines issued by the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom has encouraged outdoor exercise, even during strict lockdown periods.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Businesses in the state have sold about $10 billion of marijuana since the plant was legalized for recreational use in 2014, according to new data released by the state Department of Revenue. The figures released Tuesday indicate that marijuana sales in 2020 hit an all-time high for one year with $2.19 billion in total revenue, up from $1.75 billion in 2019. Marijuana revenue from 2020 surpassed figures from 2019 by the end of October. “Ten billion is incredible and unsurprising at the same time,” said Truman Bradley, executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, Colorado’s trade association. “The industry has partnered with regulators to do things the right way in Colorado.” Tax and fee revenue from marijuana sales since 2014 has totaled about $1.63 billion, the state said. Marijuana dispensaries collect 2.9% in state sales tax, 15% as a marijuana retail sales tax, and a 15% excise tax on wholesale sales or transfers of retail marijuana, the Colorado Sun reports. Fees are generated from license and application charges, while cities often add local sales taxes of about 20%.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: New and limited data released Wednesday from the state Department of Public Health suggests racial disparities in the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, mirroring what’s been happening in other states where Black populations lag far behind white populations in getting the shots. As of Feb. 3, nearly 2% of residents 75 and older who had received the vaccine were Black, while 59.7% were white, according to the data. Meanwhile, slightly more than 1% were Asian; 2.3% were Hispanic; 6.2% were mixed race; and 19.4% were listed as other, which includes American Indians, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. According to 2019 U.S. census data, 74.6% of Connecticut’s population is white, while 11% is only Black or African-American. “As we open up the vaccine program to individuals 65 and over, we are redoubling our efforts to ensure that vaccine is reaching the communities and populations who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19,” DPH Acting Commissioner Dr. Deidre Gifford said. The department cautioned that there are some gaps in data reporting and that people can select “other,” “multiple races” or “not reported.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Local hip-hop musician and activist Amillion the Poet has offered up a sobering music video on YouTube about the pandemic titled “The Quarantine.” The song is a melodic reminder to wear masks and take COVID-19 seriously, especially since the country has eclipsed 400,000 coronavirus deaths. The video features a cameo from Amillion’s daughter, Aaliyah Adams-Mayfield. Amillion, whose real name is Lucas Amillion Mayfield, teamed up with director Jet Phynx Films on the track, along with national recording songstress Stacy Barthe and J’ne Indigo. The song can be found on the music project “Covid-1NA and Deluxe,” which is out now. Around 2009, Amillion survived as a single parent by traveling to poetry open mics around the country, mostly performing for free, while making money from selling his book of poetry, “Poetry in Motion Proceeds,” after his performances. In the span of two years, the Dover rapper averaged close to 100 gigs annually. Eventually, Amillion said, he didn’t want to get pigeonholed as just the poetry guy. So he began performing at churches, prisons and schools. The emcee finally made his debut at Firefly Music Festival in 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents 65 and older are eligible to register for 2,500 COVID-19 vaccine appointment slots that opened Thursday, WUSA-TV reports. The appointments are also available to health professionals who work in the district and residents of Wards 5, 7 and 8 priority ZIP codes. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the demand is high, and appointments were expected to fill up quickly. Those eligible can register online at vaccinate.dc.gov or call the city’s vaccine hotline at 855-363-0333. Howard University Hospital also announced Thursday that it will open a clinic offering D.C. residents ages 65 and up their first and second doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. “It’s no secret that COVID-19 exposure and mortality rates in the communities that we serve are three times higher than the national average. And those who have unfortunately passed away from this deadly disease have been disproportionately people of color,” said Dr. Hugh E. Mighty, dean of the Howard University College of Medicine and vice president of clinical affairs. “This vaccine serves as a powerful tool in our ongoing fight to combat the virus, and the importance of administering it first to high-risk patient populations is a critical endeavor that I am proud to take on.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Local tourism officials are launching their first full-scale marketing campaign since the pandemic, aimed at tourists within driving distance in the Southeast. The $2.2 million advertising campaign launched this month is targeted for spring and summer travel to potential visitors living in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The campaign, called “The Wonder Remains,” includes TV ads, YouTube videos, digital ads, social media ads, e-newsletters and website content. Along with highlighting Orlando’s theme parks and restaurants, the campaign emphasizes the safety measures that have been taken at its tourist attractions to protect tourists from the coronavirus. “The Central Florida region has gone above and beyond to create a safe and sanitized guest experience,” said Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings. “I believe this campaign will reach individuals who are prepared to travel to a well-prepared destination for much-needed recreation.” Before the start of the pandemic almost a year ago, Orlando was the most visited tourist destination in the U.S., attracting 75 million visitors in 2018.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers approved their changes to the current year’s budget Thursday, including more money for K-12 schools and public health, along with $1,000 bonuses for more than 50,000 state employees. The House and Senate agreed to the changes by overwhelming votes, sending the bill to Gov. Brian Kemp. A spokesperson said he would sign it. The measure spends $26.6 billion in state funds and $15.6 billion more in federal money in the current year ending June 30. Lawmakers agreed with Gov. Brian Kemp’s plan to restore $567 million to the state’s K-12 school funding formula, which was cut by $950 million last year when lawmakers feared a steeper drop in revenue. Overall, lawmakers cut $2.2 billion last June, or about 10% across the board. Kemp and legislative leaders have also announced a plan to pay $1,000 bonuses to state employees making less than $80,000 yearly. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn, told House members Thursday that “simple words” are not enough to thank employees for their work during the coronavirus pandemic. “The savings we were able to capture there are the dollars we have put back in to say thank you to our state employees,” England said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A statewide moratorium on residential evictions is expected to be extended for another two months in a coronavirus emergency proclamation from the governor. Democratic Gov. David Ige also said federal stimulus funds will extend rental assistance to include utility financial aid that could help renters for up to a year, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There are no plans to provide rent relief for commercial properties, a situation Ige said was challenging. He noted difficulty in trying establish moratoriums on evictions by owners of commercial properties “without unfairly advantaging one side.” Instead, Ige said he supports ongoing efforts to provide direct financial help to small businesses. The state Council on Revenues forecast an additional $300 million increase in revenue this year and is projecting an additional $2 billion over the next seven years, leading to a significant impact on the state’s financial planning, Ige said. An improved economy means previously announced 10% budget reductions across the state will fall to 2.5% for the state Department of Education, restoring $123 million to classrooms, he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation taking aim at limits on how many people can gather during the coronavirus pandemic cleared the state House on Wednesday, but it doesn’t appear likely to have any force. The House voted 55-15 to approve the measure triggered by lawmaker anger over restrictions on crowd sizes that the Idaho High School Activities Association set for the girls’ state basketball tournament this month. The association has limited the event to 1,800 fans in the 11,000-capacity Ford Idaho Center in Nampa, saying it’s intended to keep kids safe. Officials also said some schools wouldn’t send teams to participate if they felt kids were at risk because of the pandemic. The legislation targets Republican Gov. Brad Little’s health order last week that raised the limits on gatherings from 10 to 50. The resolution says the 50-person limit is “declared null, void, and of no force and effect.” However, the governor’s health order recommends, but doesn’t require, a 50-person limit, and there is no penalty for exceeding 50 people. Also, the Ford Idaho Center is owned by the city of Nampa, which has no size limits on crowds. Neither does Canyon County, where Nampa is located.\n\nIllinois\n\nQuincy: Residents under 65 years old with preexisting medical conditions will be eligible to receive vaccination to protect them against COVID-19, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Wednesday. The Phase 1B distribution plan opening Feb. 25 will follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vaccinating pregnant women and people with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, sickle cell disease and other conditions. “Many of these people may already be eligible because they’re 65 and over or they’re in a covered profession, but those who are under 65 and live with comorbidities have an elevated risk of serious complications or even death if they contract COVID-19,” Pritzker said during a tour of a vaccination site in Quincy. The Pritzker administration said the expansion is possible due to increased federal vaccine shipments to the state. Pritzker said Illinois is making progress in adding more vaccination sites, with 517 vaccination locations established statewide. However, he conceded making an appointment requires patience because the state hasn’t received enough vaccines to provide for everyone who is eligible in Phase 1B.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb defended the constitutionality of his COVID-19 restrictions in response to an Indiana House vote this week to limit his emergency powers. At his weekly COVID-19 update Wednesday, Holcomb said he makes sure “anything” he mandates “passes constitutional muster,” after being asked his thoughts on the House vote to ban him from placing restrictions on in-person worship and allowing the General Assembly to decide whether to convene during an emergency. Holcomb declared a public health emergency March 6, the same day the state reported its first coronavirus case. He cited a state law that allowed him to declare a disaster emergency in 30-day increments. Religious services were ordered to switch online or limit services to 10 people at the beginning of the pandemic, before he reopened places of worship in May. “I want to make sure whatever changes we make are constitutional, and I think we all share that, but we’re coming from a lot of different angles,” Holcomb said. He twice said he wouldn’t go into specific line items and whether he agreed or disagreed with them, and he said the lawmakers still have the second half of the session to go.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Catholic Church apparently is the state’s largest recipient of money from the federal Paycheck Protection Program intended to help small businesses, a review of the program by the Des Moines Register shows. The finding comes as a new investigation by the Associated Press shows that the U.S. arm of the church received at least $3 billion through the forgivable loan program, even as many dioceses remained financially healthy. In Iowa, the church’s total was more than $50 million, including more than $40 million for the components for the four Catholic dioceses and $8.7 million more that went to four Catholic colleges controlled by other church entities. Those state and national totals appear to make a church with thousands of employees in Iowa alone the largest beneficiary both statewide and nationally of a program intended to help companies with fewer than 500 employees pay workers as the COVID-19 pandemic raged last summer. Church officials said the aid was necessary to prevent layoffs. Catholic officials lobbied the Trump administration to free religious organizations from the so-called affiliation rule that typically disqualifies applicants with more than 500 workers from being treated as a small business.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: School districts are rushing to vaccinate their teachers in preparation for an eventual return to a full reopening of classrooms and before a more contagious strain of the coronavirus can spread throughout the state. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly told leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature on Wednesday that about 60% of the state’s school districts have started vaccinating their teachers and staff. She met with top lawmakers a day after the state Department of Education recommended that school districts allow middle and high school students resume full-time in-person instruction if precautions are taken. Several of the state’s largest districts have been offering in-person classes only part time or teaching students only online. “The more we can get the vaccines in the arms of the folks who are teaching and taking care of our kids in our school buildings and day care centers, the more likely we will be able to bring them back safely and let them continue in person,” Kelly told legislative leaders. The state is inoculating teachers as part of its second round of vaccinations, which also extended eligibility to people ages 65 and older, prisoners, and essential workers such as law enforcement officers.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A bill that would limit the state’s authority to reduce class sizes at child care centers in an emergency won approval by a Senate committee Wednesday despite one member’s concerns that it could cause problems in a future disaster or disease outbreak. The legislation sponsored by Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, drew praise from child advocates because it streamlines the process for certifying and regulating family child care homes, where up to six children may receive care in a private residence. Kentucky Youth Advocates called it “an important first step for families seeking child care.” But a separate provision, reducing to 30 days the time the state could limit child care class sizes, drew objections from Sen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, a physician who said she was concerned about restrictions in the next “epidemic or pandemic.” Kelli Rodman, director of legislative affairs for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said her agency also opposes that provision. The restrictions on class sizes, part of COVID-19 emergency rules, have been a sore point for many child care providers because they require additional staffing and space at at time when many are struggling with other pandemic rules.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Hospitality industry workers who will lose income because of a bar shutdown and other coronavirus restrictions in the French Quarter can apply for five days of part-time work with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday. Bars are being shut down throughout the city Friday, the beginning of what is usually a raucous Mardi Gras weekend. And there will be limits on automobile and pedestrian traffic in the French Quarter, where bars usually cater to shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. In a $100,000 program, the city is offering up to 200 displaced workers jobs that officials say may include trash and litter pickup and mask distribution, according to a news release from Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration. Workers selected can earn up to $100 a day for five hours of work a day Friday through Tuesday. Affected workers can apply online and will need documentation including a state identification card and a paycheck stub.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A county commissioner is continuing a campaign to stop the enforcement of the state’s mandatory mask order, despite rulings by the state’s highest court that the orders are legal. Androscoggin County Commissioner Isaiah Lary, a Republican, is involved in a spat with state officials over mask rules. He proposed a resolution Wednesday stating that no county official can enforce masking orders in the county, which is home to Lewiston, the state’s second-largest city. Lary also wants the county administrator to ask the Maine Supreme Judicial Court for a declaration that the orders are unconstitutional, the Sun Journal reports. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has already told the county that the state’s masking orders are constitutional. Frey sent a letter to commissioners last week saying that “counties, municipalities and other political subdivisions have no authority to exempt themselves from executive orders, and any effort to do so would be of no legal effect,” the Sun Journal reports. The Androscoggin County Commission could vote on Lary’s proposed resolution at a Feb. 17 meeting. Lary is one of three commissioners facing a potential recall vote over their opposition to masking orders.\n\nMaryland\n\nBel Air: Harford County wants the state to use Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen as a mass COVID-19 vaccination site, noting that doses are being held back in the jurisdiction after large-scale vaccination sites opened in Baltimore City and Prince George’s County. A letter from Harford County officials to the acting secretary of health said the stadium’s proximity to Interstate 95 and Route 40 would allow Marylanders easy access to the site, The Baltimore Sun reports. County Health Officer David Bishai said more than 40,000 county residents are preregistered to receive the vaccine. But Bishai told the county council Tuesday that because of the limited supply of first doses, Harford is giving about 200 first doses a day. Ripken Stadium, used for a mass testing clinic in August, has a large parking lot and refrigeration but no ultra-cold refrigerators needed to store Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford said in a video meeting Wednesday that additional mass vaccination sites are in the works for M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore and in southern Maryland, western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore. Northern Maryland and Harford County specifically weren’t mentioned.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is opening two additional mass vaccination sites this month, in Natick and Dartmouth, Gov. Charlie Baker said Wednesday. The announcement came as 74,000 appointments were scheduled to be posted online for mass vaccination sites and pharmacies at locations statewide Thursday. An additional 30,000 appointments will be posted over the course of the week at pharmacies, for a total of more than 100,000 new appointments this week. The Natick location will open Feb. 22 at the Natick Mall and will begin administering 500 doses per day, accelerating over the course of several weeks to 3,000 doses daily. The Dartmouth location is scheduled to open Feb. 24 at Circuit City. It will begin administering 500 doses per day, increasing over several weeks to more than 2,000 daily. Also beginning Thursday at mass vaccination sites, caregivers who are accompanying a person 75 or older may schedule their own vaccination at the same time and location. Only one caregiver is permitted to schedule an appointment with the older resident. Caregivers may receive their first dose even if the older resident is receiving their second dose.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday proposed a $67 billion state budget that she said would aid Michigan’s pandemic recovery by solidifying new programs to expand eligibility for free community college tuition, bolstering child care assistance and boosting local bridge repairs. The Democratic governor’s spending blueprint also calls for $570 million to address learning loss and K-12 enrollment declines on top of a $162-per-student, or 2%, increase in base aid for most traditional districts in the next fiscal year. Better-funded districts would get $82 more per student, roughly 1%. More immediate coronavirus-related needs, such as vaccine distribution, would be funded with multibillion-dollar supplemental spending bills – primarily through the release of federal COVID-19 relief aid that Whitmer has been urging lawmakers to pass soon. She said she focused on three priorities: economic reengagement that “drives everything,” a return to in-person instruction at schools and vaccine dissemination. She wants to double spending on Futures for Frontliners, which covers community college tuition for essential workers who worked in the early months of the pandemic, to include those who lost their jobs when her administration reinstated business restrictions to curb surging infections in the late fall.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials on Wednesday unveiled their plan to deal with toxic man-made “forever chemicals” that are polluting Minnesota’s waters and causing growing concerns about potential health risks. The pharmaceuticals, microplastics and synthetic chemicals are known collectively as PFAS and are used in a variety of consumer products because of their durability and resistance to heat and water. An increasing number of scientists have linked some PFAS to negative health effects in humans, such as low birth weight, thyroid and kidney problems, and some cancers. “These forever chemicals are everywhere,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Commissioner Laura Bishop said in a Zoom meeting that included leaders from other state agencies, lawmakers and environmental activists. “And new PFAS are being invented, used in industry and incorporated into commercial products, and released into the environment every day.” The Minnesota PFAS Blueprint calls for the state to enact stronger regulations, including designating more than 5,000 different chemicals as hazardous substances under Minnesota’s Superfund law.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is spending $5million of federal coronavirus aid to appoint eight senior judges to help reduce the backlog in the Hinds County court system. A temporary courtroom will be set up in the Woolfolk State Office Building across the street from the state Capitol. The announcement was made by Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Randolph during a Wednesday press conference. The backlog in the court system has been driven by a historic rise in violent crime in Jackson amid the COVID-19 pandemic. There were more than 125 homicides reported in Jackson alone in 2020. There are currently thousands of backlogged cases in Hinds County, Randolph said during the briefing. According to the Ledger, Hosemann said even among cases in which an individual has been indicted by a grand jury, there are hundreds that haven’t made it to trial. The backlog has kept those cases from making it to court.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers are considering several bills that would allow Missourians to keep unemployment benefits they were given if they did not intentionally commit fraud. The House Special Committee on Government Oversight on Wednesday heard seven proposals on the issue. The committee chairman said the bills will be combined into one proposal, and the committee will likely vote on it early next week. The discussion comes after Gov. Mike Parson has said people should “most certainly” be required to return payments they mistakenly received. Most of the proposals focused on unemployment funds from the federal government because national stimulus packages allow states to waive repayment. Lawmakers said 75%-80% of the overpayments are federal funds. No committee members or witnesses objected to the idea, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Several options were discussed on how to recoup the 20%-25% of the payments that are from state funds. One bill would prohibit the state from collecting the funds, while other committee members suggested the state could cover the cost of repayment or use federal coronavirus relief money to reduce the economic loss for the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Saying he will lift a statewide mask requirement this week, Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a bill Wednesday intended to protect businesses and health care providers from coronavirus-related lawsuits. Gianforte said the new law will allow businesses to open safely during the pandemic. He also said enough vulnerable Montana residents have received COVID-19 vaccinations to allow the lifting Friday of the mask mandate put in place in July by his Democratic predecessor, Steve Bullock. Still, Gianforte said he would continue to wear a mask for the time being and encouraged others to do so. Local jurisdictions will still be permitted to implement mask mandates after the statewide rule is lifted. As of Wednesday, more than 41,000 Montana residents – representing just under 4% of the population – had received both doses of a vaccine. The state is still in the midst of the second phase of vaccinations, with doses available only to people 70 or older, those with severe underlying medical conditions, and people of color who are at greater risk if they contract the virus. Gianforte’s announcement came as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned against lifting broad mask requirements.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state should see at least 43 retail pharmacies participating in a new federal program to help provide COVID-19 vaccinations, although state officials don’t have a good way to communicate with all of them to avoid mistakes, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. Ricketts said he’s grateful for the additional 5,700 doses Nebraska will get through the federal program but voiced concerns about how all the different businesses will coordinate with the state’s efforts. He said the federal program didn’t include a clear way for states and the retailers to ensure they’re on the same page. “This is an area we do have concerns about,” Ricketts, a Republican, said at a news conference to discuss the state’s pandemic response. The coordination is critical to ensure “good information is going back and forth between those pharmacies and the state so that we can keep track of who’s been vaccinated.” Retailers participating in the program include Walmart and independent pharmacies throughout the state. Walmart announced Tuesday that it will start vaccinations Friday at more than a dozen of its Nebraska stores, all in smaller cities outside Omaha, Lincoln and Grand Island.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Distance runners will cover a shorter course when the Rock ’n’ Roll race series returns to the Las Vegas Strip in a year, tourism and event officials said Tuesday. The marathon was cut to a half-marathon under a three-year, $450,000 agreement approved by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority board. Elizabeth O’Brien, managing director of North America for Rock ’n’ Roll, called it a next chapter for the event. She said a three-day health and fitness expo will be held ahead of the half-marathon, now set for Feb. 27, 2022. The contract through hometown Las Vegas Events also includes Rock ’n’ Roll Las Vegas races in 2023 and 2024. The event traces its origin to a marathon run since 1967 in and around Las Vegas. It moved to the Las Vegas Strip in 2005 and became a Rock ’n’ Roll series race in 2009, featuring music and entertainment along the course. Held in November in recent years, it has attracted tens of thousands of runners annually for fun-run, 5-kilometer, 10-kilometer, 13.1-mile and 26.2-mile distances. The unusual nighttime race begins and ends on the neon-lit Las Vegas Strip and includes the downtown Fremont Street Experience casino mall. Races in 2020 and 2021 were canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: With coronavirus case counts on the decline and fewer hospitalizations in the state, the governor’s reopening task force on Thursday looked ahead to summer and recommended updated guidance for camp operators that includes keeping children in small groups and more preparation for arrivals and pickups. Gov. Chris Sununu would need to approve the task force’s recommendations, which also include lifting some restrictions for restaurants and bars on the use of pool and billiard tables, dartboards and karaoke. The group also plans to include new members from industries that have been hit particularly hard, such as performing arts and outdoor entertainment venues, and the wedding industry. Regarding camps, staff working at overnight camps would quarantine on site for 10 days. Campers attending from outside New England would self-quarantine at home or in New Hampshire before arriving at camp. Staff and children also would undergo virus tests seven days before they arrive, when they get to camp, and then about five to seven days later. Only four of the state’s 95 overnight summer camps opened last summer because of the pandemic.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 vaccine call center will stop booking appointments temporarily because agents were making too many mistakes such as double-booking patients, state officials said Wednesday. Since the call center opened two weeks ago, only 600 appointments had been booked by early this week despite the center being inundated with hundreds of thousands of callers. The 250 agents who operate the phone line – 855-568-0545 – will have more training on using the state’s appointment system, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said at Wednesday’s briefing. “We found that it is not as easy as we thought it would be,” she said. The center, which opened Jan. 25, has been inundated with hundreds of thousands of callers, only 50,000 of whom have gotten through to an operator. Many callers are seniors seeking appointments after not being able to obtain one on various state and private online portals. Demand skyrocketed in mid-January when Gov. Phil Murphy opened eligibility to more than 4 million New Jerseyans including those 65 and older, those with underlying conditions and smokers. The state has only been receiving about 200,000 doses a week.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials on Wednesday said they would be ending mandatory self-quarantine requirements for visitors and residents arriving in the state, as more counties have reported less spread of the coronavirus over the past two weeks. More than half of the state’s 33 counties have emerged from strict lockdown – earning favorable yellow and green ratings on a color-coded map – as test positivity rates decline. That opens permission for limited indoor dining at restaurants, though movie theaters, bars and contact recreational facilities remain closed statewide. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham sounded an optimistic note about progress against COVID-19 during an online news conference, noting that average daily deaths, infections and hospitalizations were declining. “Today is a day to really feel good about the collective efforts of the state,” Lujan Grisham said. She acknowledged a one-day surge in virus-related deaths with 31 on Wednesday. Health officials also confirmed that the state’s allotment of vaccine doses from the federal government will increase next week to about 61,000, a more than 8% increase from last week.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Large arenas and stadiums can soon reopen for sports and entertainment at 10% of their normal capacity under a plan announced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday, despite concern from public health experts about still-high rates of coronavirus infections and the threat of more contagious variants. Cuomo said major stadiums and arenas with a capacity of 10,000 people or more can reopen with limited spectators starting Feb. 23. The Barclays Center, which has about 17,700 seats for basketball games, has already received state approval to reopen Feb. 23 for the Brooklyn Nets’ home game against the Sacramento Kings. And the New York Knicks and New York Rangers said they plan to host about 2,000 fans at every game, starting with Feb. 23 and Feb. 26 games at Madison Square Garden. A New York Yankees spokesperson called Cuomo’s announcement an “encouraging first step.” But CUNY School of Public Health epidemiology professor Denis Nash said the state’s approach lacks a scientific basis when “community prevalence is very high.” He and other public health experts pointed to evidence that COVID-19 spreads more easily indoors and to the risk of people sitting near others who may be cheering or taking masks off while eating.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced Wednesday afternoon that educators and support staff will be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine starting Feb. 24 as part of a staggered rollout of the state’s next phase of distribution. The Democratic governor estimated about 240,000 people would become eligible in two weeks. The group includes child care workers, pre-K to 12th grade principals and teachers at public, private and charter schools, and support staff, such as janitors, bus drivers and cafeteria workers. “Moving to the next phase is good news. The challenge continues to be the very limited supply of the vaccine,” Cooper said. Other groups the state considers “front-line essential workers” will start becoming eligible March 10, though public health officials are still evaluating whether it will prioritize certain subgroups within that population. That group includes manufacturing workers, grocery store clerks, college and university instructors and support staff, farmers, restaurant workers, mail carriers, court workers, elected officials, homeless shelter staff, public health workers, social workers, firefighters, EMS personnel, police officers, public transit workers and several others.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The number of COVID-19 vaccine doses being delivered to North Dakota is increasing. The state will receive a 5% increase in vaccine doses allocated, according to Gov. Doug Burgum. North Dakota will receive 7,500 doses next week, up from 6,900 this week. Also, Thrifty White pharmacies in the state will be getting the vaccine starting this week as part of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The state’s immunization program manager, Molly Howell, said 16 of the 30 Thrifty White locations in North Dakota have registered to receive the vaccine. According to the company’s vaccination registration website, its pharmacies are inoculating people 65 and older. North Dakotans who want to be vaccinated may need to go somewhere besides their traditional health care provider, Howell said. Pharmacies, local public health departments and private health care providers all are offering vaccines. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, North Dakota’s rate of vaccine doses administered remains among the highest in the country, No. 3, at 17,030 people per 100,000 population.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The discovery of as many as 4,000 unreported COVID-19 deaths came as the Health Department reconciled an internal death certificate database with a federal database, the state auditor’s office said Thursday. Republican Auditor Keith Faber has been auditing Health Department coronavirus death data since September. But the agency didn’t have access to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s infectious diseases database because of federal health privacy laws, said Matt Eiselstein, Faber’s communications director. “We were never able to make that reconciliation ourselves to come up with those figures,” Eiselstein said. The final audit is expected next month. The Ohio Department of Health said those deaths will now be added to the state’s tally of deaths from the coronavirus during the coming week. Thursday’s coronavirus death toll showed more than 720 deaths, of which 650 come from previously unreported deaths, Gov. Mike DeWine said. “We hope, we believe, that is going to put us back from the track where we actually are,” DeWine said. The Health Department said that “process issues affecting the reconciliation and reporting of these deaths” began in October, with most occurring in November and December.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The first bill signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt during the current legislative session allows public bodies to continue meeting virtually as a coronavirus safety precaution. The law signed Wednesday allows public bodies to meet virtually through February 2022 or until the expiration of the governor’s executive emergency order on COVID-19, whichever comes first. “We’ve all heard from constituents, state agencies, local school boards and other public bodies requesting this, and I’m pleased we were able to deliver so quickly,” Stitt said in a statement. The bill by Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat was passed by the state Senate on Feb. 3 and by the House five days later. “With the signing of this bill, public entities can continue to meet and do so safely until the pandemic is behind us, and the people of Oklahoma maintain access to public meetings at all levels through virtual meetings,” Treat said. Lawmakers last year allowed for virtual meetings, but those provisions expired in November. Rather than convene in a special session, Republican legislative leaders agreed to address the issue at the start of the session.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The week after Christmas, with coronavirus case numbers and hospitalizations soaring, morale was low at Oregon Health & Science University, the state’s largest hospital. Doctors and nurses caring for the most critically ill were burning out just when they were needed the most. Then, the food started coming: hot, delicious, individually wrapped meals from some of the city’s trendiest restaurants, a buffet of cuisines from Chinese to Italian to Lebanese to Southern comfort food. For staffers who only took off their N95 masks once to eat during a 12-hour shift, the meals were more than just food – they were emotional sustenance. “It’s almost like having a weight lifted. It’s like getting a surprise dozen roses or something,” nurse Alice Clark said. “We’re so grateful.” But the meals, paid for by a wellness grant from the Oregon-based insurance fund SAIF, also served another purpose: They kept struggling restaurants afloat. “It’s kept the doors open and a small workforce employed. It’s been the most heartfelt catering we’ve ever done,” said Kiauna Floyd, third-generation owner of Amalfi’s, a Portland institution that’s been serving up Italian cuisine for 62 years. For now, though, meal deliveries to OHSU have dried up with the grant funding, and the program ended Jan. 19. Leaders are hoping for a new funding source to get meals running again soon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBeaver: In the first six weeks of vaccine distribution in Pennsylvania, residents in a handful of counties had no chance of getting inoculated against COVID-19 without leaving their home county. An analysis of state data found that four rural counties didn’t receive any doses in the first six weeks of the bungled rollout, and the majority of doses were sent to health care systems that focused solely on inoculating employees. More than a third of vaccine doses sent out through late January went to three counties: Allegheny, Lehigh and Montgomery, which together are home to 2.4 million people. Removing Philadelphia County from the equation – it receives its vaccine doses directly from the federal government rather than the state – those three counties comprise 21.5% of Pennsylvania’s population. The state uses a formula to determine how to allocate vaccine among counties and providers based on the previous allocation of vaccine, the amount on hand for distribution, the amount administrated, the population, the amount of the population 65 and older, the percent positivity for coronavirus tests and the death rate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: The city’s school district, which had largely resisted pressure to bring students back to the classroom, has approved a plan to resume in-person learning for most children. The plan approved Tuesday night by the Pawtucket School Committee calls for bringing back elementary school students March 1, middle school students March 15 and high school students on a hybrid schedule March 29. Only preschoolers, kindergartners and students in special populations had been approved for school in person. The school committee was under pressure from many parents, who rallied last weekend in support of in-person learning. The teachers’ union, which had previously been opposed to in-person instruction, said it now supports in-person learning for elementary students but not high school students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreer: While many people grapple with whether to wear two face masks or one, the operator of a local company that’s producing 25,000 three-layer disposable masks every day says one will do. “You don’t have to do that, doubling of a mask,” said Rick Gehricke, chief operating officer of Carolina Facemask and PPE. “If you have a mask certified to international standards, you don’t have to.” Carolina Face Mask & PPE was born more than a year ago from a Greer company founded in 1999 called Advanced Testing Instruments Corp., headed by Tim Ziegenfus. The business provides advanced testing of products in the textile, chemical, plastic, automotive, aerospace, paper, military, medial, foam and packaging industries. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last March, the company ramped up production of three-ply, Level 1 PPE face masks, and business took off. Spokesperson Katlyn Searcy said with the recent surge in coronavirus cases, many people still don’t realize a small business in Greer is doing its part to fight the pandemic. “People are starting to ask more questions about masks and their effectiveness,” Searcy said. “There are also concerns of more PPE shortages as the curve is trending up again.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Lawmakers are working to memorialize one of their own whom they lost last year to COVID-19. The late Bob Glanzer died in April while still serving as a member of the state House of Representatives after a short battle with coronavirus. Representing District 22, Glanzer was known as “Mr. Huron” for his community involvement in his hometown over his 74 years and a well-respected legislator among not just his fellow Republicans but Democrats as well. And with Gov. Kristi Noem’s pushing legislators to sign off on her plan to set aside $12 million to help the South Dakota State Fair construct a new multipurpose livestock and equestrian facility at the fairgrounds in Huron, House Speaker Spencer Gosch wants to use the opportunity to honor his late friend and colleague’s legacy. “His life was basically servitude to his community, and it shouldn’t go unnoticed,” he said after pitching his plan to state appropriators Tuesday afternoon. Gosch called the situation “fast moving” and said it’s not known what a Glanzer memorial might look like. It could be anything from a sculpture or a plaque to naming the Dakota Events Complex, as the governor has been referring to the project, after him, he said.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Public health officials announced Wednesday that 975 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine that went missing were likely thrown out by accident. Knox County said the state’s Department of Health confirmed the doses were shipped to the region last week, but local officials said they have no record of receiving them. Knox County Health Department Director Dr. Martha Buchanan said that based on GPS data, she believes the box containing the doses was probably discarded by someone who thought they were throwing out dry ice. Due to security reasons, vaccine doses are shipped without any readily identifiable information attached. “It was a kick in the gut for all of us,” Buchanan said through tears. “I apologize. Vaccinating our community is very important to us.” County officials have asked for a state investigation even though Buchanan said there was no indication of foul play. A key question remains why the GPS and temperature monitors attached to the Moderna vaccines did not work, Buchanan said. “Why were we the ones who found this out?” she asked.\n\nTexas\n\nAustwell: The coronavirus pandemic has canceled this year’s flights to count the only natural flock of whooping cranes – the first time in 71 years that crews in Texas couldn’t make an aerial survey of the world’s rarest cranes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has records of such surveys for every year starting in 1950, Wade Harrell, whooping crane recovery coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an email Wednesday. The flock breeds in Canada and winters on and around Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, where the survey is made. Current protocols call for about six flights, each with a pilot and at least two observers – often coming from different parts of the country – in the close quarters of a small plane, Harrell said. “We decided to forgo the aerial survey this winter with COVID-19 cases currently spiking,” he said in a news release. At 5 feet high from their black feet to the little red caps on their heads, whooping cranes are the tallest birds in North America, and their wingspan, at more than 7 feet, is wider than a full-size pickup truck. They mate for life. Only about 825 exist – most of them in the natural flock, which is also the only one that doesn’t need human help to keep its numbers up. Habitat loss and hunting had cut that flock to 15 in 1941.\n\nUtah\n\nPanguitch: Just off this small city’s main road is a small, unassuming building that houses the local office for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. On a clear, chilly day in early January, dozens of Garfield County residents crowded around the entrance waiting to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The people in line ranged from young to old – teachers to first responders. In the back, Robin McMullin, a supervisor with the health department, was laser-focused as she filled up syringes with the Moderna vaccine. “I feel like it’s liquid gold. I seriously do,” McMullin told KUER-FM. “I don’t want to waste one drop of it.” Garfield County, with just over 5,000 people, has seen nearly 400 cases of COVID-19 – more than one in every dozen people have had the disease. Sheriff Danny Perkins said the spread of the coronavirus really picked up this fall at the county jail. About two thirds of the inmates got it, though there weren’t any serious cases among the prisoners. “But it got out in our staff, and it was devastating,” Perkins said. “There were days that I was ten people down, and when you take ten officers off of an office my size, that’s huge.” As of Feb. 2, nine people in Garfield County had died of COVID-19, making it second in the state for deaths per capita. The community has missed out on big life moments like funerals as well as more casual moments, like getting together at high school basketball games. “It’s a social gathering to get caught up on all the gossip to see how everybody’s doing,” Perkins said. “And it’s been taken away because of this disease.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city has a helpline for seniors who don’t have access to technology or transportation to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The state is now in its third week of immunizing Vermonters 75 and older. The nonprofit Age Well VT is working with the city to help seniors register for an appointment to get their first dose or to get an at-home vaccination, if necessary, WCAX-TV reports. One of the biggest concerns is getting home-bound Vermonters vaccinated, city leaders said. “It may seem to some of us like this information is everywhere, but we know we have not reached all seniors. Even in this very high-risk population, there are still significant number of those who have not yet signed up,” Mayor Miro Weinberger said Wednesday. Black Vermonters also are a large part of the age group who have not been vaccinated. Burlington’s Trusted Community Voices Program is working with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont and other groups to help educate and encourage more people of color to get their first dose, the station reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: Christopher Newport University is in the middle of its largest wave of coronavirus cases this school year, and one official put the blame on students not following rules instead of the return to in-person classes. As of Wednesday, 129 students and six employees at Christopher Newport had active cases, The Virginian-Pilot reports. On average, 171 students were in quarantine each day last week, or about 3.5% of the student body. In a letter to students and employees Monday, Kevin Hughes, vice president for student affairs, blamed the rising numbers on students. “What is happening on our campus right now is a stark reminder that individual behavior can have a profound and lasting impact,” Hughes wrote. “When you socialize with little concern, and in some cases reckless disregard, for who it hurts, everybody is impacted.” Some students said the message was condescending and want to see the university take more concrete actions to limit gatherings. Most colleges across the state have dozens or hundreds of active cases. More than 20% of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute are in isolation or quarantine. At William & Mary, cases are also rising sharply, with 79 reported this semester through Tuesday, surpassing last semester’s total in the span of a few weeks.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court has unanimously rejected a recall effort against the Thurston County sheriff, saying his announcement that he would not criminally enforce the Health Department’s COVID-19 mask mandate was not unreasonable. Resident Arthur West sought to recall Sheriff John Snaza, alleging that Snaza’s news release last June saying his office would not engage in criminal enforcement of the mandate interfered with a lawful order, and a trial court agreed. But the justices overturned that decision Thursday. The Health Department’s order requiring masks in any public setting said violators “may” be subject to criminal penalties. That language gave Snaza discretion in how to enforce the mandate, the court said. The decision noted that Snaza did not generally undermine the mandate: He said his office would continue to work with health officials to educate the public, and he encouraged people to take safety precautions such as wearing masks. Not directly citing or arresting people was reasonable because doing so could risk transmission of the virus, the justices said. They contrasted Snaza’s actions with those of Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney, against whom the court is allowing a recall petition to proceed. Fortney said he had “no intention of carrying out enforcement for a stay-at-home directive” and encouraged business owners to remain open, in violation of the state’s directions.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Three events for youth in the state have been canceled for the second consecutive year due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The Make It Shine Earth Day Celebration, West Virginia Youth Environmental Day and state Junior Conservation Camp have all been canceled, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said in a news release. The events were also canceled in 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions. The Earth Day Celebration is usually held in late April in Charleston, drawing hundreds of grade school-age children for hands-on environmental education, the release said. Youth Environmental Day had been set for May 15 in Ritchie County. Young people are recognized during the event for projects that benefit the environment and their communities. The projects will still be judged and winners recognized. Junior Conservation Camp was scheduled for June 21-25 at Cedar Lakes in Ripley. Nearly 200 campers ages 11 to 14 usually participate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee approved a bill Wednesday that would cut taxes by $540 million by the middle of 2023, largely by eliminating taxes on federal loans to businesses to help them through the pandemic. The full Legislature could vote to pass it as soon as Tuesday. Democrats on the budget committee argued that the bill cost too much and was another handout to businesses that took the loans but still flourished during the pandemic. “We’re punching a big hole in the budget,” Rep. Evan Goyke said. “We can direct our relief in a more targeted, more efficient manner.” Republicans countered that the bill brings state tax code in line with federal code. “This isn’t everyone’s dream tax bill,” said Rep. Mark Born, a committee co-chair. “This bill matches federal law. Of course it’s not perfect.” Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, would have to sign the bill for the tax cut to take effect. Asked whether Evers would veto the measure, his spokeswoman, Britt Cudaback, responded with a statement from the governor saying he would keep doing everything he can to support small businesses during the pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Coal Creek coal mine says it will shut down, making it the second mine in the Powder River Basin to announce this year that it’s closing. St. Louis, Missouri-based Arch Resources Inc., owner of the Wyoming mine, made the announcement Tuesday as the company transitions away from thermal coal generation toward coking coal, a type of coal used to make steel and other products, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Arch Resources said it plans to wind down operations at the mine near Gillette and begin cleaning up the site over the next two years. The company said it lost $78.5 million in the final quarter of last year. The Coal Creek mine produced about 2 million tons of its lower heat value coal last year, 73% less than in 2018. The mines in the Powder River Basin produce about 40% of the nation’s coal, but production has declined in part because of a push for natural gas and renewable energy. Montana’s Decker coal mine, also in the Powder River Basin, closed last month. Production losses from coal companies have led to rising unemployment and worsening state revenue shortfalls. The coronavirus pandemic also lowered demand for coal.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/local/2014/06/21/homeless-students-education/11209293/", "title": "No place to call home", "text": "Casey Blake, and Erin Brethauer\n\nAsheville Citizen-Times\n\nStory by Casey Blakecblake@citizen-times.com\n\nPhotography by Erin Brethauerebrethau@citizen-times.com\n\n………………………………………………………………………….\n\nShane Hopkins' children have never slept on the streets. They've never spent a night under a bridge, never slept in his car.\n\nThey show up to school looking like most every other child in Buncombe County. But they carry an invisible weight: They didn't have a bed to sleep in or room to call their own for half of the just-finished school year.\n\nSkylar, 12, has learned to do her hair and brush her teeth in school bathrooms. \"There are no mirrors in (school) in the bathroom, so sometimes I have to walk all the way to the gym,\" she said with a shrug. \"Whatever, it's annoying.\"\n\nShe called in sick to school one day because she was awoken by her brother's tantrums, 3 feet from one another on the floor of the double wide in Fairview she shared with eight people.\n\nLuke, 9, and Logan, his autistic twin brother, learned to ration snacks and sleep on loveseats not quite as long as their quickly growing bodies.\n\nBy the school system's standards, they were homeless. But by federal housing standards, they were never homeless enough.\n\nBy living \"doubled up\" with other families and friends, they have lived in an impossible gray area of social services, one that 78 percent of all homeless families in Buncombe County share.\n\nThey are part of the invisible but rapidly growing population that won't show up in optimistic unemployment reports or state budgets.\n\nAnd what happened to the Hopkins family \"could happen to you at any moment,\" Shane Hopkins said. \"I would never have believed it, two or three years ago. But it can.\"\n\nHopkins' children account for three of at least 750 schoolchildren in Buncombe County who lived in and out of homelessness last year. That number has grown steadily over the past five years, more than doubling since the height of the Great Recession in 2009.\n\nChildren are the new frontier in homelessness, the only subpopulation of homeless people that has actually grown in recent years.\n\nOne in five American children nationally is now living in poverty, giving the United States the highest child poverty rate of any developed nation except for Romania.\n\nNorth Carolina has slowly climbed to the top of this national trend, consistently ranked as one of the 10 states with the highest population of homeless children in the nation.\n\nAt the center of most political and funding debates surrounding homelessness is the image of out-of-work single mothers, disabled veterans and mentally ill or drug-addicted adults. They eventually lead to the exchange of phrases such as \"personal responsibility\" and \"entitlement.\"\n\nChildren are rarely the face of that debate, though they have the most to lose from a life without stable housing.\n\n\"These families are unknown, unheard, unseen,\" Buncombe County Schools homelessness coordinator Luke Heller said. \"They're invisible. How do you advocate for children who are politically invisible? You can't. Especially if we don't call them homeless.\"\n\nThe family\n\nWhen asked if he considers himself homeless, Shane Hopkins winces, taking a long pause.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he says. \"Yeah. We're homeless. What an incredibly strange thing to say. We're homeless people.\"\n\nFive years ago the Hopkins family lived in a four-bedroom Colonial in the foothills of the Poconos mountains in New Jersey, a little over an hour from the Manhattan firm where Shane worked.\n\nHis three kids, twins Luke and Logan, then 3, and Skylar, age 7, had their own rooms on five acres surrounded by farmland.\n\n\"It was beautiful,\" Shane said. \"We had a three-car garage. We lived a really nice, comfortable life.\"\n\nHis wife, Dana, was a stay-at-home mom. They chose their home based on the best school district and an area with clean air, Shane said.\n\n\"We struggled a little bit to meet our mortgage some months, but it never got scary,\" he said. \"We were putting a little bit away. We were careful, we thought. I had a 401(k). We were planning for our future, and it looked really bright.\"\n\nA few months after they bought that home, Shane got the call that his job in software was being moved off-shore, and he was being laid off.\n\nThe next year, Dana died unexpectedly, and things unraveled quickly after that.\n\n\"You have a $5,000 a month mortgage and a car payment and the cost of therapy for an autistic child,\" Shane said. \"In three months, your 401(k) is gone, there are no jobs. ... It happens in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nFamily homelessness is what insiders call a \"lagging indicator\" of an economic downturn. Families, more than individuals, will fight and scrape together every last option before allowing children to sleep on the streets or lose their homes.\n\n\"Families generally don't drop as immediately into homelessness as individuals,\" said Heather Dillahsaw, coordinator for the Asheville Buncombe Homeless Initiative. \"Children tend to couch surf more easily. People don't want children sleeping outside.\"\n\nHopkins maxed out every credit card he had, borrowed money here and there, and moved the family into smaller rented homes and fell behind in rent. They had three or four credit cards with four or five thousand dollars each on them, he said. They were evicted from their last home.\n\nAfter the eviction they visited their last resort, moving in with an old friend of Shane's. The home is a doublewide in Fairview, at the top of a mountain so steep most two-wheel drive vehicles can't scale it. The family has survived for the last year on the children's survivor benefits and Social Security from his 64-year-old mother, Janice, who has lived with the family since they came to North Carolina to help with the kids.\n\n\"A parent will throw every resource they have at keeping their children sheltered,\" Heller said. \"They'll max out every card, borrow from high-interest lenders, do everything they can think of to keep from ending up in the shelter or on the streets, so it takes longer for them to fall.\"\n\n\"It's not the same as being on the streets, I know that,\" Hopkins said. \"But it feels like we're not far from that. Like we're a moment away from it. And you can't tell me children don't feel that.\"\n\n\"I know people will judge me, I know they will look at me in an adverse way,\" he said. \"I just hope people will understand that this could happen to anyone.\"\n\nSkylar\n\nSkylar is strikingly beautiful at 12, with long, wavy blonde hair and huge blue eyes. She's never without boys surrounding her at school.\n\nShe's adventurous and often disarmingly uninhibited for a middle school girl. She is as excited by a sparkly pair of sneakers as she is to capture a salamander for her vast collection of slimy creek creatures in the family's homemade aquarium.\n\nShe's most at ease in the spotlight, a talented performer. In her previous lives in St. Louis and Florida, Skylar was a cheerleader, a dancer and even did some modeling.\n\nShe's given that up in the past year, mostly due to the challenge of getting up and down the mountain in Shane's Oldsmobile, which breaks down several times a month.\n\n\"I've always had a big room,\" she says. \"I've never had to share a room.\n\n\"I'm used to having friends come over, and my dad would drive me to the movies,\" Skylar said. \"But I can't anymore, because…\" and she trails off.\n\nIn Fairvew, Skylar slept on a pad of blankets on the floor in a corner between the kitchen and living rooms.\n\nHer corner of the room was unmistakable as the territory of a tween girl, strewn with a tornado of brightly colored tank tops, sparkly accessories and nail polish.\n\nBut discovering makeup, boys and coming of age as a pre-teen girl has looked different for her than it has for many of her peers.\n\nOn many occasions the family would run out of water, sometimes for just a day but often for several in a row. The double-wide they shared wasn't built for eight people who cook and take showers and baths, and the well water ran low or completely diminished for days on end.\n\nOn those days, Skylar would walk to a neighbor's house for showers or sneak into school bathrooms before classes to brush her teeth or do her hair.\n\n\"Sometimes I have to brush my hair and stuff at school, which is stupid,\" Skylar said with a roll of her eyes. \"And I floss there. I have to floss all the time — I'm crazy about flossing.\"\n\nSleeping has been a challenge for Skylar, positioned in the middle of the trailer and therefore in the middle of her siblings' every move.\n\nLogan often wakes in the night or struggles to fall asleep, and Skylar has no place to escape when he has a screaming fit or tantrum.\n\n\"Sometimes I just lock myself in the bathroom,\" she said. \"I just have nowhere to be.\"\n\nSkylar says she doesn't feel \"homeless,\" and discusses the idea of people who don't have homes in the third person, even when describing her own living situation.\n\n\"I think of homeless as people who live in a box, or people who don't have a house like hobos,\" she said with a nervous laugh. \"But it's also people who share a house. It doesn't have to be for money reasons, it could just be like people looking for a house.\n\n\"Here you can find a house pretty cheap,\" she said. \"But utilities and bills and stuff are pretty expensive, so it can be really hard to do.\"\n\nShane insists the children aren't too affected by the family's financial struggles. But part of him knows they are.\n\nLuke, when asked how he likes being a twin, said, \"It's pretty cool. It's not something not many other people have, like you get to be something special.\"\n\n\"I just wish Logan wasn't autistic sometimes, though,\" Luke said, characteristically blunt. \"It's harder without much money because he doesn't have the stuff he used to and you can't really go anywhere when he's all upset.\"\n\n\"They feel it, but it amazes me how the children never lose hope,\" Shane said. \"Their grandmother and I will be talking about how to scrape together money for food, and one of them will just pop up and say, 'It'll be fine dad. It'll work out.'\n\n\"Their hopes and dreams have not been affected by this, and that gives me a lot of strength,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course the children are very astute, they're more perceptive than you realize,\" he said. \"I just try to shield them as much as possible.\n\n\"But you can't cover it when we're rationing food, when you don't have water,\" Shane said. \"How do you explain to them why they have to eat lunch at school no matter what, because we can't afford to feed them lunch here?\"\n\nDefining child homelessness\n\nAccording to recent data from the Department of Education, more than 1.1 million students in the United States in grades K-12 were homeless in the 2011-12 school year.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the federal authority over housing issues, defines chronic homelessness as having been homeless four times in a three-year period or for one full year or longer, and having a disabling condition.\n\nAsheville has done well in addressing those numbers — in fact the chronically homeless have been nearly eradicated in Buncombe County. This year's Point-in-Time Count count showed only 47 people still experiencing chronic homelessness, down 84 percent from 293 chronically homeless individuals identified in 2005.\n\n\"These (chronically homeless) are people who live in the system, who use the majority of resources so we have to focus on that demographic,\" said Emily Ball, development director of Homeward Bound. \"Our job now is to focus on a different sub-population — the family — which is something we're still learning about. That's really the next frontier for us.\"\n\nBut a major challenge in addressing that new frontier is defining what child homelessness even is.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development standards, the definitions by which more state and local homelessness coordinators like Dillashaw operate, are much stricter than those used by local school districts.\n\nHUD standards require that a family be completely without shelter, living in a car or on the street or other environments, \"unfit for human habitation,\" to be defined as homeless.\n\nOnly people who are \"literally homeless\" according to HUD's definition are counted in the Point-in-Time Count, the leading national data set on homeless children and adults in America.\n\nThis means that on the night of the count, those children have to be residing in emergency shelter, including domestic violence shelters, in transitional housing for homeless persons who originally came from the streets or emergency shelters, or in places not meant for human habitation, like cars, parks, abandoned buildings, streets or campgrounds.\n\nShane and his family have never qualified for that count.\n\n\"The most vulnerable are the literally homeless,\" Dillashaw said. \"We have to target resources where people are the most at-risk and most vulnerable.\"\n\n\"If we had all kinds of money, that would be different,\" Dillashaw said. \"Unfortunately those people are more at risk. I think those definitions are where they need to be.\"\n\nBuncombe County Schools operates under a very different definition of what constitutes homelessness in children than those set by HUD, and therefore city or county organizations.\n\nThe standard for school homelessness services are based on the McKinney-Vento Act, which defines homeless children and youth as \"individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence.\"\n\nThe term includes children who are sharing the housing of other persons because of loss of housing, economic hardship, or similar reasons; living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or campgrounds; and living in a primary night-time residence not used as a \"regular sleeping accommodation.\"\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the homeless families Buncombe County Schools serves, about 78 percent, are \"doubled up,\" or sharing housing with another family.\n\n\"They often have heat (and) water (and) are sheltered, clothed, clean and fed,\" Heller said. \"To the naked eye that would not be perceived as homeless, and indeed they have a roof over their heads. It's amazing how often families work together to support themselves and each other. This is a culture that's somewhat misunderstood and in the shadows. They're afraid to be seen.\"\n\nTo Heller, Shane Hopkins' family more than qualifies as homeless, but their case would never make it to Dillashaw's desk.\n\n\"The school definition of 'doubled up' is good, because essentially that definition is about prevention,\" Dillashaw said. \"But we do not call them homeless.\"\n\nThe gap between these definitions makes for significantly different data sets. According to the latest Point-in-Time counts, the county reported a total of 58 homeless children.\n\nAt last count in Buncombe County, there were 556 students in the county district and 201 in the city who were identified as homeless. Heller said the best national estimates are that the number of identified students likely accounts for about a third of students who might qualify if identified.\n\n\"Ending homelessness doesn't end poverty,\" Dillashaw said. \"When we house people in Asheville, we're housing them into poverty.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is get them more stable to be more well and more healthy,\" she said, \"but we're not ending poverty for them by any stretch. It's a different level of poverty, but just another level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMAP BELOW Homeless students in Buncombe County: Number of students receiving free/reduced lunch because of homelessness, for each school in the Buncombe County School system, 2013-14.\n\n\n\n\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nStory by John Boyle jboyle@citizen-times.com\n\nPhotography by Erin Brethauer ebrethau@citizen-times.com\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting into affordable housing and out of the world of homelessness, the word \"competition\" likely doesn't jump to mind.\n\nBut it should.\n\n\"When you have vacancy rates that are really, really low and such little affordable housing in our community on top of that, it makes it very competitive to get into the market anywhere,\" said Brian Alexander, executive director of Homeward Bound, the Asheville nonprofit agency that helps get low-income people into housing. \"When you have credit issues and criminal history issues on top of that — and some of our families have issues with transportation on top of that — it can be very difficult.\"\n\nAnd these challenges are affecting families disproportionately. At least 750 schoolchildren in Buncombe County were identified as homeless last year, making families the only sub-population of homeless people to have grown in recent years.\n\nCompounding the red tape and short housing supply is the mountain economy and housing market, one that relies heavily on tourism jobs that pay lower wages in a beautiful area where home prices and rents are higher than other regions. That often adds up to housing being just out of reach for low-income and even moderate income families.\n\nIn 2013, nearly one-half of all renters in Asheville and just less than 40 percent of homeowners fell under the category of \"cost-burdened,\" which are those paying more than 30 percent of income for a place to live, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures for a five-year span ending in 2013.\n\nThat's if they can get in. Most housing agencies derive their funding from federal government money, and with those come a long list of requirements and guidelines those agencies must follow, including background and credit checks and whether they've been evicted before.\n\nHitting the hurdles\n\nShane Hopkins feels like he's gotten a personal look inside that bureaucratic machine over the past few years.\n\nFive years ago the Hopkins family lived in a four-bedroom home in New Jersey, but the the loss of his high-paying software job and the unexpected death of his wife shortly thereafter started a downward spiral that led to Hopkins and his three children staying in a friend's home in Fairview. After arriving in Asheville last August, they became part of the de facto homeless, although Hopkins diligently searched for housing.\n\n\"We definitely hit some of those hurdles,\" Hopkins said. \"What we came up against in North Carolina was with the programs to help people in general — and not just in housing — there were a lot of programs in place that were funded by the government or different types of organizations. We found out a lot of the programs were really facades to kind of check off boxes or to create compliance of other broader programs that brought in the money. There was a person on the phone but no real meat and potatoes behind the the person on the phone.\"\n\nWith three kids in tow, 9-year-old twins Luke and Logan and 12-year-old daughter Skylar, Hopkins was desperate to get them out of the friend's house and into their own. The first step he took was looking at homes for rent on Craigslist.\n\n\"The first thing they want is a credit check and background report,\" Hopkins said, adding that he has no criminal background but did have an eviction on a previous house. \"With the credit check you have to be creative in how you approach it. Sometimes being up front about it is the way to go; sometimes you've got to use a diversionary tactic, maybe some cash in hand, or a story. You've got to be really, really creative in thinking, 'How can I get this woman past this point of doing background check and credit report, and focus on how it would be valuable having me as a tenant?\"\n\nWith a family counting on him, Hopkins said he was out there \"fighting\" to find a place and working with a local nonprofit. Still, \"with 90 percent of the places we looked at, we never got past (the credit check and background report),\" he said.\n\nThe eviction was poison to most potential renters. The options that remain, Hopkins said, are renting from people \"who don't check or don't care,\" and that usually translates into lower quality properties with a lot of problems, or less tech-savvy owners who go on their gut feeling.\n\nUltimately, a local church, Trinity of Fairview Baptist Church, stepped up for Hopkins, his children and his mother, who lives with them. Just before Christmas, church members had found out about his plight through the Buncombe County Schools homeless coordinator and offered to supply Christmas gifts.\n\nBy happenstance, a church member who'd just lost her tenants met Hopkins outside the church's toy room and offered to rent the house to him, without a background check. His children receive Social Security survivors benefits and his mother is on disability, an income that totals $2,700 a month.\n\nThat put the $900 rent firmly within reach.\n\n\"In 10, 15 minutes we went from having nothing to having a truckload of Christmas gifts for my kids and a place to live,\" Hopkins said. \"All this happened in a space of 15 minutes, after a year of trying. The goodwill and good faith of people in the community, they fixed the problem. They saw something they weren't going to stand for and they fixed it.\"\n\nLots of effort, huge demand\n\nIn the Asheville area, we have no shortage of agencies, nonprofits and other groups trying to fix the problem of affordable housing. But we also have an enormous number of people in need.\n\nIn Buncombe County, for every 100 extremely low-income renter households — those earning less than $17,500 annually — there were only 31 affordable rental units available in 2012, according to the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based, nonpartisan think tank that conducts economic and social policy research. With a population of about 245,000, the county had 10,308 households that met that qualification but only 3,214 affordable rental units available.\n\nIn 2000, Buncombe had 5,427 households that met that income qualification and 2,472 affordable rental units available.\n\nAsheville and Buncombe County have made a stronger effort to build affordable housing than several over comparably-sized cities in the region, according to a recent report the city commissioned, called the \"Affordable Housing Scorecard.\" The city and county have sunk $17.4 million into developments between 2007-13, with money coming from federal, city and county funding.\n\nDuring that time, the Asheville Housing Trust Fund accounted for $1.7 million in spending, while $3.6 million came through Buncombe. Those efforts resulted in 461 rental units and 223 homes on the market between 2007-13.\n\nThe N.C. Housing Finance Agency, which funnels bond funds, and state and federal dollars into affordable housing, notes that since 1974, it has helped finance just more than 4,200 homes and apartments in Buncombe County and has provided 5,100 households with rental assistance.\n\nMountain Housing Opportunities, an Asheville nonprofit dedicated to building affordable housing, adds 50-60 apartments to the local market every year. But demand always outstrips supply for their units, which offer income-based rents that are typically half the cost of market rate housing.\n\nFor example, in 2010, MHO offered up for lease 60 units in its new Glen Rock Apartments in the River Arts District. They got more than 1,000 applications.\n\nCindy Visnich Weeks, MHO's director of community investments, said they do have to follow federal guidelines on credit and background checks for potential renters, but that's not the major hurdle to securing housing, as she sees it.\n\n\"To me the major hurdle is just finding a living wage job,\" Weeks said. \"You can't solve the problems of the economy with housing.\"\n\nThe average apartment rent for the Asheville market in 2013 was $864 a month, just $10 a month less than Charlotte, according to the Charlotte apartment research firm Real Data. Rents have steadily risen in Buncombe, increasing from $690 a month in December 2004 to $839 in 2012, a 22 percent jump.\n\nIn December 2004, the average mortgage was $878 a month, increasing to $1,028 in 2009, then dropping to $979 last year. That amounts to a 12 percent increase over the span. At the same time, wages for many have remained stagnant, despite low unemployment, with the average weekly income in Buncombe County rising from $535 a week to $690 from 2001-13.\n\nBut factoring in inflation, weekly wages actually have declined, coming in at $524, according to Syneva Economics.\n\nWeeks recalled a recent meeting about helping people get in affordable housing that she attended that included bank, housing and credit officials.\n\n\"I said, 'You can all outline individual causes of why people don't qualify, but it comes down to we have a tourism-based economy that pays low wages and has very high housing costs,\" Weeks said.\n\n\"Sometimes, when I feel cynical, I feel like we're propping up employers to pay less than a living wage.\"\n\nIn Hopkins' case, he said he arrived in Asheville last year with $60 in his wallet and no job prospects. He had worked in IT for the American Association of Orthodontists in St. Louis and had an extensive background in the field but said he came back to work too soon after his wife's death and \"couldn't possibly have handled it well.\"\n\nHe was let go, landing in Asheville. With a small Internet startup under his belt right now, he's pulling in a \"few hundred dollars a month,\" income he hopes to grow.\n\nLingering problems, no simple solution\n\nAt the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, low income is the standard. The problem is supply.\n\nOccupancy for the authority's 1,531 public housing units in 11 developments hovers at 99 percent, while another 1,500 units in the Section 8 apartment program stays at 96-97 percent, according to Executive Director Gene Bell. That Section 8 number is a little misleading, as the voucher program was closed in 2011 because the program has 2,000 people on the waiting list.\n\nFunded through the Department of Housing of Urban Development, the Housing Authority has to adhere to federal guidelines. They do criminal background checks on all tenants but not credit checks.\n\n\"Some of the biggest hurdles we see are the person may have had previous tenancy with us and left under unfavorable circumstances,\" said Noele Tackett, resident selection coordinator with HACA.\n\nAnyone with a felony conviction within the last five years will be denied housing, and misdemeanor drug charges within that time frame may have a similar result, although those cases are looked at individually, Bell said. Anyone with a methamphetamine production conviction or status as registered sex offenders are banned for life.\n\nBell, who also served on the Asheville City Schools Board of Education, says the affordable housing issues breaks down into three segments, as he sees it:\n\nThe public housing residents HACA serves, who have to earn 80 percent of the median national income or less to qualify.\n\nThe working poor where folks are making at or near minimum wage and struggle to make ends meet.\n\nEntry level workers such as police, firefighters and teachers for whom \"affordability is a challenge.\"\n\nWhile the Asheville area is known as a retirement mecca awash in trendy restaurants and golf courses, affordable housing is an issue that dominates the landscape of working people.\n\n\"I think it's bigger than we want to realize it is and even confess that it is,\" Bell said. \"But affordable housing here is a major issue. I don't know of anybody working any harder than Asheville to try to address it, but the median rent and the median income, that gap is getting wider all the time.\"\n\nAlexander, at Homeward Bound, said Asheville has made great strides in attacking homelessness, but the community still struggles with the issue, partly because of the income issue. They deal with a lot of families that are at 30-50 percent of the median income.\n\nA rule of thumb is that affordable housing in a given market should not constitute more than 30 percent of a family's or individual's income.\n\n\"Most people we work with aren't able to get into fair market housing without paying more than 30 percent of their incomes,\" Alexander said. \"A lot of our people are paying 50 percent or more.\"\n\nChild care is expensive, and that impacts affordability, too, Alexander said. Many also struggle with transportation issues — being able to afford a car and insurance.\n\nBesides a lack of housing and income issues, the biggest problem they encounter with placing families in housing is eviction. Some rental companies or agencies might overlook some credit issues, and they're willing to bend when medical conditions cause financial woes, but eviction is different.\n\n\"Once someone has had eviction, a lot of landlords and management companies won't even touch them,\" Alexander said, adding that they often refer such people to the financial assistance nonprofit OnTrack Financial Education & Counseling. \"An eviction, that can take seven years to get that off your credit report. That's a long time. So then you have to be very creative. We're also very upfront.\"\n\nBill Murdoch, executive director of Eblen Charities, which has a housing assistance program, said they helped 1,757 families last year to stay in their home or find one, and they provided utilities and bill assistance to another 11,800. The charity disbursed $345,000 for housing help and another $1.5 million to help people with utilities and bills.\n\nThe idea is to help people stay in their homes so they don't become homeless. Once someone becomes homeless, they then have to accrue security and utility deposits before trying to rent again, a huge obstacle when you're already down.\n\nStill, it's an uphill struggle in a long, slow economic recovery.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one cause for it, and I don't think there's any one answer,\" Murdoch said. \"What's important is to be able to keep people in their homes.\"\n\nFor his part, Hopkins said his time of homelessness and struggling with various bureaucracies has been \"exhausting and enlightening.\" He knows agencies are trying, but one lesson he's taken away is that we have to take care of each other.\n\n\"In the end, it's the community that fixes stuff, not the government,\" he said.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nStory by Casey Blakecblake@citizen-times.com\n\nPhotography by Erin Brethauerebrethau@citizen-times.com\n\nFamilies living in cars. Families camping, then driving to a bus stop so the other kids won't see them emerging from the woods. Families living in abandoned buildings, trading the heat and running water that comes with living in a shelter for the privacy and lesser exposure to dangerous people.\n\nThese are the families who Luke Heller has worked with on a daily basis over the last three years as the Buncombe County Schools homeless students liaison.\n\nThey aren't necessarily the norm; in fact a majority of the students he works with are living in less severe circumstances. But there are enough to keep him up at night, and enough that the school system is struggling to keep up with even identifying them, much less getting them the resources they need.\n\n\"Every year we see some some pretty incredible, pretty severe circumstances,\" Heller said. \"It amazes me, still. Children living in cars, abandoned buildings and who lack running water or electricity. These kids are on the buses with other students, and most people have absolutely no idea.\"\n\nPublic schools are often on the front lines of child homelessness, identifying them and connecting their families with resources before social services even knows they exist.\n\nTeachers and schools staff are trained to spot the signs — children wearing the same clothes for several days, seeming hungry or especially tired. Once identified, they're referred to Heller's office. He then connects them with community resources and makes arrangements for transportation, which has traditionally been a huge hurdle for families who may be sleeping in a different home — and a different school district — every night or week.\n\nSchools operate under a very different definition of what constitutes homelessness in children than those standards set by the federal housing authority, HUD, and therefore city or county officials.\n\nHUD standards require that a family be completely without shelter, living in a car or on the street or other environments \"unfit for human habitation\" to be defined as homeless.\n\nThe standard for school homelessness services are based on the McKinney-Vento Act, which defines homeless children and youth as \"individuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence.\"\n\nAt last count in Buncombe County, there were 556 students in the county district and 201 in the city who were identified as homeless. Heller said the best national estimates are that the number of identified students likely accounts for about a third of students who might qualify if identified.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the homeless families Buncombe County Schools serves — about 78 percent — are \"doubled up,\" or sharing housing with another family. Last year, 65 students were identified as living in shelters, 16 were completely unsheltered, and 39 were living in motels.\n\nHeller changed the way the district asks parents how they are living, a move that has likely contributed to a significant bump in the number of students they identify as homeless.\n\nInstead of asking a parent \"are you homeless?\" on intake forms and surveys, Buncombe County schools also asks if a family is sharing housing with another, and if they have a permanent place of residence.\n\n\"As a parent, it can be hard to admit that your family is in trouble,\" Heller said. \"No parent wants to come forward and say 'Hey, we're homeless. Look at us.' Asking for help is incredibly hard, and parents fear losing their children if they admit they don't have shelter for them.\"\n\n\"We have identified so many families who won't call themselves homeless, who just can't bring themselves to check that box, but who are living in some pretty severe circumstances.\"\n\nThe faces behind those circumstances vary widely, Heller said.\n\n\"Especially in this area, it's not uncommon at all with national forests for parents to be camping, then driving their kids to school because they don't want their kids at bus stops coming right out of the woods,\" Heller said. \"I've had families camping out at the end of dead-end roads, in forests, in woods behind big commercial buildings.\"\n\n\"I've worked with families living in abandoned buildings that used to be a game room that have no showers, heat or bathrooms, a single mother fleeing domestic violence camping with a middle school boy. Families living in cars.\"\n\nThis year Heller met, a high school-age child who had been out of school for six months and his mother, who had been living between motels and in their car. He met them in a big box store parking lot, sitting with them in their car in 30-degree weather.\n\n\"When their monthly check ran out, they would live in their cars,\" Heller said. \"That was their norm.\"\n\n\"I just kept thinking, I can barely stand to sit in here. How are you sleeping like this?\"\n\nAnother family he's worked with lived in the shell of their trailer, which had had burned down months earlier.\n\n\"They ran an extension cord from a neighbor's trailer and cooked with a coffee pot,\" he said. \"They didn't think they had another option.\"\n\nThe immediate supports put them up in a hotel for a couple of days, he said, \"But then what? They had no other option than to move back into that trailer.\"\n\nUnaccompanied homeless youth, or students who have no parents in the picture and aren't living within the foster care system, are another significant demographic Heller sees. Of the 556 students identified as homeless last year, 96 of those were unaccompanied homeless youth.\n\n\"I worked with one boy who could not return to family,\" he said, adding that some students are forced to leave their homes because they pose a danger to siblings, or their homes pose a danger to them. \"So he slept in in a grocery store parking lot in his car, and just worked to support himself.\"\n\n\"Immediately, the impact is basic. It's food insecurity. It's a lack of access to necessary resources for health care, the impact of dangerous housing situations,\" Heller said.\n\n\"The long-term impact is a lifelong experience of homelessness in some form or another,\" he said. \"It's not that someone sees it and thinks, 'I want to live that way, too.' It's a lifestyle, that they just settle for this and become resigned to that way of life. That's one of the longest reaching impacts that we have to stop.'\"\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nStory by Casey Blakecblake@citizen-times.com\n\nPhotography by Erin Brethauerebrethau@citizen-times.com\n\nThe morning starts in silence.\n\nZahmari, 6, and her sister Aaliyah, 8, wake to the sudden glare of industrial fluorescent lighting, about two feet above the top bunks they share with their 2-year old brother, Lavarion, their mom, Tiana, and their infant brother, Lavar.\n\nIt's 5 a.m. They have 90 minutes to be out of the room where they've slept since September, where they won't be allowed back until later that night.\n\nWithout a word, they climb down the metal ladders and groggily start what will be a series of adult tasks they take on throughout the day.\n\nZahmari goes straight to the baby bottles resting on a rusted TV stand, where they also store the baby's shoes, a broken TV and an old VCR. It's the only piece of furniture in the room, other than the five bunk beds shared by the 10 women and children living in it.\n\nShe quietly counts off the ounces, pouring the contents of a plastic bottle of water into the baby's bottle.\n\n\"One, two, three, four… stop,\" she whispers to herself, then scoops out the powdered formula they keep in a container on the TV stand.\n\nAaliyah works next to her sister, her eyes still swollen from sleep, cracking open one of the four, 18-gallon plastic storage bins where they keep their every belonging, pulling out a bright yellow and orange dress she's been waiting to wear all week.\n\nIt matches a new pair of rubber flip-flops she got just yesterday, still with their tags on, laid out at the end of her bunk the night before.\n\nShe holds her dress up to them, as if to make sure it hadn't changed colors overnight, then pulls her toothbrush out of a plastic bag of brushes her family shares. She leaves for the bathroom they share with two dozen other women, where her family will have 15 minutes of private time to wash and get ready for the day.\n\nZahmari stays behind to help her mom. \"I am the pick-up robot,\" she murmurs in an automated voice, miming with bent elbows and flat hands, as she picks up binkies, tiny shoes and barrettes her siblings left behind. The room has to be spotless, otherwise her mother could be written up by shelter staff.\n\nZahmari and Aaliyah are two of more than 750 school children identified as homeless in Buncombe County last year, a number which has only grown since the height of the Great Recession.\n\nThe girls have lived with their family in the Western Carolina Rescue Ministries shelter on Patton Avenue downtown since September — for almost an entire school year.\n\nAs they enter the main shelter downstairs, they take their places in the chapel, where everyone waits to be fed.\n\nThey stand next to one man, still reeking of alcohol from the night before. Another covered in tattoos and a torn shirt winks as Zahmari passes him. She quickly turns away, knowing better than to talk to strangers, even though she's surrounded by them constantly.\n\nThe girls are careful not to call the room they sleep in home. Unlike their brothers, they remember what a home is — mostly as a place where they ran into their parents' room on Sunday mornings and jumped on the bed until someone made them pancakes. It's been almost nine months, but they remember the difference.\n\n\"People are nice here, and my bed is comfortable,\" Zahmari says with a shrug. \"But I just miss being a family sometimes.\"\n\nThe family is one of a growing number in Buncombe County entering shelters, living doubled up with other families and otherwise living without permanent housing.\n\nFamilies and children are what experts call a lagging indicator of an economic downturn, the new frontier in fighting homelessness.\n\nChildren are the only sub-population of homeless people that has actually grown in recent years, a trend shelter workers and others working to address homelessness have watched with concern.\n\n\"We do everything we can to make it comfortable for the kids, to make it like a home,\" Pastor Michael Woods, director of the shelter, said. \"But it makes you sick seeing all these kids in here ... just makes you sick. They shouldn't have to be here. And we can't keep up, the way things have been going. It's growing too fast.\"\n\nSheltered kids\n\nTiana Jackson cried for hours the night she and her partner of seven years, Lavar Bailey, decided they had to move their three children into the shelter.\n\nShe was pregnant at the time with her fourth child, Lavar II, who came home from the hospital to the shelter in March.\n\nBoth parents were working fast food jobs at the time, barely making ends meet for years. They lived paycheck to paycheck each month, but they made it work.\n\nThen, slowly, they both saw the number of hours their employers would allow them to work start waning, and eventually those paychecks got too small to make rent.\n\nAfter falling three months behind, they were evicted from their home in Weaverville. They lived in a motel for more than a month, but eventually realized they couldn't afford even that for much longer, and came to the shelter until they could get back on their feet.\n\n\"I was afraid of everything that first night,\" Tiana said. \"Of exposing them to all these people, of them being afraid. I was afraid they would feel ashamed. I felt ashamed. And I was worried [Lavar] would leave because we hit this rock bottom.\"\n\nBut he didn't leave, and the two have since found a way to juggle an impossible Rubiks cube of work schedules and child care, parenting their four children from different floors of the shelter.\n\nTiana works full-time at KFC, taking as many hours as she can whenever she can. Most days she works the day shift, getting home just before Lavar has to work nights at a Pizza Hut in Weaverville.\n\nOn the nights he can't get a ride home, Lavar will walk more than seven miles back to the shelter, so he can be there when the kids wake up and Tiana can go to work.\n\nLavar spends most days taking care of the kids, usually with baby Lavar strapped to his chest in a Bjorn and Lavarion, or Boo Boo as the family calls him, holding his hand or tugging at his pants.\n\nDuring the school year, he met the girls at the bus stop every day with a big bear hug and a high five. The girls say they hated getting dropped off at the shelter at first — they were embarrassed. But they're more used to it now.\n\nTheir summer days are filled mostly alternating between afternoons at the downtown library and Aston Park, both of which they can walk to.\n\nLast week, the family rode the bus for more than an hour, waiting for the shelter to open for lunch. As it is, they're stuck in the shelter from 5 p.m. to after 6 the next morning, so they take every opportunity to get away.\n\nThe girls are not Lavar's biological children, but you wouldn't know it from watching them.\n\nHe already worries about the day the girls will start dating and wonders what kind of parents they'll be. He takes every opportunity to teach them, making them spell the names of things they see in the park and practice counting.\n\n\"I try to teach them to be gentle with their brothers and how to take care of them,\" he said, watching as Aaliyah pushed her brother in the stroller, in a tiny circle at the park.\n\n\"I want them to be good moms and to be with good men.\"\n\nThe girls take joy in little pleasures, from drawing elaborate scenes with the ballpoint pens they borrow from office staff at the shelter desk to balancing on the wooden beams marking the parking lot around the shelter.\n\nThey alternate seamlessly between moments of stark adulthood and the universal silliness of being a little girl, making baby bottles for their little brother in the park, taking breaks only to giggle uncontrollably when one of them says \"yaybe\" instead of \"baby.\"\n\nTiana jokes that Aaliyah is \"Mom No. 2\" to her siblings.\n\nEach night, the children have to say goodbye to their daddy, who has to sleep with the general population downstairs, apart from the women and children in the upstairs wing. Some nights the parting is peaceful, others Lavarion will scream and cry, yelling that he doesn't want to leave his daddy. Lavar has never seen where his children have slept the last nine months.\n\nTiana and the kids have to be upstairs by 5 p.m. and are not allowed to leave again until the next morning. They make the best of it, singing to the baby and playing with the small collection of toys in the shared living room upstairs.\n\nTiana's darkest moments seem to come as she's stuffing the family's things back into the four plastic bins the five of them share. It's as if her every frustration with the family's lives lives in those bins. Every T-shirt, bottle of lotion, every toy and book — they all have to fit.\n\nEnding the cycle\n\nThe Jackson-Bailey family hits almost every mark on the long list of factors that make a family vulnerable to housing insecurity.\n\nThe family has applied for public housing but has been denied. Even with their combined wages working as many hours as they can get, they still fall well below the marker of \"cost-burdened,\" which are those paying more than 30 percent of income for a place to live.\n\nIn 2013, nearly one-half of all renters in Asheville and just less than 40 percent of homeowners fell under that category.\n\nBoth have poor credit, primarily from unpaid bills and credit cards Tiana says her parents took out in her name when she was too young to know the difference.\n\nLavar has a record — nonviolent crimes from when he was a teenager — but a record, nonetheless.\n\nHe's applied for a dozen jobs closer to town, where he can work more hours and walk to and from work, but if the fact that he doesn't have reliable transportation doesn't get in the way, his record does.\n\nBoth of these — poor credit and criminal history — can be crippling to accessing housing, children or not.\n\n\"It's almost better to have a criminal history than to have a poor credit history when it comes to getting into housing,\" said Heather Dillashaw, director of the Asheville-Buncombe Homeless Initiative.\"It can be almost impossible to overcome that, and if you've had an eviction or an issue with public housing, your options are just incredibly limited.\n\n\"And of course people who become homeless almost always have poor credit,\" she said. \"You don't fall into homelessness overnight, after paying bills on time and keeping up with rent. [Homeless] families have almost always made some tough choices.\"\n\n\"The end of the recession for one family may look very different for that of a homeless family,\" said Luke Heller, Buncombe County Schools homeless students liaison. \"The hole is a lot deeper. We talk about children and families as a lagging indicator of an economic downturn, because families stretch their resources for longer and exhaust every option before they get to a place where they really ask for help, or are eligible for it.\n\n\"For families who are homeless, trying to get back on their feet may be experiencing challenges like access to child care, even if you qualify for vouchers. If you can't get child care how do you get to work if you get a job? There are still these very basic barriers.\"\n\nAnd the inherent expenses that come with children — from childcare to school supplies to food and clothing — dig families deeper into debt than individuals, meaning that financial rock bottom comes later and hits harder than it might for single adults.\n\nDillashaw said childcare costs are one of the most, if not the most, significant barriers to climbing out of poverty.\n\nMuch of the family's savings have gone into paying for hotels on nights that Tiana and Lavar have to work, because they can't enter the shelter after 6 p.m.\n\n\"We can't get enough subsidy from anywhere to make up for the fact that we aren't paying a living wage, we just can't do it,\" Dillahsaw said.\n\n\"In a town like Asheville, we're a service industry town where low skill and no skill workers are making $8 an hour, that's $15,000 a year. We cannot make up for that gap. There's just no way for us to keep pace with that.\"\n\n\"We can address the middle class all we want, but that does nothing but push people who are already at the bottom further down,\" Dillashaw said. \"That's just simple math. There's no rocket science behind that.\"\n\nTolls and trends\n\nStatistically, the odds stacked against Zahmari, Aaliyah, Lavarion and Lavar extend to almost every aspect of their lives.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Family Homelessness, homeless children are sick four times more often than other children. They have four times as many respiratory infections, have high rates of obesity because of nutritional deficiencies and have three times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems compared to non-homeless children.\n\nBy age 12, 83 percent of homeless children had been exposed to at least one serious violent event. Almost 25 percent have witnessed acts of violence within their own families.\n\nWoods said it was only in recent years that more and more children started showing up in the shelter, an alarming trend he fears the shelter can't keep up with.\n\n\"We just can't build a place fast enough to keep up, the way things are going,\" Woods said. \"And I hope we won't have to.\"\n\nBut the shelter beats the alternative, he said. Last year, he met a boy who came to the shelter and saw the bunks, and yelled, \"I get a bed? I get to sleep in a bed!\"\n\n\"He had never slept in a bed before, not ever,\" Woods said. \"People think this is rock bottom, but that's a kid who wasn't even in the system yet. He wasn't on anybody's radar before he came here, and he had never slept in a bed before.\"\n\nCities the size of Asheville typically fall four to five years behind the bigger poverty and homelessness trends seen in larger cities like New York, which only recently has started to see results in keeping child homelessness rates at bay.\n\nThe shift in recent years, locally and across the country, has been to focus more resources on organizations that provide long-term, permanent housing rather than emergency services like shelters, Dillashaw said.\n\nThe city's 10-year plan to end homelessness is loosely based off the New York City Housing First Model.\n\nHousing First, which is distinct and separate from \"rapid re-housing\" is a relatively recent model in human services, an alternative to a system of emergency shelter and transitional housing.\n\nRather than moving homeless individuals through different \"levels\" of housing, known as the Continuum of Care, Housing First moves the homeless individual or household immediately from the streets or homeless shelters into their own apartments.\n\nThe Department of Education estimates about 28,000 North Carolina students are homeless, but only about 22 percent of the state's school districts receive federal aid to assist with the problem.\n\n\"We can throw money at the problem all day long, and for some families it may only take $1,000 and they may even have an income to sustain them,\" Heller said. \"Sometimes that fixes the problem, but more often than not that's just a band aid because there's something that tore it down in the first place. We need to get families into housing, but what then?\"\n\nTiana said she hopes the family will find housing by the time the next school year starts and that Lavar will find a job, hopefully with better pay, closer to town.\n\nThe girls say they miss cooking and reading books and watching cartoons in bed with their parents the most — so a kitchen and a bedroom are their only real demands for a home.\n\n\"I like cooking breakfast,\" Zahmari said, when asked what she wants to do first when she gets a house. \"I want to jump on the bed, too, but that's not allowed in our family.\n\n\"Mostly, I just want to read in bed with my mom and dad,\" she said. \"We don't need, like, millions of dollars for that.\"\n\n\"I like having our own house, because it's safer,\" she said. \"I like cooking breakfast, and being safe.\"\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nWhat number of homeless kids is OK with you?\n\nColumn by Casey Blakecblake@citizen-times.com\n\nZahmari Frazier, 6, told me she wants to be a police officer when she grows up, because she'd like to help people feel safe. Or a doctor, she said later, because doctors help people, and she loves helping.\n\nI felt as if I'd been punched in the gut, hearing her say that. Because statistically, as a homeless child, Zahmari stands a very small chance of becoming a doctor. This incredibly sharp, intuitive, nurturing, beautiful little girl may not get to live out her dream because a broken economy wouldn't allow it, and her community stood by and watched.\n\nAs I've written more than once in the past week, more than 750 school children were identified as homeless last year in Buncombe County. Those counts do not include pre-schoolers, who are homeless at an even higher rate than their K-12 counterparts.\n\nPhotographer Erin Brethauer and I set out to meet some of the families behind these alarming statistics almost a year ago, bringing with us more misconceptions than facts about what this problem looked like.\n\nThe day we met Shane Hopkins, the father of three who fell from a more-than-comfortable lifestyle into homelessness following the loss of several jobs and sudden loss of his wife, he asked me if I'd read a recent Wall Street Journal article on employment reports and the national affordable housing market.\n\nThis problem is not going to look like I thought it would, I realized. And it doesn't — it looks a lot like the people I work with and live next to.\n\nTiana and Lavar, parents of four children younger than 9 who have lived with their kids in a downtown shelter for an entire school year, both work as close to full time as they possibly can. Tiana works from the first shift she can take, to within 15 minutes of Lavar leaving for work. Lavar walks seven miles home from his job some nights, so he can be there for his kids when they wake up.\n\nIf that's not picking yourself up by the bootstraps, I can't imagine what is.\n\nWe went into this series knowing there would be people whose minds could not be changed — people who will refuse to think of child homelessness as a problem that needs solving, and who believe the primary if not sole fault lies with the parents.\n\nQuestioning the accountability of parents in this situation is valid — in fact it's imperative. The idea that we may be enabling families to live in poverty by providing too many services is an age-old suspicion, and it's not without its merits. But the bottom line is that children are not born with bootstraps. They don't choose this, and they join society whether we throw them a lifeline or not, and we all live with that cost.\n\nOne of the most striking things in talking with the experts on this issue, from city officials to school social workers to nonprofit managers, all of whom rely on waning funding, was that when asked where they needed funding most — where the money should go — none identified themselves.\n\nThey named Medicaid expansion, childcare vouchers, programs to get people with criminal records into better jobs, and improved mental health care access. They are the first to admit that there's no such thing as solving homelessness — there's only addressing poverty.\n\nBy federal standards, Shane Hopkins' kids — who slept in recliners and on blankets on the floor of someone else's trailer for months — are not homeless. I don't see those definitions expanding, which stretches dwindling resources even further.\n\nBut I think we have to ask ourselves what definition of homelessness we as a community, as human beings, are comfortable with before we accept that of an overburdened, underfunded governmental entity. What is our moral definition of child homelessness?\n\nIn a community known for its many creative nonprofits and so proud of its depth of compassion, why are we triaging children living in abject poverty, ranking their homelessness as if any degree of it would be OK?\n\nThe math is easy to me — every single child without a bed has to be a priority.\n\nI would be lying if I said I never lost a night's sleep wondering what effect this story would have on the children we're showing you. They're kids, and as much as we tried explaining to them every detail of what this story would look like, we know they can't get it the way their parents do.\n\nBeing 6 or 11 or 12 years old is hard enough living in a mansion, and no child should be subjected to the Internet trolls and taunting this type of notoriety can bring.\n\nMy hope is that the solace they take as adults in knowing that they may have changed something for one or 10 or 10,000 other kids in their community long after they're adults overrides the trouble it may cause them.\n\nI hope our community doesn't prove me wrong. Zahmari would make a really great doctor.\n\nThe reality is that more than 750 children out of about 30,000 isn't an overwhelming percentage. Such a relatively small number shouldn't overwhelm the system.\n\nBut I think the question we have to ask ourselves is, how many homeless children should we settle for?\n\nThe only answer that I can settle on is zero, and I would challenge every elected official in the state — every community member, in fact — to come up with theirs as well.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThank you\n\nAfterword by Erin Brethauerebrethau@citizen-times.com\n\nThis project would not have been possible without the openness and understanding of the families profiled in this series. A profound note of thanks to the Hopkins and Jackson-Bailey families for opening up their lives so that our photographs and reporting could effectively put a face to an issue has been hiding and growing in plain sight.\n\nThese families were willing to have a photographer and reporter wake up with them in the morning and watch them go to bed at night. They let us see the small victories of their days and the moments when life just feels too hard.\n\nThey understand the importance of sharing their stories so that others can understand why this problem is giving children an unfair advantage so early in their lives.\n\nOn Friday, I did a video interview with Tiana Jackson, who was completely candid about her situation as a mother of four living in a shelter since September. She said, \"I just want people to know our story, to know how hard it is. Because a lot of people see us and unless you know our situation, or you see me getting on at this bus stop here and getting off here frequently, they don't know we're homeless. But they will now because I'm not afraid to tell my story. Because I don't want to just speak for me and my family, I want to speak for the other families too.\"\n\nI firmly believe everyone has a story to tell and sometimes all you need to do is listen. I think that one of the greatest blessings of my job is the ability to give someone a voice.\n\nAnother thank you goes out to Luke Heller, the homeless liaison for Buncombe County Schools who helped connect us with these families. His dedication to the families and to this project are paramount.\n\nAnd thank you to Michael Woods at the Western Carolina Rescue Ministry, who immediately gave us full access to the shelter where the Jackson-Bailey family have been staying after learning about this project. Access and understanding are the keys to this type of intimate reporting.\n\nAnd thank you for reading these stories. If they affected you, please share them. And join us at 7 tonight at the Wesley Grant Center for our forum.

What it means", "text": "Farmers, ranchers, and various agricultural producers are urging Congress to pass a new Farm Bill as the Sept. 30 deadline approaches.\n\nBut with only 10 days remaining and peak campaign season underway ahead of the Nov. 5 election, it is increasingly likely that the 2018 Farm Bill will be extended for another year.\n\nIn May, the United States House Committee on Agriculture passed its version of the bill, which included several significant changes related to hemp products and food stamps. Since then, there has been little progress, with no further action taken on the House floor, and the bill has not even been publicly considered by the Senate.\n\nMore:The Farm Bill is stalled. What does that mean for hemp and delta-8 products in Texas?\n\nWhy is the Farm Bill taking so long?\n\nThe Farm Bill is one of the most controversial pieces of legislation in the U.S. because it addresses a wide range of issues beyond farming, leading to significant disagreements between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe most debated issue in discussions about the Farm Bill is the funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. This program is a key component of the bill and provides food assistance to nearly 42 million Americans each month.\n\nThe controversy arises because SNAP constitutes a significant portion of the Farm Bill's budget, roughly 85%, leading to disagreements about how much funding it should receive, eligibility requirements and the potential for fraud or misuse.\n\nAdvocates for SNAP emphasize its role in reducing food insecurity, particularly among low-income families, children, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. They also allege that SNAP benefits can stimulate local economies by increasing demand for groceries and agricultural products.\n\nOpponents are seeking stricter work requirements and reduced spending, suggesting that the program has expanded beyond its original intent and that it should prioritize promoting self-sufficiency. They believe that by imposing tighter eligibility criteria and reducing the number of recipients, the program could be streamlined, resulting in cost savings. This, they argue, would allow more funds to be reallocated toward farmers and agricultural initiatives that are also part of the Farm Bill, aligning with the bill’s original agricultural focus.\n\nAdditionally, one of the most contentious revisions in the 2018 Farm Bill involved hemp. The previous language allowed for the inclusion of intoxicating hemp products, despite lawmakers intending to focus solely on hemp as an agricultural commodity, particularly for fiber, seeds, and extracts like CBD. Legislators did not foresee the vast array of consumable products made possible by hemp, which contains cannabinoids like delta-8 and THC-a.\n\nAs the use of consumable hemp products has surged, government officials are becoming increasingly concerned. In late March, 21 attorneys general across the U.S. sent a letter to Congressional agriculture committees urging them to clearly define hemp products in the new bill.\n\nMore:When does early voting start in Texas? Key dates for 2024 US presidential election\n\n\"As Congress prepares for a new five-year reauthorization of the Farm Bill, we strongly urge your committees to address the significant vagueness created in the 2018 Farm Bill, which has led to the proliferation of intoxicating hemp products and challenges for states and localities in addressing the resulting health and safety crisis,\" the letter states. \"The Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 seemed clear in its intentions—reintroducing industrial hemp as an agricultural commodity while maintaining existing federal prohibitions on cannabis products and their use.\n\n\"Nevertheless, bad actors have exploited the 2018 Farm Bill’s definition of hemp, its protection of derivatives, and a misinterpretation of federal preemption against state-level regulation of these products,\" the letter added.\n\nThe new legislation aims to clarify this by explicitly excluding \"intoxicating hemp,\" specifically delta-8 and THCa products.\n\nMore:Is it legal to eat dogs in US? No, Trump made that a law when he signed 2018 Farm Bill\n\nWhat happens if the Farm Bill doesn't pass?\n\nIf Congress fails to authorize a new Farm Bill by the deadline, there is a high likelihood that the current Farm Bill will be extended for another year, with plans to revisit the legislation in 2025. This approach has been common in the past to ensure continuity of support for farmers and related programs.\n\nTypically, a Farm Bill covers a five-year period, but the 2018 Farm Bill has already been in effect for six years. It was implemented two years before the coronavirus pandemic, which significantly impacted the livelihoods of millions and increased the demand for government assistance nationwide.\n\nRegardless of whether an extension is enacted, most commodities from the 2024 crop year will still be covered through their respective marketing years, which extend into the summer or fall of 2025. This means farmers will continue to receive support for crops harvested in 2024, even if new legislation isn’t in place — or if the existing bill does not receive an extension.\n\nHowever, there are some significant concerns still.\n\nFor instance, dairy is the first commodity affected by the new crop year starting Jan. 1; if neither a new Farm Bill nor an extension is in place, dairy farmers could face funding gaps beginning as early as the new year.\n\nAnother concern is the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). If Congress extends the current Farm Bill, CCC funding will likely continue without interruption, allowing farmers to receive the support they need. But if the Farm Bill lapses without an extension, CCC funding could be delayed until 2026, creating financial challenges for growers.\n\nMeanwhile, SNAP benefits are funded through mandatory spending, which is separate from the Farm Bill. This means that even if the Farm Bill is not renewed, SNAP benefits will not be cut off immediately and will continue to operate as usual.\n\nFor the potential changes to hemp production, Texas lawmakers are also considering a ban on delta-8 and THCa products. If the Farm Bill does not pass this year, it’s likely that the state legislature will move to ban these products during the 2025 session regardless.\n\nWhat is in the Farm Bill?\n\nThe Farm Bill is a $1.5 trillion program that consists of a lot more than just crops and livestock. In fact, it affects everyone in one way or another, whether through school lunch and government assistance or support for natural resources, such as our forests.\n\nThe legislation is broken into 12 sections, or titles. Each title addresses different aspects of agriculture and related sectors. Here's a summary of each title:\n\nCommodities: Covers price and income support for farmers producing nonperishable crops, dairy and sugar, along with agricultural disaster assistance. Conservation: Includes programs for natural resource conservation on working lands and land retirement and easement programs. Trade: Covers food export subsidy programs and international food aid. Nutrition: Encompasses SNAP and other nutrition programs to assist low-income Americans, as well as school lunches. Credit: Focuses on federal loan programs to help farmers access financial credit. Rural development: Supports rural economic growth through business and community development, rural housing and infrastructure. Research, extension, and related matters: Funds farm and food research, education and extension programs. Forestry: Addresses forest-specific conservation programs. Energy: Encourages biofuel production, renewable energy installation and energy-related research. Horticulture: Includes farmers market programs, research funding for horticultural crops and organic farming initiatives. Crop insurance: Provides subsidies for crop insurance premiums and supports the development of insurance policies. Miscellaneous: Covers various advocacy and outreach areas such as support for beginning, socially disadvantaged, and veteran farmers; agricultural labor safety; workforce development; and livestock health.\n\nWhat are some of the recommended changes in the drafts for the new Farm Bill?\n\nThere are some fairly significant changes in the initial drafts of the new Farm Bill. Some of the major changes in suggested drafts and their respective chambers:\n\nSNAP cuts (House): The proposal suggests maintaining the Thrifty Food Plan without factoring in inflation adjustments, potentially leading to a reduction of approximately $30 billion in SNAP funding over the next decade. Over time, these cuts would grow, resulting in diminishing adequacy of SNAP benefits.\n\nThe proposal suggests maintaining the Thrifty Food Plan without factoring in inflation adjustments, potentially leading to a reduction of approximately $30 billion in SNAP funding over the next decade.

A Democrat known for his early career as a peanut farmer, Carter was elected a state senator and the governor of Georgia before serving as the nation's 39th president from 1977 to 1981.\n\nWhen he left office, he and his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, founded the Carter Center, a nonprofit promoting democracy and global development. In 2002, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts promoting economic and social development, negotiating peaceful solutions to international conflicts and working on human rights advocacy.\n\nIn 2015, Carter was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to his brain.

George H. W. Bush died at 94 in 2018, Gerald Ford died at 93 in 2006, and Ronald Reagan died at 93 in 2004.\n\nThe country's current president, Joe Biden, also holds an age-related record. At 81, he is the oldest person to serve as commander-in-chief. However, that record could be broken by former President Donald Trump, 78, if he wins this fall.\n\nCasting a ballot for Harris\n\nAs Carter approached his milestone birthday, he told family that he wants to help his fellow Democrats defeat Trump in November.\n\n'Close to his heart':Jimmy Carter’s grandson says his grandfather’s ‘engaged in the news’ as he approaches 100th birthday\n\n“I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” Carter told his son Chip, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nJason Carter spoke during the second night of the Democratic National Convention and confirmed the former president is planning to cast his ballot for Harris.

While each person is different, 3 out of 4 hospice patients spent less than three months in end-of-life care, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.\n\nIn a statement announcing Carter was entering hospice care, the Carter Center said the former president’s family was “grateful for the many expressions of love they have received and the continued respect for their privacy during this time.”\n\nAnd, they added, \"The family is pleased that his decision last year to enter hospice care has sparked so many family discussions across the country on an important subject.\"\n\nWhile approximately 10% of patients spend more than 264 days in hospice, Dr. Tammie Quest, Director of Emory University’s Palliative Care Center in Georgia, said Carter’s situation is not surprising in the eyes of doctors and medical experts.\n\n\"We find that when we can mitigate suffering and support family caregivers who are taking care of patients, that when you add all of those factors together that patients do far better,\" Quest told USA TODAY in February.\n\nRosalynn Carter's legacy\n\nRosalynn and Jimmy Carter were married 77 years, the longest-married couple in presidential history.

Former president to celebrate ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nATLANTA — Jimmy Carter, already the longest-living U.S. president in history, will celebrate his 98th birthday Saturday with family and friends in Plains, the tiny Georgia town where he and his wife, 95-year-old Rosalynn, were born in the years between World War I and the Great Depression.\n\nThe 39th president’s latest milestone comes as The Carter Center, which the Carters established together after their one White House term, marks 40 years of promoting democracy and conflict resolution, monitoring elections, and advancing public health in the developing world.\n\nJason Carter, the former president's grandson now leading the Carter Center board, described his grandfather, an outspoken Christian, as content with his life and legacy.\n\n“He is looking at his 98th birthday with faith in God’s plan for him,” the younger Carter, 47, said, “and that’s just a beautiful blessing for all of us to know, personally, that he is at peace and happy with where he has been and where he’s going.”\n\nCarter Center leaders said the former president, who survived a cancer diagnosis in 2015 and a serious fall at home in 2019, already has enjoyed reading congratulatory messages sent by well-wishers around the world via social media and the center's website. But Jason Carter said his grandfather is mostly looking forward to a simple day that includes watching his favorite Major League Baseball team, the Atlanta Braves, on television.\n\n“He’s still 100% with it, even though daily life things are a lot harder now,” Jason Carter said. “But one thing I guarantee. He will watch all the Braves games this weekend.”\n\nJames Earl Carter Jr. won the 1976 presidential election after beginning the campaign as a little-known one-term Georgia governor. His surprise performance in the Iowa caucuses established the small, Midwestern state as an epicenter of presidential politics. Carter went on to defeat President Gerald Ford in the general election, largely on the strength of sweeping the South before his native region shifted heavily to Republicans.\n\nAre people listening?:Elton John, more stars return to the White House under Biden\n\nA Naval Academy alumnus, Navy officer and peanut farmer, Carter won in no small part because of his promise never to lie to an electorate weary over the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal that resulted in Richard Nixon’s resignation from the presidency in 1974. Four years later, unable to tame inflation and salve voter anger over American hostages held in Iran, Carter lost 44 states to Ronald Reagan. He returned home to Georgia in 1981 at the age of 56.\n\nThe former first couple almost immediately began planning The Carter Center. It opened in Atlanta in 1982 as a first-of-its-kind effort for a former president. The stated mission: to advance peace, human rights and public health causes around the world. Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He traveled internationally into his 80s and 90s, and he did not retire officially from the board until 2020.\n\nSince opening, the center has monitored elections in 113 countries, said CEO Paige Alexander, and Carter has acted individually as a mediator in many countries, as well. Carter Center efforts have nearly eradicated the guinea worm, a parasite spread through unclean drinking water and painful to humans. Rosalynn Carter has steered programs designed to reduce stigma attached to mental health conditions.\n\n“He’s enjoying his retirement,” said Alexander, who assumed her role in 2020, about the time Jason Carter took over for his grandfather. But “he spends a lot of time thinking about the projects that he started and the projects that we’re continuing.”\n\nIan soaks the Carolinas:Ian's death toll likely to grow as crews sift through destruction in Florida: Live updates\n\nAlexander cited the guinea worm eradication effort as a highlight. Carter set the goal in 1986, when there were about 3.5 million cases annually across 21 countries, with a concentration in sub-Saharan Africa. So far this year, Alexander said, there are six known cases in two countries.\n\nIn 2019, Carter used his final annual message at the center to lament that his post-presidency had been largely silent on climate change. Jason Carter said the center's leadership is still exploring ways to combat the climate crisis. But he offered no timetable. “We won't duplicate other effective efforts,” Carter said, explaining that one of the center's strategic principles is to prioritize causes and places that no other advocacy organizations have engaged.\n\nOn elections and democracy, perhaps the most unpredictable turn is that Jimmy Carter has lived to see the center turn its efforts to the home front. The center now has programs to combat mistrust in the democratic process in the United States. Carter Center personnel monitored Georgia's recount of U.S. presidential ballots in the state in 2020 after then-President Donald Trump argued the outcome was rigged. Multiple recounts in Georgia and other states affirmed the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s victory.\n\n“Certainly, we never thought we would end up coming home to do democracy and conflict resolution around our elections,” Jason Carter said. “(But) we couldn’t go be this incredible democracy and human rights organization overseas without ensuring that we were adding our voice and our expertise ... in the U.S.”\n\nAhead of the U.S. midterm elections, the center has asked candidates -- regardless of party -- to sign onto a set of fair election principles, including committing to the peaceful transfer of power. Among those who have signed commitments: Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams.\n\nCarter himself has mostly retreated from politics. For years after his 1980 defeat, Democrats steered clear of him. He enjoyed a resurgence in recent election cycles, drawing visits from several 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls and, in 2021, from President Joe Biden, who in 1976 was the first U.S. senator to endorse Carter’s presidential bid. With inflation now at its highest levels since the late 1970s and early 1980s, some Republicans are bringing up Carter again as an attack line on Biden and Democrats.\n\nJason Carter said the former president reads and watches the news daily, and sometimes accepts calls or visits from political figures. But, he added, the former president isn’t expected to appear publicly to endorse any candidates ahead of November.\n\n“His people that he feels sort of the closest connection with now are the folks in Plains, at his church and other places,” Jason Carter said. “But, you know, his partner No. 1, 2 and 3 is my grandma, right? He has outlived friends and so many of his advisers and the people that he accomplished so much with in the past, but they’ve never been lonely because they’ve always had each other.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/01/former-president-jimmy-carter-celebrates-96th-birthday/5877397002/", "title": "Former President Jimmy Carter celebrates 96th birthday", "text": "ATLANTA — Former President Jimmy Carter marks his 96th birthday Thursday, the latest milestone for the longest lived of the 44 men to hold the highest American office.\n\nCarter planned to celebrate at his home in Plains, Georgia, with his wife of 74 years, Rosalynn Carter, according to a spokeswoman for the Carter Center in Atlanta.\n\nThe 39th president, in office from 1977-81, has largely receded from public view amid the coronavirus pandemic and his own health challenges due to a series of falls in 2019. He previously survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015. Yet Carter remains a quiet force in politics at home and, through his post-presidential Center, in public health and human rights advocacy around the world.\n\nCarter on Tuesday endorsed his fellow Democrat, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, in one of two competitive Georgia U.S. Senate races this fall. Carter’s announcement aligned him with another former president, Barack Obama, and other party power brokers in backing Warnock over Democrat Matt Lieberman, whose father was the party’s 2000 nominee for vice president.\n\nThough Carter remained neutral in Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary he fielded calls and visits from multiple candidates. Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, now 93, recorded audio addresses for Democrats’ virtual national convention urging the election of nominee Joe Biden, who was a young senator from Delaware when Jimmy Carter won the presidency in 1976.\n\n'He was a kindred spirit':Bob Dylan talks friendship with Jimmy Carter in 'Rock & Roll President' documentary\n\n“Joe Biden was my first and most effective supporter in the Senate,” Carter told the convention. “For decades, he’s been my loyal and dedicated friend.”\n\nCarter also gained new attention recently upon death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Carter is the only president since 1850 not to make a single Supreme Court nomination, but he reshaped the lower courts with a record number of nominations of women and non-white jurists, Ginsburg being the most notable.\n\nIn 1980, Carter tapped Ginsburg, then the nation’s most accomplished civil rights attorney, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, considered the nation’s second highest court. She was the second woman Carter nominated for the D.C. Circuit, setting her up for a promotion to Supreme Court 13 years later.\n\n“He looked around at the federal judiciary and he said, ‘You all look like me, but that’s not how the great United States looks,’” Ginsburg said to a Fordham University Law School forum in 2016.\n\nPerhaps most notable among Carter’s 2020 election maneuvering is the Carter Center for the first time designating the United States as a “backsliding” democracy. The Center announced after the Democratic convention that it would devote resources to ensuring free and fair U.S. elections this fall. The Carters founded the Center in 1982, two years after he lost his re-election bid to Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter:Longest-married presidential couple celebrate 74th anniversary\n\nThe Center has monitored more than 110 elections in 39 countries since 1989, but it was a striking development for the institution to turn its focus to Carter’s home country, the world’s leading democratic superpower since World War II. The development comes as President Donald Trump repeatedly casts doubt on the integrity of the U.S. voting system, regularly firing off a cascade of mistruths about the voting process and asserting that the system is “rigged” against him.\n\nAs recently as a Tuesday night debate against Biden, Trump refused to say he’d accept the results and said he’d urged his supporters “to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen.”\n\nExplaining the decision to monitor a U.S. election, a Carter Center statement said “backsliding” democracies are “often characterized by polarization, a lack of public trust, ethnic or racial divisions and injustice, and fears that election results won’t be seen as credible or could trigger violence.”\n\nCarter has not recently addressed Trump’s statements directly and, according to a spokeswoman, is not granting interviews ahead of the election. But Carter said last September during his last annual town hall at the Carter Center that it would “be a disaster to have four more years of Trump.”\n\nMore:Jimmy Carter's pastor picked to lead Trump's prisoner reentry effort\n\nSiding with Biden over Trump isn’t surprising for a Democratic former president, but it does involve Carter ignoring one of his own recent observations about the presidency. Weeks before his 95th birthday last year, Carter alluded to the advanced ages of several candidates at the time. Trump, 74, would be the oldest president ever inaugurated for a second term. Biden, 77, would the oldest sitting president in history, reaching 82 near the end of a prospective first term.\n\n“I hope there’s an age limit,” Carter said jovially at his town hall when asked whether he’d run again. Then he turned more serious: “If I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don’t believe I could undertake the duties I experienced when I was president.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/27/jimmy-carter-99th-birthday-celebrations-moved-government-shutdown/70983598007/", "title": "Government shutdown: Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday celebrations ...", "text": "Former president Jimmy Carter's 99th birthday has been moved from Sunday, Oct. 1 to Saturday, Sept. 30., amid the possibility of a government shutdown later this week.\n\nThe Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum in Atlanta announced Tuesday that the former president's birthday celebration has been moved to Saturday instead of Sunday, the day of his actual birthday.\n\n“We want to make sure we are celebrating regardless of what Congress does,” Tony Clark, the site’s public affairs director told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nLike other federal agencies and services that officials do not deem \"essential,\" the library and museum will pause operations starting Sunday if Congress doesn’t reach an agreement this week to avert a federal government shutdown.\n\nHowever, if the shutdown does not go through, the museum will have another round of festivities for visitors on Sunday, Clark told the AJC.\n\nThe possible government shutdown could also affect Carter's birthday celebration plans in his hometown of Plains, approximately 160 miles south of Atlanta.

Flotus/Instagram\n\n“A perfect birthday celebration filled with so much love – and Joe’s favorite coconut cake!” she wrote.\n\nMembers of Biden’s family already in town celebrating his granddaughter’s wedding at the White House on Saturday attended the brunch.\n\nThe wedding’s timing, two people familiar with the planning had told CNN, was not a coincidence – noting the “age issue” is never something Biden wants to highlight.\n\nThe president has political momentum on his side ahead of a potential reelection bid – having been able to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate and thwart the historical political tides of a resounding Republican wave in Congress. There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out. On the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, Nancy Pelosi, 82, recently announced plans to step down as House speaker, celebrating Democrats ushering in a new generation of leadership. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 80, faced his first challenger to lead the Republican conference in 15 years – though that challenge was unsuccessful.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/10/30/former-student-teacher-happy-100th-birthday/813825001/", "title": "Former student to teacher: Happy 100th birthday!", "text": "Today is a favorite day for Lillian Carter.\n\nNot because it's Halloween.\n\nIt's her birthday.\n\nToday, she turns 100.\n\nState Rep.

He still has a note that she wrote to him after his junior year at Abilene High.\n\nHe had been elected Student Council president and had attended a workshop at Southern Methodist University with other student leaders. Lambert won an award at the event, and a story appeared in the Reporter-News.\n\nCarter, in turn, sent this hand-written note to him, dated July 19, 1970:\n\n\"Dear Stan,\n\n'Thank you' for being the outstanding leader that you are!

The couple has known each other their entire lives – Carter's sister Ruth was Rosalynn's best friend.\n\n\"I’d known Rosalynn since the day she was born, because we were next-door neighbors,\" Carter said in Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue's book \"What Makes A Marriage Last,\" which published in May.\n\nThe feeling was mutual. Rosalynn admitted, \"I always said I fell in love with a photograph of him on (Ruth’s) bedroom wall.\"\n\nCarter said he \"just felt compatible\" with Rosalynn. He explained, \"She was beautiful and innocent, and there was a resonance. We rode in the rumble seat of a Ford pickup – Ruth and her boyfriend in the front – and I kissed her on that first date.

Their debut LP \"Down to the River\" will be released in the summer.\n\n\"It's good to see those guys together,\" Betts says. \"I suggested they get together years ago but they wanted to do individual things and I think they sound wonderful together. Berry Oakley Jr. is fantastic with them. It's important to have strong partners and I think they're going to do very well.\"\n\nThere's also the June release of the new live CD/DVD \"Rambling Man: The Dickey Betts Band Live at the St George Theater\" featuring Dickey and son Duane performing Betts classics like the title track, \"Blue Sky\" and \"Jessica.\" Devon Allman makes a guest appearance, too, to sing his dad Gregg Allman's song \"Midnight Rider.\"\n\nBetts, who turned 75 in December, says he's feeling OK today. It's been an eventful past year, to say the least. He started touring again last spring with his Dickey Betts Band. Then, an accident occurred here in September that required brain surgery.\n\n\"Two weeks before I went on the road I had a stroke. It was a mild stroke, thank God, but it did impair my right hand some,\" Betts says. \"I went and did those shows and then about halfway through those I was washing my Labrador and she yanked me into the steps trying to get back in the house. I had to have brain surgery so I had to cancel my remaining dates. I don't know if I'm even going to go back out this year. It's not very exciting but it's the truth.\"\n\nLater, though, Betts says, \"I don't count my band completely out.\"\n\nAnyone familiar with the man's life and career knows better than to ever count out Dickey Betts.\n\nMARCH 26, 1969\n\nDuane and sibling Gregg Allman grew up in Daytona while the Betts family has ties to Sarasota-Bradenton dating back to about the time of the Civil War.\n\nAfter years of playing in various bands in many of the same Florida clubs, the Allman Brothers Band came together in Jacksonville with guitarists Duane Allman and Dickey Betts jamming with bassist Berry Oakley and drummers Jai Johanny Johanson (later known as Jaimoe) and Butch Trucks.\n\nBetts remembers how he and the rest of the musicians pleaded with Duane to get Gregg, who was in California at the time, in their new band.\n\n“Yeah, Duane and his brother were having an argument and Duane didn’t want Gregg,” Betts recalls. “We had five of us, and Duane was singing and there was me singing and Berry Oakley singing but we were guitar players; we weren’t really singers. We knew Gregg and we kept trying to get Duane to call him.\n\n“We finally talked Duane into calling Gregg one night and when he came down I think we were in the middle of ‘Don’t Want You No More,’ the instrumental version we did of the Spencer Davis Group song. Gregg walked in on that and he was saying, ‘God, what a band!’ He was just really blown away, which made us all proud. We were real glad to see Gregg.”\n\nGregg Allman sang the band’s arrangement of “Trouble No More,” pretty much exactly as they would on record and then in concert for decades, on March 26, 1969, the birth date of the Allman Brothers Band.\n\n'DREAMS'\n\nFollowing the release of their landmark 1971 live album \"At Fillmore East,\" lead guitarist Duane Allman and then bassist Oakley died in separate motorcycle accidents. The Allman Brothers' ’73 LP \"Brothers and Sisters\" featured the No. 1 hit \"Ramblin'\" Man\" and propelled the band to superstardom but then they split several years later. The Allman Brothers Band reformed in ’78 and then broke up again in ’82.\n\nAfter spending the better part of the 1980s living in the Sarasota area while relegated to playing clubs and bars with their respective solo groups, Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts did it: They resurrected The Allman Brothers Band — again.\n\nThe bestselling 1989 \"Dreams\" box set and subsequent albums of new material starting with \"Seven Turns\" put the Allman Brothers back on top.\n\nBy the early 1990s, they were headlining 10,000- and 20,000-capacity venues across the country.\n\nOlder songs played regularly on classic rock radio while new singles including “Good Clean Fun,” \"End of the Line\" and \"No One to Run With\" were heard on mainstream rock stations with their music videos appearing on MTV. In ’95, the Allman Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\"We had some real tragedies losing Duane and losing Berry Oakley and we had to keep the band together, had to keep it effective, and viable through all that period,\" Betts says. \"We took off the (1980s) and Gregg and I put our little bands together and played clubs. After we got back together a lot of writers from Rolling Stone and stuff were calling us dinosaurs and making fun of bands like us and wondering if we could still play and we were determined. It gave us more drive and we showed we weren't done yet. We made some of our best records and I think that helped put us in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nThe Allman Brothers’ summer tours of the era were family affairs with Betts initiating a tradition of bringing their sons on stage.\n\nBerry Duane Oakley, who's slightly older than Devon Allman and a few years older than Duane Betts, made his debut with the Allman Brothers Band on Aug. 11, 1989, at Shoreline Amphitheater near San Francisco.\n\n\"I was only 17 at the time and the only kid without a dad and Dickey and (his wife) Donna brought me on the road,\" Oakley says from his home in Venice. \"There, at that particular show, Dickey goes, 'By the way, you're sitting in with us.' He took me backstage and showed me the chords to 'Southbound.' I had my bass for jamming at the hotel but had no idea I'd be sitting in. I think my mom still has the press clipping.\"\n\nA few years later, Duane Betts' teen peers watched him on MTV when he joined the Allman Brothers Band during their triumphant performance at Woodstock ’94. Dickey would continue to encourage Duane the rest of his career, which includes the release last year of his acclaimed debut solo EP \"Sketches of American Music.\"\n\n\"He’s always just told me to 'keep playing guitar,'\" Duane says of his famous father, who raised him in Sarasota. “'Keep playing that guitar and you’ll be OK.' He was always reassuring to my trepidation about how it will all work out in the end, and everything has really turned out the way I dreamed.\"\n\nAt one Allman Brothers show in the 1990s, Betts crouches behind his stack of Marshall amplifiers during a drum solo. He spots Devon Allman watching from the side of the stage and motions over to him.\n\nDevon asks if can get him anything. Betts points to the cheering crowd and tells Devon to look out there.\n\n“Someday that’s going to be you and Duane’s crowd,” Betts says.\n\nIt's a fond memory of Devon's.\n\n\"At the time I was in my early 20s and really just trying to scratch and claw my way into a career and into a sense of comfortability with the genre that I would land in,\" says Devon, whose latest solo album \"Ride or Die\" debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Blues Albums chart. \"I was focused as a musician but I didn't have much focus on the type of music I wanted to play so that hit me really hard but I kind of let it drop away because I had so much work to do to become someone who could make records and tour the world. Those words that Dickey had said to me came back around and reverberated stronger when I started touring with Duane. Dickey was really sweet and he was kind of telling the future there.\"\n\nALLMAN BETTS BAND\n\nThe Allman Betts Band — featuring Devon Allman and Duane Betts on lead guitars and vocals with Berry Oakley Jr. on bass — will kick off its inaugural world tour at The Brooklyn Bowl in New York City on Wednesday. The shows will feature new music from the upcoming debut album “Down to the River,” recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, as well as classic Allman Brothers songs in honor of the band’s 50th anniversary.\n\n\"When my dad passed and, at the same time Dickey had retired, Duane and I came together and just realized it would be weird if we didn't play a few of their songs,\" Devon Allman says from his St. Louis area home. \"It's amazing to see grown men burst into tears after hearing the opening of 'Blue Sky' or 'Midnight Rider.'\n\n\"That music is going to live on and it’s humbling, and we're as serious as we can be to do our part to put our music into that same well. We’re comfortable and honored to play our fathers' music and keep it alive but we must also stay vital and stay real to ourselves. It's really about striking that balance.\"\n\nIt's a special bond shared by Devon, Duane and Berry, who have known each other since meeting as kids 30 years ago on the road with the Allman Brothers Band.\n\n\"There's a closeness there due to the legacies, for sure,\" Devon says. \"We can totally understand each other because we have famous fathers, fathers who were musicians who got famous together for the right reasons: because they did really, really great work. And we know what that body of work means to the fans.\"\n\nAFTER THE ALLMAN BROS.\n\nIn 2000, Betts left the Allman Brothers Band in a much-publicized split after reportedly being told by fax to \"get clean.\" The Allman Brothers continued touring for another 14 years but only released one more studio album. Betts also released another studio album of new material and toured with his Great Southern group, which would feature his son Duane sharing lead guitar duties with him. Dickey Betts decided to retire in 2014 following a hometown charity show here at Robarts Arena that took place shortly after the Allman Brothers Band's final gig.\n\nIn January 2017, Butch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A few months later, Gregg Allman died due to complications from liver cancer.\n\nGregg Allman kept his health problems private but Dickey Betts had been informed and recalls calling him quite a bit during those last months when Allman was frequently in and out of the hospital. Betts has praised Gregg as the best white blues singer and as having a \"golden voice.\" When they spoke, though, Betts couldn't help but be saddened to hear that great voice reduced to a whisper.\n\n\"I was trying to make him feel good and tell him how much he was loved and respected,\" Betts says. \"I would just call and try to make his day a little better.\"\n\nDickey and Duane Betts were with Devon Allman, Berry Oakley Jr. and many more members of the extended Allman Brothers family at Gregg Allman's funeral in Macon, Georgia, where the Allman Brothers were based in the early 1970s. Former President Jimmy Carter, whose election the Allman Brothers Band boosted, attended the private ceremony along with Allman's ex-wife Cher. Gregg Allman was buried near his brother, Duane, and bandmate Berry Oakley.\n\nBetts told a reporter from Rolling Stone he was retired for a story that ran in November of 2017 but soon changed his mind. On his birthday, Dec., 12, 2017, after about a four-year hiatus from performing, Dickey Betts announced he would play select dates in 2018.\n\n“Everywhere I go fans keep saying they want me to get out and play again,” Betts said at the time. “I think the time is right.”\n\nDICKEY BETTS BAND\n\nThe new Dickey Betts Band made its debut last May at White Buffalo Saloon a few miles from Betts' home and in July played the historic St. George Theatre in New York City with the cameras rolling for the upcoming CD/DVD \"Ramblin' Man.\"\n\n\"That was a really special night with a really cool kind of vibe,\" Duane Betts says. \"We were starting to really get into a groove and there was a great exchange between the crowd and the band and Dad. I'm real proud of my dad and the band. He hadn't been playing for four years and so it was a challenge to get everyone in shape but we hit our stride there by the end of the run.\"\n\nAnd then there was the accident at the Betts home, followed by a huge outpouring of support from fans all over the world as Dickey went into surgery.\n\n\"I wasn't worried about it too much; everybody else was, of course, but I was too loaded on Propofol there for about four or five days,\" Betts says with a chuckle. \"From that stroke, I was taking blood thinners so they had to put me in an induced coma. I was just in a dream world, thought I was in a cowboy movie, and when I came to I was just glad to be awake and see somebody.\n\n\"I didn't know that I had so many friends that were praying for me and helping me,\" Betts continues, now somber. \"It made me feel good to still be alive. The fall was more serious than I had realized. It was pretty damn serious because they couldn't stop the bleeding because of the blood thinners I was on after the stroke.\"\n\nDuring a New Year’s Eve show by the Devon Allman Project featuring Duane Betts with special guest Berry Oakley Jr. at the Grand Opera House in in Macon, Dickey Betts sat right in front of Oakley's amplifier and took it all in. Then, after the clock struck midnight, Betts stepped onto the stage to play guitar on his revered instrumental \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.\" \"It's just such an honor and a privilege to be on stage with him,\" says Devon, who makes a memorable appearance on the upcoming Dickey Betts Band CD/DVD.\n\n\"You know, Dickey was the first one to invite me onto the Allman Brothers' stage,\" Devon says. \"He heard me sing backstage and was like, 'Man, I didn't know you had pipes like that.' He was always very supportive and, yeah, the first one to invite me on the Allman Brothers stage, even before my dad, which was pretty mind-blowing.\n\n\"It's an amazing thing to look over and see Dickey and to make music alongside one of your heroes. I certainly have heroes within the Allman Brothers but then heroes in many, many other bands. I've been lucky to play with Billy Gibbons and Charlie Daniels and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Les Paul but Dickey Betts, obviously, is the closest to home, so that's an amazing feeling.\"\n\nWhile Dickey picks up the guitar occasionally, his only appearance on a public stage since the accident has been the one on New Year's Eve. He has no concert dates booked for 2019.\n\n\"I want to do it because I miss what I call my friends, my fans, but on the other hand, I don't think I put on the show I used to,\" Betts says. \"I'm told no one expects you to do what you did when you were younger but I don't know. I guess there’s always a chance I’ll go back out.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/02/05/kirk-douglas-hollywood-icon-and-former-palm-springs-resident-dies-103/4673953002/", "title": "Kirk Douglas, Hollywood icon and former Palm Springs resident ...", "text": "Iconic Hollywood actor, producer and director Kirk Douglas died Wednesday at age 103.\n\n\"It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103,\" son Michael Douglas said on his Facebook page. \"To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\n\n\"But to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine (Zeta-Jones), a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband.\"\n\nKnown for films \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\" \"Seven Days in May\" and \"Spartacus,\" Douglas received many honors throughout his lifetime such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Jimmy Carter in 1981, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1991 and the National Medal of Arts Award from President George Bush in 2002.\n\nHe received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005.\n\nHe liked to refer to himself as “the ragman’s son,” but to most people the cleft-chinned Douglas was the epitome of an old-fashioned movie star. The chiseled-featured actor with the winning smile left a legacy of dignity, grace and talent in the wake of his death.\n\nDouglas thrived despite a severe stroke in 1996 at aged 85, which severely affected his ability to speak. He continued to be a vibrant Hollywood voice – flirting with Anne Hathaway during the 2011 Oscars as well as continuing to write books.\n\nHe was married to his second wife, Anne, for more than 60 years. “She was the most difficult woman I ever met,” Douglas told USA TODAY in April 2017, with Anne chuckling by his side. (She famously turned the A-lister down for dinner when they first met, preferring to go home and make herself scrambled eggs.)\n\nIt was the German-born Belgian Anne who inspired a lifetime of art collecting, and who also helped clean up Douglas’ messy finances after they met in 1953.\n\n“I think romance begins at 80,” he told USA TODAY. “And I ought to know, because I live with a girl who would tell you so! ... I send her a note, and put it on her pillow. She likes that.\"\n\nDuring their four decades in Palm Springs, Douglas and Anne were a formidable team. They had two sons in addition to Douglas' children from an earlier marriage, and Anne became president of Douglas' production company at a time when women were mainly playing housewives on television. Anne, 100, also heads the family foundation, which has donated funds to sustain hospitals, theaters and playgrounds around the world, to name a few of their philanthropic endeavors.\n\n“The City of Palm Springs is saddened to learn of the passing of one of our most famous part-time residents Kirk Douglas, a legend of the silver screen who helped put Palm Springs on the international stage,” Palm Springs Mayor Geoff Kors said in a prepared statement. “On behalf of the citizens of Palm Springs, we send our deepest condolences to Kirk’s wife Anne and the entire Douglas family.”\n\nDouglas and Anne co-chaired the first Desert AIDS Walk in Palm Springs with former First Lady Betty Ford in 1989, raising $25,000.\n\n\"We loved Palm Springs and would have stayed forever if the grandchildren weren’t in Montecito,\" Anne told The Desert Sun in 2017.\n\nIn August 2012, the rugged star of 1960’s \"Spartacus\" was able to see a restored version of the classic film, 42 years after it was originally released in theaters. But he was alone on the stage to talk about the film, having outlived his Hollywood contemporaries.\n\n“If you die young, you have a chance to be a hero,” he told USA TODAY at the time. “If you die of old age, most of us are forgotten.\"\n\nHe was wrong on that point. The acting legend was never forgotten. During a photo shoot for Paramount studio’s 100th anniversary, Douglas was one of the most sought-after stars in a galaxy that included everyone from George Clooney to Justin Bieber.\n\n“Everybody came by to pay respects,” Douglas said. “I felt like a king.”\n\nClooney would go on to write the forword to Douglas’ 2012 book \"I Am Spartacus! Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist,\" where he described his role in overcoming the dreaded communist blacklist of his era.\n\n“Kirk Douglas is many things. A movie star. An actor. A producer,” Clooney wrote. “But he is, first and foremost, a man of extraordinary character … the kind we always look for at our darkest hour.”\n\nDouglas’ 1988 autobiography, \"The Ragman’s Son\" (referring to his Russian-Jewish ancestry) attests to his lean early years growing up in a New York ghetto, the son of illiterate Russian immigrants. Born Issur Danielovitch Demsky in 1916, he nearly drowned at 5. It was one of a few close calls the actor had over the years; in 1991, a helicopter he was riding in crashed into a small plane. He suffered a compressed spine.\n\nBut Douglas laughed easily when he spoke of death, attributing his easy sense of humor to his mother, whom he quoted on the subject of dying: “Don’t be afraid. It happens to everyone.”\n\nThough best known as an actor, Douglas wrote 12 books, including 2002's \"A Stroke of Luck,\" in which he chronicled how he beat depression after suffering a stroke and found salvation in his wife, Anne, his family, and in returning to work.\n\nHe said he wrote it hoping to help other stroke survivors. “Maybe it will help others to deal with depression,” he said. After his stroke, with his characteristic trademark self-deprecating humor, he wrote: “All I could do was babble like a baby, but I worked hard with my speech therapist and in a few months I could talk as well as my three-year-old granddaughter, Kelsey.”\n\nWriting the book clearly had a cathartic effect on Douglas. The following year he starred in one of his final films, \"It Runs in the Family,\" a story of a dysfunctional family living in New York. The title might also have referred to the acting bug. The movie starred Douglas, his actor-producer son, Michael, his grandson Cameron and his ex-wife, Diana Dill Douglas, who died in 2015 at the age of 92.\n\nIn \"A Stroke of Luck,\" Douglas writes “I have been so lucky to be an actor. It has given me fame, money and satisfaction.”\n\nHis ascension up the Hollywood ranks came after his athletic college years at St. Lawrence University, where he was a wrestling champion. Following his graduation, Douglas won an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. His first stop was Broadway, followed by a stint in the Navy during World War II. After the war, he returned to the theater and also performed in radio plays. He married Dill in 1943, with whom he had two sons, Michael and Joel.\n\nThey were divorced in 1951 and he married the Belgian-born Anne Buydens in 1954, with whom he had two more sons, Peter and Eric. Eric died in 2004.\n\nDouglas’ movie career began after fellow classmate Lauren Bacall urged producer Hal Wallis to give Douglas a screen test. The test went so well that he was cast in the lead role in 1946's \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.\" After receiving a host of kudos for that performance, he went on to make \"I Walk Alone\" with another future screen legend, Burt Lancaster. Their chemistry was so potent that they made seven films together, including the western \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" (1957) and the political thriller \"Seven Days in May\" (1964). Their last collaboration was in the gangster comedy \"Tough Guys\" in 1986.\n\nThough they were good pals, Douglas joked at one point: “I’ve finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I’ve got nice-looking girls in my films now.”\n\nHis busiest decades were the ’50s and ’60s. Douglas was nominated for an Oscar in 1952 for \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" and again in 1957 for his portrayal of Van Gogh in \"Lust for Life.\" In the following few years he would take on his pivotal roles, as Colonel Dax in the anti-war epic \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) and as the leader of the Roman Empire in \"Spartacus\" (1960).\n\nDouglas executive-produced \"Spartacus\" and detailed in his 2011 book, \"I am Spartacus,\" how he was instrumental in breaking the Hollywood blacklist by insisting blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo be given the proper credit for his screenplay. It was an experience detailed in the 2015 film \"Trumbo,\" starring Bryan Cranston.\n\n\"When I hired Dalton Trumbo to write \"Spartacus\" under the pseudonym Sam Jackson, we all had been employing the blacklisted writers,” wrote Douglas in \"I am Spartacus.\" “It was an open secret and an act of hypocrisy, as well as a way to get the best talent at bargain prices. I hated being part of such a system.\"\n\nHe remained busy in the 1960s, starring in a host of films including \"Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962) in which he played an outlaw cowboy in a contemporary setting, a part he said he considers his best performance, and co-starred with John Wayne in the World War II drama \"In Harm’s Way\" (1965) and in the comedy/western \"The War Wagon\" (1967).\n\nThe Palm Springs home that once belonged to Douglas was awarded historic status last month by the Palm Springs City Council. Built in the early 1950s on West Via Lola in the Old Las Palmas neighborhood, the home was owned and occupied by Douglas from 1959 to 1999.\n\n\"I was called the Mayor of Via Lola,\" Douglas told The Desert Sun in 2017. \"There were no sewer lines, and I self-appointed myself to work with the mayor and the city officials to get them put in. I also campaigned to get rid of the ugly poles which provided our telephone, TV and electricity but marred the look of the street. I raised $4,000 from each house to get them put underground and improve the area.\"\n\nAirport Road in Palm Springs was renamed Kirk Douglas Way in 2004, according to a Desert Sun column by Tracy Conrad of the Palm Springs Historical Society.\n\nAnne told The Desert Sun in 2017 that Joel still lived in the desert and \"makes sure that Kirk Douglas Way has no potholes!\"\n\nDouglas had his share of missteps. He starred in a couple of bombs, including the loopy western \"The Villain\" (1979) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and \"Saturn 3\" (1980) with Farrah Fawcett.\n\n\"I have made almost 90 pictures,\" Douglas said. \"Lots of them are bad. Fortunately, I forget the bad pictures.\"\n\nDouglas remained a staunch Luddite as he got older. “Technology frightens me. I don't have a cellphone. I don't even have a watch,\" Douglas told USA TODAY in 2015. \"My wife insisted on buying me a computer. I know nothing about computers. But one thing: I love having a place to play solitaire. I play all the time.\"\n\nOn his 100th birthday, Anne gifted him his first iPad, and the milestone was celebrated with a starry bash in Beverly Hills, with Steven Spielberg and Don Rickles among the guests present.\n\nIn 2017, the couple released their first book with longtime publicist and friend Marcia Newberger, titled “Kirk and Anne: Letters of Love, Laughter and a Lifetime in Hollywood.” It is based on a cache of love letters Anne saved since they met in France.\n\nDouglas was also known for his humanitarian work and was a goodwill ambassador for the U.S. State Department since 1963. Nearly two decades later he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French bestowed him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. He dedicated a Tel Aviv playground in honor of Yitzhak Rabin, then prime minister of Israel.\n\nBut he didn’t play favorites. Douglas was also a friend of King Hussein of Jordan.\n\nCloser to home, he rehabilitated dilapidated playgrounds in inner-city Los Angeles and raised $2 million for the Alzheimer’s wing at the hospital for retired Motion Picture Academy workers. It was named Harry’s Haven, after Douglas’ father. “Somebody complained that that made it sound like a saloon,” he said. “That would have made my father very happy, because he used to spend a lot of time in saloons.”\n\nAt age 99, he and Anne donated an additional $15 million toward an Alzheimer’s care center, bringing their total donations to the Motion Picture & Television Fund to $40 million.\n\nAt 100, he reflected on his charitable efforts. “I have given most of my money away because that pleases me,” he told Variety. “I was born a poor boy. My mother and father came from Russia; I don’t think they could have gotten into the country today. So I have a lot to be thankful for.”\n\nPerhaps it was this sensitivity to those in need that informed his nuanced performances. He once said: “When I play a strong character in a movie, I search for some weakness, and when I play a weak character, I search for some strength.” Whether playing good guys or bad, he was always convincing and his portrayals consistently powerful.\n\nA devout Jew, after his stroke, Douglas studied the Bible and began to read in depth about Judaism. Though he had celebrated his bar mitzvah at the traditional age of 13, he decided to celebrate it again at 83.\n\nHe had learned to read Hebrew as a child. “But I never understood what I was saying,” said Douglas, who also spoke German and French.\n\nIn \"Stroke of Luck,\" Douglas urged readers to seek out prayer.\n\n“Pray, however you perceive that higher power to be. Pray, it will help you,” he wrote, adding that on the Sabbath he prayed over candles in antique candlesticks his mother brought over from Russia. “In doing that, I am reminded of my mother, I feel closer to God, to my family and I have increased The Light, even if only for a moment.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael wrote in his tribute that his father's \"life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet.\"\n\nMichael closed his post \"with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad- I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\"\n\nDesert Sun reporter Brian Blueskye covers arts and entertainment. He can be reached at brian.blueskye@desertsun.com or (760) 778-4617.

In northern Maine, just 10% of the sun will be blocked by the moon, while San Diego will see about 70% of the sun blocked.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University astronomer Eric Vandernoot, a veteran eclipse watcher, is less excited about Saturday's celestial show than the total solar eclipse in 2017 and the upcoming total solar eclipse in April 2024.\n\nStill, he will be hosting an event at the FAU observatory, 777 Glades Road, building 43, from noon to 3 p.m. He will have solar eclipse sunglasses to give out and there will be telescopes with special filters to watch the event.\n\n\"I would recommend coming here so you can look at it safely,\" Vandernoot said. \"I don't want people staring at the sun in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n“Dear God, go away!”:A cloud covered the eclipse, then something amazing happened\n\nDon't look at Saturday's partial eclipse without special protective glasses\n\nIt is not safe to watch the event without special protective eclipse glasses. Even sunglasses won’t keep out damaging rays that can burn a hole through the retina.\n\nVandernoot said glasses left over from the August 2017 total solar eclipse probably are no longer viable protection.\n\nThe Cox Science Center & Aquarium, in West Palm Beach, will be hosting a livestream event in its lobby for the eclipse beginning around 11 a.m. and will have astronomers available to answer questions. The telescope will not be open for viewing.\n\nBecause South Florida will only see a partial eclipse, Vandernoot said people are unlikely to notice the event if they don’t know to look for it.\n\n“There won’t be any change in light levels,” he said. “But if you happen to walk outside and go under the shadow of a tree, the light passing through the gaps of leaves will leave the projection of a crescent sun on the ground.”\n\nIt’s the same concept as creating a making a pinhole viewer that projects an image of the eclipse onto the ground. You can also simply hold up both hands with fingers overlapping at right angles to create the equivalent of pin holes.\n\nWilliam Cooke, who leads NASA’s Meteoroid Environments Office, said Saturday’s eclipse is the most notable solar eclipse in the United States since Aug. 21, 2017 when the moon covered the sun completely in a path from Newport, Oregon, to Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn South Florida, about 80% of the sun was covered during the 2017 event.\n\nBefore that, the last total solar eclipse viewed in the United States was in February 1979, but it crossed only six states in the northwestern part of the country.\n\nThe next total solar eclipse is on April 8, 2024 and will cross the United States from Texas to Maine and up through Canada.\n\nCooke called Saturday’s event the \"warm-up act\" for 2024.\n\n“If you are in the path of annularity, there will be a nice ‘ring of fire’ at maximum eclipse,” Cooke said in an email. “That’s pretty cool.”\n\nEugene, Oregon is in the direct path and will see the moon cover the center of the sun for four minutes. Eugene was just south of the path of totality in 2017.\n\nA deadline set by unforgiving boss:Pilgrims flock to path of totality for Great American Eclipse of 2017\n\nThe reason only the sun's center is covered by the moon is because the moon is at apogee to the Earth, meaning it's farther away. That allows the edges of the sun to leak around the edge, creating the ring of fire.\n\n“This one isn’t full but it’s still pretty awesome in terms of near totality and the ring of fire,” said Andy Vobora, vice president of stakeholder relations with the Travel Lane County tourism service, which includes Eugene. “Hopefully we get a clear day.”\n\nIn South Florida, the forecast for Saturday is for mostly sunny skies, but also a 40% chance of rain.\n\nKimberly Miller is a veteran journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

For the latest on recovery efforts, view our live updates file for Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − President Joe Biden is sure to get a first-hand look at the devastation is Asheville when he visits North Carolina on Wednesday as part of his tour of the Southeastern states ravaged by Hurricane Helene, which caused more than 100 deaths and left nearly 1.6 million customers without power as of Monday evening.\n\nBiden is less likely to see communities like Lake Lure and neighboring Chimney Rock, not only because they're more than 30 miles away and much smaller, but because they're barely there anymore.\n\nChimney Rock was largely submerged, its buildings swept away by the water and their debris blocking entry points into the village of 140 residents, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported.\n\n“What was once a town is now a river,'' said Tracey Stevens, who worked at the Chimney Rock brewery, now also wiped away. \"It’s beyond anything I can imagine.”\n\nLake Lure, a resort town of 1,400 people, also took a severe blow from the storm, which destroyed the town hall, police station and pier while washing away businesses.\n\nThe scene is not much prettier in normally picturesque Asheville, county seat of Buncombe County, or for that matter in much of the Southeast. Hundreds of water rescues have taken place across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia since Helene's brutal landfall in Florida's Big Bend region late Thursday.\n\nAtlanta totaled more than 11 inches of rain in 48 hours, smashing a record that stood for almost 150 years. Western North Carolina took the brunt of the devastating rains, and more than 30 inches was recorded in some areas. Houses floated away from subdivisions, bridges crumbled, and semi-trucks were tossed into mangled piles. Mud, tree branches and food from local grocery stores flowed into the streets. The Associated Press reported at least 133 people have died because of Helene.\n\nForty of those fatalities have been confirmed in Buncombe County, County Manager Avril Pinder said in a Monday afternoon briefing, raising the total in North Carolina to nearly 50. Officials have received about 600 missing persons reports, although many are expected to be resolved when communications are restored.\n\n\"We don't have water and we do not have power across most of the county,\" Pinder said. \"The roads are still incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSome supplies were being airlifted because ground transportation was limited with so many damaged roads, and the county planned to begin distributing food and water Monday.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen from the National Guard. More than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets and high-water response vehicles, were feverishly working to save lives.\n\nOn the ground:How flood damage is cutting off North Carolina communities from emergency relief\n\nHurricanes, tornadoes, snow and heat: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter for more weather news and analysis.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ AccuWeather has increased its estimate of the total damage and economic loss from Hurricane Helene to between $145 billion and $160 billion. Helene is expected to be one of the costliest storms in U.S. history because of its overwhelming storm surge, winds and flooding, the weather service said.\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris will cut short a campaign trip and plans a visit to the storm-ravaged Southeast, her office told Reuters. Former President Donald Trump, who said he will visit the region, has criticized Harris for campaigning as the tragedy unfolded. He has also continued to hold rallies.\n\n∎ The South Carolina Department of Public Safety has confirmed 29 storm-related deaths, many involving fallen trees. Impassable roads and lack of stable power has forced several school closures in the state, some lasting through Friday.\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Helene killed a minimum of 25 people in his state. In Tennessee, the state Department of Health has confirmed six weather-related fatalities across four counties, and about 100 people are reported missing. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency noted several county health departments have been closed due to the storm's impact.\n\n∎ Helene is one of the deadliest hurricanes to make landfall on the U.S. mainland in modern history. Since 1950, only eight hurricanes have claimed more than 100 lives in the contiguous 48 states. Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and the surrounding region in 2017, killed 103.\n\n∎ Energy production in the Gulf was recovering. Only 3% of crude oil and 1% of natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut down in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said late Sunday.\n\nStorm tracker:Hurricane Center tracking Tropical Depression Joyce, 4 other systems\n\nAsheville water system severely damaged\n\nIn the days after Helene swept through western North Carolina, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer cautioned that those in the county waiting for the water system to come back online must prepare for the long term.\n\n\"And I’m not talking about days,\" she told the Citizen-Times. \"We want them to plan for longer than that.”\n\nWith the city's water system \"severely damaged\" — which feeds not only the city of Asheville, but also Buncombe County and the northern portion of Henderson County — officials said that restoring service to the full system could take weeks.\n\nAssistant City Manager Ben Woody described the damage as \"catastrophic\" and said crews are still attempting to access infrastructure buried by debris or underwater.\n\nWater distribution began on Monday with four county run sites and one city site. As federal and state supply delivery lagged, though it eventually reached the county for its sites, the city spent \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars to purchase water through a private provider, said City Manager Debra Campbell.\n\n— Sarah Honosky, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nBiden sends FEMA chief to Asheville 'until the situation has stabilized'\n\nBiden sent FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to be on the ground in Asheville, North Carolina, \"until the situation has stabilized,\" the federal agency said Monday. FEMA teams are deploying to Mission Hospital and are currently treating patients, while another team is moving to Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine.\n\nTen federal search and rescue teams are on the ground in the region and another nine teams are on the way, for a total of 900 active personnel, FEMA said. Also being being brought to the region: 25 trailer-loads of meals, 60 trailer-loads of waters, and C-17 cargo plane full of food, water and other essentials.\n\nAccording to a news release, 200 federal ambulances have been provided to the state. The agency has also supplied 40 Starlink satellites to help with responder communications, and 18 helicopters are on standby to help deliver additional resources to affected areas.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen Times\n\nDevastation like a scene from 'War of the Worlds'\n\nResidents in parts of western North Carolina where help has not arrived are fending for themselves. Taylor Shelton said her husband spent two days cutting through large fallen trees with a chainsaw to open a passageway for the couple and their three children to drive out of their darkened house in Yancey County, which abuts Buncombe County.\n\nThe devastation they saw along the way left them awestruck.\n\n\"It looks like 'War of the Worlds.' Very, very big trees are down everywhere,\" she said. \"We saw houses that are just washed away.\"\n\nShelton said the couple still hasn't been able to get in touch with her husband's parents in nearby Burnside, which was also battered by the storm.\n\nManheimer echoed the sentiment, noting that she was experiencing the same things — no power, no water, no Wi-Fi and limited to no cell reception — as many others in the county.\n\n“We are so lucky. Our house did not get hit,\" she said. \"Our neighborhood looks like a war zone.”\n\nIn the hours after Helene lashed the county, Manheimer and her youngest son donned backpacks and went looking for her dad, who lives a mile-and-a-half away. The scene, she said, was \"unbelievable.\"\n\nThey picked through the wreckage of the neighborhood, navigating fallen trees, and downed lines, shimmying through gaps where they could. Her family, once everyone was accounted for, was safe, she said\n\nDeSantis sends rescuers for Floridians in North Carolina\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered rescue teams to mobilize air lifts for people from Florida who may be stranded in western North Carolina in areas with blocked roads and power and cellphone outages.\n\n“Operation Blue Ridge” launched Sunday, an effort similar to one he’d ordered almost a year ago to help Florida residents in Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, and from Haiti earlier this year amid that country’s political violence.\n\nRecovery efforts are ongoing in Florida in the aftermath of Helene. At least 11 people were killed in the state, including at least nine in Pinellas County − hundreds of miles from where the storm made landfall.\n\nDeSantis said he missed a call from Biden because he was in the air viewing damage. The governor added that the federal government should concentrate its efforts on helping those in western North Carolina, though he said Florida might ask for more federal assistance in the future.\n\n− Gray Rohrer, Tallahassee Democrat\n\n'Biblical devastation':Helene leaves trail of destruction\n\n'It's a race against time': Historic town begins digging out\n\nMARSHALL, N.C. − Days after flooding devastated this tiny town of less than 800 people, cleanup crews on Monday worked to remove thick mud and debris while business owners pulled belongings from waterlogged downtown buildings. The historic town, set along the French Broad River north of Asheville, was slammed by a deluge that reached to the first-floor roof of some downtown buildings. It also damaged a water-treatment plant across the river.Most of the town was without power and cellular service. The damage extended to some businesses that in recent years have become part of an artistic renewal in the downtown area. As excavators and equipment buzzed around him, Chad Adamowski and his friends were shoveling mud out of his tattoo and music store, hoping to tear out walls before mold set in. “It’s a race against time,” he said.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nLoss of cell service 'crippled' North Carolina town\n\nWhen Helene inundated and isolated communities across the Southeast, it knocked out cell phone service in Canton, North Carolina, at the moment residents needed it most, according to the town's mayor.\n\nThe loss of service \"crippled\" the town's ability to communicate during and after the devastating storm, leaving residents few options to get crucial updates and check on their loved ones, Mayor Zeb Smathers told USA TODAY.\n\n“I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most,” he said in a statement. “From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this.”\n\nMaking cell communication accessible during a disaster should be something these companies have the resources and know-how to offer, the mayor said.\n\nMajor cellular providers have said they are working around the clock to provide temporary solutions and fully restore service. But the reality on the ground has been harrowing for people stuck without means to reach their loved ones or get help.\n\nCommunications in the region could be impacted for days, weeks or even months, and large companies need to do more to prepare for communication breakdowns triggered by disasters fueled by climate change, said Alyssa Provencio, a professor who oversees the disaster management certificate program at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\n“Communication failure is not a matter of 'if,' it's a matter of 'when,'” Provencio said. \"We know that extreme events are occurring more frequently and with more intensity, and so whether you're talking about hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, it's something that will impact you and impact your communications.\" Read more here.\n\n– N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nWorld Central Kitchen distributing food in Asheville\n\nDisaster relief organizations are providing free food and supplies in the Asheville area amid massive, urgent need. Global relief organization World Central Kitchen began distributing free meals for the public on Monday. WCK is also providing meals in Florida and Georgia. The organization was founded by celebrity chef José Andrés in 2010 to provide fresh food on the frontlines of humanitarian disasters in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"Asheville, we are here,\" the group tweeted Monday. \"WCK is in North Carolina working to reach flooded communities and families stranded by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\n− Tiana Kennell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore:Power outage maps: Mass outages remain in Carolinas, Georgia, Florida after Helene\n\nWorry for neighbors amid communication blackouts\n\nIn Burnsville, North Carolina, Suzanne Vale on Monday posted the names of her neighbors in a group Facebook chat in hopes someone knows how they’re doing. She is among hundreds of people turning to social media for help to contact friends and loved ones in parts of the Southeast that were battered by Helene. Communication blackouts created by Helene's fury have made obtaining information difficult.\n\nAs the storm approached Florida, Vale and her husband drove from their Burnsville home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to their house in Dunedin, a coastal town west of Tampa. While their Florida home was unscathed, their worry immediately became centered on Burnsville, where washed-out bridges and roads have left residents trapped with no means to communicate with the outside world.\n\n“No one’s been able to get a hold of anyone up there. I’m sure they’re OK, it's just not knowing,” she said, speaking about her friends and neighbors. “It's beyond comprehension what’s happened.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\n'The whole side of the mountain came down'\n\nRED HILL, N.C. – James Waters watched Helene's torrential rains and fierce winds decimate his farm among the hilly slopes of Appalachian North Carolina, snapping trees, ripping out fences and causing a landslide.\n\nIt took him a full day to dig to the main road with a farm excavator. He found windy roads strewn with downed power lines, fallen limbs, thick mud and debris. In some areas, cars were washed into ditches. One neighbor found a dead body near a riverbank, he said.\n\nNo one had cell service or power. People couldn’t find out whether their relatives were alive or dead. Waters knew he had a huge recovery ahead of himself. But his family had survived. So, like others in the area, he first grabbed his chainsaw to help clear roads and check on neighbors.\n\n\"The whole side of the mountain came down,\" he said. \"Then it filled up the valley with mud.\" Read more here.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nNorth Carolina town bands together:'That's what we do'\n\nHelicopters, thermal drones used in some rescues\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of Global Guardian, said his international security firm has supported and evacuated over 400 people from disaster areas across the Southeast. Some of the rescues required helicopters and even thermal drones, he said.\n\n\"While we’ve seen the highest demand from clients in the North Carolina region, we are actively conducting wellness checks and delivering food and water supplies along the storm’s path,\" he said. \"The devastation ... and its impact will be felt for months to come.\"\n\nDid the historic Biltmore Estate flood from Helene?\n\nThe Biltmore Estate in Asheville is assessing damage and will remain temporarily closed because of \"significant flooding, impassable roads and widespread power outages in our region,\" according to a statement on the social media account for the historic house and museum. Museum officials were asking people to check biltmore.com/weather-update for the latest. As of Sunday, a message on the website said officials were \"working to reopen\" but provided no timeline.\n\nGeorge Vanderbilt’s 250-room French Renaissance château, which took six years to build in the late 19th century, was the \"largest undertaking in residential architecture in the nation,\" according to the estate website. The home contains more than four acres of floor space, 35 bedrooms, 43 bathrooms and 65 fireplaces.

The clam farmer worries about impact on his harvest. And the business leader contemplates what Mother Nature will throw at them next as the climate changes.\n\nTens of thousands of residents of Florida’s Big Bend region are confronting the same fears in the wake of Hurricane Helene. And those feelings are increasingly shared by coastal residents from Alaska to California and Maine as stronger, more frequent storms and rising ocean levels upend their lives and livelihoods. Many insurers already have curtailed coverage or withdrawn entirely from some areas, indicating the long-term risk.\n\n“Natural disasters are natural disasters,” said innkeeeper Ian Maki, who has lived through five hurricanes since moving to the island community southwest of Gainesville in 2018. “But these don’t feel natural anymore.” Read more here.\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nHurricanes on repeat:Natural disasters 'don't feel natural anymore'\n\nAnxious relatives gather outside emergency room\n\nPeople waited outside the emergency room at HCA Healthcare’s Mission Hospital in Asheville, checking the conditions of relatives who had been admitted. Shawn Hensley, 47, of Black Mountain, told the Citizen Times, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, his 65-year-old mother arrived at the hospital the night before because she was running low on oxygen. Hensley and neighbors had to chainsaw a tree blocking his car so he could get out of his neighborhood.\n\n“It looks like Mother Nature just stomped all over that little town,” Hensley said. “It’s just destruction everywhere you look.”\n\nBiden expected to visit the region affected by Helene\n\nBiden plans to visit the areas ravaged by Helene this week once he can do so without disrupting emergency services, the White House said.\n\n\"It's tragic,\" Biden told reporters on Sunday, pledging recovery assistance after declaring major disasters in Florida and North Carolina and emergencies for Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama. \"You saw the photographs. It's stunning.\"\n\nTrump planned to visit Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to receive a briefing on storm damage, his campaign said.\n\nMore storms developing in Atlantic Basin\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is tracking five systems in the Atlantic basin. The biggest concern to Florida and the U.S. is a disturbance in the Caribbean Sea, which could become a tropical depression later this week as it follows a path similar to major Hurricane Helene. Forecasters are advising residents along the Gulf Coast to closely monitor the system.\n\nAnother system, Tropical Storm Kirk, was expected to become a \"large and powerful\" system later this week, the hurricane center said. Current models show it curving north into the middle of the Atlantic, well away from the U.S. Read more here.\n\n– Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\n\nHow to donate and assist Helene victims\n\nAs authorities assess Helene’s destruction along a large portion of the country, rescuers and other emergency workers have been deployed to hard-hit and isolated communities. Relief efforts and funds have also been created to help victims and survivors.\n\nFederal officials have advised against sending unsolicited donated goods or heading toward disaster-affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted there are no requests, at the moment, for donations other than money.\n\nHere are some organizations that accept donations to help those impacted by the storm:\n\nAmerican Red Cross : Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance.

For the latest news on the storm, view our live updates file for Monday, Sept. 30.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − More than 2 million people remained without power late Sunday across the Southeast in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, including more than 430,000 in North Carolina, where the deadly storm pulverized homes, trapped residents, spawned landslides, and submerged communities under raging floodwaters.\n\nAt least 90 people have died across multiple states since the record-breaking storm hit Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mph winds Thursday, before moving north through Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas and weakening to a post-tropical cyclone. The death toll is expected to rise.\n\nOn Sunday, North Carolina officials were still trying to grasp the level of devastation. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference that at least 11 people died in the devastated state, \"and tragically we know there will be more.\"\n\nBuncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said more than 1,000 people were reported missing through the county’s online portal but added that she expected the number to drop dramatically when cell service is restored. Rescue crews are “still trying to save every single person we can” in the hard-hit community, Pinder said.\n\nHundreds of roads were washed away, cellular service for over 250,000 people was cut off, and vast swaths of cities such as Asheville were left underwater. Cooper said Helene had become \"one of the worst storms in modern history for parts of North Carolina.\"\n\nOfficials said earlier that more than 200 people had been rescued in the state by water and helicopter crews.\n\nRyan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, said the wreckage was overwhelming. \"We have biblical devastation through the county. We’ve had biblical flooding here,” Cole said.\n\nDeaths in eastern Tennessee as communities remain underwater\n\nAt least two people in eastern Tennessee have died due to the recent devastation caused by Helene, officials said Sunday. One death was confirmed in Unicoi County and the other in Johnson County.\n\n\"We do expect this number to change,\" spokesperson Myron Hughes of the Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency said during a 5 p.m. news conference. Tennessee officials reported that 153 people were still unaccounted for in the state as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nMany communities across eastern Tennessee were still underwater and coping with crumbled roads, unsteady bridges, and devastated utility systems. The remnants of Helene brought rivers to record levels and forced evacuations.\n\nLocal schools remained closed, including Carter County Schools which will likely be closed \"for an indefinite period of time due to the ongoing disruptions,\" count spokesperson Ivan Sanders said. In Elizabethton, Sycamore Shores Hospital had shut down but nearby hospitals were up and running, according to Sanders.\n\n— Areena Arora, Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nPower returning to many in North Carolina, but drivers hindering repair efforts\n\nCooper said the number of customers without power is down from more than 1 million to 464,000 on Sunday afternoon, and efforts are underway to restore cellphone service to the thousands without it.\n\nAttempts to provide relief and make repairs are hindered by residents driving in areas impacted by the storm, state officials said at an afternoon news conference, urging people to stay home.\n\n\"Travel in western North Carolina remains limited and dangerous,\" Cooper said, pointing out 280 roads are closed, including sections of I-40 and I-26. \"Please stay off western North Carolina roads.\"\n\nThe governor said Helene dropped 10 to 29 inches of rain on the mountains in parts of the state, resulting in life-threatening landslides and floods. That has prompted reports of up to 1,000 missing, and for some of their loved ones to go searching for them.\n\n“I know there are a lot of people who are concerned about relatives and friends they cannot get in touch with,’’ Cooper said. \"It’s one of the reasons we’re pushing so hard to get communications back up because we know a lot of these people are just simply out of communication and are OK.\"\n\nLines for gas and cash in flooded Ashville\n\nResidents in Asheville were scrambling for resources after widespread flooding and power outages caused gas and water shortages. Gas stations began to close on Sunday and businesses started to only accept cash, as many remain unable to process credit and debit purchases due to lack of power and spotty internet service.\n\nIn West Asheville, amid the distant clatter of chainsaws cutting through downed trees, a line gathered at BJ's Food Mart for its 9 a.m. opening. When the cash-only gas station and market opened, screams across the street could be heard: \"No gas! Cash only! No gas!\"\n\nIn downtown, an hour-and-a-half-long line had formed at the Wells Fargo building ATM. Residents were piling in to get cash for groceries, water, and gas. Some were trying to get out of town and others just wanted enough cash for the coming days.\n\n\"We came downtown looking for gas,\" Stephan Amann told the Asheville Citizen-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"We were in line for one of the gas stations on Merrimon, but they ran out before we got there, which was inconvenient.\"\n\nAmann and his partner, who live in North Asheville, wanted to leave town but found no better options. \"We've tried, but it looks like there's really nowhere to go,\" he said.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nHelene the latest in increasing $1 billion-plus disasters\n\nThe U.S. has averaged eight yearly disasters that caused more than $1 billion in damage since 1980. But in the last five years, the number of such catastrophes has more than doubled to 18.\n\nHelene is only the latest, and the cost of its damage is estimated at between $15 billion and $100 billion.\n\nScientists who study the Earth's climate and weather say storms like Helene are more likely to occur in the future, prompting an insurance crisis as insurers reduce coverage on some markets – most notably Florida for storms and California for wildfires – or withdraw from them altogether.\n\n\"Natural disasters are natural disasters,\" said Ian Maki, an innkeeper in Cedar Key, Florida. \"But these don’t feel natural anymore.\"\n\nDaughter 'powerless and helpless' trying to reach her parents\n\nAs Helene battered the Southeast, LaNette Wimer sat on hold with the Red Cross for two hours Sunday morning more than a thousand miles away in Denver.\n\nWimer, 59, was searching for information about her parents, Don and Brenda Holmer, who have lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina, for the past 25 years. Hendersonville is south of Asheville, where Helene swept through leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nThe last time Wimer spoke to her family they made no mention of the coming storm, and she worries her parents, who do not have cellphones or internet access, were caught unprepared. When the storm hit, Wimer began frantically watching the news, scouring social media, and calling her parents’ landlines, getting no answer.\n\nShe said the Red Cross has agreed to do a wellness check, which could take up to 48 hours. Unsure where else to turn, Wimer said she’s been left with \"a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear, a lot of wondering.\"\n\n\"How are they eating? Do they have water? Do they have their medications?\" Wimer wondered. \"You just feel so powerless and helpless. Other than reaching out to anything I can find online, there's nothing I can do. It's very scary.\"\n\nNorth Carolina residents trying to connect with family members may call NC 211 (or 1-888-892-1162 if calling from out of state) to report missing loved ones. People in the affected areas can alert others that they are safe by checking in on Facebook crisis response or reporting themselves safe through Red Cross Reunification by calling 1-800-ED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767).\n\nHow to donate and assist Helene victims\n\nAs authorities assess Helene’s destruction along a large portion of the country, rescuers and other emergency workers have been deployed to hard-hit and isolated communities. Relief efforts and funds have also been created to help victims and survivors.\n\nFederal officials have advised against sending unsolicited donated goods or heading toward disaster-affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted there are no requests, at the moment, for donations other than money.\n\nHere are some organizations that accept donations to help those impacted by the storm:\n\nAmerican Red Cross : Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance.

His department planned \"welfare checks\" at homes to check those individuals.\n\nHelene wiped out large parts of Asheville, including businesses in the beloved River Arts District. Overlooking the district, the Riverlink Bridge, a central gateway between downtown and West Asheville, has become a sort of hub for gathering as residents reel from the historic damage caused by Helene. The French Broad River crested at a record 24.67 feet Friday and was still well above its banks at 12.68 feet Sunday around noon, according to NOAA.\n\nErin Quevedo, the owner of Balm Salon on Depot Street, was ankle-deep in mud attempting to save what she could of her business.\n\n\"The salon was completely destroyed. It looks like the water came up to about five feet inside,\" Quevedo said. Five hair stylists worked at the salon along with her.\n\n\"Right now, all we're doing is we're trying to salvage what we can,\" she said, noting that only a few things, such as hairstyle tools, were salvageable. \"It's really heartbreaking. I'm not really sure what we're going to do. I think it's just kind of one step at a time.\"\n\nOn Tennessee-North Carolina border, ravaged homes and roads\n\nERWIN, Tenn. − In parts of Appalachian eastern Tennessee near the North Carolina border, the damage from Helene’s deluge was evident Sunday in washed-out bridges, closed roads, destroyed buildings and lack of power for some residents.\n\nUnicoi County officials said restoring power could take weeks. Some residents said they had relatives who were still missing.\n\nAt a church shelter in Greeneville run by the Red Cross, volunteers made pancakes early Sunday for a handful of people still sleeping on cots after being forced from their homes. In Erwin, a town of about 6,000, those impacted by the storm streamed into a local high school serving as a shelter to get hot food, bottled water and clothing. Many were trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nDire situation taking a mental toll\n\nMany Asheville, North Carolina, residents expressed concerns over access to water as grocery and convenience stores have rapidly run out of supplies. Grocery stores have metered customer entrances, and the city and county had yet to establish water distribution sites as of early Sunday afternoon.\n\nBrandi Hayes, 37, and four of her children stood in a long, snaking line of more than 100 people outside the Ingles Markets in west Asheville on Sunday, hoping to buy water, bread, and other essential food items. This was one of the few open grocery stores they could find.\n\nHayes ran out of water Saturday morning and said she's gathered water from a nearby creek to flush the toilet. She tried to call her 18-year-old daughter, a student at Western Carolina University in North Carolina, to let her know she was OK, but there was no answer.\n\nHayes' 12-year-old son tried to console her as she broke down in tears and acknowledged the mental toll the disaster was taking on them.\n\n“We keep talking about (what) we’re thankful for,” Hayes said. “Some people don’t have homes.”\n\n− Jacob Biba and Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nIn West Virginia, fretting about daughter in North Carolina\n\nIn West Virginia, where the storm has left more than 35,000 homes and businesses without power, Twyla Bosley is waiting to hear back from her daughter, Sorida Gain.\n\nGain was riding out the storm in Marion, North Carolina, with her boyfriend, James McKinney, their dogs and chickens. Bosley said the last time they spoke Gain, 40, told her floodwaters had started to breach their basement.\n\n“That's been the last thing I've heard,” Bosley said. “I mean, I lost count of how many missing-person reports I made. I’ve been in contact with the sheriff's department in Marion and nothing yet.”\n\nBosley said she’s trying to stay positive, knowing that the lack of cell service and internet access is likely what’s preventing her daughter from reaching out. Still, she can’t help but worry after seeing images of the widespread flooding in Asheville, less than 40 miles southwest of Marion.\n\n“My mind goes to the worst-case scenario, you know, what if something did happen to her? What if she got trapped there?” Bosley said. “My daughter has a major fear of flood waters. She's scared to death of ‘em. I'm just hoping that she got away.”\n\nA scramble for survival:No time for shoes as Asheville family flees by boat, fearing they lost everything\n\nOver 2 feet of rain swamps North Carolina mountains\n\nOver 2 feet of rain had fallen across North Carolina's mountainous region in recent days because of a rare confluence of weather patterns over the eastern U.S. before Helene arrived in Florida on Thursday night.\n\nTiny Busick in Yancey County along the western border with Tennessee, recorded 29.58 inches in just 48 hours. In Asheville, record high levels were set on the French Broad River and the Swannanoa River near the Biltmore estate. The historic Biltmore Village nearby was nearly submerged after Helene tore through the area, according to aerial footage.\n\nAt least 5,000 emergency calls to 911 were fielded since Thursday. And with more than 200 North Carolinians requiring rescue following Helene’s torrential rains, local, state and federal officials mobilized to help. Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nThousands of National Guard Troops deployed\n\nThousands of members of the National Guard have been mobilized to join search and rescue missions and clear debris after Helene battered the Southeast.\n\nThe bulk of National Guard members were deployed in Florida, where 3,900 were stationed across 21 counties to offer humanitarian relief and security as well as cleaning up debris and rescuing residents from rising floodwaters.\n\nHundreds more were activated in Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and Tennessee, where members rescued 50 patients and staff from a hospital in Unicoi County who were trapped because of extreme flooding.\n\nMadison County, Florida, residents recall horrors of Helene\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall around 11:10 p.m. Thursday just east of the Aucilla River's mouth, roughly 40 minutes south of Madison County, Florida.\n\nWinds ripped the roof off Kenneth Butler's home, which had just been fixed after Hurricane Idalia damaged it last year. During Helene on Thursday, \"it sounded like someone was grabbing tin and just throwing it everywhere,\" he said.\n\nWater drenched the home as the storm raged on. All he and his family could hear was the sound of a train whistle.\n\nDoreen Gross and the five grandchildren who live with her did not take any chances. Gross said her boss had a fully furnished, unoccupied house he was planning to sell and let them stay in it for the storm.\n\nBut the home's sturdy walls didn't shield them from the wails of the winds. \"The whole house was rattling, (the kids) were all scared,\" Gross said. \"We were all bundled together.\"\n\nIt was the scariest thing she had ever seen, Gross said − and she survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Looking outside Thursday night was like watching a scene from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" she said.\n\n− Elena Barrera, the Tallahassee Democrat\n\nBiden briefed on Hurricane Helene impact\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for North Carolina and ordered federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts. Biden also approved emergency disaster relief aid for Tennessee as local officials warned the Nolichucky Dam in Greene County was on the brink of failure and urged about 100,000 residents to seek higher ground. Hours later, the National Weather Service ended its \"flash flood emergency,\" but a flood warning was still in effect.\n\nFEMA administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Georgia on Sunday and North Carolina on Monday, the White House said, as part of the administration's effort to speed support to survivors and deploy more search and rescue teams to \"accelerate recovery efforts\" in North Carolina.\n\nHow many people are without power?\n\nThe worst power outages from Helene were in South Carolina, where nearly more than 761,000 homes and businesses were in the dark as of 11 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker.\n\nIn Georgia, more than 583,000 were without power, in addition to about 432,000 in North Carolina. Florida also had more than 137,000 customers without electricity, and Virginia had over 104,000.\n\nAuthorities have warned it will take days for services to be fully restored.\n\nWhy was Helene so destructive?\n\nForecasters began warning last Tuesday that a confluence of weather patterns was coming together that would likely soak the Southeast and even farther north. A front overhead was going to interact with a plume of moisture being pulled in ahead of Helene.\n\nThe rain \"started well ahead of the storm, training up from the Gulf into our area, and circulation around the storm pushed moisture up from the extremely warm Gulf waters,\" said David Easterling, a rain expert with NOAA's National Climate Assessment Technical Support Unit.\n\nInteractions like this, with a band of moisture ahead of a tropical storm or hurricane, are called predecessor events and they’ve been documented in the past to cause heavy rains ahead of the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes. Jet stream winds blowing aloft at more than 115 mph provided lift that further enhanced moisture in the developing storms.\n\nAlong the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, almost 10 inches of rain fell in Asheville and 8 inches in Tryon, according to preliminary weather service data. Another 6 fell over the two days in Bristol-Johnson, Tennessee, and more than 4 inches in Knoxville.\n\n−Dinah Voyles-Pulver\n\nAre other storms brewing in the Atlantic?\n\nForecasters were keeping watch on the Atlantic as hurricane season approaches its last two months.\n\nTropical Storm Joyce, which formed in the central Atlantic Ocean on Friday, was about 920 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands late Sunday and was gradually weakening. There was no threat to land.\n\nHurricane Isaac was about 535 miles north-northwest of the Azores moving over the open Atlantic, hurricane officials said. There was also no current threat to land.\n\nAn 11 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center noted a tropical depression in the eastern tropical Atlantic, currently known simply as \"12,\" is expected to strengthen over the open Atlantic over the next several days. However, it's not expected to threaten the U.S.\n\nContributing: Michael Loria and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-impacts-tracker-live-updates-from-tallahassee/75386305007/", "title": "Hurricane Helene impacts tracker: Landfall updates from Tallahassee", "text": "A Category 4 Hurricane Helene crashed into the Big Bend as a storm whose fury has never been seen in this area.\n\nAs Helene closed in on Thursday, residents in the path prepared, hoped and prayed.\n\nHere's the latest from the path of the storm:\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long: Damage assessments to begin at first light\n\nLeon County Administrator Vince Long, who rode the storm out at the Emergency Operations Center, told the Democrat around 2:40 a.m. Friday that there were a couple of reports of trees on structures but no widespread damage to buildings. He said emergency calls were lower than expected.\n\n“It sort of had us in the crosshairs for quite a while as it moved into the Gulf and closer to us,\" Long said. “And minor degrees of variation in that track can have a major effect on what the impact is here to us. And certainly by it trending a little east ... it appears anyway that the impacts (here) could have been far greater.”\n\nLong added that the extent of the damage in Leon County won’t be known until assessments start at dawn.\n\n“We will be doing damage assessments at first light,” he said. “And we have crews pre-staged throughout the county in shelters so that they can begin work immediately.”\n\nHurricane Helene wipes Taylor, Madison County off the power grid\n\nAn hour an a half after Hurricane Helene made landfall, residents in Taylor and Madison County were left completely without power, according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker.\n\nOther Nature Coast counties weren't far behind:\n\n48,811 outages reported in Leon County, affecting 37% of customers\n\n14,952 outages reported in Wakulla County, affecting 80.9% of customers\n\n9,619 outages reported in Dixie County, affecting 90.9% of customers\n\n6,179 outages reported in Jefferson County, affecting 70.3% of customers\n\n3,519 outages reported in Franklin County, affecting 30.9% of customers\n\nThe City of Tallahassee power outage map showed that 695 outages were reported, affecting 42,330 customers as of 12:31 a.m.\n\nTo read about Tallahassee's plans to restore power, click here.\n\nTreat it like a tornado: Extreme wind warning for Madison, Monticello and Mayo\n\nAn extreme wind warning is now in effect for the North Florida towns of Madison, Monticello and Mayo, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIt's in place until 1:30 a.m.\n\n\"Treat these imminent extreme winds as if a tornado was approaching and move immediately to an interior room or shelter NOW!\" it said in a social media alert.\n\nWeather warnings in Georgia towns near border\n\nAs Hurricane Helene rips up North Florida, towns on the Georgia side of the state line are soon to get battered.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued an extreme wind warning for Valdosta, Thomasville and Quitman until 2 a.m.\n\nValdosta, Thomasville and Moultrie are under a flash flood warning until 5:15 a.m.\n\nPower outages spike after Hurricane Helene makes landfall\n\nHurricane Helene has been wiping out power for residents left and right as the storm moved closer to the Big Bend and Florida’s Nature Coast.

Turnbull Conference Center on campus.\n\nExtreme wind warning issued for several towns\n\nThe National Weather Service of Tallahassee issued an extreme wind warning for Perry, Madison and Monticello until midnight.\n\nThe wind warning does not currently include Tallahassee, but extends just east of Leon County from Capitola to Horseshoe Beach.\n\n\"Treat these imminent extreme winds as if a tornado was approaching and move immediately to an interior room or shelter NOW!\" NWS Tallahassee said in a post on X.\n\nPresident Joe Biden says to take Helene seriously and 'be safe'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he is \"closely tracking Hurricane Helene\" in an 8:50 p.m. post on X.\n\nThe president's team is communicating with state and local officials \"ready to support.\"\n\n\"I urge everyone in and near the path of Helene to listen to local officials and follow evacuation warnings,\" Biden said. \"Take this seriously, and be safe.\"\n\nPower outages start to mount as Helene approaches\n\nCoastal counties are starting to lose power as Hurricane Helene makes her way toward the Big Bend.\n\nAs of 9 p.m. a USA TODAY power outage tracker shows there are:\n\n2,792 power outages reported in Franklin County out of a total 11,403 customers\n\n1,069 power outages reported in Dixie County, out of a total 10,584 customers\n\n884 power outages reported in Wakulla County, out of a total 18,483 customers\n\n554 power outages reported in Leon County, out of a total 132,016 customers\n\n191 power outages reported in Taylor County, out of a total 13,988 customers\n\nAcross the state, there are 543,265 outages reported, of more than 11 million customers, according to the outage map.\n\nCORRECTION:An earlier version of this entry had the incorrect number of customers without power.\n\nAlligator Point loses power, resident says\n\nThe electricity went out at Alligator Point, according to a resident who has been monitoring the storm from his Ring camera.\n\nStace Stroud said his Ring camera and Internet went out around 8:30 p.m. Thursday evening.\n\nHelene expected to make landfall in Taylor County around 10 or 11 p.m.\n\nWinds are steadily picking up as Hurricane Helene closes in on Taylor County.\n\nThe Category 4 storm is expected to make landfall around 10 or 11 p.m., said Andy Haner, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service Tallahassee.\n\nAs of 8:30 p.m. the center was about 75 miles south-southwest of the Taylor County coastline, with the leading edge of Helene’s inner eyewall only about 35 miles offshore Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County.\n\nAn offshore buoy, located 90 miles southeast of Apalachicola, clocked wind gusts at 102 miles per hour, indicating no escape from Helene, Haner said.\n\n“For folks out in places like Perry, Madison, Monticello, out there you could very well come under the eye for maybe 30 or 45 minutes,” he said.\n\nThe strongest winds will rip through Taylor County before the eye arrives, then the calmer eye will hover. But once the eye moves, on winds are going to come from the opposite direction and be just as strong as when they came in, he said.\n\nTallahassee to see worst weather between 9 p.m. and midnight\n\nWinds are picking up in Tallahassee, and now is the time to take shelter, the National Weather Service Tallahassee says.\n\nAs of 8 p.m., the storm was located 130 miles south of Tallahassee with an expected landfall in Taylor County around 10 or 11 p.m., said Andy Haner, a meteorologist at NWS Tallahassee.\n\n“We are at the stage in Tallahassee where people need to be hunkering down,” Haner said.\n\nThe worst weather is expected to hit Tallahassee between 9 p.m. and midnight, he said, simmering down around 1 or 2 a.m.\n\nTallahassee is slated to be in or immediately west of the left side of the eyewall, which is usually where the worst winds of a hurricane are located, he said.\n\nSome of the Big Bend counties will eventually come under an “extreme wind warning” that should prompt residents to take the same precautions as if a tornado was coming.\n\nBy sunrise, winds are projected to be around 15 to 20 miles per hour, “which is less than what we’re seeing outside at this moment,” Haner said.\n\nTallahassee predicted to get 3-6 inches of rain\n\nThe NWS Tallahassee is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of rain along and west of the eyewall including Tallahassee. An area southwest of the city has seen 6 to 10 inches over the past 24 hours but will likely be west of the band of intense rainfall mentioned above.\n\nWhat to do if you hear trees snapping in a hurricane\n\nFlorida Department of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie advised Big Bend residents that if they start to hear trees snapping while sheltering from the hurricane, treat it like a tornado:\n\nTake shelter in an interior portion of their home, such as a windowless bathroom.\n\nGet as low as possible and cover yourself with a heavy blanket, a comforter or even a thin mattress.\n\nThe sound of pine trees snapping is \"an awful lot like fireworks or potentially gunshots, so please make sure if you hear that, act immediately,” Guthrie said.\n\nIf the sound suddenly stops and it becomes calm and quiet, Guthrie warned that does not mean the storm is over. It means you’re in the eyewall of the storm. He urged residents to stay inside, and especially not to start surveying any damage to one's property.\n\n“This eye is projected to be anywhere from 50 miles wide to 20 miles wide. But again, if it's moving at 21 miles an hour, and it's a 20-mile wide eyewall, you may have only 30 minutes, 45 minutes before that eyewall collapses right back on you and trees start snapping again,” Guthrie said.\n\nWeatherTiger: NHC intermediate advisory shows Helene's outer core pushing ashore\n\nHere's an excerpt from the 8:05 p.m. live blog update from Dr. Ryan Truchelut of Tallahassee-based WeatherTiger:\n\n\"The NHC’s 8 p.m. advisory is out, and there is little change from the previous information we had. Estimated minimum central pressure is down to 942 millibars, and motion remains to the north-northeast (25 degrees) at 23 mph.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Checking on radar, Category 4 Helene’s outer core is now pushing on shore into Florida’s Big Bend. While on-the-ground weather observations are sparse in this part of Florida, Cedar Key recently reported sustained winds of 52 mph and a gust to 65 mph, so tropical storm conditions with embedded hurricane-force gusts are likely to overspread the Apalachee Bay coastline in the next hour.\"\n\nLocal officials appear on NewsNation to talk Helene response\n\nLeon County Sheriff Walt McNeil and Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey both appeared on NewsNation this evening to talk about response and recovery plans for Hurricane Helene.\n\nDailey said the city was ready and waiting to see what Mother Nature brings. He also touted the city’s partnership with the state, the Governor’s Office and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n“We have a saying here in Tallahassee that we’re ‘Tallahassee strong,’ ” Dailey said.\n\nHurricane Helene is now a Category 4\n\nA NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft currently investigating Helene recently found that the maximum sustained winds have increased to 130 mph, according to a post by the National Hurricane Center on X.\n\n\"Helene now an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane,\" the post says.\n\nLeon County say Category 3 force winds are expected inland\n\nHurricane Helene started picking up speed, meaning the storm will get here and be done quicker, Leon County Emergency Management Director Kevin Peters said. But the faster the storm, the stronger the winds inland towns — like Tallahassee — will see.\n\nLeon County’s 5 p.m. forecast showed sustained winds were clocking in at 125 miles per hour, Peters said. Category 3 force winds are still expected to make landfall tonight, alongside six to 12 inches of rainfall.\n\n“Trees will come down, roads will be blocked, power lines will be down, and it’s going to take time to repair and restore and clear all of that,” he said.\n\nPeters said crews are ready to begin restoration efforts as soon as winds die down, but “it’s going to be a process” with a core of the storm this close to Tallahassee.\n\n“We’ve not had that happen in the past,” he said. “We’ve seen storms like Hurricane Michael or Hurricane Idalia, but the cores were a little further away.”\n\nResidents should expect heavy debris and roadblocks and proceed with caution. It’s best to treat every down line as a power line and let the professionals clear them, Peters said.\n\nLatest NHC cone no longer includes western Leon County, but NWS Tallahassee says any eastern shift only 'incremental'\n\nThe National Hurricane Center’s 5 p.m. advisory for Hurricane Helene indicated another small shift to the east, with the cone of uncertainty stretching from eastern Leon County into Taylor County.\n\nThe hurricane’s center line, which ran between Tallahassee and Quincy in earlier forecasts, is now east of there, between Tallahassee and Perry.\n\nHowever, Felicia Bowser, meteorologist in charge with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said residents shouldn’t pay attention to the center line.\n\n“If it changed at all, it was very, very incremental,” Bowser said. “The southeast Florida Big Bend is still the same area of where it’s going to be making landfall. So not really that much change in regards to that.”\n\nAnd while some forecasters have predicted later landfalls, Bowser said she still expects the hurricane to make landfall before 10 p.m.\n\n“Just how strong it can get is a little bit questionable at this time,” Bowser said. “But it’s a strong Category 3 hurricane, sustained winds of 125 mph and not too far from Category 4.”\n\nDuring a news conference shortly before 6 p.m., Gov. Ron DeSantis said landfall was expected around 11 p.m. and that the track had shifted toward Taylor County. But the change may not mean much for the capital city.\n\n\"Tallahassee remains in the path of the storm, and the impacts are expected to be significant,\" Mayor John Dailey said in a post on X at about 6 p.m. \"Widespread and prolonged power outages, damage to critical infrastructure, catastrophic damage to the trees and powerlines, widespread inaccessibility due to blocked roads, and damage to well-built structures will all be likely.\"\n\nMost Leon shelters at capacity; evacuees directed to Rickards High shelter\n\nMore than 1,000 people are hunkering down at eight local public schools turned shelters as Hurricane Helene approaches the Big Bend coast.\n\nA district representative said Rickards High School opened this morning to accommodate more evacuees. Aside for Rickards, all other school shelters have reached capacity. Those still seeking shelter must go to Rickards at 3013 Jim Lee Road.\n\nTallahassee City Manager Reese Goad: 2K workers across all utilities will respond to Helene\n\nSome 2,000 workers across all the city utilities and including mutual-aid electric repair crews and contract workers, will be working to restore power and other services once Hurricane Helene has passed, City Manager Reese Goad said in an interview with the Democrat.\n\nGoad said he expects the damage to eclipse Hurricane Michael, which knocked out power to 90% of city customers in 2018. Repairs will take days, but estimates are unlikely until Saturday, after assessments are done. He added that the city put generators at critical intersections to keep signals operating while power is down and will deploy more as needed.\n\n\"I would expect hundreds of roads to be blocked by trees, based on our past experience, and so you'll have a lot of roads that are impacted just by downed trees and wires,\" Goad said. \"And so that'll take some time to dig out from that. Obviously, we would hope that people kind of stay still on Friday, allow the first responders to get out and do their work. Then I would be hopeful by the weekend that, people can start to move about a little bit, things start to resume a little bit of normalcy. But you know how long ... the pace will be for restoration, it's too early to say at this point.\"\n\nFSU athletics hunkers down for Helene\n\nFlorida State Athletics is preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Helene as the potential major hurricane is expected to make landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region.\n\nFor instance, the FSU football team is flying out of Jacksonville International Airport a day ahead of its game against Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\nThe Seminoles baseball complex was significantly damaged in the May 10 tornados that tore through Tallahassee. The right field wall of Dick Howser Stadium toppled over after the storms, with significant damage to the trees and surrounding area.\n\nThe wall was replaced in the days after the tornados, but the university is prepared for the potential arrival of Helene. Safety measures were put in place throughout the week with loose objects like chairs and training equipment moved indoors or zip-tied to fences.\n\nFSU’s basketball stadium, the Donald L.

Many roads will be impassable, and there may be downed power lines, fallen trees, and other dangerous conditions,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nWakulla County sheriff shares personal message to residents\n\nWakulla County Sheriff Jared F. Miller asked residents to join him in prayer for the coastal community, which will have a long road to recovery after Hurricane Helene.\n\n\"I have lived here my entire life and have never witnessed some of the storm predictions we are currently seeing,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nHe assured residents the sheriff's office would be ready to help during the recovery process and asked for patience once the storm passes.\n\n\"May God keep each of you safe during this storm and may God Bless Wakulla County,\" he wrote.\n\nNWS: Time running out for big changes in Helene track\n\nThere was no change in Hurricane Helene’s forecast track in the National Hurricane Center’s 11 a.m. forecast, though its maximum sustained wind speeds were up slightly.\n\nHelene is projected to make landfall tonight as a high-end Category 3 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. That’s slightly lower than Wednesday projections of a low-end Category 4.\n\nFelicia Bowser, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said Helene is expected to make landfall this evening.\n\n“It’s still moving at a pretty decent speed,” she said.\n\nAs for Helene’s slight jog to the east, Bowser said it happened as of the NHC’s 11 p.m. Wednesday forecast and that any move in that direction since was “extremely incremental.”\n\n“That slight eastward shift did occur, and the fact that it wobbles a little bit east, west, east, west, that’s pretty typical,” she said. “Will we not see any more wobbles? That’s just a little bit hard to say. Will it keep going east? That’s a little bit hard to say, too.”\n\nShe said NHC Hurricane Hunter aircraft will continue to collect data that will show whether there are more wobbles or the track is as refined as it will get.\n\n“We’re definitely getting to that time where the refinements are probably going to be minimized, because it looks like it’s on target,” Bowser said. “And eventually that will happen.”\n\nAt 11 a.m., Helene was 290 miles south of Apalachicola and moving north-northeast at 14 mph. Its maximum sustained winds were 105 mph.\n\nPower outages mount as Helene stalks Florida peninsula ahead of landfall\n\nThe power struggle has begun.\n\nMore than 27,000 Florida customers are already in the dark as an intensifying Hurricane Helene lashes the peninsula as it heads north to a Big Bend landfall.\n\nSouth and central Florida counties like Lake, Collier, Lee, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade have the most outages, but as rain bands begins to lash northern Florida, even Wakulla and Leon counties are beginning to see outages with about 650 and 500 respectively.\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest outages, visit our power outage tracker.\n\nEntire Big Bend under tornado watch; Franklin County warning set to expire\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for more than two dozen Florida counties, including Leon and nearby counties. The watch, which means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form, is in effect until 10 p.m.\n\nFlorida counties under the watch are: Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Calhoun, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Franklin, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Hamilton, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Nassau, Putnam, St. Johns, Suwannee, Taylor, Union and Wakulla.\n\nAn earlier tornado warning for central Franklin County will expire at 11:30 a.m.\n\nNWS in Tallahassee said, \"The storm which prompted the warning has weakened below severe limits, and no longer appears capable of producing a tornado. Therefore, the warning will be allowed to expire.\"\n\nWeatherTiger's offers 'slightly positive trends' for Tallahassee in latest Helene update\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut of WeatherTiger offered up the one thing Tallahasseeans have been praying for — a glimmer of hope — in his latest forecast for Hurricane Helene.\n\nTruchelut said Helene did not intensify as much as expected overnight. And while it’s still expected to become a Category 3 or 4 hurricane, the delay in intensification “is helpful in shaving a bit of the high-end potential off the hurricane’s core of destructive winds tonight,” he wrote.\n\nIn his newsletter to his subscribers on substack, Truchelut added that Helene nudged a few miles east, but no further, from the National Hurricane Center’s 5 a.m. forecast centerline.\n\n“I’ll be watching carefully to see if that persists, as every tick east counts towards increasing the potential for Tallahassee staying on the weaker, western half of the storm,” Truchelut wrote. “Make no mistake: in Tallahassee, your rooting interest is that the center of Helene passes to our east.”\n\nHelene was about 350 miles south of Apalachicola and moving north-northeast at about 12 mph, according to the NHC’s 8 a.m. forecast. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph.\n\nDespite what he called the \"slightly positive trends,\" Truchelut said Helene remains a \"catastrophic threat.\" The hurricane is expected to make landfall in Apalachee Bay tonight or early Friday morning.\n\nLeon County opens eighth shelter at Rickards High School\n\nLeon County opened its eighth shelter for people seeking refuge from Helene this morning at Rickards High School.\n\nThe shelters are run in cooperation with Leon County Schools.

Ron DeSantis appeared on Fox & Friends Thursday morning to talk about Florida's preparations for Hurricane Helene.\n\nThe governor warned that time is running out for those living in evacuation zones to leave.\n\n\"People just need to make decisions, keep themselves safe,\" DeSantis said. \"Soon as the storm passes, you're going to see the response very quickly.\"\n\nHe also emphasized the potential damages for Tallahassee, which has historically missed the brunt of major hurricanes.\n\n\"If it does hit Tallahassee, they have not had a major hurricane in Tallahassee in recent memory,\" DeSantis said. \"We've got a lot of beautiful trees here — the neighborhoods have them. But when you start having 125 mph winds, that could cause a lot of damage, a lot of debris as well.\"\n\nHe gave another warning for those who live beneath trees: \"You got a big oak fall on your roof, that is not going to be something that you're going to want to be there for,\" he said.\n\nJim Cantore, a harbinger for hurricane damage, in Tallahassee\n\nThe Weather Channel's Jim Cantore was in Tallahassee Thursday morning.\n\nThat's something making city residents uneasy, as he's known to visit areas before and as they get significantly damaged by hurricanes.\n\n\"It cannot be understated the threat (Hurricane Helene) poses across the southeastern United States just based on current intensity projections,\" Cantore said in a social media post Wednesday.\n\nThe Tallahassee Democrat spotted Cantore doing live coverage outside the Old Florida Capitol on Wednesday evening. See the images below.\n\nHurricane Helene grows to Category 2 storm\n\nHurricane Helene is now a Category 2 with 100-mph winds, according to the National Hurricane Center's 8 a.m. bulletin.\n\n\"ADDITIONAL STRENGTHENING EXPECTED BEFORE LANDFALL IN FLORIDA... ...PREPARATIONS TO PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY SHOULD BE RUSHED TO COMPLETION...\"\n\n\"Weakening is expected after landfall,\" NHC forecasters say, \"but Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians.\"\n\nThat scenario harkens back to Hurricane Michael, which punched into Georgia with Category 3 winds.\n\nDreams washed away: Horseshoe Beach residents pray for a miracle ahead of Helene\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH — This beloved Gulf Coast fishing destination was a ghost town in the hours leading up to Hurricane Helene's anticipated landfall.\n\nOnly a few residents remained Wednesday afternoon as they made final preparations for the storm before evacuating to more inland towns.\n\nThe town lost more than 50% of its homes to Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge that could be even worse.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking to come back and see your dreams you've always had get washed away in two hours,\" resident John Hamelink said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWeatherTiger's video forecast outlines a harrowing night ahead\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK meteorologist Ryan Truchelut of WeatherTiger broke down the impacts ahead of Hurricane Helene in a late Wednesday night video forecast.\n\nHe warned that Tallahassee could be blasted by 115 mph winds. He also noted that a record storm surge of 15 to 20 feet will occur during high tide, which will ratchet up the life-threatening risk potential for those coastal dwellers under hurricane and surge warnings.\n\n\"This is not a survivable situation,\" he said. \"You just have to get out.\"\n\nWhen the night is over, Truchelut said, \"(Helene) will stand toe to toe with one of the biggest hurricane hits in Florida hurricane history, unfortunately.\"\n\nFlorida becomes the evacuation state as residents wake-up to final decision\n\nResidents are awaking Thursday morning and facing a final decision on whether to stay or go.

The storm has been linked to at least eight deaths in Texas and Louisiana.\n\nNow a tropical depression, Beryl is expected to lose strength as it moves further inland, though it will remain potent enough to drop several inches of rain on multiple states and spin up tornadoes as it heads toward the Northeast, according to the National Hurricane Center. On Tuesday, over 21 million people from Arkansas to Maine were under flood watches, the National Weather Service said.\n\nTexas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick warned that while Beryl has moved out of the state, dangerous flooding could last for several days.\n\nThe deadly storm swept through Jamaica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines last week. At least 11 people were killed in Mexico and the Caribbean before Beryl reached Texas.\n\nSee outage map:Beryl leaves millions without power, heads toward Mississippi\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry declared a state of emergency Tuesday after Beryl, which arrived as a tropical storm, caused one death and \"major damage to homes and businesses, as well as massive power outages,'' his office said.\n\n∎ Texas oil and gas companies that shut down in anticipation of Beryl's arrival started to get their operations going again Tuesday despite damage to some of their facilities and power outages in some areas.\n\n∎ Officials with the city of Houston asked people to \"avoid all unnecessary travel\" Tuesday to clear the roads for authorities working to remove debris and restore power.\n\n∎ More than 2,500 first responders were deployed statewide to assist in the recovery effort, according to Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. In Harris County, which encompasses Houston, the sheriff's office's high water rescue team continued responding to incidents across the city Tuesday.\n\n∎ Patrick said Tuesday that President Joe Biden has granted his request for a federal emergency disaster declaration, which would help cover recovery costs. Biden also told Houston Mayor John Whitmire his administration \"will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm now and to recover moving forward.\"\n\nTornadoes sweep through Ohio Valley\n\nTwo tornadoes have been confirmed by the National Weather Service office in Paducah, Kentucky, as a weakened Beryl continues to stir up danger along its path.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned about the possibility of several tornadoes Tuesday night across the Ohio Valley, including parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Tennessee. That became a reality a little over an hour later when the Paducah office confirmed a \"large and extremely dangerous tornado'' near Owensville, Indiana, about 25 miles north of Evansville.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the same office reported a second tornado had formed near Poseyville, Indiana, also close to Evansville.\n\nIn Mount Vernon, Indiana, crews were assessing damage after a tornado swept through the town Tuesday and displaced more than a dozen families. Black Township Fire Chief Jay Price said no injuries were reported as of Tuesday evening.\n\nThe storm overturned train cars, caused several gas leaks, mangled utility poles, and damaged a warehouse. Footage posted to social media from other Indiana towns of Johnson and Poseyville showed the storm's devastating aftermath, with snapped trees and some homes reduced to rubble.\n\nAccording to Iowa State University research, Beryl set a record by producing 113 tornado warnings Monday.\n\nDangerous heat to scorch east Texas amid Beryl outages\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Beryl, another form of dangerous weather is bearing down on parts of Texas as more than 2 million homes and businesses are out of power: High heat and humidity.\n\nWeather officials issued a heat advisory from 7 a.m. Tuesday to 7 a.m. Wednesday across much of southeast Texas, from the Gulf Coast through Houston and Montgomery County. Heat index values, also called \"feels-like temperatures,\" could reach 106 degrees in the afternoon, prompting authorities to urge residents to find places with working air conditioning, drink plenty of water, and check in on neighbors, friends, and relatives.\n\nIn Houston, where the thermometer reached 95 degrees Tuesday, resident Raymond Miller lost power at 6 a.m. on Monday, making for a rough night.\n\n\"It was hot, I had trouble sleeping and the humidity makes it very hard to breath in my apartment,'' said Miller, 46, who works in higher education. \"Opening the windows last night didn't do anything, it kind of made it worse.\"\n\nMiller's plan to seek relief for himself and his dog was for them to sit in his vehicle with the air conditioning running, but with only a quarter tank of gas left, it would be difficult to escape the heat for long.\n\n\"There is no gas available. Everyone is out of gas,\" he said. \"Everything is coming to a head at this point.\"\n\nExtreme heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather. This week, a relentless heat wave scorching the West Coast is suspected to have killed eight people as temperatures soared into the triple digits. More record-breaking heat was expected to bake the West Coast in the coming days, with some areas reaching up to 30 degrees above average, the National Weather Service said.\n\nHigh temperatures plaguing the West this week will move into north-central and southeast U.S. on Sunday and early next week, according to the weather service.\n\n\"The persistent and record-breaking heat is extremely dangerous to those without access to cooling,\" the weather service warned.\n\nStorm causes wastewater spill of 154,000 gallons in Houston\n\nThe combination of Beryl's powerful winds, abundant rain, and the power outages they caused led to a wastewater spill of at least 154,000 gallons in the central part of the city, Houston Public Works reported.\n\nThe agency said those who get their water from the city \"are safe from the spill and do not need to boil their water.'' However, officials advised residents who rely on private drinking supply wells within the affected area to boil water for at least a minute, including water for cooking and bathing.\n\nHouston endured another spill of more than 100,000 gallons of wastewater in mid-May, when storms bringing fierce winds and heavy rain killed eight people in the area, flooded streets and knocked out power to about 1 million customers.\n\nBeryl's path from Arkansas to Maine\n\nBeryl is projected to drench a vast swath of the central and eastern U.S. as it unleashes thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes from the lower Plains to the Northeast.\n\nThe storm is expected to move over Arkansas and enter the lower Ohio Valley by Tuesday evening, threatening the region with possible tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. The heaviest rainfall will follow Beryl's track through Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana through late Tuesday, where up to 8 inches can fall, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Bill Deger said.\n\n\"Since the storm will be moving fast, this rain can fall in just a matter of hours, leading to reduced visibility for motorists and flash flooding on highways and in poor-drainage areas,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the storm is forecast to bring its \"prolific heavy rain\" and tornado threats to the lower Great Lakes and northeast regions, including upstate New York, northern Pennsylvania and parts of southern Maine. Torrential downpours are expected to develop along the mid-Atlantic coast before expanding into New England at midweek, according to AccuWeather.\n\nLingering moisture across the Northeast, even after Beryl dissipates, will continue to fuel storms from Thursday to Friday and possibly Saturday, AccuWeather said, adding that it's possible parts of the East could receive half a foot of rain.\n\nSummer bake:Record-high temperatures from Portland to Phoenix as heat wave continues. Is end in sight?\n\nPower crews work to restore service after Beryl\n\nState and local officials in Texas warned that it could take several days to restore electricity after Beryl knocked out power to millions of homes and businesses.\n\nNearly 1.6 million customers were out of power in the Houston area by midafternoon Tuesday, CenterPoint Energy reported, saying about 825,000 had it restored in the previous 24 hours. According to PowerOutage.us, over 2 million Texas homes and businesses had lost power while about 10,000 were out of electricity in Louisiana.\n\nIn a statement on X, CenterPoint Energy said it expects to restore power to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. The company, which provides service in Houston and surrounding areas, said nearly 12,000 field resources were assisting in the response.\n\nAt its peak, over 2.2 million CenterPoint Energy customers were without power on Monday. By 8 p.m., 285,000 customers had their power back on, the company said in a statement.\n\n“While we tracked the projected path, intensity and timing for Hurricane Beryl closely for many days, this storm proved the unpredictability of hurricanes as it delivered a powerful blow across our service territory and impacted a lot of lives,” said Lynnae Wilson, senior vice president of CenterPoint Energy.\n\nDeath toll climbs after Beryl hits east Texas, Louisiana\n\nMultiple people were killed in eastern Texas and one person died in Louisiana in storm-related incidents, according to officials.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott wrote in a social media post on Tuesday night that the state is deploying 25 additional ambulances and a 250-bed medical shelter to support EMS and hospital capacity needs in the Houston area, where four storm-related deaths have been confirmed.\n\nWhitmire said a Houston Police Department civilian employee drowned when he got caught in flood waters while driving to work. In southeast Houston, a man died in a fire believed to have been started by lighting as Beryl bore down on the city.\n\nA 53-year-old man and a 74-year-old woman were killed in two incidents after trees fell on their homes on Monday, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.\n\nA man operating a tractor was killed after a tree fell and struck him, according to Montgomery County Emergency Management. In addition, two people were found dead in a tent in a wooded area of Montgomery County, north of Houston. No further details were available.\n\nIn northwest Louisiana, a woman died after a tree fell on her home, according to a statement from the sheriff's office in Bossier Parish.\n\nHundreds of egrets killed during Beryl, hundreds rescued\n\nHundreds of egrets were thrown from their nests and drowned as Hurricane Beryl slammed southeast Texas on Monday, the Houston chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) said in a statement.\n\nThe nonprofit said specialists with its wildlife center in Texas were on the scene in Cypress, a city just northwest of Houston, to rescue the injured and orphaned egrets that survived.\n\nThe specialists were expected to bring back around 300 birds to their campus for triage and medical care, the statement said.\n\nEgrets are all-white wading birds that make their home in wetlands across the United States. They're found throughout Texas and the Gulf Coast states year-round, according to the Houston Audubon Society.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; Ryan Reynolds, Jon Webb, Houston Harwood and Sarah Loesch, Evansville Courier & Press; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/08/hurricane-beryl-live-updates-texas/74322274007/", "title": "Beryl updates: At least 4 deaths in Texas linked to historic storm", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects news on Hurricane Beryl from Monday, July 8. For the latest news on Beryl, please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Tuesday, July 9.Tropical Storm Beryl unleashed a barrage of severe weather to southeast Texas on Monday, killing at least four people, flooding highways, closing oil ports, canceling more than 1,300 flights and knocking out power to more than 2.7 million homes and businesses.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Beryl, the season's earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, weakened from a hurricane after pounding the coastal Texas town of Matagorda, a coastal community between Corpus Christi and Galveston. It had sustained winds of more than 80 mph as it made landfall at 4 a.m. CT.\n\nThe agency said current conditions could spawn tornadoes in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. By 7 p.m. CT, the weather service office in Shreveport, Louisiana, reported it had issued over 50 tornado warnings. The office had also stacked up a list of a half-dozen possible tornadoes.\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire said most of the city was experiencing flood waters of more than 10 inches. \"We're literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions,\" he said Monday.\n\nIn a suburban part of Harris County, just northeast of Houston, a man was killed when a tree fell on his home and trapped him under debris, according to Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. In northern Harris County, a tree fell onto a house and killed a 74-year-old woman, Gonzalez said on social media.\n\nAt least two more people died: A Houston Police Department civilian employee got caught in flood waters driving to work; in southeast Houston, a man was killed in a fire believed to have been started by lightning, Whitmire said at a news conference Monday evening.\n\nLast week, Beryl carved a path of destruction across the Caribbean — leaving at least 11 people dead and destroying or severely damaging infrastructure on several islands. Beryl, which at one point strengthened into the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, last made landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Friday morning.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Officials in Fort Bend County outside of Houston evacuated the residents of an apartment building badly hit by the storm to local fairgrounds, the county’s Emergency Management Agency announced Monday evening.\n\n∎ Beryl’s maximum sustained winds fell to around 35 mph by 7 p.m. local time. The tropical depression is expected to weaken into a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday, according to a National Weather Service advisory. It is expected to move through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the Ohio Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n∎ More than 2.7 million homes and businesses in Texas lost power, according to Patrick and PowerOutage.us. Several counties in southeastern Texas — including Houston, where many U.S. energy companies are headquartered — are under a flash-flood warning as thunderstorms unleashed up to nearly 12 inches of rain in some areas.\n\n∎ Closures of major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston, and Houston ahead of the storm could disrupt crude oil exports and shipments of crude to refineries and motor fuel from the plants. The Corpus Christi Ship Channel has re-opened, while the Port of Houston was projected to resume operations on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n∎ At least two locations on the west side of Houston experienced major flooding Monday, according to the National Water Prediction Service. They included the White Oak Bayou, where the water rose more than 25 feet, and the Buffalo Bayou, where the water rose 24 feet, both within about 9 hours.\n\n∎ Across eastern Texas, heavy rain and flooding triggered water rescues as people became trapped in their homes and vehicles.\n\nMore flooding expected in Houston\n\nAs Beryl drenched the region north of Houston, officials urged residents to stay off the roads.\n\n“Don’t let the clear skies fool you,” Whitmire said. “We still have dangerous circumstances, we still have high water.”\n\nRussell Richardson, a Houston Police Department information security officer, died after getting caught in floodwaters on his way to work Monday morning, the police shared on social media. He was 54.\n\nBrent Taylor, chief communications officer for the city’s Office of Emergency Management, said rain falling north of the city went through Houston’s bayou system, a network of creeks that can easily overflow.\n\n“The flooding isn’t over,” he said. “We anticipate the cresting will happen later as the water moves down to the Gulf of Mexico.”\n\nAdditional flooding plus the impact of the power outage on city traffic lights will continue to make driving dangerous, he said.\n\nBeryl produces tornadoes\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center documented nearly a dozen tornado reports produced by Beryl as it moved north from Texas into Louisiana and Arkansas. Local National Weather Service officials issued over 60 tornado warnings.\n\nA condo building in Jasper County, Texas, took a direct hit from a tornado Monday morning, local emergency management officials told the National Weather Service; a twister in Timpson, Texas, 25 miles from the Lousiana border, tore the roof off of City Hall.\n\nMost of the tornadoes were reported in Texas and Louisiana, with an additional report in Arkansas. Nearly all of Southern Arkansas and Western Louisiana were under tornadoe watch, according to the weather service.\n\nHurricane Beryl's strength caught people off guard\n\nHal Needham, an extreme weather scientist widely known to other locals in Galveston, Texas, as \"Hurricane Hal\", was up just after 4 a.m. Monday to monitor the storm and livestream updates.\n\n\"We've had some pretty big squalls today with widespread power outages,\" he said. \"I think the storm was a lot stronger than a lot of people expected.\"\n\nNeedham also was concerned that continuing power outages would leave residents vulnerable to high-80s heat and high humidity. \"This is the hottest time of the year,\" he said. \"If people still don't have power, there could really be some issues with heat exhaustion, with heat-related illnesses, especially for elderly people with health conditions.\"\n\nAlthough people from the area are hurricane-savvy, this storm hit earlier than most, catching them off guard, Needham said. \"Only 3% of major hurricanes usually happen in June or July,\" he said. \"Typically, Texas does not get a lot of July and June hurricane landfalls.\"\n\n\"I think people were really surprised by how hard and how quickly this hit,\" he added.\n\nHigh heat index, no A/C will make for harsh early recovery\n\nThe early part of the recovery from Beryl's ravages will be an arduous, sweaty task made a lot more uncomfortable by the power outages affecting millions of Texans amid the summer heat.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Houston issued a heat advisory for Tuesday in southeast Texas, where a heat index of 105 Fahrenheit is expected.\n\n\"While this would normally be below criteria (for the advisory), the widespread loss of power and A/C will make for dangerous conditions,'' the Houston office said. \"Those working outside may not have a chance to properly cool off!''\n\nThe heat index combines air temperature with relative humidity to provide a measure of what the temperature actually feels like to people. The thermometer is expected to rise to 93 degrees in Houston on Tuesday and Wednesday, and which along with relative humidity of close to 80 may send the heat index past the 110 mark.\n\nThe Houston office warned about the possibility of heat-related illnesses and advised residents to limit outdoor activities, drink lots of water, wear light clothing, and try to work during cooler times of the day.\n\nWhat now?Where are Beryl's remnants headed next? Flooding rain; tornadoes possible\n\nGalveston resident says first hurricane will be her last\n\nAlanna Carter endured her first hurricane Monday night when Beryl passed over her home in Galveston. \"I don't want to go through that ever again,\" the 44-year-old bartender said hours after the storm passed through the area.\n\n\"If that was only a Cat 1, I can only imagine what Ike was like and that was a Cat 4,\" she said of Hurricane Ike, which struck Texas in 2008, before Carter's arrival.\n\nCarter said Beryl lashed her house with fierce wind and rain. \"It literally shook the entire house,\" she said, adding the neighborhood was dark after losing power. She doesn't expect it back for days.\n\nThough her house wasn't severely damaged, Carter said a neighbor lost a window and the area was covered with debris left behind by Beryl, including fallen trees, shingles, plastic and trash. The next time a hurricane heads for Galveston, Carter doesn't plan to stick around.\n\n\"This is not my jam,'' she said. \"I mean, I was nauseous because my anxiety was so high.\"\n\nBeryl knocks out power for over 2 million people in Texas\n\nMore than 2.1 million customers were out of power in eastern Texas, according to the power company CenterPoint Energy. It’s unclear how many of those customers were in Houston. On its website, CenterPoint Energy said the service was disrupted by 5,993 active outages.\n\nAccording to PowerOutage.us, an outage tracker, more than 2.7 million homes and businesses across Texas were without power.\n\nStorm does heavy damage in last 30 minutes\n\nRichard Reyes thought the worst of the storm had passed him and his family by. Then their house in northeast Houston started flooding with up to a foot of water, the power went out and a huge tree toppled in front of their place.\n\n“All of this happened in the last 30 minutes of the storm,'' said Reyes, 73, a retired actor and arts advocate who as his Santa-like alter ego, “Pancho Claus,” distributes thousands of toys annually to mostly Latino kids in the Houston area.\n\nReyes, who saw similar damage during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 when he lived elsewhere in Houston, said the floodwaters moved in even after the rain stopped. He said his son didn't trust the tall tree would stay upright and moved the family cars just before it fell into the street where the vehicles had been, somehow avoiding pulling multiple power lines down along the way.\n\nReyes said his son and neighbors were out Monday morning cutting through the tree to clear the way so vehicles could pass. In the meantime, they’re hoping FEMA will cover some of the damage.\n\n“Luckily, everyone is safe,” he said.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nLiving next to a seawall, 'our whole building was shaking'\n\nTom Sheppard, 59, was jolted awake at 3:30 Monday morning by the storm raging through Galveston. \"It was a lot worse than we thought,\" he said, pointing out he lives next to the seawall. \"Our whole building was shaking.\"\n\nThe winds ripped down the wrought iron fence around his gated community, bringing down gutters and part of a wall.\n\nVenturing out after the storm passed, Sheppard saw the destruction was widespread. \"All the palm trees are snapped in half,\" he said. \"All the power poles are down. It's flooded. It got pretty bad.\"\n\nIn Galveston, a fish swimming on a flooded street\n\nJacob Jonathan, 21, awoke Monday to harsh winds banging on the window of his Galveston home, which he found \"a little stressful.''\n\nJonathan said his street was flooded with nearly a foot of water. At one point, he looked out his window to see a fish jump. Debris littered the neighborhood, and a fence was knocked down by the wind, he said.\n\nBy midday, Jonathan was still out of power, and said some friends in Galveston also were without water. \"We're mainly worried about our food going bad in the fridge,\" he said.\n\nJonathan spent the morning at home after the auto repair shop where he works delayed opening until the afternoon because of the storm, and he was waiting to see when conditions improved.\n\n\"Our house is lifted and we don't have any leaking,\" he added. \"The only nuisance right now is we had to pick up after our animals because they can't really walk in the water.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl 'has been rough'\n\nDonna Radin said she was startled awake by the “very strong howl” of wind rattling her home as rain came down in sheets early Monday morning.\n\nThe 58-year-old travel agent lives in Deer Park, a small city east of Houston. Around 5 a.m., as the conditions worsened, she heard a generator blow just down the block, and soon her home lost power.\n\nHuddled inside with her daughter, two granddaughters and five dogs, Radin said she's avoided the windows but can see lots of downed trees and the remnants of a fence that was ripped out of the ground and hurled several yards away.\n\n\"It's the most intense Cat 1 I've ever been through,\" said Radin, who has lived on the Texas Gulf Coast all her life. \"I told my husband, 'Our next investment will be remote-controlled hurricane shutters,' because this has been rough.\"\n\nMore:Hurricane Beryl tracker: Storm makes landfall in Texas, see spaghetti models, path\n\nBeryl causes over 1,000 flight cancellations in Houston\n\nMore than 1,000 flights across airports in Houston were canceled Monday as Beryl bore down on the city.\n\nAt George Bush Intercontinental Airport, over 1,000 arriving and departing flights were canceled, according to FightAware. The smaller William P. Hobby Airport had over 300 cancellations, FlightAware said.\n\nHouston is a major hub for United Airlines, which is enduring the worst of the operational impacts from the storm. About 14% of United’s flights, around 400 departures, have been canceled Monday.\n\nTexas power outage map\n\nBeryl brings flooding, prompting water rescues\n\nAcross eastern Texas, officials in multiple counties said first responders were rescuing people trapped in their cars and homes amid Hurricane Beryl's deluge.\n\nGonzalez, the Harris County sheriff, asked drivers to \"please stay off the roadways\" as heavy rain drenched Houston and its surrounding areas.\n\nThe police department in Rosenberg, just southwest of Houston, said it was conducting water rescues and warned residents about falling trees and ongoing flooding.\n\n'We need help':Honeymoon now a 'prison nightmare,' after Hurricane Beryl strands couple in Jamaica\n\n\"Street flooding, downed trees, power outages and water rescues. All of that is happening right now in Rosenberg. Please stay off of the roads,'' the Rosenberg Police Department said on X. \"A downed tree even fell (on) one of our high water rescue vehicles coming back from a rescue.\"\n\nIn Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston, officials in a statement on X asked residents to, \"Please stay home until the storm passes.\" The statement from the county said, \"trees and debris are all over the roads, several roads flooded and most signals are out.\" It added that deputies were responding to \"stranded/flooded motorists.\"\n\nIt's hurricane season.See which previous storms passed near your neighborhood\n\nHurricane Beryl hits records amid projected busy hurricane season\n\nOn July 1, Beryl made landfall in Grenada's Carriacou Island as a Category 4 hurricane and tore through the southern Caribbean Islands, flattening hundreds of buildings.\n\nLater that night, Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. Driven by record-high ocean temperatures, Beryl's rapid strengthening stunned experts. Beryl was also the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record and is the first June major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles on record.\n\nFederal forecasters have predicted a hurricane season unlike any other, with as many as 25 named storms possible.

The flashing on Lee Hall was also damaged, according to Kendall Jones, associate vice president Facilities, Planning, Construction, and Safety.\n\nWhile the campus cleanup is underway classes will be conducted remotely May 13-17. Monday marks the start of the summer semester at FAMU.\n\nFollowing Friday’s closure, FAMU Developmental Research School (DRS) administrators will announce re-opening plans over the weekend. The Educational Research Center for Child Development’s (ERCCD) roof was damaged, and the facility will be closed at least Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for repairs.\n\n“We appreciate all of the prayers and support from the community.

There is no history of anything other than brief, short-lived touchdowns in the urban core, college campuses, or densest residential areas of town.\"\n\nHe continued that \"radar data, an 84 mph wind gust report from FAMU, and wide swaths of structural and severe tree damage suggest that most destructive tornado in Tallahassee's history may have occurred around 7 a.m. today.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service will make the final determination.\n\nLooking for a late evening bite to eat?

Residents hunkered down in interior hallways and bathrooms as they prepared for the worst in the early morning hours.\n\n“Having been in Indianhead for 40 years, and a Florida native, I had always heard of tornadoes and the freight train noise that they make, but I had never experienced it. Well, now I have experienced it,” said Sherry Mills, an Indianhead resident.\n\nHer son and small grandson just happened to be staying over at her house the night before. “We all ran to the bathroom with no windows, it was unbelievable. The worst of it was only about five minutes, but it was terribly frightening.”\n\nThe cleanup of the neighborhood with the massive green and brown camouflaged roads will likely take days before residents see some sense of normalcy.\n\nVideo of Railroad Square from above shows scope of damage\n\nThe beloved arts district of Railroad Square was one of the hardest hit areas of Tallahassee, along with Indianhead Acres, Myers Park and College Town.\n\nSee the scope of the damage from above in drone footage and hear from one of the business owner's.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" she said. \"One of the galleries is completely gone, smashed down to the ground.

City officials expect the work to restore power will go through the weekend.\n\nCity spokesperson Alison Faris said the extent of the damage has made it hard-going today because crews are focused on fixing the transmission infrastructure before they can start working on the distribution of power that energizes homes and businesses.\n\n\"Transmission first and then we restore circuits which impacts distribution,\" Faris told the Democrat. \"All hands are on the transmission. We should start seeing some circuits repaired here shortly.\"\n\nThat can lead to entire sections of neighborhoods being powered up.\n\nAt 6 p.m., Faris said 85 percent of the work to the transmission line is complete.

Dick Howser Stadium ― the home for FSU baseball ― was among the structures in the path of the violent storm.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe view from Indianhead\n\nThe Indianhead neighborhood, as usual during severe weather, was hard hit. Fallen trees appear to be blocking roads every 50 yards. One neighbor reported that a treetop near his house appeared to have snapped off, was shorn of branches and driven into the ground “like a pencil.”\n\nStill other trees had their tops snipped off, apparently by strong winds, leaving jagged edges of bare wood. Power lines and supporting cables were downed and lying on the ground like a mess of twist ties. A couple of residents could be seen trying to pull a limb off a roof.\n\nWith school canceled, neighborhood kids had nothing else to do but go outside, with some dragging large branches out of the streets.

For the latest news on Hurricane Beryl, which is now a Category 5 storm, please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Tuesday, July 2.\n\nHurricane Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record Monday night when its winds increased to 160 mph as it barreled through the southeastern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl shatters the old record by more than two weeks — Hurricane Emily became a Category 5 on July 17, 2005. Forecasters fear that the historically busy hurricane season in 2005 could be repeated this year.\n\nHurricane hunter reconnaissance flights into the storm Monday found continued strengthening. As of 11 p.m. Monday, Beryl's winds had climbed from 155 mph to 160 mph — becoming a \"potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane,\" according to the hurricane center.\n\nBeryl's central barometric pressure had dropped to 938 millibars but the hurricane center expects its Category 5 status to be brief, forecasting a steady decline in windspeed with the winds steadily declining.\n\nThe hurricane was about 510 miles east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic and traveling west-northwest at 22 mph, the hurricane center said. Its center was on track to move across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea into Tuesday and is expected to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nBeryl is forecast to weaken after reaching Jamaica, according to the hurricane center, but it's expected to remain a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.\n\nBeryl tore through the Windward Islands on Monday after making landfall on Grenada’s Carriacou Island as a Category 4 storm at 11:10 a.m., according to the hurricane center. The hurricane had 150 mph winds when its eye made landfall on Carriacou.\n\nPower was out throughout Grenada and residents were advised to shelter in place as Beryl brought down power lines and tore away roofs. The last major hurricane to reach the country's shores was Ivan, which caused widespread devastation with winds of more than 135 mph in 2004.\n\nThe government of Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning for the island, according to the hurricane center.\n\nFrom the island of St. Lucia south to Grenada, streets were littered with parts of trees and personal effects, the Associated Press reported. The lack of electricity and communications outages in the region made it difficult to get accurate reports on injuries and property damage.\n\nThe historic Beryl reached tropical storm status Friday before becoming a major hurricane Sunday as it raced toward the Caribbean with winds of 130 mph − a gain of 95 mph in just 42½ hours. Record-warm ocean temperatures led to rapid intensification, a phenomenon that occurs when a storm strengthens by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.\n\nThe storm became the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record and the first June major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles. Beryl hit Category 4 status Sunday, but its winds decreased slightly overnight, making it a Category 3 storm Monday. It strengthened again early Monday.\n\nHurricane Beryl storm tracker:See latest details, projected path of Category 3 storm\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ At least one death was reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said late Monday, adding that there may be more fatalities. Gonsalves noted the widespread devastation in the area with hundreds of homes and buildings damaged or destroyed.\n\n∎ In a statement on Facebook, St. Lucia's Prime Minister Philip Pierre said that the island experienced \"strong winds and torrential rains that resulted in flooding, land slippage and property destruction.\" He added that Beryl \"could have been even more severe on our country but we were spared this time from possible disaster.\"\n\n∎ Storm surge in the Windward Islands could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels and bring \"large, destructive waves\" to the coast, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n∎ Rainfall could cause flooding and is expected to dump 3 to 6 inches in Barbados and the Windward Islands. Up to 10 inches are possible in isolated locations, especially in the Grenadines.\n\n∎ After Beryl's center moves across the Windward Islands on Monday, the storm will cross the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late Monday through Wednesday.\n\nHow Beryl grew:Hurricane Beryl, super-charged by warm seas, stuns experts\n\nHurricane Beryl's quick emergence a 'massive warning sign'\n\nAn explosive increase in wind speeds, a record for the strongest hurricane this early in the season. Those are ominous signs of what weather experts see as danger ahead in what is expected to be a hyperactive season for major storms.\n\nHurricane Beryl's stunning transformation from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in less than 42 hours has meteorologists reaching out for superlatives and issuing warnings. This is only the seventh time such a quick rise in category has occurred with an Atlantic storm, and never before had it happened before Sept. 1, the heart of the hurricane season.\n\n\"Buckle up. It could be a challenging few months ahead,\" said chief science officer Steve Bowen of Gallagher Re, a reinsurance firm. \"This is a massive warning sign for the rest of the season.\"\n\nCould Hurricane Beryl hit the US coast?\n\nAfter watching Beryl spin up from a tropical depression to a hurricane in a little more than 40 hours, and then slam into the Windward Islands, the big question on the minds of millions of U.S. residents is where the storm could be next weekend and whether it will still be a hurricane.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no clear answer yet, and may not be for a couple of days.\n\nOn Monday evening, the National Hurricane Center’s forecast track showed Beryl as a tropical storm near the Mexican coast on Saturday afternoon.\n\n“There’s a lot of variables that could occur that can change the direction of a tropical storm, especially when it’s several days out,” said Tawnya Evans, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service field office in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nWindy conditions over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico could prevent Beryl from maintaining its hurricane status.\n\nA high-pressure ridge sitting over the Gulf could be the deciding factor. If it holds strong, Beryl would continue a more westward track. If the ridge shifts eastward, Beryl could move more northward and potentially threaten the Gulf Coast.\n\nRegardless of its strength or location in the Gulf next weekend, Beryl could bring an increased risk of showers and thunderstorms, along with swells and rip currents to the Texas coast, Corpus Christi’s forecast stated on Monday.\n\nPuerto Rico forecast to see large swells\n\nThe hurricane center expects Beryl to remain a hurricane as it reaches Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday.\n\n\"The most likely scenario is for the storm to move westward into Mexico,\" DaSilva said. \"However, it is very important to note that if the high pressure across the Southeast weakens, that can allow the storm to move farther north and potentially directly impact the Gulf Coast.\"\n\nThe storm is likely to have some impact on Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory that is home to more than 3 million American citizens. The hurricane center said the island can expect large swells that cause \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions'' in the next day.\n\n'Full panic mode' in Barbados\n\nAbe and Kristin Homan woke up Monday to the crash of waves on barrier islands just a short walk from their hotel on the southwestern coast of Barbados. From their window, they watched as fierce winds uprooted trees and sent debris flying.\n\n“It’s pretty intense,” Abe Homan, 46, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Homans arrived on the island Tuesday. What started “as a beautiful vacation,” made a dramatic turn over the weekend when the couple realized the severity of the storm, and people “went into full panic mode,” Homan said. They searched for a way back to South Carolina on Sunday, but it was too late. The planes were fully booked and the airport was soon shut down. Back at the Sandals resort, stranded vacationers and some of the staff were distraught.\n\n“They were just so confused, and almost crying,” said Abe Homan, who runs a technology company based in his home state.\n\nLater Monday, the Barbados government discontinued the hurricane warning. Now, the Homans are hoping to return to their four children in South Carolina by the Fourth of July.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nBeryl on the move:Hurricane Beryl an 'extremely dangerous' Cat 4 storm as it roars toward Caribbean\n\nGrenada authorities warn residents to stay indoors\n\nDr. Terence Walters, the national disaster coordinator for Grenada, urged residents to gather documents and put them and other necessities in plastic bags. Walters, speaking at a briefing early Monday, warned residents not to go outside but said Beryl could damage or destroy some homes. Even if a house suffers damage, residents might be safer hiding in a bathroom rather than making a run for a government shelter, Walters said. About 3,000 people were in shelters awaiting the storm, he said.\n\n\"If your house is damaged or destroyed, you have to use good judgment before you make a decision to get to safety,\" he said.\n\nBarbados weather worsens: 'Do not go anywhere'\n\nIn Barbados, about 160 miles northeast of Carriacou, Home Affairs and Information Minister Wilfred Abrahams told residents “do not go anywhere until the all clear is given.\" Abrahams said some power lines were down and some of the island's 280,000 people were in the dark. More than 35,000 homes and businesses − about a quarter of Barbados Light & Power customers − were without power, the company said.\n\nThe worst of the storm has passed, but more damage was expected, Abrahams said. A \"drone team\" was ready to survey the island and help determine where work crews will be sent, he said.\n\nAbrahams said the sun was coming out and he could see from comments on social media that many people were anxious about what happened.\n\n“I know in the day of social media, everybody wants to be first to get something out,\" he told Barbados Today. \"You want to be the first to have a video. You want to be the first to show something, you want to be first to show house damage. Don’t do that in a way that might cost you your life.\"\n\nRiding out Hurricane Beryl in St. Lucia: 'We'll just kind of wing it'\n\nAmong those hunkering down for the storm was Linda Dancer, a travel agent from Charlotte, North Carolina, who arrived in St. Lucia on Saturday for an award ceremony. Over the last two days, she's watched as staff at the Sandals Grande St. Lucian resort installed plywood over windows, laid out sandbags and removed chandeliers. Dancer, 63, planned on staying in her room as the hurricane lashed the island.\n\n“It was really sunny this morning, but we have outer bands coming in so it’s getting gray and darker out now,” she told USA TODAY. “I’m not taking my eyes off the weather app.”\n\nWhile stocking her fridge at a Sandals resort on the west side of the island, Dancer has also been coordinating with clients whose vacations and honeymoons have been interrupted by the hurricane.\n\n“Some of them … they're scared but you can’t leave at this point,” she said. “Some are like, ‘It's not that big a deal, we'll just kind of wing it.’”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?\n\nRapid intensification is a process in which a storm undergoes accelerated growth. The phenomenon is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone (whether a tropical storm or hurricane) intensifying by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.\n\n\"Rapid intensification occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an extremely conducive environment,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. \"Typically, this environment consists of very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture.\"\n\nWhat are the Windward Islands?\n\nThe Windward Islands are the group of Caribbean islands in the eastern part of the Caribbean Sea. They include Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada. Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago are sometimes included in the group.\n\nThey are called \"windward\" − which means upward from a given point − because they are more windward to arriving ships than the Leeward Islands.\n\nDowngraded Tropical Storm Chris still a threat in Mexico\n\nTropical Storm Chris, the third named storm of the season, eased to tropical depression status after crashing across the Mexican coastline near Veracruz overnight. The storm was forecast to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches across parts of eastern Mexico earlier Monday, with maximum rainfall totals around 12 inches in higher terrain of the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi.\n\n\"This rainfall will result in areas of flooding, with mudslides possible in areas of higher terrain,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nWhat is the 2024 hurricane season forecast?\n\nFederal forecasters have predicted a hurricane season unlike any other, with as many as 25 named storms possible.\n\nIt is the most storms the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has ever predicted in a preseason outlook. \"All the ingredients are in place for an active season,\" National Weather Service director Ken Graham said in May.\n\nNOAA director Rick Spinrad said the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be \"extraordinary\" − an 85% chance for an above-average year. \"The forecast … is the highest NOAA has ever issued for the May outlook,\" he said.\n\nHurricane Beryl Spaghetti models\n\nHurricane Beryl Trajectory\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice and Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/08/debby-tropical-storm-updates/74716296007/", "title": "Debby storm updates: Carolinas hit with 'life threatening' flooding", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Tropical Storm Debby's remnants for Thursday, Aug. 8. For the latest news on the storm, view our story for Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nThough no longer a tropical storm, now-Tropical Depression Debby was still dropping copious amounts of rain on eastern states Thursday evening as the Northeast braces for the system's arrival.\n\nDebby, still a tropical storm at the time, made its second U.S. landfall around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, just northeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. In a matter of hours, over half a foot of rain had fallen in parts of central North Carolina, causing \"life-threatening flash flooding\" as waterways crested, turning roads into rivers.\n\nDebby is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain − some areas could get up to 15 inches − across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday, bringing \"considerable to locally catastrophic flash flooding impacts,\" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. All told, rain totals in some parts of South Carolina could exceed 2 feet.\n\nCaught in Hurricane Debby's winds: A migrating bird named Suwannee 22 ended up where she started\n\nDebby's sustained winds were down to 30 mph by 11 p.m. ET. In the days ahead, the storm is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves north, bringing up to 6 inches of rain from Maryland to Vermont. Flood watches throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions were set to activate Thursday evening and last through Friday night.\n\nAcross Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, Debby drenched communities in over a foot of rain, breaking several decades-old records. Flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads, and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least seven people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nDebby tracker map:Where is Tropical Storm Debby? Maps track path, flooding, rain, where it already hit\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Millions of people from southeast Georgia up through the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia were under tornado watches.\n\n∎ Virginia's Department of Emergency Management warned residents to stay aware of possible tornadoes Thursday and Friday. \"Tropical Storm Debby has the potential to create tornadoes, with the threat potentially lasting through the overnight hours,\" the post said.\n\n∎ Cleanup crews have cleared over 245 miles of road and eight acres of debris across Florida, according to the state's Division of Emergency Management. Emergency responders in high-water vehicles and on foot rescued at least 120 people trapped by floodwaters.\n\nDeath toll rises to at least 7 after tornado kills man in North Carolina\n\nA man in Wilson County, North Carolina, was found dead in his home after a tornado touched down in the area, bringing Debby's death toll to at least seven.\n\nStephen Mann, director of communication for Wilson County, told USA TODAY on Thursday that a twister tore through the outskirts of Lucama, a town 35 miles southeast of Raleigh, sometime before 3 a.m. A middle school, a church and four homes sustained structural damage. Inside one of the homes, a search and rescue team discovered the body of an adult male, Mann said.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper met with local officials at Springfield Middle School to assess the damage and posted photos to social media Thursday. They showed piles of debris outside a heavily damaged building, with about half of the roof missing as insulation foam spilled out, and a collapsed wall that exposed what appeared to be the remnants of a classroom.\n\nOfficials have tied Debby to at least six other deaths, five in Florida and one in Georgia. In the southern Georgia city of Moultrie, a tree fell onto a home, killing a 19-year-old, Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday. In Florida, two adults and a child were killed in fatal vehicle accidents; also, a 13-year-old boy died after a fallen tree landed on a mobile home; and officials on Tuesday found the body of a boater who had been missing near the city of Gulfport.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, officials confirmed a tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. A suspected tornado was also reported in Pender County. Across South Carolina and Florida, Debby spawned eight tornadoes earlier this week.\n\nAt historic North Carolina inn, 'it's literally raining inside'\n\nThursday quickly became a tough day at work for hotel manager Elise Tyler, when the ceiling of the Colonial Inn in Hillsborough, North Carolina, began to leak rainwater and drain systems couldn’t keep up with the heavy downpour.\n\n“We are on the verge of flooded,” said Tyler, 37. “Several areas of the inn are dripping and it’s literally raining inside.”\n\nThe 200-year-old building had not lost power, but the lights were flickering, Tyler said. Nearby roads were closed because of flooding and some staff who lost power at their homes took advantage of empty hotel rooms to shower and charge their phones, she said.\n\nThe Colonial is located in a historic block of Hillsborough, close to the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and the building was pillaged by Union troops, according to the hotel's website.\n\nKnown for its restaurant’s weekend brunch, the inn got a lot of customers Wednesday, Tyler said, likely because people were anticipating hunkering down Thursday – when only “one brave soul” came in for lunch.\n\nForecasters eye another system in the Atlantic\n\nJust as Debby continues to pound the East Coast, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are also keeping an eye on a developing system near the Caribbean islands.\n\n\"An area of low pressure could form in the central or western tropical Atlantic Ocean early next week,\" the center said in an online forecast released Thursday morning. \"Some development of this system is possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week and moves generally west-northwestward toward the Greater Antilles thereafter.\"\n\nThe system has a 30% chance of becoming a tropical depression or named storm within the next week. The next name on the 2024 storm list is Ernesto. It's far too soon to determine whether the system will impact any land areas, including the U.S.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nDebby's latest rainfall totals\n\nRainfall reports show more than a dozen locations in the Southeast where Debby has dropped at least a foot of rain since Saturday, causing widespread flooding from Florida to North Carolina. Below are some preliminary selected rain totals from the National Weather Service.\n\nFlorida:\n\nLake City: 19.67 inches\n\nParrish: 18.86 inches\n\nLakewood Ranch: 18.34 inches\n\nSarasota: 17.78 inches\n\nEllenton: 14.60 inches\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nSummerville: 18.25 inches\n\nMount Pleasant: 17.70 inches\n\nGreen Pond: 17.43 inches\n\nLoris: 15.89 inches\n\nCharleston Airport: 10.35 inches\n\nGeorgia:\n\nOliver: 14.82 inches\n\nRincon: 13.87 inches\n\nBelville: 13.59 inches\n\nRocky Ford: 11.63 inches\n\nSavannah Airport: 10.10 inches\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nKings Grant: 15.25 inches\n\nShallotte: 13.05 inches\n\nElizabethtown: 10.71 inches\n\nHolden Beach: 10.28 inches\n\nWilmington Airport: 8.57 inches\n\nPower outages in NC down to 60,000\n\nMore than 25,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina were without power Thursday night, a major improvement from 60,000 customers just a few hours earlier as crews repaired some of the damage caused by Debby. Duke Energy, the state's largest power provider, said Wednesday it had 7,500 linemen and other employees staged across the Carolinas to respond to outages.\n\nBlackouts also diminished in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia, which were all under 2,500 outages by 10 p.m. E.T.\n\nBut as the storm headed north, other states such as Virginia − with 20,000 outages − were feeling its effects. In addition, more than 232,000 homes and businesses were out of power in Ohio, the result of Tuesday's storms impacted by Debby.\n\nWhere is Debby?\n\nDebby gained speed but lost intensity as it moved farther inland Thursday, hours after making its second U.S. landfall, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAccording to an 11 p.m. update, the storm was moving north-northeast at 26 mph. Debby was located 80 miles north-northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina, and 90 miles west-northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, with sustained winds of 30 mph, according to the center.\n\nNorth Carolina resident prepared campground for Debby\n\nIn Raeford, North Carolina, Michelle Morville said her property got a few inches of rain overnight but hasn’t flooded or lost power. “It poured and is still raining here with more to come,” Morville said Thursday morning.\n\nHer campground, Idlewild Farm Stays, is terraced to allow for erosion control so there’s no standing water, Morville said. Rain flows properly down a main driveway during storms, and after the current downpour passes, Morville said she will use a land plane on the road to clear any remaining moisture.\n\nMany people who come to the farm are visiting family members serving in the military on nearby Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, Morville said. This week, she is offering discounted rates to anyone needing to move their camper or RV out of a flood zone.\n\n“Most flooding issues I believe come from a lack of regard for Mother Nature and not planning accordingly to work with her,” Morville said.\n\nReopening begins after flooding cuts off North Carolina town\n\nAuthorities in Bladenboro, North Carolina, began reopening several main roads after the town was completely cut off by floodwaters overnight.\n\n\"Water has receded in some areas. Crews will begin reopening up roads here shortly,\" said a statement on the county's Facebook page. Much of the downtown was still closed as standing water remained several inches deep in some areas.\n\nJust before midnight, as Debby approached the South Carolina coast, a statement on Bladenboro's Facebook page announced, \"Downtown is underwater. We have several street closures out. Please stay off the roads!\" Within an hour, the local fire department said, \"Due to flooded roadways all roads into Bladenboro are closed.\"\n\nAs the heavy rains and tornado threat shifted away from the area toward more northern parts of North Carolina and Virginia, the town has begun to assess the damage and reopen main roads. \"Many secondary roads have not been checked, use caution,\" the fire department warned early Thursday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/08/16/recollections-hurricane-bob-steamrolled-cape-cod-30-years-1991-wind-erosion-damage-wellfleet/5552292001/", "title": "Hurricane Bob: Steamrolled Cape Cod in Aug. 1991 here are our ...", "text": "When Hurricane Bob took aim at Cape Cod in August 1991, I was a punk in my 20s, between jobs and freeloading at my mother's new Wellfleet cottage. It was great. She only came down to the Cape every once in awhile, so there was plenty of time to drink beer, swim and celebrate wasting a college education.\n\nI can't remember how weather forecasters came up with predictions back in those primitive science days — they probably poked at entrails and tea leaves or tossed darts at barometers. But stormy scuttlebutt began crawling through town like a gloomy horseshoe crab: The big one was coming!\n\nWhatever, I thought. Look at these scaredy cats, buying water and bread and filling up their gas tanks. I wasn't going to fall for it. It was summer on Cape Cod and I could sleep until noon, goof off all day and party all night. With that kind of action-packed schedule, there was simply no time to prepare for anything. Keeping bologna in the house was hard enough.\n\nHurricane History: Aug. 19 a disastrous day in USA's hurricane history\n\nThen my mother got wind of Bob. She phoned up and said she was coming to Wellfleet to \"keep an eye on the place\" when this likely teeny tempest puffed over the Cape. Oh, great. Now I had to dredge out the beer cans and pizza crusts before she showed up. But I still got yelled at for my slovenly ways when she rolled in on Aug. 18, 1991.\n\nShe really hit the roof when I told her that my car had run out of gas, and I had left it in the parking lot of the Wellfleet Post Office. I figured I would leave it there until the faux storm passed and then I would hoof over and deal with it. That did not sit well with my mom, and shortly thereafter we were en route to the late, great Jack's Gas in Truro, dispenser of petroleum and frozen Milky Ways.\n\nSo when Aug. 19, 1991 rolled around, my beloved dirt-brown Toyota Celica was ensconced in the little shell driveway at the corner of Main and East Commercial streets in Wellfleet. Boy, I loved that car. No keys necessary — it started with a screwdriver — and you could stuff an elephant in through the hatchback.\n\nBut now the wind was picking up, and even I started to get a little nervous about this Hurricane Bob thing. There wasn't much rain, but suddenly there were these freight trains of air slamming through space and howling like a wolf on a rocket. The sky was filled with leaves and branches, organic confetti, and then there was a giant crack and smash from the courtyard. A giant locust tree had been uprooted and tipped over, crushing a fence and landing right on my Celica!\n\n\"What happened?\" asked my mom.\n\n\"I got Bobbed!\" I replied. Then the power went out.\n\nThus began a dark era in Wellfleet. All afternoon we heard branches breaking and windy chaos. When things died down, we emerged into a broken world and looked at the giant fallen tree. It had crushed the beautiful hatchback on my Toyota!\n\nOn the bright side, the tires weren't flat and it started right up with the twist of a screwdriver. And in the giant root ball of the locust, I found little ancient medicine bottles, probably worth more than the Celica at this point.\n\nMy mom stuck around for about a day, then hightailed it back to the off-Cape Land of Power, where civilized people enjoyed ice in their drinks and watched amazing glowing televisions. But not me. I stuck it out in Wellfleet and became a caveman, surviving on what the ruined countryside could offer.\n\nLife scopes down when the power goes out for a week. Especially when you've got well water and the pump doesn't work. That means toilets don't flush, and earthly delights like showers and shaving are mere memories. All food is consumed at room temperature and I remember sitting in the twilight kitchen, eating beef stew out of a can and thinking, \"Is this all there is?\"\n\nThe weather got hot after Bob passed by. The power stayed off. Chainsaws were the soundtrack of life. Every day I drove my mangled Celica to Long Pond and filled up 5-gallon contractor buckets so I could flush the toilet.\n\nTourists started flowing back into town and onto the beaches. My daily water run had a bigger audience. I could see parents shield their children as this shaggy, unshaven, sometimes mumbling guy (me) emerged from a crushed car and filled buckets.\n\n\"I am not an animal,\" I shouted, at least in my mind.\n\nNow, when I look back at Bob, with cold beer in my fridge, I sometimes smile and think, \"What crazy memories, maybe it was all worth it.\" Then I think of my beloved Celica, traded for a Saab hubcap shortly after the storm. And I think of the lonely cry of an empty toilet tank. And then I think, \"No way. That was freakin' awful!\"\n\n— Eric Williams\n\nWhen a dog has no place to go during a hurricane, hide him\n\nThe minivan was rocking in the wind when I checked the Cape Cod Times' Hyannis parking lot to see how the van's occupant, my family’s German shepherd, was doing.\n\nSheets of paper and bits of trash flew by.\n\nIt was time for me and my copy chief husband, the late Charlie Hibbert, to sneak our fur baby into the building.\n\nI was five months pregnant with our oldest child, Caroline, and more than happy to ride out Hurricane Bob in the solid red-brick Times building.\n\nNow it was time for dog Nacona to join us, and I wondered how to get her past the brass — editors, assistant publisher and publisher — who had gathered in the newsroom on Main Street for the Cape’s biggest storm in decades and a whopper of a story.\n\nThe first stop was a department that had its own office in the back of the building but was not connected to auxiliary power.\n\nWhen the lights went out, I took advantage of the hubbub to settle Nacona — all 80 pounds of her — in the well under my newsroom desk.\n\nThere she lay, quietly curled up, for the duration of the storm.\n\nNacona wasn’t the only pet secreted away on the premises. A fellow reporter shared the foot space under her desk with a cat in a carrier.\n\nBob passed, leaving a darkened Main Street strewn with electrical wires, a slick coating of leaves and branches, and glass from blown-out windows.\n\nAnd yet inside the newsroom, pizza pies made a miraculous and welcome appearance.\n\nGiven the air of bonhomie and relief — we were alive! — that descended, I decided it was time for Nacona to stretch her limbs.\n\nI should mention that people regularly asked us if Nacona, who had a type of coloring known as sable, was a wolf.\n\nOur assistant publisher opened his eyes wide when he saw our dog looming before him in the glow of generator-produced lighting.\n\nThen he offered her a slice of pizza.\n\n— Cynthia McCormick\n\nFacts about Hurricane Bob, Aug. 18-19, 1991\n\n– Hurricane Bob was the second named storm and first hurricane of the 1991 Atlantic Hurricane Season.\n\n– The storm brushed the Outer Banks on Aug. 18-19, and subsequently intensified into a major Category 3 hurricane. After peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph, Bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of New England.\n\n– The eye of Hurricane Bob passed over Block Island, Rhode Island, at approximately 1:30 p.m on Aug. 19, 1991 and made landfall over Newport, Rhode Island, shortly before 2 p.m.\n\n– Hurricane Bob brought sustained hurricane-force winds to the immediate coastal communities of Rhode Island and most of southeast Massachusetts. Wind damage to trees and utility poles was common and resulted in numerous power outages.\n\n– Coastal communities bore the brunt of the storm, with sustained winds between 75 to 100 mph. Peak wind gusts to 125 mph were recorded on Cape Cod in the towns of Brewster and North Truro. The highest sustained wind of 100 mph was recorded in North Truro.\n\n– Hurricane Bob drove an ocean surge of 10 to 15 feet into Buzzards Bay. The Buzzards Bay shore east to Cape Cod was hardest hit. The highest surges, of 12 to 15 feet, were observed in Onset, Bourne, Mashpee and Wareham, at the head of Buzzard's Bay. On Cove Road, in Mattapoisett, 29 of 37 homes were destroyed.\n\n– Boat damage was significant, as many boats were torn from their moorings. Extensive beach erosion occurred along the shore from Westerly, Rhode Island, eastward. Some south-facing beach locations on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket islands lost up to 50 feet of beach to erosion.\n\n– Bob was responsible for 17 deaths along the Eastern Seaboard. Total damage in Southern New England was estimated at approximately $680 million.\n\nSource: National Weather Service", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2024/07/26/how-delta-airlines-passengers-can-file-claims/74555651007/", "title": "Delta customers lost time, money. How to file claims, complaints.", "text": "Delta Air Lines customers who faced massive delays and cancellations after a global tech outage July 19 triggered all sorts of havoc for days must do one thing after their nightmare ends. File a complaint − and get some money back.\n\nMaybe you think you can't do anything about it. Maybe you think submitting a complaint is a waste of even more time. A friend shared one comment on social media in which a frustrated traveler stated: \"Glad we have zero consumer protection laws on the books to help everyone being psychologically abused by @Delta.\"\n\nBut it's not true. Actually, consumers do have many air travel rights now. Unfortunately, consumers are going to need to file for reimbursement to get what they are owed. And if they're not satisfied, they're going to need to go a step further and file complaints with the Department of Transportation.\n\nCruising Altitude:Why tech keeps holding airlines back when something goes wrong\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Delta CEO Ed Bastian posted a letter to customers on the airline's website as the company continued to recover from last week's CrowdStrike outage. Delta upgraded its reimbursement efforts, too.\n\nBastian apologized but also noted that \"the worst impacts of the CrowdStrike-caused outage are clearly behind us.\"\n\nDelta, he said, remains \"committed to taking care of those whose flights may still be impacted, with meals, hotel accommodations and ground transportation offered through vouchers and reimbursements. We’re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers as a further gesture of apology.\"\n\nDelta also noted online Wednesday that it is taking steps to reimburse out-of-pocket expenses. \"We know many customers have incurred unplanned travel expenses, including purchasing tickets on other airlines, rental cars, train tickets and more,\" the airline said on its site.\n\n\"Delta will cover reasonable costs for additional categories of expenses incurred during the duration of the travel waiver (which currently applies for flights between July 19 and July 28).\"\n\nAnother key point: \"Delta is permitting customers with Delta travel booked from July 19-28 who no longer wish to travel to cancel and request a refund of the unflown portion of their trip − regardless of whether their flight has been canceled or significantly delayed.\"\n\nDelta has been offering waivers, which, according to Delta, allow customers hurt by the troubles to make a one-time change to their itinerary or to cancel and receive a refund for the unused portion of their ticket upon request. The waiver applies to customers with travel scheduled for July 19-28. The fare difference for customers will be waived when rebooked travel occurs on or before Aug. 4 in the same cabin of service as originally booked.\n\nOn Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced an investigation into Delta Air Lines. He noted that the Transportation Department is making sure \"the law is followed and that Delta is 'taking care of its passengers' as the disruptions continue.\"\n\nIn this case, experts say, Transportation Department rules require Delta to refund unused flights for those who choose not to travel on alternate flights if their original itinerary was canceled for any reason, even if the original tickets were nonrefundable. That's true as long as you didn’t get on a rebooked flight at no cost to you, experts say. Some people think they can do both − fly and get a refund − but that's not the case.\n\nJane McNamara, of Royal Oak, Michigan, was to fly out of Detroit on Delta on Friday, heading to Newark to see her sons in New Jersey. She had heard of the CrowdStrike software failure that hit Microsoft's Windows Operating System earlier on Friday. But she had no alerts from Delta via the app or email to tell her the Friday flight was canceled.\n\n\"I drove to the airport hoping I might have a flight,\" she said. \"Once there, after parking in the out lot and making my way to McNamara terminal, I learned it was canceled.\"\n\nShe was shocked by the massive lines and chaos. \"You couldn't get near the (Delta) counter. It was just slammed.\"\n\nShe ended up acting quickly and booked a flight on United Airlines on Saturday. She paid $306, and she had no trouble getting out of Detroit on United the next day.\n\nShe kept the return ticket for Tuesday on Delta. \"I thought by Tuesday, everything should be fine.\"\n\nFor a while, it seemed as if it would be. She checked in Monday and had a boarding pass, the whole thing.\n\nThen, about 6 a.m. Tuesday, she got an alert that her Delta flight out of Newark that day had been canceled.\n\nShe spotted one seat on another Delta flight, but it was quickly gone. Other flights on other airlines that day had fares that were $800 and higher. Some of those flights had layovers of three hours to five hours. Nothing seemed to be doable.\n\nOh, she could sit in New Jersey until Thursday because Delta had rebooked her on a flight for Thursday morning. \"I couldn't hang out there\" that long, she said. \"My only option was to rent a car.\"\n\nMcNamara, who owns Jazzercise Royal Oak, needed to get back to work and ended up renting a car for $152.\n\n\"I literally just had to do a car,\" she said. Driving alone, she left the area about 11 a.m. and got home after 10 p.m. Most of the driving was fine, she said, until she hit the intense storm in metro Detroit. She's now reviewing how to get reimbursed for her expenses.\n\nEven as travel gets back to normal, the shakeout for Delta could be intense in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"There will be hell to pay,\" said Teresa Murray, who directs the Consumer Watchdog office for U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit advocacy group that has advocated for more passenger protections.\n\nThe major IT systems outage disrupted the operations of several major airlines, triggering extensive delays and cancellations at U.S. airports.\n\nThe Transportation Department said it has determined that the delays and cancellations resulting from the CrowdStrike-related outage were “controllable\" − which means the flight cancellation or delay is one that is attributable to the airline.\n\nMurray said Delta's response in individual situations seems to have been all over the map. Some consumers, she said, complained about being offered only frequent flier miles when they needed more help getting where they needed to go in a timely manner. One young man she knows, who happens to be a magician from Michigan, had to rent a car to drive to Philadelphia to be on time for his show. Her advice: Make sure to send the bill to Delta.\n\nDaniel Martin, a global touring magician who lives in Jackson, told me his horrific tale that involved two Delta flights vanishing.\n\nOne flight ended up being canceled Friday when he was trying to leave Hartford, Connecticut, to fly to Detroit for a show in Michigan; a second flight was canceled when he needed to fly from Detroit to Philadelphia on Monday for another show.\n\nHe said the Delta employees he encountered were trying to help, but it was out of their control.\n\nMartin, who has a summer tour as a magician, had a show last week in New Hampshire, and he had planned on driving to Bradley International Airport in Hartford to catch that flight to Detroit. He travels a great deal, but all the regular steps, like going on Delta.com, didn't work Friday for rebooking a flight. \"You couldn't even get on their site to figure out options.\"\n\nTrying to call, even as a preferred customer, meant a six-hour wait. He quickly booked a Friday night flight on Southwest Airlines as a hedge. Then he headed to the airport and got in line at Delta. After turning down many bad options, he ultimately was able to get on another Delta flight, which sat on the tarmac. That flight faced so many delays that he figured he should hop on Southwest. Ultimately, he was able to get off that flight with help of Delta employees to rush to grab the backup Southwest flight.\n\nAs for his luggage? Well, it was on the Delta flight. He faced a four-hour delay in Detroit at baggage claim to get his magic equipment. \"It was like the zombie apocalypse,\" Martin said.\n\nUltimately, he got home to Jackson at 5 a.m. Saturday, but he had missed his magic show Friday in Michigan.\n\nMonday morning, another Delta flight delay, this time out of Detroit to Philadelphia. He made that show but only by spending $250 to rent a car.\n\nOverall, Martin estimates he lost more than 35 hours in delays and about $600 in expenses. That's not including the thousands of dollars lost when he missed the show in Michigan.\n\nOne headache after another, and, frankly, travelers will need to take their time figuring out what to do next to recoup some of their costs.\n\nIn general, PIRG's Murray said, she would not recommend that people accept vouchers or credits or miles as compensation for their hotel, meal, ground transportation and other expenses.\n\nBut the amount might matter. \"If someone is looking at a refund of $200, but Delta is offering miles or vouchers worth $1,000 to the traveler, then the voucher or credit might make sense, as long as there aren’t restrictions on how or when or where it can be used,\" she said.\n\nBecause the IT debacle is being viewed by the Transportation Department as a controllable cancellation or delay, Murray said, consumers should try to get a hotel and meal and ground transportation accommodations taken care of by the airline. \"They can’t just go out and book a hotel at a 5-star hotel or something.\"\n\nBut in many cases, travelers couldn't even get Delta on the phone. In those circumstances, Murray said, her advice would be to \"spend what is reasonable, to take care of yourself and your family, and submit those expenses for reimbursement later.\"\n\nHow do you submit a claim?\n\nCheck with your airline, but typically you'd submit claims online, not by mail.\n\nWhere to go: Delta has an online process. See Delta.com/reimbursement for the form and some instructions.\n\nDelta has an online process. See Delta.com/reimbursement for the form and some instructions. What to do: Before you do submit a claim, take time gathering your paperwork and records. Make sure when you file for reimbursement with Delta or another airline that you have receipts, records and all you need to back up a claim. File everything at once, Murray said. Take screen shots from your phone if that can help document how long you were on hold with the airline. Find the names of people you talked with at the airline. Recall what was said during a conversation. Give details about how lines were backed up and you couldn't get to an airline representative.\n\nBefore you do submit a claim, take time gathering your paperwork and records.

Their motorized descendants, however, are now popular among adults.\n\nLast year, Americans took 38.5 million trips on shared scooters in more than 100 cities, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), a nonprofit organization. Those trips accounted for almost half of the 84 million trips – more than doubled from 2017 – taken on “shared micro-mobility” options that also include station-based bikes and dockless bikes.\n\nAs people look for ways to get around congested cities faster, scooters have gained in popularity. But their emergence has drawn criticism that the vehicles are risky both for riders and pedestrians.\n\nSome cities, such as Chicago, launched pilot programs for sharing scooters in June, eyeing the potential to ease congestion and pollution brought by cars. Portland, Oregon, launched a 120-day pilot program last year and a one-year program this year that started in April. New York State passed a bill in June to legalize the vehicle, though renting them is prohibited in Manhattan – you have to own one to ride it.\n\nBut some cities said no, or at least not now. Last month, Chattanooga, Tennessee, issued a six-month ban of the conveyance. San Francisco and Beverly Hills once took similar approaches. Nashville's mayor called for a ban on the vehicle following the city's first scooter-related death, but the Metro Council rejected the plan - the legislative institute decided to reduce scooter fleets instead.\n\nCity officials and residents have conflicting attitudes toward electric scooters. And in many places, its regulation still falls into gray areas.\n\nWhy people love electric scooters\n\nYou can easily ride a scooter, with a top speed of 15 to 30 mph, to the nearest subway stop a mile away or other destinations 5 miles out, and travel faster than cars during rush hour. Unlike bikes, they can keep you from getting sweaty before you arrive at work or to meet friends. Many people rode scooters in childhood, which makes them familiar and appealing for commuters.\n\nAfter scooter startup Bird deployed its first fleet in September 2017, bike-sharing companies Spin (acquired by Ford last November) and Lime, and ride-hailing giant Lyft and Uber dipped their toes into the scooter market by launching their own fleets last year. Other key players include Skip and Scoot, which was acquired by Bird in June.\n\nThe scooter startups have raised more than $1.5 billion in funding and the global market is expected to reach about $40 billion to $50 billion by 2025, according to Boston Consulting Group.\n\n“People are just trying to find ways of getting from A to B faster,” said Rasheq Zarif, Deloitte's leader in future of mobility tech. It is kind of a \"prime time\" for ride-hailing and micro-mobility transportation, he said, with the prevalence of smartphones and advancement of technology like GPS, as more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas that are crowded with cars.\n\nSafety:Electric scooters sending lots of riders to emergency rooms with injuries\n\nScooter hazards: safety and parking\n\nCity officials opposing scooters cited safety as their major concern and worry they would block sidewalks if they were parked inappropriately, impeding pedestrians and people with disabilities.\n\nAfter electric scooters were introduced, several hospitals at various locations saw spikes in scooter-related injuries at their emergency rooms. Since the fall of 2017, at least eight scooter riders have died and 1,500 have been injured, according to Consumer Reports. Emily Hartridge, a TV host and YouTube star, died after her electric scooter crashed with a truck in London. Last week, a person in Atlanta died in a crash with an oil truck while riding a scooter.\n\nDespite the news, experts said there were limitations in existing data, which may not be enough to justify scooter bans. Most research into scooter-related injuries didn’t provide the total number of rides, said Alex Epstein, director of transportation safety at the National Safety Council. They also didn’t compare the injury rates with that of other vehicles, he added, considering scooters are replacing some cars and bikes.\n\n“You don’t have a sense of what is happening citywide. All you have is a sense of what the injuries are,” he said. “People have to realize that operating any motorized vehicle is inherently dangerous and that it is up to the driver to operate the vehicle in a safe way.”\n\nMotor vehicle crashes are tracked by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, but no entities follow scooter-related injuries in a similar way, which also adds to the difficulty to collect enough quantifiable data, said Deloitte’s Zarif.\n\nKevin Fang, a professor at Sonoma State University said the parking issues around scooters are “a bit overblown”, after studying where the vehicles were parked in San Jose, California, with his fellow researchers. He said though most of the vehicles were parked on the sidewalk, they stand either “on the edge” of it or in the so-called \"Furnish Zone\" that is already blocked by benches and planter boxes.\n\nSafety:E-scooters now seem less likely to run people off sidewalks\n\nCompanies built 'safer' scooters\n\nScooter service providers are working to address the problems, as well. They have distributed free helmets, held safety training, and are developing their own models, which the companies said are \"more durable\", though most operators started the business by sourcing from the few Chinese suppliers.\n\nLast year, Lime “voluntarily pulled” an unknown number of scooters from its fleets twice due to safety concerns. One was because some Segway Ninebot products' batteries were destabilized \"largely by misuse\" and another related to manufacturer Okai’s baseboards being broken \"when subjected to repeated abuse,\" the company said.\n\nLime once used many different manufacturers for its scooter production, according to a company spokesperson. All of Lime's scooters in use now, including its Generation 2.5 and 3.0, were designed completely in house, the person said. The two generations were both launched in October last year.\n\nSecurity:Hackers can gain full control over Xiaomi electric scooter, security group finds\n\nAfter sourcing most of its scooters from Xiaomi and Segway Ninebot, Bird has launched its own models Bird Zero last October, Bird One in May, and Bird Two earlier this month. “We saw kind of how those initial vehicles performed, and we felt that we could build something that was more durable, safer and sustainable,” said Rebecca Hahn, Bird's chief communications officer.\n\nIn addition to the dockless scooters for sharing on the streets, Bird One is also available for purchase at $1,299 and for monthly rental at $25 per month in San Francisco, to “meet the needs of different use cases and in different cities,” said Hahn.\n\nBoosted, a startup founded in 2012 that debuted with its flagship electric skateboards, is a newcomer to the market. The company touts its latest product Boosted Rev, which started shipping last month, has “vehicle-grade durability.”\n\nIts electric scooter has a top speed of 24 mph, can go up to 22 miles on a single charge and has three brakes, including an electronic one, according to the company. It costs $1,599, compared with Segway and Xiaomi’s scooters that range from $400 to $800.\n\n“We've adopted a lot of the fire safety and impact and durability standards from the automotive industry for electric cars and adopted them to the standards we've built,” said Boosted’s CEO Jeff Russakow, who compared the company’s approach in electric scooters to Tesla's.\n\nDifferent from other providers, however, Boosted aims to sell its scooters directly to consumers, saying owning instead of sharing helps reduce safety and parking issues. Russakow said riders who own a scooter are more likely to wear a helmet and educate themselves before going on the streets. They can also take the vehicle to the office and fold it under the desk, instead of parking down the roads, he added.\n\nOwn or share? What's next?\n\nExperts said it is still too early to say whether sharing or owning will prevail.\n\n\"When you see that kind of adoption, it's quite attractive to find other forms of business models in order to capture some sort of share,\" said Zarif. He estimates that within next year, companies will come up with new forms of micro-mobility vehicles other than electric scooters to offer commuters more choices.\n\nFang said there might be markets for both buying and sharing. But to accommodate the scooters and other micro-mobility options, cities need better infrastructure, he said, such as enough bike lanes, which are ideal for scooter riders who might feel unsafe riding with cars that go 25 to 40 miles per hour on main roads but would endanger pedestrians on sidewalks.\n\nCities are adapting fast though, Zarif argued. “It's getting there. I mean, think of it as when the first car got in the road over a hundred years ago,” he said. “The roads weren't built for the cars, but eventually they started building the right infrastructure.\"\n\nFollow Frances Yue on Twitter: @FrancesYue_.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/05/ford-focus-fiesta-dps-6-transmission-problems/2617601001/", "title": "Ford workers: Focus, Fiesta DPS6 transmission problems were ...", "text": "DETROIT – They knew the truth and kept quiet.\n\nTheir secret wasn’t a secret at all in engineering, product development, research, design or manufacturing within Ford Motor Co., say seven current and former employees who worked to develop and launch the Fiesta and Focus cars that would become known for defective automatic transmissions.\n\n“My hands are dirty. I feel horrible,” said an engineer who played a key role in developing the popular compact cars.\n\n“You think of the gentleman who stood up for the space shuttle Challenger, saying if they launched that with the ice on it that it’s going to blow up. Well, these kinds of really horrific technical errors seemed to pass right through at Ford on this project,” the engineer said.\n\nAsked whether the company ignored early warnings from its experts, Ford said the \"vehicles were safe when they were introduced after rigorous testing during development, and remain so today after more than a decade on the road and billions of miles accumulated by customers around the globe.\"\n\nMore:Ford knew Focus, Fiesta models had flawed transmission, sold them anyway\n\nThe engineer said: “We’d raise our hands and be told, ‘Don’t be naysayers.’ We got strange comments. It seemed the ship had sailed. After that, if you ask questions, you’re accused of mutiny, so you put your head down and make it work. Good people tried to make it work. But you can’t violate the laws of physics. It’s a mechanical catastrophe.”\n\nHe was referring to the DPS6 dual-clutch \"PowerShift\" transmission used in 2 million Focus and Fiesta cars sold this decade that is the subject of massive litigation and a federal criminal fraud probe.\n\n\"It was cheap to make and cheap to assemble,\" the engineer said, but because the DPS6 used \"dry\" clutch technology, it couldn't cool itself, ensuring failures in real-world use.\n\nA Detroit Free Press investigation published in July found that Ford knew the DPS6 was defective before putting it on the market and later rejected a plan to stop using it.\n\nAfter publication of the \"Out of Gear\" investigation, Ford insiders reached out to provide previously unseen company documents and firsthand accounts about the cars’ development and the company’s efforts to cover up the problems. The sources and documents describe a fearful atmosphere within Ford that led to silence and, in one case, downgrading the risk assessment of the DPS6 clutch and control unit \"due to political reasons.\"\n\nThe vehicles have saddled the company with an estimated $3 billion in warranty costs plus legal expenses from thousands of lawsuits – losses still adding up as court cases play out and customers continue to report problems, including in weekly calls and emails to the Free Press. A month after publication of Out of Gear, Ford extended the clutch warranty on about 600,000 of the cars not covered by a 2014 extension. In October, Ford cited that extended warranty relief as a factor denting company profits.\n\nOn top of everything, U.S. Department of Justice fraud investigators opened a probe into Ford's conduct involving the transmission dating to 2010. It subpoenaed material earlier this year seeking to learn whether the company knew the transmissions were defective and couldn't be fixed and whether it lied to federal safety regulators.\n\n'A life of its own'\n\nEngineers and others involved in the Fiesta and Focus programs told the Free Press that speaking up during development of the vehicles was fruitless. They say they feared losing their jobs during the dramatic economic downturn that chased General Motors and Chrysler into bankruptcy.\n\n“This thing, in engineering terms, had its own momentum,” said a veteran engineer who attended hundreds of meetings involving the vehicles. “All of a sudden, the project took on a life of its own, and off it went.”\n\nThe low-priced vehicles, introduced when gas was touching $4 a gallon and Americans were reeling from the Great Recession, were marketed as having the fuel economy and acceleration of a manual transmission with the operational ease of an automatic. Today, thousands of owners are suing because they have taken their cars to repair shops so often. A class-action settlement valued at $35 million is under review in U.S. District Court in California to determine whether it is fair to owners. About 13,000 individual lawsuits are pending.\n\nMany of the vehicles shudder, sometimes violently, and can shift erratically, accelerate unevenly and lurch unpredictably. The transmissions are designed to default to neutral when certain problems occur, which causes drivers to lose drive power. Consumers have filed more than 4,300 complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that include reports of 50 injuries, but both Ford and NHTSA regulators say the vehicles do not pose an unreasonable safety risk. The cars have never been recalled for transmission repair.\n\nFord says the litigation is the work of greedy lawyers eager to line their pockets through frivolous claims. The company alleges that the Free Press investigation is driven by those lawyers when it in fact arises from Ford whistleblowers and hundreds of consumers from across the country.\n\n\"Selecting and attempting to draw conclusions from a few documents out of millions turned over to trial lawyers distorts the facts,\" spokesman Said Deep said in a statement to the Free Press on Monday. \"Government agencies in the U.S. and globally have repeatedly looked at DPS6 data and have not found a safety issue.\"\n\nFrom July through November, the Free Press interviewed engineers in product development and others who took part in bringing the cars to market. These experts outlined serious transmission issues identified prior to the manufacture and sale of the vehicles.\n\nDivided we fall? Americans see our angry political debate as 'a big problem'\n\n‘What are you thinking?’\n\nThe transmissions were introduced in the 2011 model year Fiesta, which went to dealerships in the spring of 2010, and 2012 Focus, which went on the market a year later. They were used until the Focus was discontinued with the 2018 model year and through the 2019 Fiesta model year.\n\nAmong things the Department of Justice Fraud Division investigation seeks to learn, according to a grand jury subpoena obtained by the Free Press in November, is whether Ford knew that the DPS6 transmissions were defective “and could not be repaired or made to comply with Ford’s warranty obligations and/or with the owner’s reasonable expectations.”\n\nThe status of the grand jury investigation is unknown; the agency declined to comment. Asked about the probe, Ford said that it routinely cooperates with authorities.\n\nThe seven Ford insiders interviewed for this article include engineers present for planning meetings as far back as 2006, and some people still employed by the company. One engineer still has his paper calendar entries listing who attended crisis meetings in 2010.\n\nThey shared detailed experiences on the condition that they not be named because they fear being identified could threaten their current jobs and their ability to work in the auto industry in the future. Information the insiders provided in separate interviews was consistent with each others’ accounts and with internal Ford documents and emails the Free Press obtained during its investigation.\n\nSome of the engineers and product designers say they agreed to talk because spouses and religious advisers suggested it might help ease feelings of guilt and their worry about the safety of drivers today.\n\n\"I told one friend if he loved his stepdaughter, he'd get her out of that Fiesta as quick as possible,\" one of the company's mechanical experts said on Nov. 25. \"I wouldn't put my kid in one of those cars.\"\n\nAbout 1.5 million of the cars remain registered in the United States.\n\nAn engineer said, “We saw problems with this transmission design years before production.”\n\nDuring development, thermal testing showed the transmissions' limits, and Ford began working on software in an attempt to mitigate the problems.\n\nAt the root of the problem was Ford’s decision to use dry clutch technology for the transmission. The guts of a dual-clutch transmission are more like a manual than a conventional automatic transmission, but the driver does not have to shift gears. These transmissions can improve fuel economy and weigh less than a conventional automatic – and also are less expensive to build.\n\nThere are two kinds of dual-clutch transmissions: wet-clutch and dry-clutch. The difference is whether oil lubricates the clutches. The DPS6 was a dry-clutch design.\n\n“What in the world are you thinking going with a dry clutch?” one engineer asked. “The friction coefficient is inconsistent, and it creates problems. But this was someone’s baby. If a manager came up with an idea, people would be afraid to say no. At first, it was just on paper. Someone should have said something. They should have. The idea should’ve been killed. No one knew how it was even considered – and then implemented – in the Focus and Fiesta.\n\n“But they got to this point in the product development cycle where Ford realized they passed the point of no return. They spent a ton of money, and here’s this giant problem,” the engineer said. “How do you solve it? They had implemented the flawed transmission, and any fix was going to be super expensive.\"\n\nFord lawyers did raise at least one worry early on: the potential for the transmission to slip into neutral without warning. Ford’s Office of General Counsel in 2008 challenged engineers on the risk, arguing that the condition could lead to costly recalls if the technology was used for the first time in mass production vehicles.\n\nMore:US fraud prosecutors demand Ford Focus, Fiesta documents\n\nFord secretly tells dealers:Fix faulty Focus, Fiesta transmissions until July 19\n\nWe meant for that to happen\n\nAddressing lawyers’ concerns, Ford quality supervisor Johann Kirchhoffer wrote in an email on June 27, 2008, that stalling “alone is not hazardous.”\n\n“We have evidence that VW had a recall of a number of (similar) transmissions with a potential ‘Unintended Neutral’ occurring with low volumes,” he wrote. “We are pursuing any effort to reduce the occurrence of an ‘Unintended Neutral’ event to a so-called ‘Broadly Acceptable level.’”\n\nThe solution, engineers told the Free Press, was to make neutral an intended fail safe to keep a transmission from burning up or locking up from overheating or an electrical communications glitch. The company has consistently maintained that the neutral state is not a safety hazard because the car doesn't lose steering, braking or turn signals.\n\nThe whistleblowing engineers told the Free Press the strategy was extraordinary and a poor approach.\n\n\"It was just a Band-Aid,\" an engineer said.\n\nIn other automatic transmissions, Ford had used a \"limp home\" strategy, so if something wasn't working right, the car would have some “tractive” force. Engineers would install technology to limit engine speed and torque but a driver could still get some power from pushing the accelerator.\n\nThe engineers said defaulting to neutral is unsafe. Several Free Press interviews with drivers and complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration describe terror from the experience of losing acceleration on the highway or, for example, when merging onto a freeway.\n\nThe neutral state was explored in depth during development and clearly was seen as a potential defect, a key engineer said.\n\nIt became a focus of attention again in 2014, the same year NHTSA questioned Ford about the transmissions.\n\nRoger Pline, DPS6 transmission system supervisor in Livonia, Michigan, emailed Kirchhoffer on April 2, 2014: “Please send me the portion of the System FMEA that deals with MAM issues and the need to open the clutches. Need tonight or tomorrow.”\n\nGlossary:\n\n“Open the clutches” refers to, in effect, putting the transmission in neutral.\n\n“FMEA” is failure mode and effects analysis, a system used by automakers and suppliers meant to ensure that potential problems have been addressed during product development. It includes a risk assessment system that ranks the severity of potential problems from 1 (“very minor effect”) to 10 (“Failure is hazardous and occurs without warning … involves noncompliance with government regulations.”). In DPS6 discussions, engineers abbreviate severity as SEV.\n\n“MAM” is the mechatronic actuation module, which controls the DPS6’s two clutches and shifts the gears.\n\nThe situation had Ford lawyers’ attention. Kirchhoffer’s responses to the April 2 email, which included technical documentation, didn’t satisfy Pline, who emailed with HIGH importance on April 29: “I’ve been through these documents, but have not found what I’m looking for. Can you point me to the location in the FMEA that if the MAM loses power or communication that we open both clutches? I need to show our legal team that this is the proper intended function for this hardware.”\n\nKirchhoffer referred Pline to “final” FMEA severity classifications. The Free Press has corrected typos in an excerpt of Kirchhoffer’s reply: “Please note also that the mechanical FMEAs drive the end electrical failure modes as an effect and carry the highest electrical SEV classification. This drives the MAM up to the highest criticality! On the wiring harness we have kept ‘unintended neutral/roll back’ as SEV 10, which we did NOT on the clutch and MAM due to political reasons. However, we have treated neutral states as SEV 10 item in the background.\n\n“... Please raise the flag if you need more help. I agree – this is a rather complex area!”\n\nWe asked the Ford insiders what Kirchhoffer likely meant by “political reasons.”\n\n“He was being threatened by somebody,” a former senior engineer surmised.\n\n“Somebody might have told him that if you declare the thing a '10,' which would lead to a safety recall,” he would lose the project. If it’s an 8, well, they’ve pulled that on us before. They could keep not being truthful to each other and pretend it would work and then they’d still have jobs. It’s ‘politics’ all through everything on these ratings.”\n\nLater in 2014, amid discussions with NHTSA that focused on the neutral state that Ford blamed on a solder crack, the company extended the drivetrain warranty to seven years/100,000 miles on Focus and Fiestas built before mid-2013 and added a dashboard warning light to tell drivers the transmission is at risk of malfunction. The latter move was described in company documents as something that “will more easily satisfy NHTSA’s requirements.” The agency chose not to open a formal investigation.\n\nFord also has extended the warranty on the transmission control unit to 10 years/150,000 miles.\n\nThis summer, a month after publication of Out of Gear and amid renewed NHTSA scrutiny, Ford extended the drivetrain warranty on cars built between mid-2013 and 2016. Ford remains overwhelmed with repair needs. This fall, Ford dealers have networked in an attempt to find mechanics to work full time on DPS6 repairs.\n\nAmong the issues the Department of Justice is examining is whether Ford misrepresented the nature of DPS6 defects to federal regulators.\n\nA shaky launch\n\nInsiders who drove early production vehicles said serious problems were obvious right away.\n\nHaving worked on the projects for years, one engineer said, “I took a production vehicle home overnight for an evaluation drive. It started warming up and it accelerated away from our parking lot. Fine. Then it stopped at a red light, then I went to accelerate fairly moderately and it felt like I got rear-ended by someone. The car just shot forward and there was a big boom, but no one had hit me. It was the transmission.”\n\nThe company was scrambling, he said. “They needed to get the vehicle on the road while they were still developing software.”\n\nAnother engineer explained the effort: “They had problems with the launch and shift quality. They even had an elaborate program where initial Fiestas had to go on a drive route by Greenfield Village for adaptive learning for the (transmission) control module. It was a panic situation. They were trying to develop software to handle the glitches. Obviously, they were never able to. They were trying to rush software out to deal with the problem of vehicle performance and shifting.”\n\nA veteran engineer described the coding efforts: “They masked things using computer software language. One guy was able to modulate a clutch in a way that torque released so it masked the problem. Management latched onto it. Not only can we mask problems, but we can fake success. They started to write software to mask problems. But there's no way you can software your way out of a physics problem.”\n\nSaid a seasoned mechanical expert on whom Ford depended for project direction, “I was driving a Fiesta during the launch, and it wasn’t right.\"\n\n“It couldn’t figure out what gear it wanted to be in, then it kept hesitating. That sucker would not go into any gear. The transmission revved all the way up and finally found the gear. I had to pull over and swerve so I wouldn’t get hit. It wouldn’t shift. I think it actually dropped into neutral,” he said.\n\n“Everybody knew they had problems,” the mechanical expert said. “They were rushing into production and things weren’t ready yet.”\n\nWhile customers reported transmission problems with the 2011 Fiesta – 313 complaints were filed with federal regulators, a high number – troubles mushroomed with release of the 2012 Focus. The Focus was more than 300 pounds heavier than the Fiesta and demanded more of the transmission. Buyers of the 2012 Focus filed an extraordinary 1,130 transmission complaints with NHTSA and started flooding dealership repair departments. Consumer Reports in October 2011 lowered Ford’s reliability rating, in part because of the transmission.\n\nThat month, secret Ford documents show, the company made a preliminary decision to abandon the transmission, but also noted that the decision would delay launch of future model years, add production and factory costs and reduce fuel economy. The idea was scratched.\n\nA Ford production worker at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne for launch of the 2012 Focus in early 2011 said problems were evident.\n\n“As soon as you’d drive those cars off the line, you’d feel the shuddering,” he said. “Some were way worse than others. We were always told that’s normal. The slipping is normal. I can’t tell you how many times I said something to an engineer on the line. We’d been trying to get it fixed since day one. People like team leaders, regular people on the line, quality inspectors, drivers who would drive the cars, repair people, everyone at the plant knew the transmission was garbage.”\n\nThe production worker is one of many family members who have worked in white- and blue-collar jobs at Ford, people who love the company and are saddened by what's happened. He recalled the tension of the time, with Detroit automakers on life support.\n\n“You didn’t ask questions,” the worker said. “It was right after the recession, right after Ford, GM and Chrysler all basically redid their whole infrastructure of the company and got rid of thousands of people.”\n\nWhile Ford avoided bankruptcy, CEO Alan Mulally had promised bankers that the company would make more fuel-efficient cars, in demand at the time from financially bruised consumers – particularly working-class families toward whom the Focus and Fiesta were aimed. At the same time, the Obama administration was pushing tougher fuel economy standards and automakers faced fines if they didn’t meet them. The DPS6 was a key for Ford.\n\n“That Focus got great gas mileage,” the Michigan Assembly worker said. “They freaking rushed that thing out as fast as possible. They knew about the problems and turned their eye away from it. They didn’t want to deal with it. They would have to worry about engineering, designing and redoing the transmission. The amount of money they would’ve had to cough up would’ve been a huge amount.\n\n“Everybody started to figure it out,” the production worker said. “But Ford ... wanted to keep going. It was a big fiasco.”\n\nInternal emails back him up: Just six months before the 2012 Focus hit the market, product development engineer Tom Langeland emailed colleagues and supervisors describing “nasty launch judder” – intense vibration from a stop – that “did not clear up after many miles of driving.”\n\n“We also cannot achieve a driveable calibration that will get us to production,” he wrote. “The clutch torque delivery MUST BE IMPROVED.”\n\nAccidents and fatalities?\n\nAmong the Justice Department’s lines of inquiry, according to the subpoena obtained by the Free Press, is “whether Ford concealed from owners and/or regulators that the transmission defect(s) and resulting ‘failure modes” (e.g., ‘unintended neutral’/’loss of motive power’) resulted in a dangerous condition(s) that could and/or did cause accidents, injuries and/or fatalities.”\n\nA former Ford hotline worker, who managed internal calls from dealers nationally to the company, questioned how anyone might know if the Fiesta and Focus resulted in injuries or death because reporting is designed to minimize the severity of incidents.\n\nHe showed a Free Press reporter the protocol for internal reporting to illustrate his point.\n\n“They will tell you, ‘Don’t code a certain way.' If you do, using words like wreck or crash or fire, NHTSA gets involved. You don’t say certain things. For example, you never say 'the dealership says,' you always say ‘the customer states.’ You don’t say certain things that make the company liable. So you’d say ‘thermal event’ instead of fire. If you don’t say it the right way on the Ford tech hotline, you won’t have that job for long.”\n\nFord said, \"We encourage our employees to be accurate and concise in all their communications.\"\n\nA mechanical expert who worked inside Ford to troubleshoot the Fiesta and Focus cars said in November, \"Really, I’m surprised no accidents have been attributed to transmission failure where people got hurt. We had a lot of quality issues that year.”\n\nFord insists the cars were and are safe.\n\nA Free Press analysis of consumer complaints to NHTSA found reports of 50 injuries, including incidents when drivers reported cars bolting forward or delayed acceleration as they intended to turn left, leaving them in the path of oncoming vehicles. A key engineer involved in development said those incidents could be consistent with how the transmission behaves.\n\nOne driver reported being T-boned and his elderly wife suffering chest bruising; another said he had a $16,000 medical bill after slamming into a wall in a parking lot; a third said she spent the night in a hospital after a delayed start in a left turn.\n\nA NHTSA spokesman told the Free Press that the agency, charged with protecting the public on roadways, \"has been monitoring the consumer complaints on the Ford DPS6 transmissions for many years. The vast majority of the complaints involved a low or nonexistent level of severity rather than a safety issue warranting further investigation at this time.\"\n\nThe agency's Office of Defects Investigation \"attempted to verify the injury complaints (by reviewing available police reports and insurance claims, as well as interviewing those involved) and found many to be difficult to validate and/or not attributable to the alleged defect.\"\n\nJason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C., said the federal regulatory agency has traditionally been, and remains, an underfunded and understaffed safety agency. \"Even in the best of times, this limits their ability to identify hard to find defects. And these aren’t the best of times.\"\n\nNHTSA has been criticized for its failure to quickly identify defects that led to fatalities from defective General Motors ignition switches, exploding Takata air bag canisters and unintended acceleration in Toyotas.\n\nLevine added: \"Manufacturers have a long history of bending over backward to avoid reporting potential problems as opposed to addressing the issue head on and standing behind their product. The reason that car companies prefer secret settlements is to hide the existence of a potential pattern of defects from the public. While it is difficult to know, whenever there is a secret settlement it is very likely that are other similar settlements because that is the usual course of business when defects result in serious injuries or fatalities.\"\n\nDeath reports\n\nFord reported to federal safety officials at least two traffic deaths that families blamed at least in part on defective DPS6 transmissions, though the carmaker is adamant that neither actually was related.\n\nThe grieving survivors' assertions, one in a lawsuit that Ford settled, the other from parents so upset that they traded their second Fiesta for a truck and \"monstrous payments,\" do not prove that the transmissions had a role in the fatal accidents. The law that required Ford to report them is meant to provide early warning of possible defects and explicitly seeks all such assertions without expecting proof.\n\nNHTSA declined to provide a statement about the deaths after three months of discussion with the Free Press.\n\nDaniel Jackson\n\nOn May 20, 2014, Daniel Jackson of Buena Vista, Tennessee, drove his 2012 Ford Focus west on U.S. Highway 70 with his wife of 38 days in the passenger seat.\n\n“Suddenly and without warning, the Ford Focus darted left across the center line into oncoming traffic. It was struck head on by a wrecker,” according to a lawsuit filed by widow Victoria Jackson, who was severely injured. The lawsuit blames a steering defect and cites transmission problems.\n\nTheir vehicle was “equipped with a data recorder which shows that at or near the time of impact, the vehicle’s transmission shifted from ‘drive’ to first gear,” a filing in the case said, noting “belief the defective transmission was a cause or contributing factor in the accident.”\n\nDaniel Jackson “reasonably expected his new vehicle to be free of defects and that it would not pose an unreasonable and unavoidable safety risk. That after purchasing the vehicle, Mr. Jackson experienced some difficulties with the vehicle’s transmission and took it to Golden Circle on multiple occasions for service and repairs …”\n\nFord in early 2018 settled Victoria Jackson’s claim. The assertion against the Golden Circle dealership, focused on transmission service, was dismissed before the settlement without being litigated. The lawyer for Jackson declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement.\n\nFord said, “Our understanding of the facts indicates that the transmission played no role in the accident. We reported the allegation as required under the TREAD Act regulations.”\n\nTREAD is the Transportation Recall Enhancement Accountability and Documentation Act, passed by Congress in 2000 after the Ford-Firestone tire debacle, which led to 174 deaths. The law is designed to alert federal regulators and automakers to potential defects in hopes of getting them fixed and preventing injury and death.\n\nAutomakers are required, under threat of criminal penalty, “to report any claim or notice of an incident related to death or injury due to an alleged defect,” NHTSA told the Free Press. “While these claims are unverified allegations, and in and of themselves are not evidence of a defect, they may help NHTSA identify a possible defect.”\n\nDonald Ray Wright\n\nOn the clear, dry evening of Saturday, May 25, 2013, Donald Ray Wright was driving one of the two 2011 Fiestas his West Virginia family bought the year before. Traveling on a familiar county road going to a movie with friends, Wright, 20, died instantly when the Fiesta went off the road, hit a tree and flipped.\n\nPassenger Chris Collins told the Free Press it felt like the car was on ice and then grabbed before it went off the road. Police noted skid marks on the road and said no action by the driver contributed to the crash. It said Wright, who according to the police report was wearing his shoulder and lap belt properly, had a clean driving record and no alcohol or other drugs in his system.\n\nPhyllis Wright can’t prove it, but she told the Free Press she believes that the PowerShift transmission in her son’s green Fiesta was responsible for his death. She said the family had complained to the dealer repeatedly about the transmissions in both cars before the accident.\n\nShe and her husband took the remaining Fiesta to a Mid-State Ford in Summersville, West Virginia, for transmission repair a few weeks after losing their son. When they arrived, the dealership had no record of her appointment.\n\n“I started falling apart, and my husband threw down the keys on the counter and told ‘em to keep it, keep the car,” Wright recalled. “By this time, I was hysterical and bawling. I said, ‘Apparently no one can effing help me. One car already killed one kid and now it’s going to kill the rest of my family.' ”\n\nThe dealer arranged for the Wrights to trade the Fiesta for a Ford truck. “We had to make monstrous payments. I didn’t care. I needed to get that car out of our life,” she said.\n\nWord of the fatal accident reached Ford headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. The Free Press obtained an internal company document dated Dec. 2, 2013, that lists several incidents involving cars using the DPS6. It includes a cryptic reference to the crash.\n\n“Transmission stalled and caused an accident,” the document says, indicating that the report was handled by Ford’s Office of General Counsel. “Her son was going around a corner at 60 mph when it happened. The son died on impact. We requested additional information, but received no response.”\n\nThis fall, Ford said, “The accident was tragic, as a young driver lost his life. But any attempt to characterize this accident as being caused by the car ignores the facts of the accident. … Based on the police report, the accident facts, the absence of pre-accident warranty claims, Ford does not see a basis for attributing the accident to the vehicle.”\n\nPhyllis Wright did not take action against Ford.\n\n“Everybody kept saying, ‘Sue Ford. Sue Ford,’” she said from her home in Glen Ferris, West Virginia. “But I didn’t want no dead baby money.”\n\nFollow Phoebe Wall Howard on Twitter @phoebesaid\n\nBroken Pledge:The fraternity hazing and death of Ohio University freshman Collin Wiant\n\nState history:20-year-old college student gets elected to office Iowa", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/tesla-ev-fire-flooding/75468212007/", "title": "Video: Tesla catches fire as Hurricane Helene floods Siesta Key ...", "text": "A house in Florida caught fire in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene after a Tesla burst into flames in the garage purportedly due to coming into contact with saltwater, Reuters reported.\n\nNine people were in the Siesta Key home Sunday night when the Tesla vehicle, a Model X Plaid caught fire, KOLOTV reported.

There were no injuries, but fire officials told the family they were fortunate to have called 911 as soon as they saw smoke, which led to firefighters being on scene to hose the van down when the first of three fireballs burst out of the vehicle.\n\nThis was less than two months after Chris and Ellie Hawkins had the vehicle serviced for a recall linked to a risk of fire.\n\n'Someone else is sleeping soundly at night, but it could happen to them'\n\nThe couple is now questioning the effectiveness of the fix on their vehicle, and they are worried that the same thing could happen to other unsuspecting Pacifica plug-in owners.\n\n“We got it fixed. That’s what really made us feel like we should reach out to NHTSA and others,” Chris Hawkins told USA TODAY. “I’m sure there’s someone else out there that had this recall done and is sleeping soundly at night, but it could happen to them.”\n\nWhat was the 2017 and 2018 Pacifica PHEV recall?\n\nThe recall by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, now part of Stellantis, was for 2017 and 2018 Pacifica Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) produced between Aug. 12, 2016, and Aug. 7, 2018. The recall addressed fires that may originate in the high-voltage battery pack assembly while the vehicle is off and plugged in.\n\nThe fire “can result in an increased risk of occupant injury, injury to persons outside the vehicle, and property damage,” according to the notice from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nOther vehicle owners also had Pacifica hybrid fires\n\nHawkins and his wife are not alone in wanting to make sure another family doesn’t have a similar experience.\n\nLast week, NHTSA opened an investigation into the remedy effectiveness of recall 22V-077.\n\nA spokeswoman for NHTSA said the government agency generally does not comment on open investigations, but she provided a link to the public document outlining the inquiry, which was opened on Jan. 16.\n\nThe NHTSA investigation document detailed the current recall, which said “a software remedy designed to improve thermal event detectability by monitoring battery diagnostics is currently being installed on subject vehicles as an interim remedy. As of November 23, 2023, the root cause of the battery failure is unknown.”\n\nThe investigation was prompted by four consumer complaints, including one from the Hawkins family, according to the document. The complaints range from December 2022 through December 2023 and allege vehicle thermal events involving recalled 2017 and 2018 Chrysler Pacifica PHEVs.\n\nTwo of the four reports indicated the vehicle had been repaired for the fire-risk recall; the other two reports do not indicate whether the recall work was done.\n\nThe four complaints in the investigation report, from Missouri, Illinois, California and an unknown location all have the same story: the consumer’s plug-in vehicle caught fire while off and plugged in the garage. Three of the vehicles were declared totaled and there was extensive damage to the garage.\n\nA fourth vehicle's lithium battery caught fire to the point of smoking and the owner said the fire could have burned the house down if the fire department had not arrived. No injuries were reported, but all four consumers reported no warning signs and were thankful their houses didn’t burn down. Consumers have also complained of smoke-related consequences.\n\nOne complaint from a car owner in an unknown location said the vehicle had just been repaired a week prior. The hybrid was parked in the garage, plugged in, but done charging.\n\n“In the middle of the night, the battery spontaneously combusted. We heard a loud boom sound and found the car smoldering and emitting significant amounts of smoke. The car then burst into flames,” the complaint said.\n\nThe fire department soaked the vehicle with water, the complaint continued, “but it continued to reignite for approximately two hours despite the fire department’s best efforts.”\n\nA Stellantis spokesman said “in accordance with our standard practice, we are providing our full cooperation” for the NHTSA investigation.\n\nWhat happened at the Hawkins' house?\n\nThe Hawkins' habit was to plug their electric vehicle in for charging in the morning after they took their three dogs on a walk instead of charging it overnight.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Ellie Hawkins left the house early in the morning to go to an open house for the preschool where she is a teacher. About 3½ hours later, Chris Hawkins, a finance/operations executive, said he smelled burning plastic in the house.\n\nInitially, he wasn’t too worried. “We’ve got three little kids, and maybe somebody ran over the vacuum cord,” he thought to himself.\n\nHawkins and the children, ages 5, 7, and 9, walked around the house but couldn’t find the source of the smell. He also texted his wife to ask if she had smelled anything weird when she left. She hadn’t.\n\nAs Hawkins and the kids prepared to drive to the zoo, the couple’s 9-year-old walked out to the garage. He called back to his dad.\n\nThere was a strong burning plastic smell and Hawkins' son pointed to what he thought was gas under the car. Hawkins said it was a pink liquid that had trickled from somewhere under the van and formed a puddle that stretched toward the driveway.\n\nThe charging station is connected to the car on the driver’s side. When Hawkins went to unplug the vehicle, he saw the dashboard “lit up” with all kinds of lights he had never seen before.\n\nHe rushed the kids inside and told them they weren’t going to the zoo.\n\nA few minutes later, Hawkins went back out to the garage. He saw plumes of smoke coming out of his van.\n\nFamily gets safely outside\n\nHawkins got the kids and two of the family’s three dogs out of the house through a back door and called 911. They went to their backyard, where Hawkins started taking photos and videos of the garage, located on the side of their house.\n\nAs the firefighters from the Metro West Fire Protection District were dousing the car with water and foam, Hawkins said a “big fireball shoots out of the back” of the vehicle’s back hatch, which had been opened.\n\n“At that point, they really kicked it into high gear,” he said of the firefighters. More fire trucks began arriving on the scene.\n\nAnd firefighters told the family to move further away from the house.\n\n“I remember it clear as day, the fire chief said ‘we’re preparing for your house to go up’” because the garage had effectively turned into an oven, Hawkins said.\n\nBut the house didn’t catch on fire. A firefighter later told Hawkins, after the van blaze was fully extinguished that the only reason the house didn’t burn down was because he had called 911 and they were actively spraying the van when the first explosion happened.\n\nNeighbors said two more fireballs came out of the vehicle while Hawkins was briefly allowed back in the house to retrieve the family’s third dog. Finally, a tow truck had to come and pull the van out and turn it on its side.\n\nFirefighters cleared the scene two hours and 13 minutes after first arriving, according to the incident report.\n\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY, Metro West Fire Protection District Capt. Matt Coppin said: “The homeowner's immediate decision to call 911 upon detecting the odor of smoke prevented possible injury to the occupants and substantial damage to the home.”\n\nAftermath of the fire\n\nHawkins filed a complaint with NHTSA on Nov. 14 and heard back from an investigator three days later. On the advice of the NHTSA investigator, he called a Chrysler customer service number on Nov. 21 and was told the incident was going to be escalated to the company’s special investigations team.\n\nOn Thanksgiving, Hawkins got a call back from a Chrysler representative who left a message asking where the vehicle was located. Hawkins called back the next day and said he was unaware of the van’s exact location since it was under the insurance company’s control while the claim was being handled. That was the last call he had from Chrysler.\n\nHawkins also went to the dealership where he had the vehicle serviced. An employee said he was sorry about the experience but added it was a corporate matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawkins says his kids are traumatized, having seen “the car they ride in everyday blow up.\" He's consulted with several attorneys, who've said even though his family has lost money due to insurance deductibles, and the need to rent and ultimately buy a new car, no one was injured so there is no case.\n\nHe believes Chrysler has ignored the family.\n\n“We felt that we did what we needed to do,” said Hawkins. “I would have felt differently had this happened before we had this recall addressed. All they’ve really done at this point is ignore us and I think that’s just crazy.”\n\nA Stellantis spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY “with regard to this particular customer, we are trying to arrange an inspection of this vehicle. Until such an inspection is complete, it is inappropriate to engage in speculation. Fires are highly complex events with multiple potential causes.”\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nAccording to the latest quarterly report from NHTSA based on data provided by the automaker, 16,741 Pacifica vehicles had been recalled for the initial fire risk as of Oct. 30, 2023. The report added that 11,857 vehicles had been serviced.\n\nHowever, according to the investigation report from NHTSA, \"the Office of Defects Investigation is opening this Recall Query to review the effectiveness of the original recall remedy, understand the root cause of the battery fires, investigate additional reports of Pacifica PHEV HV battery fires, and to increase monitoring of the manufacturer root cause investigation.”\n\nAre electric vehicles a fire hazard?\n\nIn the past, when there have been reports of vehicles on fire on the side of the road, they've typically involved an older car that has sprung a leak and oil or gasoline has caught on fire, said Greg Less, director of the Battery Lab at the University of Michigan’s Electric Vehicle Center.\n\n“What’s different about electric vehicles is new electric vehicles are catching fire without there being a crash or some sort of road debris penetrating the battery pack, or in this case, it is in someone’s garage and catches on fire,” Less told USA TODAY. “So in that sense, fires are more prevalent in new electric vehicles than in new gasoline cars.”\n\nLess was not aware of Pacifica Electric Vehicle Hybrids specifically catching fire. But when such incidents happen to electric vehicles, there could be a variety of reasons, he said.\n\nFor instance, batteries store energy and when a stored energy has extra heat added to it, a reaction can occur to generate more heat and potentially cause a fire or explosion, he said.\n\nHe likened a battery to a full water balloon. If you keep adding more water to it, it’s going to pop. “For whatever reason, some computer chip failed or whatever kept pushing more electricity into that battery. That would be bad, and it would cause bad things to happen,” he said.\n\nHow can you protect yourself from an electrical vehicle fire?\n\nThough electric fires are relatively uncommon, there have been reports of other manufacturers’ electric vehicles catching fire, such as several incidents involving Teslas and in the spring of 2023, several F-150 electric vehicle truck batteries caught on fire in the holding lot of a Michigan plant.\n\nWhen there is an incident, each fire helps researchers learn to fix the issue, so it won’t happen again, Less said.\n\n“People should not abandon their electric vehicles because of this,” Less said. Get the vehicle checked out and make sure it is fine, but “they’re a great mode of transportation.”\n\nOther EV fires:Tesla 'spontaneously' catches fire on California highway; 6,000 gallons of water needed to put it out\n\nLess has an electric vehicle and believes in them, he said.\n\nStill, Less’s charger is outside of the garage at the end of the driveway to prevent any damage to his house if something were to go wrong.\n\nIt's also good to have a smoke detector, though there may already be a problem by the time it goes off, Less said. A carbon monoxide detector near the electric vehicle might give an early warning sign, since carbon monoxide is one of the gases that would be emitted if a battery cell starts to burn, he said.\n\nIf you find your electric vehicle is smoking, Less said, do not attempt to roll it out of the garage or start the car to move it.\n\n“Those giant fireballs are no joke,” he said. “The No. 1 thing for consumers is to keep in mind their health and safety is more important than the vehicle or the house.”\n\nIf everything is working properly, similar to how a cell phone stops charging when it is fully charged, an electric vehicle should do the same, he said.\n\nFamily would consider another plug-in in the future\n\nThe out-of-pocket costs for the Hawkins family have been a hit, Hawkins said, especially since these were expenses they were not expecting and the Pacifica was paid off. Their home and auto deductibles are $5,000 and their insurance only provided a rental car for 30 days, so they had to spend $75 a day, totaling more than $2,000. Hawkins also estimates he's spent 100 hours dealing with insurance and paperwork related to the fire and NHTSA complaint.\n\nThey also had to take out an 8% loan to buy a new minivan, which cost approximately $40,000 – twice the amount insurance paid them for their burned-out Pacifica.\n\nThe Hawkins family decided not to get another plug-in hybrid; they bought a new Toyota Sienna, which has a gas tank and battery that is powered by the vehicle.\n\nThe family would consider another eco-friendly plug-in in the future, “once the track record for safety showed consistent improvement,” Hawkins said.\n\nBut until then, they want Pacifica owners whose vehicles have been recalled and serviced to be careful.\n\n“If you have a 2018 Pacifica hybrid, have someone take a look at it again and make sure it was fixed right,'' he said. \"If this saves one life, I will be happy.”\n\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

Sometimes, no one knows immediately how to fix them.\n\nSecretaries of state around the country register vehicles as road-worthy despite unfixed safety defects.\n\nUsed car retailers continue to sell potentially faulty cars and trucks with open recalls while new car dealers legally can't.\n\nOn a dark winter morning, Jeffrey Wu nearly lost his life stopping for gas.\n\nWu was driving his Jeep Grand Cherokee to work on March 4, 2022, when he pulled over to fill up about 20 miles south of Minneapolis.\n\nHe had a moment of forgetfulness as he tried to drive away from the Kwik Trip without removing the pump nozzle from his fuel tank. So the dairy plant worker said he stopped and stepped out again into the frigid predawn.\n\nLittle did Wu know that the way he tried to put his SUV into park would lead to tragedy.\n\nSix years before, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles had issued a recall on his 2014 Jeep for problems related to the gear shifter and parking the vehicle. The problem was so pervasive that industry insiders already dubbed it the “park-to-reverse defect.” All it would take is a quick software update to fix. Wu later said he had no idea about the danger and never received a recall notice to get the repair done.\n\nOn that cloudy morning around 3, after getting out of his Jeep, Wu was shocked to realize that his unrepaired vehicle was suddenly rolling backward toward him. The Jeep quickly slammed into him, crushing his left leg so severely doctors would later need to amputate it below the knee.\n\n“I thought, 'Oh my God, there it goes, I’m probably going to lose my life, right here at this moment,'” Wu recalled.\n\nWu's lawsuit now making its way through the courts illustrates one of the most serious, yet unresolved problems in the auto industry: Millions of aging, used passenger cars and trucks on the road in the U.S. today aren’t getting fixed despite dangerous defects identified by automakers and the federal government.\n\nAn investigation by the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, found that automakers are making scant progress in repairing their oldest models with safety problems, putting a growing and vulnerable group of drivers at unnecessary risk.\n\nWithout any federal requirement on auto companies to fix all of the potentially dangerous used vehicles, the annual repair rate rarely exceeds 65% – and much less than that for older vehicles.\n\nParts to fix problems aren’t always available, even after consumers are notified about their faulty vehicles. Sometimes, no one knows immediately how to fix them.\n\nVehicle recall campaigns do not place any threshold for manufacturers to reach or deadlines to fix all of the potentially flawed cars and trucks. Close federal oversight is rare.\n\nProposed reforms are stalled, despite recommendations of federal officials, industry insiders and safety advocates.\n\nUsed car retailers continue to sell potentially faulty cars and trucks with open recalls in most places, while new car dealers legally can't.\n\nStates around the country register vehicles as roadworthy despite unfixed safety defects. Most of them, through their departments of motor vehicles, have failed to sign on to a federal effort to increase awareness about recalls.\n\n\"The recall system is still broken, and it needs to be fixed,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who has fought for nearly a decade to ban dealers from selling used cars and trucks with uncorrected defects.\n\nFor the Detroit Three automakers and other major builders of cars and trucks, recalls are piling up, saddling companies with huge costs and the potential to ding their brands' reputations. One-third of consumers said a recall on their vehicle would make them less likely to purchase that brand in the future, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\nMore than 30 million vehicles were recalled in 2023. Ernst & Young, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, estimates the industry shells out billions of dollars annually to address recalls. The three largest U.S.-based auto manufacturers – Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla – paid a total of $10 billion in warranty claims, including recalls, during 2023, exceeding the previous year by just about a billion dollars, according to Warranty Week. That means a big drag on a company's bottom line, employee profit-sharing and stockholder dividends.\n\nThe human toll has been enormous: The decade-old General Motors' ignition switch defect linked to 124 fatalities and 275 injuries; the faulty Takata air bags connected to more than two dozen dead and at least 400 injured.\n\nBut a full accounting of the dead and injured related to all known safety defects is not regularly collected and reported widely by automakers or the federal government.\n\n“What's clear is the system has been stagnant for too long,” former top federal regulator Mark Rosekind said in an interview. “Every once in a while, it comes back to our headlines that defects … can cost people their lives, create injuries, be unsafe to drive and we're just happy leaving it where it is. And that's not OK.”\n\nRosekind, who led the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration between 2014 and 2017, added that “Takata showed us this could be huge and very dangerous, and we need to do something about it. And we need to start thinking about sort of the full range of tools that we could use.”\n\nSince 1966, Congress has given the NHTSA the power to issue safety standards and require manufacturers to recall vehicles that have safety-related defects or do not meet standards. The NHTSA collects consumer complaints about vehicles and launches investigations, including those regarding the timeliness of recalls and whether they cover enough vehicles. Ultimately, manufacturers are responsible for reporting their own problems and voluntarily initiating recalls.\n\nTheir authorized dealers are required to fix all recalled vehicles brought to them for repair.\n\nAll repairs are free for cars and trucks up to 15 years old. In some cases, manufacturers eliminate the need for a trip to the dealership through an over-the-air software update.\n\nRalph Nader, the pioneering consumer advocate and auto-safety icon who helped lead the push for legislation to create the NHTSA, said in an interview the “whole recall system has been in shambles for decades.”\n\nHe said it's possible for the NHTSA to initiate recalls on its own. But the agency leans heavily on automakers to lead the way. The result? A weakened approach, he said. “You want to start with the language of the recall. It’s not alarming enough. It's almost wonky. They don't say … quick, bring it back. …\n\n“It was thought that NHTSA would have a flurry of mandatory orders and that the companies would be scared of the enforcement,” Nader added. “We overestimated that one, didn’t we?”\n\nMillions unrepaired\n\nMany people never get their vehicles fixed, making the problem more severe by the day. In the past 10 years, more than 300 million vehicles have been recalled.\n\nAll the while, the effort to fix a greater number of cars and trucks under recall has generally stalled, due, in part, to the growing number of recalled vehicles and shortages in workers and parts, as well as the greater consumer acceptance of risk many don’t see as especially severe.\n\nThe NHTSA regularly monitors recall efforts but, overall, the agency has focused more on investigating defects and pushing to launch recall campaigns, rather than broader efforts to get more recalled vehicles repaired, the federal General Accounting Office, a government watchdog, concluded in a January report.\n\nIt’s also a world of haves and have-nots, favoring the wealthy with pricey new cars.\n\nOver time, about 90% of new vehicles – up to 3 years old – have their recall problems quickly fixed. But the average age of vehicles in use – more than 12 years old – has soared to an all-time high. And a fraction – less than half – of recalled cars and trucks 8 years or older ever have their outstanding repairs completed, according to Stout, an auto industry consultant.\n\nIt \"feels like you're pushing a boulder up a hill,\" said Jennifer Timian, the former chief of the recall management division at the NHTSA.\n\nFederal transportation department officials tout numbers showing cars and trucks up to 5 years old have an 83% recall completion rate. But as cars age, those numbers drop off sharply: Vehicles 5 to 10 years old have a 60% rate; vehicles 11 to 15 years old have a 52% rate; and those 16 to 20 years old have a 38% rate.\n\nFederal vehicle safety officials acknowledged the issue is a challenge. But they also cautioned that some of the data regularly cited may include scrapped or totaled vehicles likely no longer in service or even in existence.\n\nRecent data indicates the auto industry is also failing to prioritize the most potentially lethal vehicles by getting them off the road and fixed. There isn’t much difference, for example, between the success rate for repairing vehicles with relatively minor flaws and the success rate for fixing cars and trucks with more serious problems that could lead to injury and death, figures from Stout show.\n\nThe used vehicle industry seems driven to sell potentially dangerous vehicles, warts and all.\n\nSparking objections from consumer groups and a coalition of U.S. senators, the Federal Trade Commission in 2016 announced a settlement after complaints that General Motors, CarMax and several associated car dealerships advertised their used vehicles with open recalls using terms like “certified” and “172-point inspection.\" Under the settlement, the FTC required these ads to mention that a vehicle “may” be under an open recall for safety defects. This enabled dealers to advertise these vehicles as certified even if they still had unrepaired safety defects.\n\nToday, according to a GM spokesman, its \"dealers are required to remedy all new and used vehicles subject to open recalls before selling them.\" CarMax says it informs customers about any recalls before purchase.\n\n\"The widespread practice of selling these dangerous vehicles without first fixing obvious and identified safety hazards unacceptably shifts the burden from manufacturers and used car sellers onto the party least equipped to address the danger – the consumer,\" Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said in a statement. He described the outlook to improve the repair rate for older cars and trucks as \"bleak.\"\n\n\"There's a real problem in both reaching owners of older vehicles, and also in many cases, incentivizing them to bring their vehicle in,\" he said in an interview, adding that \"there's a big gap in the law there, that if the (NHTSA) wants to push manufacturers to do a better job where it sees problems, it has a hard time doing that.\"\n\nSo far, settlements over product liability lawsuits or actions taken by federal regulators haven’t moved the needle toward a significantly better repair rate for older vehicles with open recalls. The NHTSA can impose civil penalties for violation of federal safety laws – Volvo, for example, agreed last year to pay $65 million for problems related to recalls – but such large fines against makers of passenger cars and light trucks have been generally few and far between.\n\n“A more active regime around civil penalties and enforcement, as well as larger amounts to punish violations, would go a long way towards making automakers prioritize safety,” Brooks said in an email.\n\n'A bomb detonated'\n\nAmong the most alarming safety recalls still haunting roadways are the defective Takata airbags.\n\nRoughly 67 million Takata airbags have been recalled in the U.S. since 2013, the largest callback in automotive history. Long-term exposure to high heat and humidity can cause these airbags to explode with flying shrapnel instead of safely deploying as designed.\n\nDespite yearslong investigations, lawsuits, regulatory orders and unprecedented recall campaigns involving innovations such as repairs done in car owners' driveways, more than 6 million inflators have yet to be replaced or otherwise accounted for in the U.S., according to the NHTSA.\n\n\"To many occupants who have experienced the explosion of a defective Takata air bag inflator, it is as if a bomb detonated in their vehicle,\" according to a 2017 report from the independent monitor overseeing the recalls.\n\nOlder vehicles put their occupants at higher risk since the age of the airbag is one of the contributing factors. A Free Press review of Takata-related deaths in the U.S. compiled by Safety Research & Strategies found the vast majority of the vehicles involved were more than 10 years old.\n\nThreats from the malfunctioning airbags still loom.\n\nTwo years ago, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles issued an urgent warning to owners of more than 250,000 vehicles to not drive them after the company reported two people in older Chrysler or Dodge vehicles died from exploding Takata airbags. And this year, a Free Press report revealed the challenges of Ford Motor Co.’s “recall of a recall,” a massive effort to reexamine more than a quarter-million vehicles after discovering subpar work around replacing Takata airbags.\n\nMore:Thousands of Ford owners may be at risk of injury from flawed air bag repairs\n\nThe problem grew yet again in July with nearly 400,000 BMW models recalled for defective airbags that could lead to deadly explosions. In August, the NHTSA announced that Ford and Mazda issued new “Do Not Drive” warnings for more than 457,000 vehicles equipped with recalled, unrepaired Takata airbags.\n\nAnother Takata-like recall could be on the horizon.\n\nMore than 50 million airbag inflators built by other manufacturers and installed in vehicles by 13 automakers are dangerous and should not be in use, according to federal regulators. The agency has said the inflators are responsible for at least seven injuries and two deaths in the United States and Canada since 2009. A final decision on a new recall has not been announced.\n\nReform stuck in neutral\n\nJeffrey Liker, a retired University of Michigan professor who studied engineering with a focus on Toyota, believes the largely voluntary recall system has fundamental flaws.\n\n\"Depending on the automakers to come forward and say, 'I'm gonna confess that I had this problem' is not a great system,\" Liker said in an interview. \"And, in addition to that, then having no consequence for just sending out postcards, and waiting, and expecting people to make appointments and take time from their busy workday to bring the car in for the day.\"\n\nIn an effort to alert consumers quickly, the NHTSA in 2013 moved up the notification requirement, mandating that manufacturers alert owners within 60 days of notifying the government of a recall campaign. The agency more recently created a lookup website and cellphone app to push out the latest information.\n\nBut often, the part needed to fix a problem is not available, an issue made worse during the supply-chain crisis after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStill, one of the authors of the 60-day deadline defended the approach.\n\n\"This is America, OK? And people deserve to know, even if there's nothing you can do about it. Even if it's frustrating, you deserve to know,\" said Timian, the former safety official.\n\nThis has led to consternation among some owners, who may call the dealership once seeking a fix but never again if the solution isn't yet available, safety advocates say.\n\n“What good is this actually doing?” asked Rosemary Shahan, president of the national group Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety. “When people get it and there's no repair available, then what are they supposed to do?”\n\nConsumers say they’re not getting their recalled vehicles fixed, in part, because they worry a dealership might try to upsell them during the visit. They also expressed concern about the inconvenience of giving up their vehicles for repair, according to a 2017 University of Michigan national survey.\n\nThe poor and vulnerable\n\nWho is likely to pay the price of unrepaired vehicles still on the road? Poor and vulnerable people. The greatest percentage of vehicles purchased by low-income consumers are used, which means that group will likely be sold a disproportionate share of recalled vehicles.\n\nOne in every 5 used vehicles for sale in the U.S. – more than 21% of all used cars for sale from both private sellers and auto dealers – carries an unfixed recall, according to Carfax, the private vehicle data company.\n\n\"It is completely unacceptable that any vehicle with an open recall could leave a dealer’s lot,\" said U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts who was a co-sponsor with Blumenthal on the proposed used-car recall sales ban. \"This endangers the driver, and everyone on the road with them.\"\n\nIn 2019, Genon Bell, a Connecticut man who worked for an auto parts store but had never bought a car from a dealer, purchased an 8-year-old Hyundai Sonata with 11 open recalls. According to an arbitrator in his legal case, \"this fact was disclosed to Mr. Bell only when he tried to return the car the same day he purchased it because he did not think it was safe to drive.\"\n\nTracking down current owners of older cars and trucks can also be difficult. Their mailing addresses on file may be outdated. And speed matters. If an automaker can contact customers within three months of them purchasing their vehicles, consumers are five times more likely to complete a safety recall fix, according to LexisNexis research.\n\nStill, even if alerted, many are wary of bringing their only vehicle into a pricey car dealership even though the vast majority of recall repairs are free. (Vehicles older than 15 years with recalls don't qualify for no-cost repair.) There also may be a language barrier for some car owners.\n\nVivek Astvansh, who studies consumer behavior and U.S. vehicle recalls as an associate professor at McGill University in Montreal, found part of the problem is inertia. Owners of older vehicles \"are less motivated or incentivized to take their car or vehicle to dealerships,\" Astvansh said in an interview. He added that consumers often believe that if the recalled vehicle has been working safely thus far, the attitude is “why worry, why bother?\"\n\nMany car and truck owners “tend to migrate away from dealerships” as their vehicles age, making it less likely to get a recall vehicle repaired, said Bruce Belzowski, a retired auto safety scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Institute. “They tend to go to mom-and-pop shops that are less expensive. And for some reason or another, they have more trust in them.”\n\nAmong the hardest owners to reach for manufacturers are young people and people who move often, according to David Nemtuda, who works in data services for carmakers at LexisNexis.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office in its January report found \"accommodations, such as towing and mobile repair, were effective in encouraging owners of older vehicles to schedule a recall repair.\" But many manufacturers don't offer such services for routine recall repairs.\n\nSome state officials say they have tried to keep consumers better informed about potential risks.\n\nThirty-six states’ attorneys general sued CarMax Auto Superstores, alleging nondisclosure of information about recalls as well as advertising vehicles as safe despite open recalls. The states settled for $1 million and the promise that the giant retailer would disclose open recalls on vehicles before consumers buy them. (CarMax said in a statement it has been disclosing vehicle-specific recall information in its sales process and online advertising since 2014.)\n\nToday, CarMax says it links its vehicle listings to the federal safety website on recalls, nhtsa.gov/recalls. The national used-car retailer also posts two stickers on the windows of its used cars and trucks for sale with information about how to check a recall status. Before any purchase, customers review two separate times if the car or truck has an outstanding recall and then sign an acknowledgment.\n\n\"As CarMax is not authorized by manufacturers to complete recall repairs and close out recalls, we work hard to ensure our customers have the information they need to take action and have recalls repaired at a manufacturer-authorized facility,\" said Joe Wilson, CarMax's chief operating officer.\n\nSome manufacturers argue the ultimate responsibility rests with the owners, including those who don’t take recalls seriously.\n\nOne vehicle owner was so incensed by multiple notifications that \"he threatened us with a cease-and-desist letter if we did not stop sending recall notices to him,\" said Eric Mayne, a spokesman for Stellantis, which builds cars and trucks under the Chrysler, Jeep and Ram brands, among others.\n\nWhy recalled vehicles remain unfixed\n\nJeffrey Wu says he never knew his Jeep had an outstanding recall because he never received a notice. Wu says he would have had his Jeep fixed if he had known.\n\nThat’s because he had another truck before the Jeep and received a recall notice. He knew to pay attention to the safety notices and get his truck’s recall addressed in a timely way.\n\n“I had a Toyota pickup truck I drove for 12 years, with hundreds of thousands of miles on there. And one day I got this recall saying … the car was unsafe.” He said the frame was falling apart and wearing down his tires.\n\n“Finally, I got the recall notice and I brought it in,” he said. Toyota eventually paid Wu three times the value of the aging truck because the safety problem could not be fixed. “They really wanted the car back because it was unsafe.” (A Toyota spokesman did not respond to specific questions about Wu's experience.)\n\nOverall, nearly 58 million vehicles on U.S. roads are being driven with a known recall that should be repaired, according to data from January compiled by Carfax for the Free Press.\n\nManufacturers in part blame the challenge of identifying the fix quickly and making the part available, especially for older models out of production. Ford spokeswoman Maria Buczkowski said the industry would benefit from learning which vehicles are out of commission as it did in the cash-for-clunkers program – the federal government subsidy for consumers turning in their beat-up old cars to buy new ones. \"Many older vehicles are already off the road but can't be located due to data-sharing gaps,\" Buczkowski said.\n\nThe GAO more than a decade ago found the NHTSA could be doing more to improve the recall repair rate.\n\nThe internal watchdog agency found in 2011 that \"although recall completion rates vary considerably by certain factors, NHTSA has not consistently used the data it collects to identify which factors make some recalls more successful than others.\"\n\nThis year, the agency echoed a similar theme.\n\nThe GAO found that the current recall repair rate is hampered by a lack of convenience for customers, the owner's diminished perception of safety risk, the owner's awareness of the recall, the availability of parts as well as the vehicle's age. The agency concluded in its January report that the NHTSA knows this information but has no plans to do more research into what can be done to improve the rate.\n\nThe GAO also worried that \"NHTSA may be losing valuable insights that could improve repair rates and help the agency work toward its vision of achieving a 100 percent repair rate for every recall.\" In addition, the watchdog chided the NHTSA for failing to fully embrace measures, including industry “collaborations that aim to improve completion rates.\"\n\nA May NHTSA research report based on focus groups sought to find out more about potential barriers for consumers. The report concluded drivers like to keep on top of vehicle maintenance, but they say checking for recalls is “not top-of-mind.” They also see providing free alternative transportation and offering mobile repairs as keys to improving the likelihood of getting their recalled vehicles repaired.\n\nThere have been some bright spots. In 2015, with support from the industry, Congress passed a law that banned rental car companies from loaning vehicles with open recalls.\n\nBut other key players like auto insurance companies don't want to enter the fray.\n\n“Safety recall notifications are meant to give manufacturers the chance to correct a defect in their product before something worse happens. Recall notices establish a direct line of communication between the responsible party and consumers who may be affected if the problem isn’t fixed,\" said Tony Cotto, public policy counsel for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies.\n\n\"Bringing an insurer into this process is only likely to add to confusion around recalls.”\n\nSome industry analysts worry that the federal government, auto manufacturers and other stakeholders responsible for vehicle safety are failing to concentrate their effort on the most acute problem.\n\n“When we talk about recalls not being completed, we're talking about older vehicles,” Raymond Roth, a director focusing on automotive recalls with the consultancy Stout, said in an industry meeting on the issue in Livonia, Michigan, last year. Roth said the broader industry has not stepped up its efforts to identify, notify and motivate owners of older vehicles, even though that’s where the greatest gap is.\n\nSome dealers have argued that auto manufacturers don't have a great incentive to get vehicles with safety defects fixed because it drives up their costs.\n\n\"Manufacturers view recalls as expense, and they naturally seek to avoid expense wherever and however they can,\" said Jim Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, a statewide trade association that represents more than 500 franchised dealerships. \"Dealers, on the other hand, see recalls as revenue – and an opportunity to step up and often advocate on behalf of their customer to build and strengthen the relationships they have with their customer. …\n\n\"The automakers don't have the financial incentive. Indeed, they have the financial disincentive to go any further than they're required under the federal law to notify consumers.\"\n\nThe government and auto manufacturers sometimes send more severe “Do Not Drive” and “Park Outside” recall alerts when the safety risk is seen as especially high. Those notifications are for vehicles with a risk of serious accident or physical harm, and those with high risk of fire that could start inside a garage or near a home.\n\nThose notifications have recently exploded.\n\nThere are 4.2 million vehicles that have been tagged with “Do Not Drive” or “Park Outside” safety recalls and remained unrepaired as of January, up from an estimated 2.5 million last year, according to a Carfax analysis completed for the Free Press. For example, Hyundai Motor America and Kia America issued “Park Outside” recalls for more than 3.3 million vehicles due to the risk of fire, according to an NHTSA announcement last year.\n\nAmong those owners left in the cold is Gloria Villegas.\n\nThe 49-year-old full-time caregiver from Woodland, California, bought her 2015 Hyundai Elantra with about 180,000 miles from a CarMax store for $18,000 in October 2022. When the car began to have trouble, a friend recommended a search for open recalls. Villegas found an urgent one for her brakes that could spark a fire, but she said she never got the legally required notice in the mail.\n\nVillegas, who works six days a week, parks the car away from her home but still hasn't gotten it fixed. \"I have a crazy schedule,\" she said. \"It's just really hard.\"\n\nEven if Villegas had had the time, it wouldn't have mattered. Hyundai sent warning letters last November, but it wasn't scheduled to have a fix until sometime this spring, according to the NHTSA. (A Hyundai spokeswoman said in an email in August that a part to fix the problem is available and customers can now schedule an appointment to get the work done.)\n\nSome analysts worry overall that vehicles with the greatest risk to cause injury and death are not getting enough attention from automakers and other important stakeholders to get them fixed.\n\n\"We're taking a generally one-size-fits-all approach to recalls, we have recalls that we know are hurting people, and we're treating them the same way as a typo in an owner's manual,” said Roth, the Stout analyst. \"So we know what can be done and what should be done. But just haven't thought through, ‘OK, maybe we should treat these differently.’ And this is important.\"\n\nRecalling a sales ban\n\nIndustry forces have long fought a proposed ban on the sale of used cars and trucks with unfixed recalls. One leading used car dealer imposed its own ban, but that didn’t last very long.\n\nIn 2015, AutoNation – one of the nation’s largest automotive retailers – announced that it would not sell, lease or wholesale from its nearly 300 stores any vehicle that had an open safety recall.\n\n\"There's no way to expect that customers would or should know of every safety recall on every vehicle they might purchase, so we will ensure that our vehicles have all recalls completed,\" AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson said at the time. \"We make it our responsibility as a retailer to identify those vehicles and remove them from the market until their safety issues have been addressed.\"\n\nA year later, the company reversed course, selling those vehicles with open recalls again because they said their competitors failed to follow suit.\n\nFormer CarMax CEO Tom Folliard told a forum hosted by Florida Institute of Technology in October 2019 that “what we want to make sure we do is be completely transparent with the customer.” He called some recalls “not really safety issues.”\n\n“It's not really realistic to say you won't sell a car with an open recall,” Folliard, who still serves as the company's chairman of the board, told the audience. “You'd be surprised how many cars on the road today have open recalls. Many of them are not really safety issues. They're just open recalls. But because of all the consumer movement around it, they're all considered safety recalls. So we don't not sell a car that has a recall. We just make sure we're transparent with the customer.”\n\nThe federal government disagrees.\n\nIt's our position that “every recall is a safety recall,” said Tanya Topka, director of the NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation. “And it's critical to be done.”\n\nConcerned about a possible ban, the used car industry has sought to enshrine at the state level the right to sell cars and trucks with open recalls.\n\nAuto dealers crafted what’s known as “model legislation” that would allow them to continue selling recalled used cars, so long as they disclosed open recalls to customers somewhere in a stack of sales documents. An investigation published in 2019 by USA TODAY and others found that after a lobbying effort, copycat versions of the auto dealers’ bill had been introduced in at least 11 states, including two states that passed the measures.\n\nConsumer advocates criticized the bills, which required disclosure of open recalls but no requirement for vehicle owners to fix them.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's Office said it's concerned about sales of vehicles with open recalls, but press secretary Danny Wimmer added that because of recent state court cases that prevent state investigation of certain businesses, and a lack of legislation, the office is unable to undertake \"meaningful in-state investigation or enforcement.\"\n\n'Park to reverse' recall\n\nJeffrey Wu drove his recalled Jeep for the last time in March 2022.\n\n“I was picking up the hose and was trying to put it back on the … gasoline (pump),” Wu recalled in a recent interview from his home in Lakeville, Minnesota. “I saw the car come around me. ... Should I go towards the car and try to stop it? Or should I try to move away? So my reaction was maybe I should go towards the car, but then I realized that was a bad mistake.”\n\nHe was soon pinned by his own car, his lower left leg absorbing the blow.\n\n“I think I fell down to the ground. And then I reached for my leg. And then that's when I realized my leg was gone.\n\n“I tried to call for help, help … screaming for two minutes, nobody was around, because it was early at 3 in the morning, around that time. So finally, someone helped …\n\n“And they rushed out and they, you know, try to take care of me and try to comfort me. ... They actually was able to get ahold of my wife and get her down to the spot before the ambulance took off.\"\n\nWu bought his used Jeep with nearly 30,000 miles from an independent seller in September 2015.\n\nHe said in an interview he never knew that in April 2016, FCA, the manufacturer of the Jeep, issued a recall warning:\n\n“Your vehicle may roll away striking and injuring you, your passengers, or bystanders, if the vehicle’s engine is left running, the parking brake is not engaged, and the vehicle is not in the park position before exiting the vehicle. Drivers may inadvertently fail to achieve the park position before exiting the vehicle.”\n\nThe fix to the gear shifter was related to the Jeep’s computer. The recall was designed to “update software to include an additional mechanism to mitigate the effect of operator error in failing to shift the monostable gear selector into PARK prior to exiting the vehicle.”\n\nMore:Key question in lawsuit against FCA: Did company knowingly sell defective shifters?\n\nWu was not alone in his encounter with a tricky gear shifter. Star Trek film actor Anton Yelchin was killed in 2016 because he was struck by his Jeep Grand Cherokee; his attorneys say they believe it happened after he tried to put the vehicle into park.\n\nThe recalled Grand Cherokees used electronic shift levers that confused drivers because they could think they put their vehicle in park, but they had not. As part of a recall of more than a million vehicles, FCA altered the software so Jeeps with the engine running automatically shift into park after opening the driver’s door.\n\nAccording to police reports, Yelchin climbed out of his recalled Jeep, which rolled backward down a driveway, pinning him against a mailbox pillar and killing him.\n\n“If you look at the recall letter, ‘Dear Anton Yelchin, your car is defective. It can roll away,’” Yelchin family attorney Gary Dordick told a news conference announcing a lawsuit against FCA later in 2016. “They mailed that letter to him seven days after he died.”\n\nDouglas Shaffer, an attorney at Dordick’s firm who worked on the case, said in an interview in August it had been unclear whether Yelchin had received an earlier letter sent by FCA explaining it was working on a fix.\n\nShaffer added Fiat Chrysler knew of problems with the gear selector as early as 2012 but still installed it in the 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees. The gearshift was changed for the 2016 model.\n\nFCA, now Stellantis, reached a confidential settlement with Yelchin’s family out of court in 2018.\n\n\"We extend our sincerest condolences to Mr. Yelchin’s family,\" Mayne, the Stellantis spokesman, said in a statement. \"A recall notice, which also contained an advisory to help further enable safe operation of the vehicle, was sent to his home address in May of 2016.\"\n\nHe estimated that \"customers used this shifter to safely exit their vehicles more than 1.75 billion times.\"\n\nWu and his wife, Ting Yang – who were both born in China, married after they met in the U.S. and raised a now college-age daughter in Minnesota – said they filed suit in March 2023 in state court against FCA so that others don’t suffer a similar fate.\n\nRegarding the couple's suit, Mayne said for Stellantis, \"We reject these claims and will vigorously defend against them in court.\n\n\"Multiple recall notices were sent to this customer’s home address,\" Mayne added. \"More than 635,000 customers availed themselves of the free remedy within the first 24 months of service launch in 2016.\"\n\nIn court filings, defense attorneys for FCA raised their doubts about Wu’s account of his accident, citing a video and a police report from the scene.\n\nThe Jeep “starts to reverse when the driver’s door is opened” by Wu, who never exited the Jeep, according to a November 2023 court document. FCA’s lawyers also cited Wu’s statement to the police, in which Wu reportedly said he left his left foot and leg dangling outside the open driver’s side door while operating the Jeep in reverse.\n\nThe police officer’s incident report said that Wu told the officer he “exited the vehicle without placing it back into park; Jeffrey observed the vehicle begin to move again and quickly reentered the vehicle to place the transmission into park.\"\n\n“As he entered the vehicle, Jeffrey stuck his left foot out. This limb then became trapped between the slow-moving vehicle’s door and the barrier protecting the pump.”\n\nWhen asked about the police report description of his account, Wu said during a deposition in his lawsuit, “I don't remember saying anything like that,” adding “this is not even close to what happened.” In the deposition, Wu also said, “I put the car in park.”\n\nThe judge in the case has so far declined to take sides in the conflict.\n\n“This Court need not decide the underlying facts at this time,” Dakota County District Judge Dannia Edwards wrote in a March 1 order. “Regardless of which parties’ factual contentions are more accurate, it is uncontested that as a result of the March 4, 2022, incident, (Wu's) left leg was amputated.”\n\nIn an interview in her Minnesota home late last year, Yang questioned why customers appear to shoulder so much responsibility in trying to find out and repair potentially dangerous cars and trucks.\n\n“Why do we have to make sure that we're buying a safe vehicle?” Yang asked. She added that she hopes automakers would “focus more on the safety” of the vehicles they manufacture “rather than the quantity they're making. ... I don't want any family to go through what we went through.”\n\nThe injury to Wu, 47, meant he could no longer drive a forklift during a day shift at his dairy plant and had to move to an overnight production line. His long recovery has tested the strength of the couple’s marriage.\n\nYang, 42, said she refuses to sugarcoat the family’s struggle. “It’s never a pretty picture.”\n\n\"So the accident happened. It was never a smooth recovery for us. It's up and down ... emotionally, physically, we fight over small things. We lost temper on each other” because of the lingering anguish over the accident.\n\n“But we’re still here today because we love each other,” she said, adding, hopefully, one day, “we will help each other to have our life back again.\"\n\nStay safe:Use your Vehicle Identification Number here to check whether your car or truck has an open safety recall.\n\nWu's case is set to go to trial in September 2025.\n\nHe pleaded for the auto industry to make and sell safe vehicles “because I'm going to continue driving,\" he said. \"So just next time, I want to buy a new car, I want to be safe.”\n\nThis report received funding from the Abrams Nieman Fellowships for Local Investigative Journalism at Harvard University.\n\nHave a question about vehicle recalls or a story to share?

Nearly half of the accidents (467) could have been avoidable, ODI said, but happened because \"Tesla’s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot’s permissive operating capabilities.\"\n\nCrash test results:Only 1 of 10 SUVs gets 'good' rating in crash test updated to reflect higher speeds\n\nIn that investigation, the agency found at least 13 crashes \"involving one or more fatalities and many more involving serious injuries in which foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role,\" it said.\n\nLast week, a Tesla driven by someone with Tesla's Full Self-Driving beta feature reportedly engaged hit and killed a motorcyclist in Washington state. That feature isn't a total self-driving mode, but does more than autopilot – navigating turns and stopping at lights and signs – and still requires drivers to pay attention.\n\nNHTSA: Tesla autopilot system has 'critical safety gap'\n\nWhile often referred to as self-driving cars, Teslas actually have driver support features that make driving easier, but not totally automatic. Autopilot involves using Tesla's Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, which matches the speed of other traffic, and Autosteer, which helps keep the vehicle within a lane but drivers are supposed to have their hands on the wheel.\n\nBut drivers may be expecting their Tesla to do too much, federal regulators say.\n\nA \"critical safety gap between drivers’ expectations of (Tesla's drivers' assistance system's) operating capabilities and the system’s true capabilities … led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes,\" the agency said in its closed investigation report.\n\nIn those 467 accidents, ODI said attentive drivers should have been able \"to respond or mitigate the crash\" in many cases. Other times, cars went off the road when Autosteer – Tesla's hands-on steering assist feature – \"was inadvertently disengaged by the driver's inputs,\" or the features were being used in \"low traction conditions such as wet roadways,\" the agency said.\n\nThe new investigation will \"evaluate the adequacy of (the December 2023 recall), including the prominence and scope of Autopilot controls to address misuse, mode confusion, or usage in environments the system is not designed for,\" the agency said.\n\nNeed coverage on your car? Read our guide on the best car warranty companies.\n\nWhat Tesla vehicles were recalled?\n\nWhen announced in December, the recall involved 2,031,220 vehicles: the 2012-2023 Model S, 2016-2023 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3 and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles, all equipped with Tesla's Autosteer driver-assistance feature.\n\nIn its issuance of the December 2023 recall, Tesla noted that, \"In certain circumstances when the Autosteer feature is engaged, and the driver does not maintain personal responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to intervene as necessary or fails to recognize when Autosteer is canceled or not engaged, there may be an increased risk of a crash.\"\n\nThe ODI investigation includes newer models and the Tesla Cybertruck, too.\n\nModels included in NHTSA investigation:\n\n2024 Tesla Cybertruck\n\n2017-2024 Tesla Model 3\n\n2021-2024 Tesla Model S\n\n2016-2024 Tesla Model X\n\n2020-2024 Tesla Model Y\n\nMotor Trend:The 2024 Tesla Cybertruck takes an off-road performance test\n\nThe new investigation lands as Tesla recently announced a decline in first quarter revenue and layoffs in Austin and the Bay Area. CEO Elon Musk, however, remained bullish on the company's self-driving technology and electric cars. And the company is expected to unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8.\n\nReuters reported in October 2022 that Tesla was under criminal investigation over its self-driving claims. Tesla said in October 2023 that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas related to its self-driving and autopilot technology.\n\nContributing: Emily DeLetter, James Powel, USA TODAY, and Reuters.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

At least 52 people in nine states have been sickened with E. coli poisoning, and 141 students at Boston College have been sickened with norovirus.

That study was reported on heavily, adding to a growing list of news stories and investigations – one of which was mentioned in Watchdog Warnings – about the potential concern. The conservative media outlet The Daily Caller reported last week, however, that several scientists and anti-smoking advocates took issue with the reporting. Regular cigarettes contain far more diacetyl than e-cig juices, yet no study has connected popcorn lung to cigarette smoking.

Deputy commissioner Mark Tatum announced the pick from ESPN’s Seaport studio on the edge of lower Manhattan’s Financial District where the second round took place.\n\nBronny, and his dad, NBA star LeBron James, are the first father-son player pair in the NBA at the same time. Bronny, 19, was drafted nearly 21 years to the date after LeBron was chosen No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003.\n\nHe is a 6-2 guard with exceptional leaping ability and a strong defensive disposition.\n\nBronny has had a scary and exciting year. He sustained a life-threatening cardiac arrest while working out on Southern California’s campus in July, leaving his basketball future unclear.\n\nBefore his cardiac arrest, Bronny had a strong senior season in high school and had become a potential first-round pick. The cardiac arrest, which was the result of a congenital heart defect, set back his development. He had surgery to repair the defect, was cleared to play for the Trojans and averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists and shot 36.6% from the field and 26.7% on 3-pointers in 25 games during his freshman season in 2023-24.\n\nThe NBA’s Fitness to Play Panel also cleared James for NBA play.\n\nMORE:Hawks, Wizards tap French players with top picks in first round\n\nMORE:Celtics' Kristaps Porzingis out 5-6 months after post-NBA championship leg surgery\n\nAt one point, LeBron said he wanted to play alongside Bronny, but the elder James has distanced himself from that sentiment saying as far back as a year ago that what the son wants isn’t always what the dad wants.\n\n“I never thought about just playing with my dad, but of course he’s, he’s brought it up a couple times.

That’s what Bronny James’ selection in the second round of the NBA draft Thursday is about.\n\nJames’ physical heart, the one that sustained a cardiac arrest 11 months ago while he worked out on Southern California’s campus. And his metaphorical heart, the one that helped him get back on the basketball court and in position to be drafted after a life-threatening incident required a procedure to fix his congenital heart defect.\n\nAnd our hearts, the hardened ones that can’t find the joy in a young adult reaching his dreams, and the warm hearts that can. Read Jeff Zillgitt's column.\n\nA picture is worth …\n\nLike father, like son.\n\nBronny James and LeBron James became the first father-and-son player duo in NBA history to be in the league at the same time. A photo shared on NBA’s official Instagram account highlighted just how amazing a feat that is. The photo from June 2, 2007, shows LeBron holding a young Bronny after the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. LeBron was 22 years, 5 months and 8 days and Bronny was 2 years, 8 months and 1 day. — Cydney Henderson\n\nTeams told not to draft Bronny James, per ESPN\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers drafted Bronny James with the 55th pick in the second round of the 2024 NBA draft on Thursday.\n\nThe 19-year-old, 6-foot-2, 210-pound guard left USC after one season amid speculation about his future and possibly playing alongside his father, Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James. The superstar has until Saturday to inform the Lakers whether he is returning or opting out of his contract. Even if he opts out, he still could return to the Lakers.\n\nOPINION:Bronny James must earn his spot with Lakers, but no one should question his heart\n\nRich Paul, the agent for father and son, said Bronny James ending up with the right team so he can develop was more important than where he was selected in the draft. According to ESPN, Paul even threatened that James would play in Australia and asked certain unnamed teams not to draft him.\n\nSeveral teams, such as the Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and San Antonio Spurs, had expressed interest in drafting James but according to reports, he only worked out for the Suns and Lakers. — Scooby Axson\n\nNo. 58 Dallas Mavericks, Ariel Hukporti, Riesen Ludwigsburg (Germany)\n\nThe Mavericks closed out the draft by selecting Hukporti, who averaged 8.4 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks last season on Riesen Ludwigsburg in Germany. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 57 Memphis Grizzlies, Ulrich Chomche, Cameroon\n\nThe youngest player in this year’s draft, turning 18 in December. He played a few games in the NBA Academy Africa, so his inexperience is a concern. But in the limited amount of games he’s played, he’s shown off his defensive presence. He will need tons of development and there’s uncertainty of how far his offensive game can go, yet he does have the tools to make it in the NBA. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 56 Denver Nuggets, Kevin McCullar Jr., Kansas\n\nA semifinalist for the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year award in each of the past three seasons, McCullar is a long wing who can guard multiple positions. He has natural instincts on both sides, but averaged 18.3 points and 6 rebounds per game last season. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n∎ The Nuggets traded the No. 56 pick to the Knicks, via the Suns, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 55 Los Angeles Lakers, Bronny James, USC\n\nThe Lakers did the expected and paired LeBron James with his son, Bronny. Assuming Bronny plays in a game next season, it will mark the first-ever father-son player duo in NBA history. Bronny flashed speed, jumping ability, athleticism and defense in the NBA draft combine and pre-draft process. He’ll have to continue to polish his jump shot, but his quickest path to the court is as a willing, pesky defender in a “3-and-D” role. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNo. 54 Boston Celtics, Anton Watson, Gonzaga\n\nThe reigning champion Boston Celtics are adding Anton Watson to their squad with the No. 54 overall pick. He averaged 14.5 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists last season. Watson led the Bulldogs in steals per game (1.5). — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 53 Detroit Pistons, Cam Spencer, Connecticut\n\nLikely the best 3-point shooter in the draft, Spence shot 44% from deep during the national championship season. He’s better suited as a shooter coming off screens and he has great vision in finding the right spots to get open. He averaged 14.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game last season. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n∎ The Pistons traded the No. 53 pick to the Grizzlies, via the Timberwolves, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 52 Golden State Warriors, Quinten Post, Boston College\n\nPost is a true big that can dominate near the basket with his frame, but what’s remarkable is his 3-point shooting ability; last season, he shot 43.1% from beyond the arc. He isn’t fast and can be exploited if he has to defend around the perimeter, but he gives Golden State another possible scoring threat off the bench. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 51 New York Knicks, Melvin Ajinça, Saint-Quentin (France)\n\nAnother French player is off the board. The Knicks picked up Ajinça, a 6-8 wing that shot 30.9% from three last season on Saint-Quentin. He averaged 13.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 assists. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Knicks traded the No. 51 pick to the Mavericks, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 50 Indiana Pacers, Enrique Freeman, Akron\n\nThe Pacers are looking to solidify the glass. After ranking 28th in the league in rebounding last season, Freeman should find minutes by collecting boards. He led the country with 12.9 rebounds per game, but he can also contribute on offense with high energy; last season, he tied the NCAA Divsion I single-season record for double-doubles (31). He is the first Zip to be drafted since 1987 and just the second to go in one of the first two rounds. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNo. 49 Indiana Pacers: Tristen Newton, Connecticut\n\nThe leader of the back-to-back national champion Huskies, Newton led UConn in nearly every statistical category, including points (15.1) and assists (6.2) per game. He was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four and one of his strengths is driving to the basket. There are concerns about his age and outlook, but he continued to grow in every college season. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 48 San Antonio Spurs, Harrison Ingram, North Carolina\n\nIngram is an impact player and spot-up shooter, shooting 43% from the field and 38.5% from three. He nearly averaged a double-double last season, with a career-high 12.2 points and 8.8 rebounds. He was named third-team All-ACC team. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 47 Orlando Magic, Antonio Reeves, Kentucky\n\nThis is a pick made with scoring and experience in mind. As a senior, Reeves averaged 20.2 points per game, but it wasn’t just his pure 3-point stroke. Reeves can score from different levels on the floor, though going 44.7% from beyond the arc should get him instant playing time. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ The Magic traded the No. 47 pick to the Pelicans, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 46 Los Angeles Clippers, Cam Christie, Minnesota\n\nLakers second-year player Max Christie is getting company in Los Angeles. His younger brother Cam Christie was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers. The younger Christie is a threat from beyond the arc, shooting 39.1%. He averaged 11.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists at Minnesota last season. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 45 Sacramento Kings, Jamal Shead, Houston\n\nThe leader of a dominant run at Houston, Shead was a menace for one of the best defensive teams in Division I as he was named 2023-24 Naismith National Defensive Player of the Year. He will be able to handle most defensive assignments in the perimeter despite being just 6-foot. Shead dished the ball effectively on offense and can be a pass-first guard. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n∎ The Kings traded the No. 45 pick to the Raptors, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 44 Atlanta Hawks, Pelle Larsson, Arizona\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks selected Pelle Larsson out of Arizona with the No. 44 overall pick of the 2024 NBA draft. Last season, the Swedish basketball player averaged a career-high 12.8 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists, which led the Wildcats. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Hawks traded the No. 44 pick to the Heat for the No. 43 pick, which was the Hawks’ selection from an earlier trade with the Houston Rockets for AJ Griffin, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 43 Miami Heat, Nikola Đurišić, Serbia\n\nHe’s a candidate to be stashed in the G League, but Đurišić is a versatile wing who thrived as a playmaker, though his play most closely resembles something seen in a traditional 2-guard. He has pure shooting mechanics, but he will need to work on his defense at the next level. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ The Heat traded the No. 43 pick to the Hawks for the No. 44 pick, which was the Hawks’ selection from an earlier trade with the Houston Rockets for AJ Griffin, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 42 Charlotte Hornets, KJ Simpson, Colorado\n\nNEW YORK — Simpson is a 6-0 guard who can score, rebound and pass. He averaged 19.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists – just one of five Division I players to average at least 19-5-4 in 2023-24. He also shot 43.4% on 3-pointers and averaged 1.6 steals for the Buffaloes. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNo. 41 Philadelphia 76ers, Adem Bona, UCLA\n\nA player all about hustle, Bona makes his presence known on the defensive end with his long, athletic frame, and he can bring explosiveness inside the paint on the offensive side. He was the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year and led the Bruins in blocks with 1.8 per game. He will give Philadelphia a true big to come off the bench for Joel Embiid and bring intensity to the second unit. Something he will need to develop in the pros is his discipline as he dealt with foul troubles throughout his two years at UCLA. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 40 Portland Trail Blazers, Osasere Ighodaro, Marquette\n\nIghodaro is a versatile big man that can score in a number of ways, averaging 13.4 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists last season. And Portland is in desperate need of scoring. Portland, who finished with the third-worst record (21-61) in the league, was also second-to-last in field goal percentage (43.9%) last season. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Trailblazers traded Ighodaro to the Suns, per ESPN. Ighodaro is returning home — he’s from Mesa, Arizona, and attended high school in Phoenix.\n\nNo. 39 Memphis Grizzlies, Jaylen Wells, Washington State\n\nThe Grizzlies are joining the trend of taking athletic wings and stashing them. Wells led the Cougars in 3-point percentage last season at 41.7%, but he’s more than just a shooter. Wells chipped in on the glass, grabbing 4.6 rebounds per game. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNo. 38 New York Knicks, Ajay Mitchell, UC-Santa Barbara\n\nNEW YORK — Mitchell is an efficient offensive player – he averaged 20 points 50.4% shooting from the field, 39.3% on 3-pointers and 85.8% on free throws in 2023-24. The 6-3 guard also averaged 4.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists. He was the 2022-23 Big West player of the year. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ The Knicks traded this pick to Oklahoma City who will acquire Mitchell, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 37 Minnesota Timberwolves, Bobi Klintman, Sweden\n\nKlintman played one season at Wake Forest before going to Australia to play for Cairns Taipans. He had a productive season in the Australian National Basketball League with 9.7 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. Klintman can space the floor and he is excellent in transition. His defensive prowess is another plus. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 36 Indiana Pacers, Juan Núñez, Ratiopharm Ulm (Germany)\n\nNúñez has excellent court vision, is a great passer and a threat on the pick and roll. Núñez averaged 10.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 5.7 assists last season at Ratiopharm Ulm, a professional club in Germany, where he played with Pacome Dadiet, the 25th overall pick of the 2024 NBA draft. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Pacers traded Núñez to the Spurs for the No. 35 pick, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 35. San Antonio Spurs, Johnny Furphy, Kansas\n\nFurphy, who played his junior basketball in Australia, runs the court well, finishes in transition and can knock down spot-up 3s. He was one of 21 players to receive an invite to the green room for the first round, but did not hear his name called. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ The Spurs traded Furphy to the Indiana Pacers for the No. 36 pick, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 34, Portland Trail Blazers, Tyler Kolek, Marquette\n\nNEW YORK — A playmaker and scorer, especially off the dribble, Kolek sees the court well, operates with savvy in the pick-and-roll and is clever with his finishes at the rim. He had six double-doubles in points and assists this season. He averaged 15.3 points, 7.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.6 steals and shot 49.6% from the field and 38.8% on 3-pointers. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ The Trail Blazers will send Kolek to the Knicks for future second-round picks, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly until the deal was official.\n\nNo. 33 Milwaukee Bucks, Tyler Smith, G League Ignite\n\nA versatile stretch-four that can shoot from just about anywhere on the court. He shot 36% from 3-point land last season, a big boost for a Bucks team that was a top 10 3-point shooting team. Smith started his professional career as a 16-year-old and opted to skip the final two years of high school. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 32 Utah Jazz, Kyle Filipowski, Duke\n\nFilipowski averaged 16.4 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks last season. Filipowski is a versatile low-post big who can pull up for a three or drive to the bucket. He will also add a defensive boost to the Jazz, who finished dead last in the league in defensive rating. Filipowski will team up with Lauri Markkanen, who Filipowski says he models his game after. — Cydney Henderson and Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNo. 31 Toronto Raptors, Jonathan Mogbo, San Francisco\n\nThe Raptors start the second round with some experience, taking Mogbo, a senior forward. Mogbo is a two-way player who is comfortable in transition with the ball in his hands and is a double-double machine. He averaged 14.2 points and 10.1 rebounds per game last season, though he is not a 3-point threat. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nBronny James is not among green room guests\n\nNEW YORK — Bronny James was not among the 10 green room attendees, per the NBA. But that doesn’t mean Bronny is not at ESPN’s Seaport studio in lower Manhattan where the second round of the draft is taking place.\n\nDuke’s Kyle Filipowski and Kansas’ Johnny Furphy, who were first-round green room attendees and not drafted on Wednesday, are not expected to attend the second round in person. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nThe 10 green room players for the second round:\n\nAdem Bona, UCLA\n\nCam Christie, Minnesota\n\nNikola Djurisic, Mega (Serbia)\n\nBoogie Ellis, USC\n\nOso Ighodaro, Marquette\n\nHarrison Ingram, North Carolina\n\nBobi Klintman, Cairns (Australia) Taipans\n\nJuan Nunez, Ratiopharm Ulm (Germany)\n\nKJ Simpson, Colorado\n\nJaylen Wells, Washington State\n\nHow to watch the NBA draft\n\nThe second round will be broadcast on ESPN.\n\nWhen is the NBA draft?\n\nThe second round is Thursday at 4 p.m. ET\n\nHow to stream the NBA draft\n\nThe draft will be streamed on ESPN+, YouTube TV and fuboTV.\n\nHow many rounds are the NBA draft?\n\nThe draft has two rounds.

The second round is at ESPN Seaport District Studio in Manhattan, N.Y.\n\nHow many picks are in the NBA draft?\n\nThe NBA draft usually has 60 picks.

It also may have something to do with his namesake’s future employer.

Thank you both for allowing me to be your DAD and be apart of your compass through life’s trials and tribulations!” — Craig Meyer, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nNBA draft first-round highlights\n\nDid you miss the first round Wednesday? Read our analysis of all 30 picks and catch up with these highlights:\n\nNBA draft first-round picks\n\nOpinion: Hawks don't need a savior in Risacher. They just need him to be good\n\nATLANTA — It would be difficult to have a strong opinion about Zaccharie Risacher, the NBA’s newly-minted No. 1 overall draft pick, unless JL Bourg of the LNB Élite league was somehow part of your basketball viewing menu last season. But there’s a reason that the people who actually get paid to pay attention to this stuff — and whose jobs depend on getting it right — have liked Risacher since he was 16 years old.\n\nIn the modern NBA, tall wings who can shoot from the perimeter and defend multiple positions are among the rarest commodities. Just ask the New York Knicks, who are about to pay OG Anunoby more than $200 million despite never averaging more than 17.1 points per game and just gave up a ransom of draft picks for Mikal Bridges. Read Dan Wolken's column.\n\nOpinion: Knicks taking big swings. Risk is worth it\n\nNEW YORK – The day before the first round of Wednesday’s NBA draft and just hours before the draft began, the New York Knicks dominated the league’s headlines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Knicks acquired Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets, and the following day, they reached a five-year, $212 million deal with OG Anunoby, their own free agent, to remain with New York.\n\nThe opening of NBA free agency is Sunday, and the Knicks’ front office, led by former player-agent Leon Rose, sent a message: the Knicks are going for it. They see a window to play for an NBA championship, and they’re taking a big-league swing. That should be commended. Read Jeff Zillgitt's column.\n\nNBA draft winners and losers\n\nBROOKLYN, N.Y. — The first round of the 2024 NBA draft wrapped up late Wednesday night, and though there's still one more round — comprising 28 selections — left, it's not too early to break down the implications from the night.\n\nThe biggest winner, arguably, wasn't a team or player or executive, but a country. France has had an unprecedented run of success in getting players drafted in the first round. No team made more selections than the Washington Wizards, who came into the night with two but aggressively added another in the middle of the round, and now they appear to have infused talent onto a roster that badly needed it. Read our winners and losers from the first round of the 2024 NBA draft here.\n\nThree biggest surprise picks from first round\n\nNEW YORK — The first round of the 2024 NBA draft produced expected results − a pair of French players in Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr, for example, were selected in the first two picks.\n\nBut the first round also yielded picks that were total surprises, ones that drew audible reactions from the crowd in attendance at the Barclays Center after Commissioner Adam Silver read off their names.\n\nWhether it was teams in win-now mode drafting prospects who are projects, or players seemingly taken too high, here are the three biggest surprise picks from the first round of the 2024 NBA draft. Read story. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nHistoric draft for France\n\nIt’s been a big day for France with one of its most successful drafts in NBA history.\n\nWith Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr the first two picks in the draft, it’s the first time two Frenchmen went 1-2 in the NBA draft.\n\nOn top of that, with Tidjane Salaun taken sixth overall, it’s the first time three Frenchmen were selected in the top 10. It’s also the first time a country other than the U.S. has had three players drafted in the top 10. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nESPN cameras show incorrect player when displaying graphic\n\nDalton Knecht is at the 2024 NBA draft with his family and Tennessee coach Rick Barnes as he waits to live out a childhood dream of hearing his name called by NBA commissioner Adam Silver. But for a brief second ESPN's broadcast showed someone other than the Vols forward — the second production error for the network this week after missing the Florida Panthers hoist the Stanley Cup on Monday.\n\nDuring the introduction of players at the 2024 NBA draft at the Barclays Center on Wednesday, ESPN broadcast a lower-third graphic with Knecht's name. However, the camera was trained on French forward Tidjane Salaun instead of Knecht. Salaun would go No. 6 overall to the Charlotte Hornets. — John Leuzzi, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nDonovan Clingan honors mom at draft\n\nDonovan Clingan has dedicated his basketball career to his mother, and he made sure to have a piece of her with him when he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers. Inside of his suit jacket he has pictures of his family, and on the other side are pictures of him and his mom.\n\nClingan’s mother, Stacey Clingan, died of breast cancer in 2018. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTeams with most, fewest picks in 2024 NBA draft\n\nThe Spurs and Trail Blazers are tied for most picks in the 2024 NBA draft with four picks each.\n\nSpurs picks: 4, 8 35, 48\n\n4, 8 35, 48 Trail Blazers picks: 7, 14, 34, 40\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets have the fewest picks in this year's draft as the only team with zero selections.\n\nNBA draft eligibility requirements\n\nCan anybody enter the draft? Here are the rules of eligibility for the NBA draft.\n\nAge: The NBA's collective bargaining agreement says that all players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft.\n\nOne-and-done rule: The collective bargaining agreement says that \"at least one (1) NBA Season has elapsed since the player’s graduation from high school (or, if the player did not graduate from high school, since the graduation of the class with which the player would have graduated had he graduated from high school)\" in order for a player to be eligible for the NBA draft.\n\nInternational players: According to the collective bargaining agreement, an international player is defined as one \"(i) who has maintained a permanent residence outside of the United States for at least the three (3) years prior to the Draft, while participating in the game of basketball as an amateur or as a professional outside of the United States; (ii) who has never previously enrolled in a college or university in the United States; and (iii) who did not complete high school in the United States.\"\n\nDraft limits: A player seeking to be a part of the NBA can only enter two drafts.

His mother rushed him to Christiana Hospital. The cause of the emergency, she said, was toxic ozone – a byproduct of pollution from greenhouse gases – in combination with a lingering smell of fresh grass clippings at his school.\n\n“We regulate his medicine and push his medicine and everything like that but that doesn’t mean he’s not going to have an asthma attack during these high [ozone] days,\" she said.\n\nPeople vulnerable to the chemical ozone, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, have been dealing with poor air in Delaware for at least eight years, according to the American Lung Association. In an April report, the organization gave all three counties in the First State “F” grades for ozone pollution.\n\nThe problem is continuing. Two days during the past week – including Friday – the level of ozone pollution in northern Delaware surpassed federal limits, said David Small, secretary of the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.\n\nSTORY: Delaware City Refinery cited for more violations\n\nSTORY: Taking on DuPont: Illnesses, deaths blamed on pollution from W. Virginia plant\n\nSTORY:Toxic air pollution concentrated at small number of sites\n\nFor years, state officials have pointed to out-of-state industrial facilities as the perpetrators of Delaware's pollution problems. States such as Pennsylvania, with its numerous coal-fired power plants, and the Sunoco Marcus Hook refinery that sits along the Delaware state line, bombard the First State with too many pollutants, they say.\n\nAnd it's a problem that is out of DNREC's control, said Small.\n\nMore than \"90 percent of those contaminants that lead to our ozone problems come from out of state,” he said.\n\nBut greenhouse gas industrial emissions data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2014, shows the picture to be more complex, according to an examination by The News Journal, in conjunction with the Center for Public Integrity, the Weather Channel and USA Today.\n\nWhile the First State lies in the path of prevailing winds that pass over many of the country’s largest producers of ozone-causing greenhouse gases, Delaware – for its size – is also an outsize emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\nIndustries released more greenhouse gases per square mile in 2014 than those in any state, except Indiana or West Virginia. The Delaware City refinery, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in Delaware at nearly 4 million metric tons in 2013, accounted for 48 percent of the state's industrial output of those emissions, according to EPA data.\n\nMichael Karlovich, a spokesman for refinery operator PBF Energy, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEmission reports to the EPA from DuPont Co., Delaware's flagship chemical businesses, show the company emitted small amounts of greenhouse gases in past years.\n\nThe company's now-shuttered facility in Edge Moor in 2014 released 231,131 pounds of toxic air, water and solid chemicals – separate from greenhouse gases – into the environment, second to only to the Delaware City refinery.\n\nHurst, who like her son is asthmatic, says they both sense higher levels of air pollution in Delaware than they do during trips to the West Coast.\n\n“It’s worse in Delaware than other places,” said Hurst.\n\nSTORY: Study: Air pollution kills 41 in Delaware each year\n\nSTORY: Public defender asks for second shot in drug lab cases\n\nThe greenhouse gases nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, as well as volatile organic compounds, that lurk in East Coast air become a toxic brew during sunny days because sunlight causes the chemicals to transform into ozone, said Kevin Stewart, director of Environmental Health at the American Lung Association of the Mid-Atlantic. That is deteriorating the health of people with weakened lungs. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, also contribute to temperature increases globally, he said.\n\n“What will happen is [air pollution], on its way to you on a hot, sunny day will become ozone,” Stewart said.\n\n“Ozone smog is harmful for public health and especially for children, older adults and those with asthma and other lung diseases,” he said.\n\nDavid Stevenson, director of the Center for Energy Competitiveness at Wilmington-based, conservative think-tank Caesar Rodney Institute, disputes DNREC’s numbers about out-of-state emitters and said coal power is critical to the country’s energy supply despite recent shifts away from the fuel.\n\nThe majority of ozone, he said, comes from naturally occurring sources and regulators should not disturb industry based upon uncertain science.\n\n“If every source of pollution were shut off in the world, we’d still get days of high ozone,” Stevenson said.\n\nRegulators take action\n\nDNREC officials, whose views differ starkly with Stevenson’s, say they are gaining ground on Delaware’s air pollution fight in-state, pointing to an 80 percent reduction in the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide at the Indian River Power Plant in Millsboro since 2010.\n\nBut those efforts have not allowed Delaware to consistently meet pollution standards set by the EPA in 2008 because the First State is being “thwarted” by emissions from Maryland, Pennsylvania and states farther west.\n\n“It’s just that we are at the mercy of upwind sources,” Small said.\n\nThat argument is the “basis” of two lawsuits DNREC filed this summer with the federal court system in the hope of forcing states to act.\n\nThe first, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, challenges a ruling that would give Delaware’s neighbors another year to meet federal ozone standards set in 2008.\n\nOne more year for Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey would mean more time that asthmatic people and others would have to breathe polluted air, officials say. It also puts Delaware businesses at a competitive disadvantage, Small said.\n\n“Those who worry about economic development here in Delaware might be saying, ‘What are we doing? We ought to be using some of that available [pollution] headspace for our own economic development purposes,” he said.\n\nDNREC also filed a petition with the EPA asking the federal agency to mandate pollution reductions at the Brunner Island Power plant near York, Pennsylvania.\n\nSmall said computer modeling indicates the plant’s three coal-fired electric generating units are contributing to unhealthy ozone in Delaware.\n\nBrunner Island is the 127th largest industrial greenhouse gas emitter in the country. The issue, Small said, is about more than total emissions but also the way a plant cleans them.\n\n“We’re filing petitions with EPA for power plants that either don’t have pollution control equipment, and these are coal-fired plants, or they have the equipment and they don’t run it during ozone season,” Small said.\n\nEPA spokeswoman Joan Schafer said the agency would not comment on the court cases “as we are currently reviewing the data.”\n\nStevenson argues the data will show that Delaware has no case and that insignificant amount of pollutants drift into Delaware from other states.\n\nHe alleges DNREC officials might be trying to manufacture an ozone “crisis” to justify their existence, saying that ozone levels across the U.S. are down significantly from the 1980s before federal standards were set.\n\nNevertheless, more states and individual industrial facilities could be targeted for future DNREC suits, Small said, but he declined to name any.\n\nIn a July statement, DNREC said Delaware’s air will improve only if upwind states reduce emissions, including “Maryland and Pennsylvania and other states further west and as far away as Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.”\n\n“We’re just trying to use every tool that we have available to us because we feel like we’ve done as far as our own regulatory framework, about as much as we can do,” Small said.\n\nDNREC's lawsuits follow similar action taken in 2011 by the Delaware justice department to limit out-of-state pollution from drifting into the First State. Then-Attorney General Beau Biden intervened in a lawsuit filed by Kansas that challenged the EPA's ability to limit cross-state pollution.\n\n“Delawareans should not be subjected to increased air pollution because other states do not take the necessary steps to control pollution produced within their borders,” Biden said in a 2011 statement.\n\nEarly this month, the EPA did move unilaterally to limit second-hand, cross-state pollutants for 2017, announcing that it will reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide allowed to cross state lines during the summer of that year from power plants in 22 states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland.\n\nContinues to play soccer\n\nDr. Katherine King, a pediatric pulmonologist at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital, is building a database of hospital visits from asthmatic patients that might give researchers a clearer view of the connection between pollutants and lung diseases. While ozone is clearly a threat, she said, microscopic particles, which are vented from engines or power plants and float in the air, might be just as dangerous.\n\n“Ozone is the elephant in the room, but the little things that we may not be measuring, may, in fact, be causing a lot of damage,” she said.\n\nViruses and pollen also can irritate asthmatic people, she said, but emissions are something that can, and should, be regulated, she said.\n\nAccording to an August report from New York University' Marron Institute, 41 Delawareans die each year on average as a result of air pollution, making it the sixth highest death rate in the country. At least three state did not have data.\n\nUntil the air is cleaned, Daniel must be constantly vigilant when outside, but he will not live condemned to an indoor “bubble,\" shielded from Delaware's outdoor air pollution. While there are times when he must stay indoors – windows closed, with the hope that a clean air filter sits between him and the toxins outside, he is also an active soccer player.

The menacing asteroid will harmlessly pass by, astronomers say.\n\nApophis measures nearly a quarter of a mile long – about the size of a cruise ship – making it large enough to be visible to the naked eye when it shoots past Earth.\n\nSpace agencies and scientific institutes around the world are planning to use the rare flyby to explore Apophis from the ground with telescopes and even spacecraft.\n\nAmong astronomers both professional and amateur, perhaps no asteroid is more notorious than Apophis.\n\nIf you've heard of Apophis, then you're likely aware of the reputation it gained upon its discovery two decades ago as a potentially very dangerous space rock hurtling too close for comfort toward Earth. It was initially believed that the asteroid could one day pose a serious threat to our planet.\n\nAnd one day, it just might.\n\nBut that day won't come for at least 100 years, astronomers say. No, not even in 2029, when Apophis makes the closest approach to Earth that any asteroid of its size ever has – at least, one that scientists have known about in advance.\n\nAdditional observations of Apophis have allowed astronomers to long rule out the risk of an impact in 2029 when Apophis is predicted to come within a distance of Earth 10 times closer than the moon, according to NASA. The asteroid also won't hit our planet when it makes another close approach in 2036.\n\nWhile we and our children are safe from Apophis' wrath, scientists still see a valuable opportunity to study the asteroid as it whizzes by Earth to learn what they can of other space rocks that actually could hit our planet.\n\nHere's what to know about Apophis and how space agencies hope to protect Earth from other asteroids like it.\n\nApophis to make 2029 flyby to Earth\n\nApophis is projected to pass within 20,000 miles of our planet’s surface on April 13, 2029.\n\nFor the superstitious lot, yes, that's a Friday, no less.\n\nOn that day, Apophis will come closer than telecommunications satellites in geostationary orbit, the ESA says.\n\nThe close encounter with Earth will make the asteroid visible in the Eastern hemisphere, including in Europe, Africa, and western Asia. It should look somewhat like a bright star streaking across the sky.\n\nEarth's gravity will significantly influence Apophis – squeezing and distorting the asteroid as one side is pulled toward our planet more than the other. While no affects will be felt on Earth, Apophis may experience some quakes and even landslides, the ESA said.\n\nWill Apophis hit earth?\n\nIn short, no. Not during our lifetimes, anyway.\n\nWhile Apophis is classified as a near-Earth asteroid because its orbit bring it within 30 million miles of Earth, you have nothing to fear from it.\n\nApophis was initially identified as one of the most hazardous asteroids that could impact Earth after its 2004 discovery, but that assessment has since changed as astronomers tracked it and learned more about its orbit.\n\nWhile the risk of it impacting Earth during its 2029 flyby rose as high as 2.7%, Apophis has since been removed from NASA’s Sentry Impact Risk Table. That's thanks to a radar observation campaign in March 2021 during a distant flyby that – combined with precise orbit analysis – allowed astronomers to determine that the asteroid poses no risk of crashing into Earth for at least a century.\n\nHow big is the Apophis asteroid?\n\nApophis measures nearly a quarter of a mile long – about the size of a cruise ship – making it large enough to be visible to the naked eye when it shoots past Earth.\n\nThe Planetary Society compares its size to the equivalent of about five football fields and taller than the Empire State Building in New York City.\n\nIt's hard to know just exactly what Apophis looks like, as scientists do not yet have images of it. But radar observations have suggested that Apophis is shaped roughly like a peanut – a relatively common shape among near-Earth asteroids larger than 660 feet in diameter, according to NASA.\n\nApophis is believed to be stony, made up of silicate (or rocky) materials and a mixture of metallic nickel and iron.\n\nWhat would happen if Apophis hit Earth?\n\nThough not as big or catastrophic as the asteroid theorized to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Apophis would cause widespread destruction up to several hundred kilometers from its impact site.\n\nThe energy released would be equal more than 1,000 megatons of TNT, or tens to hundreds of nuclear weapons, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization promoting space exploration.\n\nWhat does 'Apophis' mean?\n\nApophis is no different from other asteroids in that it is a remnant from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. It originated in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and spent millions of years being altered by the gravitational influence of large planets such as Jupiter, NASA said.\n\nNow, Apophis's orbit around the sun brings it startlingly close to Earth.\n\nIt's partly due to its proximity, as well as the sheer devastation its impact with Earth would bring, that astronomers named the asteroid after an ancient Egyptian god of disorder.\n\nSpecifically, Apophis is named for the demon serpent who personified evil and chaos.\n\nESA, NASA hope to study Apophis\n\nSpace agencies and scientific institutes around the world are planning to use the rare flyby to explore Apophis from the ground with telescopes and even spacecraft.\n\nNASA's OSIRIS-REx, which gathered and returned a sample of asteroid Bennu in September, has been renamed OSIRIS-APophis EXplorer (OSIRIS-APEX) and sent on a trajectory that would allow it to cross paths with the asteroid in 2029. When it has its rendezvous with Apophis in June that year, OSIRIS-APEX will spend 18 months mapping the asteroid’s surface and analyzing its chemical makeup, according to NASA.\n\nEarth-based telescopes will observe Apophis as well, but they won't be able to detect as much as the spacecraft will when the asteroid gets near the sun, NASA said. But unlike with the Bennu mission, OSIRIS-APEX will not collect a sample from Apophis.\n\nThe European Space Agency, NASA's counterpart across the pond, plans to launch a spacecraft of its own called Ramses.\n\nThe Ramses spacecraft, which must be ready to launch a year ahead of time, will meet Apophis before it passes by Earth and accompany it on its way out of our orbit. During that time, the mission will observe how the surface of the asteroid changes from being in such close proximity to Earth, the European Space Agency said in July.\n\nNASA takes on dangerous asteroids\n\nThe expedition is all part of the steps NASA and other space agencies have taken in recent years to protect humanity from threats posed by asteroids and other inbound space rocks, such as comets.\n\nIn September 2022, NASA intentionally slammed a spacecraft into the small asteroid Dimorphos at roughly 14,000 mph.\n\nThough Dimorphos posed no threat to Earth, the mission served as the first demonstration of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART. If an incoming asteroid is ever on a collision course with our planet, the space agency has said that the DART method could prove crucial for deflecting and changing the object's orbital path.\n\nAnd to gauge whether authorities are prepared to defend Earth from space objects, NASA has hosted a series of exercises, the fifth and most recent of which occurred in April, with findings announced in June. It was the first such exercise to include about 100 international government representatives who gathered to work through a hypothetical scenario about an inbound asteroid.\n\nThe exercise was organized by the U.S. space agency's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, which was established in 2016 to catalog near-Earth objects that could crash into the planet.\n\nNASA is also working on an asteroid-hunting telescope known as the NEO Surveyor to find near-Earth objects capable of causing significant damage. Set to launch no earlier than June 2028, the telescope is designed to discover 90% of asteroids and comets that are 460 feet in size or larger and come within 30 million miles of Earth’s orbit.\n\nContributing: Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Consisting of parts of discarded rockets, spacecraft and satellites, the European Space Agency (ESA) estimates there are now 36,500 objects of space debris greater than 10cm in near-Earth orbit, along with more than 130 million smaller objects.\n\nMost of this space junk is moving up to seven times the speed of a bullet, meaning “an object no bigger than a penny could easily destroy a spacecraft”, said BBC Science Focus.\n\n“These objects pose more than just a hypothetical threat,” according to Space.com. From 1999 to May 2021, the International Space Station (ISS) conducted 29 debris-avoiding manoeuvres, including three in 2020 alone, said Nasa. This number continues to grow.\n\nEven more worryingly, said Dr Alastair Gunn in Science Focus, a “critical mass” of space junk “may be only a few decades away, where one major collision results in an uncontrollable chain reaction, causing untold damage”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThis is known as the Kessler Syndrome, named after the former Nasa scientist Donald Kessler who laid out the idea of a orbital debris chain-reaction in a seminal 1978 paper. It featured in the 2013 Oscar-winning film “Gravity” and could make space travel impossible in the future, also disrupting our complex web of satellites so crucial to global communications.\n\nWhat can be done to clean up space?\n\n“Unfortunately,” said Space.com, “private companies and national governments have been slow to act.”\n\nMost of the efforts focus on mitigation and avoidance of generating space junk in the first place but this does not address the huge amount of debris already there.\n\nWaiting for the Earth’s atmosphere to drag debris into low orbit where it will burn up in the atmosphere can take decades. This has led to more radical clean-up proposals including “gathering the debris using nets, harpoons, laser beams or mini-satellites”, said Gunn.\n\nThe problem, said Space.com, is that besides the ground-based laser, all of the proposals call for launching new satellites, “thus making satellite cleanup uncomfortably expensive”.\n\nAlso, any satellite clean-up technology “automatically becomes a ‘remove an enemy’s satellite from the sky’ technology”. So any proposal “quickly moves into the murky waters of defense, international diplomacy and the militarization of space.\n\n“For now, our best strategy is to track, monitor and warn, using a network of ground- and satellite-based observatories – and cross our fingers,” said the website.\n\nWho is liable for space debris that falls to Earth?\n\nWhile instances of space junk falling to Earth is “pretty rare”, said Australian broadcaster 9news, it does happen. The Times reported that there are villages in the remote northwest of Russia where people scavenge for space debris from a nearby launch site.\n\nThe debris provides an “unexpected resource for locals”, said the paper. But it “also poses an existential threat” in the form of a highly toxic chemical compound called unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine – a rocket propellant – suspected of causing cancer.\n\nWho pays for the clean-up depends on where it lands, if there is damage, and crucially, what the debris is, space lawyer and professor Melissa de Zwart told 9news.\n\nIn short, the answer is “whoever launched the object into space” in the first place, reported Al Jazeera.\n\n“There is a United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, and they have an Outer Space Treaty that everyone has signed, saying that whoever launches something into space is responsible for it right until the very end,” said European Space Agency engineer Andrea Boyd.\n\nCrucially, however, “liability under international law attaches to states, not to companies”, she said. This means that if, as seems likely, the recently discovered rocket was launched by India, it will be liable for any damage and disposal. But if it is launched by a private company, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX, it would be the liability of the United States.\n\nThis is particularly problematic given the majority of satellites launched in recent years have been by corporations. SpaceX, for example, has already launched more than 1,700 satellites into orbit while Amazon is now aiming to assemble its own internet-satellite network.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Theunis Bates", "Joel Mathis", "Peter Weber", "Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "Jeva Lange"], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/04/taurids-meteor-shower-peak/71410104007/", "title": "Meteor shower this weekend: How to see Taurid fireball stream peak", "text": "A meteor shower known for its cascade of bright fireballs is set to peak in activity during the next few days, offering an ideal opportunity for stargazers to catch a glimpse of its mesmerizing display.\n\nBoth the Northern and Southern Taurid meteor streams become visible for several weeks of the year each fall as Earth passes through a stream of debris left by Comet Encke. November is when the meteors produced by both branches of the Taurid meteor stream will be most active, beginning this weekend with the Southern Taurids.\n\nHere's what to know about the Southern Taurid meteor shower and its upcoming peak.\n\n'Not to be missed':'Devil comet' may be visible to naked eye in April. Here's how to see it.\n\nWhen can you see the Southern Taurid meteor shower?\n\nTaurid meteors can be seen when the constellation Taurus is above the horizon between September and November, according to NASA.\n\nLasting for weeks, the Taurid meteor streams tend to be slow moving with higher visibility compared to other meteor showers like Orion and Perseid.\n\nEven at their peak, neither the Southern nor Northern branches of the Taurid meteor stream are particularly frequent, producing only about five meteors an hour. But the meteors they do produce are famously big and bright, leading to an increase in fireball activity when they're active at the same time, according to the American Meteorological Society.\n\nWhile the Southern Taurids are active between Sept. 23 and Dec. 8, astronomers anticipate that the celestial light show will be most visible Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe Northern Taurids, which are active between Oct. 13 and Dec. 2, will then peak around Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.\n\nAncient radio burst:A radio burst that traveled 8 billion years to reach Earth is the farthest ever detected\n\nHow to watch the Taurid meteor shower\n\nThe Taurids, which come from the approximate direction of the Taurus constellation, are visible practically anywhere on Earth with the exception of the South Pole.\n\nThe best time of day to see the activity tends to be after midnight and before dawn. That's when the moon won't interfere with the display and the Taurus constellation, which is the shower's radiant point from where it originates, is high in the sky, according to Earth Sky, a website devoted to astronomy and Earth sciences.\n\nLocated northeast of the Orion constellation, Taurus can be identified by finding the bright red star known as Aldebaran and the star cluster Pleiades. And as long as stargazers are in a dark location, equipment like telescopes and binoculars shouldn't be necessary to glimpse the celestial light show.\n\n\"Hunting for meteors, like the rest of astronomy, is a waiting game, so it's best to bring a comfy chair to sit on and to wrap up warm as you could be outside for a while,\" according to Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG).\n\nStudy:Asteroid known as Polyhymnia may contain 'superheavy' elements unknown to humans\n\nWhat causes the Taurid meteor shower?\n\nCommonly called shooting stars, meteors are generated when debris enters and burns up in Earth’s atmosphere. The resulting meteor showers occur when Earth travels through a cloud of comet debris.\n\nAstronomers believe the meteors produced by both Taurid streams are debris left behind by Encke’s comet.\n\nWhile Encke's comet was discovered in 1786 by French astronomer Pierre F. A. Mechain, the comet was named after German astronomer Johann Franz Encke who calculated its orbit, according to NASA.\n\nThought by some astronomers to be a piece of a larger comet that broke up tens of thousands of years ago, Encke has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within the solar system, taking 3.3 years to orbit the sun.\n\nEach time comet Encke returns to the inner solar system, its comparatively small nucleus sheds ice and rock into space to create a vast debris stream.\n\nThe debris stream is dispersed across such a large swatch of space that it takes Earth a lengthy time to pass through it. That's why we see two segments of the same debris cloud, according to RMG: the Northern Taurids and the Southern Taurids.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Liftoff occurred at 9:54 a.m. ET. A few hours later, just after 1 p.m. ET, the Soyuz capsule docked with the ISS, allowing the astronauts to board the space station.\n\nThis is the first trip to space for Rubio, who will serve as a flight engineer on this mission. A trained family physician, he also has experience as a flight surgeon — meaning he’s got the chops to take care of any medical issues that could arise during their journey.\n\nRubio, a Florida native, joined NASA in 2017. Prior to his acceptance in the astronaut corps, he graduated from the US Military Academy and earned a doctorate of medicine from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. He has more than 600 hours of combat experience in countries including Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. Rubio considers Miami his hometown, according to NASA, although he was born in California and his mother lives in El Salvador.\n\nWhen Rubio and his Russian counterparts make it to the space station, they’ll be tag-teaming with astronauts from the United States, Russia and Europe. The space station, which has continuously had people on board since the year 2000, keeps a rotating base of crew members to ensure the orbiting laboratory is consistently staffed with enough astronauts to maintain the space station’s hardware as well as keep a lengthy log of space-based experiments operating.\n\nThe fact that Rubio is traveling to space on a Russian Soyuz capsule is notable.\n\nThe history of getting humans to and from the International Space Station began with Russia and the United States each having their own rockets to get their citizens to and from the ISS, which became a symbol of post-Cold War cooperation in the late 20th century and early 2000s. But after 2011, when NASA retired its Space Shuttle program, Russia’s Soyuz capsules were the only option for US astronauts. NASA has been paying up to $90 million for seats aboard a Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nIn 2020, that changed. NASA had, years before, cooked up its own plan to allow privatized companies to take over the task of shuttling astronauts to and from the space station. And Elon Musk’s SpaceX has been doing that ever since, beginning with the Demo-2 mission in 2020 and, most recently, gearing up for the Crew-5 mission. SpaceX’s launches have become routine for NASA, allowing it to take back some control over how the ISS is staffed.\n\nThe tension between the United States and Russia, however, hit a fever pitch after Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nBut after years of sharing rides on Russian Soyuz vehicles before SpaceX came onto the scene, one of the big questions that cropped up was whether the United States and Russia would continue to put their astronauts side by side on ISS missions.\n\nThat was answered in July when NASA and its Russian counterpart, Roscosmos, confirmed that sharing seats on rocket rides to the space station would continue. Russian cosmonauts are now expected to fly on SpaceX capsules in addition to NASA astronauts sharing seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nThe United States and Russia are the primary operators of the ISS, with both countries controlling its day-to-day operations. Importantly, the Russian-controlled segment houses the propulsion that is necessary to keep the ISS afloat in Earth’s orbit. And NASA has repeatedly said that one of its goals is to ensure continued cooperation between the US and Russia in space.\n\nRubio, as many US astronauts had done before him, traveled to Russia to train with Russian cosmonauts ahead of this mission.\n\n“It’s been a privilege to be here,” he told CNN’s Kristin Fisher during an August press conference. “We have a pretty robust NASA team that’s here to support the mission … I think every one of us would say we do feel safe.”", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/world/mars-nasa-meteoroid-impacts-scn/index.html", "title": "Space rock slams into Mars, forming a crater that revealed chunks of ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nChristmas came a little early for NASA’s InSight mission last December when the lander detected a massive quake on Mars.\n\nNow, scientists know what caused the red planet to rumble. A meteoroid slammed into Mars 2,174 miles (3,500 kilometers) away from the lander and created a fresh impact crater on the Martian surface.\n\nThe ground literally moved beneath InSight on December 24, 2021, when the lander recorded a magnitude 4 marsquake. Before and after photos captured from above by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling Mars since 2006, spotted a new crater this past February.\n\nBefore and after photos taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show where a meteoroid slammed into Mars on December 24, 2021. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nWhen scientists connected the dots from both missions, they realized it was one of the largest meteoroid strikes on Mars since NASA began studying the red planet. Images from the orbiter’s two cameras showed the blast zone of the crater, which allowed scientists to compare it with the epicenter of the quake detected by InSight.\n\nThe journal Science published two new studies describing the impact and its effects on Thursday.\n\nThe space rock also revealed boulder-size ice chunks when it slammed into Mars. They were found buried closer to the warm Martian equator than any ice that has ever been detected on the planet.\n\nBoulder-size ice chunks can be seen scattered around and outside the new crater's rim. NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona\n\n“The image of the impact was unlike any I had seen before, with the massive crater, the exposed ice, and the dramatic blast zone preserved in the Martian dust,” said Liliya Posiolova, orbital science operations lead for the orbiter at Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, in a statement.\n\n“I couldn’t help but imagine what it must have been like to witness the impact, the atmospheric blast, and debris ejected miles downrange.”\n\nStudying the ice revealed by the impact will help scientists better understand previous climate conditions on Mars, as well as how and when the ice was deposited and buried.\n\nResearchers estimated the meteoroid, the name for a space rock before it hits the ground, was about 16 to 39 feet (5 to 12 meters). While this would have been small enough to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, the same can’t be said for Mars, which has a thin atmosphere only 1% as dense as Earth’s.\n\nWhen the meteoroid crashed into Mars, it created a crater in the planet’s Amazonis Planitia region spanning 492 feet (150 meters) across and 70 feet (21 meters) deep. Some of the material blasted out of the crater landed as far as 23 miles (37 kilometers) away. Teams at NASA also captured sound from the impact, so you can listen to what it sounds like when a space rock hits Mars.\n\nNASA’s InSight Records the Sound of a Martian Impact\n\nThe images captured by the orbiter, along with seismic data recorded by InSight, make the impact one of the largest craters in our solar system ever observed as it was created. Mars is littered with massive craters, but they’re much older than any mission to explore the red planet.\n\n“It’s unprecedented to find a fresh impact of this size,” said Ingrid Daubar, InSight impact science lead at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in a statement. “It’s an exciting moment in geologic history, and we got to witness it.”\n\nIf a quake like this one had occurred on Earth, it would be “big enough to be felt, but not big enough to cause a ton of damage,” Daubar said. About a thousand quakes of this size occur on Earth each year, but Mars is less active than our planet, so it was “a pretty big one” for the red planet, she said.\n\nThe quake that resulted from the impact also created surface waves, or a seismic wave that moved along the top of the Martian crust. InSight’s data from the event will help scientists study the planet’s crust and learn more about its structure.\n\nStudying craters and their formation rate can help scientists pin down Mars’ geologic timeline. Impact craters also excavate material and bring it to the surface, like the ice revealed by the December 24 strike.\n\nIce beneath the Martian surface could be used for drinking water, rocket propellant and even growing crops and plants by future astronauts. And the fact that the ice was found so near the equator, the warmest region on Mars, might make it an ideal place to land crewed missions to the red planet.\n\nPreviously, InSight has “heard” and detected space rocks hitting Mars, but the December impact was the largest. Since landing on 2018, the mission has revealed new details about Mars’ crust, mantle and core and detected 1,318 marsquakes.\n\nSadly, InSight’s mission is running out of time. Increasing amounts of dust have settled on the lander’s solar panels, only exacerbated by a continent-size dust storm detected on Mars in September, and its power levels keep dropping.\n\nThe beige clouds are a continent-size dust storm imaged by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on September 29. The locations of the Perseverance, Curiosity and InSight missions are also labeled.

But the weather event has kicked a lot of dust up into the atmosphere, and it has cut down the amount of sunlight reaching InSight’s solar panels, said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe mission scientists estimate InSight will likely shut down in the next six weeks, ending a promising mission to unlock the interior of Mars.\n\n“For the last four years we’ve gone well beyond the intended lifetime of the mission, which was two years,” Banerdt said. ” And even now as we’re winding down, we’re still getting these amazing new results.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/world/nye-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "title": "The moments and discoveries that provided us with wonder in 2022 ...", "text": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCape Canaveral, Florida CNN —\n\nThe historic Artemis I mission took flight in the early hours of Wednesday morning after months of anticipation. The milestone event kicked off a journey that will send an uncrewed spacecraft around the moon, paving the way for NASA to return astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft’s spectacular first views of Earth were shared more than nine hours into the journey, with the vehicle about 57,000 miles away from our planet on its way to the moon.\n\nIt’s the first time since the final Apollo mission in 1972 that a spacecraft designed to carry humans to the moon has captured a view of Earth.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft shared its first view of Earth more than nine hours after launch Wednesday morning. NASA\n\nThe towering, 322-foot-tall (98-meter-tall) Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket lit its engines at 1:47 a.m. ET. It emitted up to 9 million pounds (4.1 million kilograms) of thrust to haul itself off the launchpad in Florida and into the air, streaking vibrantly across the night sky.\n\nAtop the rocket was the Orion spacecraft, a gumdrop-shaped capsule that broke away from the rocket after reaching space. Orion is designed to carry humans, but its passengers for this test mission are of the inanimate variety, including some mannequins collecting vital data to help future live crews.\n\nThe SLS rocket expended millions of pounds of fuel before parts of the rocket began breaking away, and Orion was left to soar through orbit with just one large engine. That engine then set off two powerful burns to put the spacecraft on the correct trajectory toward the moon. Then, about two hours after liftoff, the rocket engine also fell away, leaving Orion to free-fly for the remainder of its journey.\n\nOn the 20th day of the Artemis I mission, NASA's Orion spacecraft made its second close flyby of the moon's surface.

The burn sets Orion up for its lunar flyby and closest approach of the moon on November 21 before entering a distant retrograde orbit around the moon on November 25.\n\nOrion will come within about 60 miles (96 kilometers) of the lunar surface during its close flyby next week.\n\nThe spacecraft is outfitted with 16 cameras inside and outside to document its trip around the moon from different perspectives. One image shared Wednesday showed Commander Moonikin Campos, one of the Artemis mannequins riding in the capsule, decked out in a survival suit.\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos (left) can be seen sitting inside the Orion capsule. NASA\n\nOrion is expected to log roughly 1.3 million miles (2 million kilometers), taking a path that will lead it farther than any other spacecraft designed for human flight has traveled, according to NASA. After orbiting the moon, Orion will make its return trip, completing its journey in about 25.5 days. The capsule is then scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego on December 11, when recovery teams will be waiting nearby to haul it to safety.\n\nThroughout the mission, NASA engineers will be keeping a close eye on the spacecraft’s performance. The team will evaluate whether Orion performs as intended and will be ready to support its first crewed mission to lunar orbit, which is currently scheduled for 2024.\n\nThis mission also marks the debut flight of the SLS rocket as the most powerful ever to reach Earth’s orbit, boasting 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rocket that powered NASA’s 20th century moon landings.\n\nAnd this mission is just the first in what’s expected to be a long series of increasingly difficult Artemis missions as NASA works toward its goal of establishing a permanent outpost at the moon. Artemis II will follow a similar path as Artemis I but will have astronauts on board. Artemis III, slated for later this decade, is expected to land a woman and a person of color on the lunar surface for the first time.\n\nA long road to liftoff\n\nThe mission team encountered a number of setbacks in the lead-up to Wednesday morning’s launch, including technical issues with the mega moon rocket and two hurricanes that have rolled through the launch site.\n\nFueling the SLS rocket with superchilled liquid hydrogen proved to be one main issue that forced NASA to wave off earlier takeoff attempts, but on Tuesday, the tanks were filled despite leak issues that halted fueling hours before launch.\n\nRead more: The big numbers that make the Artemis I mission a monumental feat\n\nTo address that problem, NASA deployed what it calls a “red crew” — a group of personnel specially trained to make repairs while the rocket is loaded with propellant. They tightened some nuts and bolts to stop the fuel leaks.\n\n“The rocket, it’s alive, it’s creaking, its making venting noises — it’s pretty scary. So … my heart was pumping. My nerves were going but, yeah, we showed up today. When we walked up the stairs. We were ready to rock and roll,” red crew member Trent Annis said in an interview on NASA TV after launch.\n\nAs @NASA_Orion begins the #Artemis I mission to the Moon, the spacecraft captured these stunning views of our home planet. pic.twitter.com/Pzk3PDt7sd — NASA Artemis (@NASAArtemis) November 16, 2022\n\nOther NASA personnel at the launch site’s firing room, where agency officials make crucial decisions in the hours and moments before liftoff, celebrated a victory.\n\n“Well for once I might be speechless,” said Artemis I launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, the first woman to hold such a role.\n\n“I have talked a lot about appreciating the moment that you’re in,” Blackwell-Thompson said in remarks to the engineers in the firing room. “And we have worked hard as a team. You guys have worked hard as a team to this moment. This is your moment.”\n\nBlackwell-Thompson then declared it was time for tie-cutting, a NASA tradition in which launch operators snip off the ends of their business ties. Blackwell-Thompson’s was cut by shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach, and she pledged to the others in the room, “I’ll stay all night if I have to. It’ll be my pleasure to cut ties.”\n\nSeveral astronauts were on-site for the launch, and NASA administrator Bill Nelson told reporters that he watched liftoff from a nearby rooftop with a few of the them.\n\n“There were a bunch there that would like to be on that rocket,” Nelson said.\n\nINTERACTIVE: Trace the path Artemis I will take around the moon and back", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}]}

It also surfaced as a factor in the recent shelving of a $1 billion project at the Delaware City Refinery, and a contributor to uncertainty surrounding another refinery venture.\n\nEarly thoughts are that the $400 million to $600 million port expansion bid might qualify as an allowable light industry, New Castle County Executive Tom Gordon said. But concerns remain about Coastal Zone conflicts the location of a new cargo complex outside the original city port's boundaries. Similar consistency tests await any other job-creating ventures or attempts to redevelop brownfields and under-used industrial sites inside the zone.\n\n\"I believe we need to make use of our coastline, safely, cleanly. We don't have much left but that now\" for economic development, Gordon said days ahead of Monday's planned release of a joint economic development plan for Wilmington and the County.\n\n\"When [former Gov.] Russ Peterson wrote the Coastal Zone Act, it was a really great thing. We had a corporation on every corner and we were the number one city in the world in the '60s,\" Gordon said. \"Wilmington's environment is full of bullets right now. That's a concern, too.\"\n\nState and business officials have long worried that Coastal Zone will permanently stymie efforts to redevelop and improve blighted, vacant or underused industrial locations inside the zone along the mostly urban strip between the refinery in the south and the now-closed Evraz Claymont Steel plant and shuttered General Chemical site at the state's border in the north.\n\n\"It's obvious it's not going to be a park,\" Delaware State Chamber of Commerce President A. Richard Heffron said of areas just south of Marcus Hook. \"We need to take a serious look at these things.\"\n\nOthers drew different conclusions.\n\n\"Do I think there will be people who push for amending the act. Of course. There always are,\" said James R. May, a law professor and co-director of the Environmental Law Center at Widener University who believes the act should be tightened and expanded to include residential land uses in the zone, in addition to industry.\n\n\"I think it will happen again. There will be proposals for conversations first, which will turn into proposals to change regulations which potentially will be proposals for changing the act.\"\n\nDavid Carter, conservation chair for Delaware Audubon, rejected suggestions that the law is too restrictive, and said that it has plenty of defenders.\n\n\"Go ahead and go after it. It will reinvigorate Delaware's environmental movement in a way they haven't seen in 35 years,\" Carter said. He said that financial barriers are to blame for holding back job-creating clean-ups and redevelopments of under-used and polluted brownfields outside the zone, rather than environmental laws protecting sensitive areas.\n\nOriginal need\n\nThe General Assembly approved the act in June 1971, banning new heavy industries and bulk material loading operations from a 275,000 acre buffer along the Delaware River, Delaware Bay and Atlantic Coast. Existing plants and factories were generally confined to ongoing activities within their property boundaries at the time of enactment.\n\nSupporters pressed for the law to head off proposals for a new refinery and other industrial ventures in the zone, drawing the wrath and unsuccessful opposition of national business interests and the Nixon administration. Years of site-by-site battles and disputes over regulations needed to manage the law and ban followed passage. Supporters noted that the act preserved vast areas of irreplaceable coastal and wooded habitat.\n\nHeffron said last week that the law needs to be considered in light of the state's wider economic, redevelopment and environmental goals.\n\n\"It's been my argument for a while that we need to relook at the Coastal zone, look at those industrial areas and see what kind of clean industries we can attract, and redefine what a heavy industry is,\" Heffron said. Government willingness might have increased since the election, he said, with lawmakers having more than a year before the next campaigns heat up, and Gov. Jack Markell having only two years left in his tenure.\n\n\"I think maybe now is the time to do it,\" Heffron said. \"You need to get some environmental groups on board, and you need to sit down and discuss planning\" and economic development and environmental goals.\n\nJust over the border\n\nEvidence of the Coastal Zone stakes today can been seen just north of Claymont and the Delaware-Pennsylvania line, where Sun Logistics Partners on Thursday announced a $2.5 billion pipeline gathering plan that will send huge volumes of natural gas liquids to Sunoco's former Marcus Hook refinery.\n\nSupplies from the Marcellus Shale region are expected to support an export industry as well as new and expanded petrochemical businesses. Construction of a new \"world scale\" chemical production unit already is under consideration at Marcus Hook that would convert arriving natural gas propane into propylene, a valuable plastics and chemical industry ingredient. Some forecasts have pointed to a million-barrel daily volume in the future.\n\nSimilar industrial site redevelopment and re-purposing would seemingly be impossible just a few hundred hundred yards south in Delaware, officials have acknowledged, at places like the once-dangerous, long-shuttered former General Chemical sulfuric acid plant off Philadelphia Pike.\n\nLate last month, PBF Energy cited economics and \"significant permitting issues\" in Delaware among its reasons for writing off $28 million spent on preparations for a $1 billion addition for production of low-sulfur fuels at Delaware City. Later that same day, a refinery subsidiary reported it was considering its own natural gas liquid transfer venture at Delaware City, but dealing with a lukewarm state response.\n\nNeither Delaware Economic Development Office Director Alan Levin nor Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary David Small responded to questions about the issue last week.\n\nLorraine Fleming, a longtime Delaware Nature Society member active in drafting long delayed Coastal Zone regulations, said she and other environmental advocates are aware of chafing over Coastal Zone Act restrictions.\n\n\"It's more than a desire, there's an almost-passionate desire to introduce new industry to Delaware, whether it be manufacturing with a permit or something that's totally illegal, like expanding the port, a new port or a new bulk transfer facility\" at the refinery, Fleming said.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest in keeping an eye on what's going on.\"\n\nSen. Karen Peterson, D-Stanton, a former New Castle County Council president, said that moves to adjust the Coastal Zone law are \"a temptation, obviously, when you look at the competition just over the state line. But we're responsible for Delaware, not Pennsylvania.\"\n\nUnder pressure\n\nFew organized Coastal Zone discussions have taken place since 2011, Peterson said, when Widener University hosted a symposium on the law for the 40th anniversary of its passage.\n\nAs a sign of the sensitivities, organizers described the symposium in advance as a \"neutral forum for a civil conversation\" on the issue.\n\n\"I've not heard any proposals to amend the Coastal Zone Act,\" Peterson said. \"Unless and until we hear that, I can tell you my mind set coming into it is to leave it intact. It has served the people of Delaware well for all these years. I don't know why we would want to change it.\"\n\nCarter said that moves to amend the Coastal Zone law would quickly trigger \"a lot of rabble rousing,\" particularly in \"communities that are already concerned about the oil trains.\"\n\nAudubon and other groups are still disputing PBF's construction of a more-than $100 million crude oil train offloading track and barge loading facility without Coastal Zone review. Although the company has credited the investment with turning around Delaware City's fortunes, critics say the move created new and inadequately examined environmental risks and industrial activities.\n\nCarter said that the economic slowdown and other factors are to blame for the state's blue collar squeeze.\n\n\"All of our union guys are concerned. We've lost heavy industry, manufacturing and construction, and they're looking for a scapegoat,\" Carter said. \"With no data whatsoever, right now [the target] has become the Coastal Zone.\"\n\n\"Redevelopment is limited by not being able to cleanup brownfields,\" Carter said. \"It's not a restriction, it's just that you don't have the money to do it.\"\n\nMartin Willis, a union boilermaker who has been active at public meetings on a number of Delaware industrial projects in recent years, said environmental groups appear too ready to rule out industrial growth without discussion.\n\n\"They want to stop everything,\" said Willis, who has worked on and off at Delaware City and recently took a 10-day job at Philadelphia Energy Solutions big refinery, while hoping that PBF will move forward with a hydrogen production unit that could mean months of work and tens of millions of dollars worth of investment at Delaware City.\n\n\"Right now, the energy markets are going to propel our economy around here,\" Willis said. \"I'm waiting for the hydrogen plant in Delaware, or there's a natural gas plant going up in Delta, Pa., right next to Peach Bottom. It's been dry for the last three years for boilermakers. It looks like it's going to be good for the next five or six.\"\n\nPaul Morrill, executive director of the Committee of 100 business group, said talks on Coastal Zone issues are \"hard to broach without setting off alarm bells.\"\n\n\"First of all, there's a recognition that it's very important environmental legislation, and nobody wants to mess with it,\" Morrill said. \"Having said that, we think it's worth seeing whether there are any uses that might be compatible with the Coastal Zone as it's evolved over time. We just know it's a very tricky thing.\"\n\n\"If there's no project that triggers constructive conversations, there's still going to need to be some offline conversations,\" Morrill said, \"almost confidence building diplomacy, so there's a sense that people's motives aren't questioned.\"\n\nMay, who has called the Coastal Zone law a \"love letter to future generations,\" said that it leaves ample room for growth apart from heavy industry, while protecting the environment from the kind of industrial landscape seen in the Marcus Hook area.\n\n\"You can't see the Delaware River from most places on the Marcus Hook side,\" May said. \"The corridor just over the Delaware line all the way to the airport is one block after the next with the remnants of an industrial past, boarded up ghost towns, although there are islands of hope there.\"\n\n\"Northern Delaware isn't just an island of hope. The state provides hope for what smart growth can look like, and there's still plenty of opportunity for growth in other areas.\"\n\nContact Jeff Montgomery at 463-3344 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2017/11/27/november-route-roundup-where-airlines-adding-or-cutting-service/886600001/", "title": "November route roundup: Where airlines are adding (or cutting ...", "text": "Airlines constantly tweak their schedules, trying to find profitable new routes or pulling the plug on ones that have underperformed. Airports and communities court these new services.\n\nThere are dozens of changes to airline routes each month. Here's a look at some of the most interesting:\n\nTwo new cities join United route map amid 10-route expansion\n\nUnited Airlines is adding 10 new routes from five of its hub airports. The expansion includes flights to two cities the company does not currently serve: Elmira, N.Y., and Wilmington, N.C.\n\nThe new service comes as United looks to solidify its network by increasing connecting opportunities at its hub airports.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: United’s new 18-hour flight is longest-ever by a U.S. airline\n\nFrom Chicago O’Hare, United will launch three new routes. Twice-daily flights to Wilmington and El Paso begin April 9 while a seasonal once-daily route to Fresno, Calif., begins June 7.\n\nUnited’s Los Angeles hub gets four new routes in the expansion. Twice-daily service to the Oregon cities of Medford and Redmond starts April 9 and will operate year-round. Seasonal daily flights to the Montana cities of Kalispell and Missoula begin June 7.\n\nElsewhere, United will add two daily round-trip flights between Newark Liberty and Elmira; two daily round-trip flights between Washington Dulles and Wilmington; and one daily round-trip flight between Denver and Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: The fleet and hubs of United Airlines (story continues below)\n\nSouthwest strikes Flint from schedule\n\nSouthwest Airlines will drop Flint, Mich., from its route map. The carrier’s last flight from the city will come June 6.\n\nThe move is rare for Southwest, known more for creating a stir when it enters new markets than for leaving them.\n\nStill, Flint will become the fifth destination axed by Southwest in the past year. The airline ended service to the Ohio airports of Dayton and Akron/Canton in June, paring two more cities it had inherited via its 2011 merger with AirTran Airways. Flights to the Cuban cities of Santa Clara and Varadero ended in September.\n\nOnce its Flint flights end in June, Southwest will still serve Michigan through airports in Detroit and Grand Rapids.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Reno: The biggest little freight hub you’ve never heard of (story continues below)\n\nSpirit adds Richmond, Columbus\n\nColumbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Va., are the latest cities to land new service on “ultra low-cost carrier” Spirit Airlines.\n\nSpirit’s Columbus debut will come Feb. 15, when the airline begins flying to Las Vegas and the Florida destinations of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Orlando and Tampa. Two more routes – seasonal offerings to New Orleans and Myrtle Beach, S.C. – begin March 22.\n\nRichmond’s first Spirit flights begin March 15, when the carrier launches non-stop service to both Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. The addition of the two new cities gives Spirit 62 total destinations.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Spirit picks flamboyant yellow as U.S. airlines repaint planes (story continues below)\n\nAer Lingus connects the Emerald City to the Emerald Isle\n\nAer Lingus will begin flying from Seattle on May 18, offering four flights a week to its main hub in Dublin on 265-seat Airbus A330 aircraft.\n\nThe launch of the Seattle route furthers a robust trans-Atlantic expansion for Aer Lingus since its acquisition in 2015 by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways and Iberia. (Full report: Fast-growing Aer Lingus makes Seattle its 12th U.S. destination)\n\nUnder IAG’s stewardship, Aer Lingus has begun service to six other U.S. cities: Hartford, Conn.; Los Angeles; Miami; Newark; Philadelphia and – now – Seattle. Combined with destinations it had already served prior to 2015, Aer Lingus will be flying from 12 U.S. airports once the latest flights begin. The carrier also flies to Toronto in Canada.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Aer Lingus CEO: 'No plans to join oneworld'\n\nAmerican adds Iceland flights as competition surges\n\nAmerican Airlines will begin flying to Iceland, becoming the last of the USA’s “big three” legacy carriers to add service to the nation.\n\nAmerican’s service begins June 7, when it launches daily non-stop service from its hub at Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) to Reykjavik. The seasonal flights will continue through Oct. 27. American will fly the route on 176-seat Boeing 757-200 jets that include 16 lie-flat business-class seats. (Full report: American adds Iceland flights as competition surges)\n\nAmerican’s Iceland service continues what’s become a flood of new flight options to the European island nation, as the big U.S. airlines push back against the dozens of new routes that Icelandic rivals WOW and Icelandair have added to the U.S. in recent years.\n\nThat includes at DFW, where both WOW and Icelandair each announced their own DFW routes just a week apart from each other in September. Now, with American’s even-more-recent announcement, Dallas/Fort Worth has gone from having zero routes to Iceland two months ago to three now.\n\nFor the time being, that leaves industry observers wondering whether DFW will have the demand to support all three routes.\n\n“It’s ultimately going to be a game of chicken,” the Airline Weekly trade publication predicted about the sudden glut of capacity between DFW and Reykjavik.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: The fleet and hubs of American Airlines (story continues below)\n\nAlaska Airlines makes its way to Pittsburgh\n\nAlaska Airlines has announced Pittsburgh as its newest destination. Starting Sept. 6, the carrier will fly one daily round-trip flight between Pittsburgh and its busiest hub in Seattle. Alaska will use Boeing 737 jets for the service, which will be the only non-stop flight connecting the cities.\n\nLos Angeles to Acapulco, non-stop on Volaris\n\nTravelers in Southern California will soon get a new non-stop connection to the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco.\n\nMexican low-cost carrier Volaris will launch non-stop Acapulco service from Los Angeles on Dec. 19, offering one round-trip flight every Tuesday. Flight time will be just more than 4 hours, with Volaris using Airbus A319 jets on the route. Volaris will be the only airline offering regular non-stop flights between the cities.\n\nAcapulco will become the twelfth route for Volaris at Los Angeles International Airport, which the airline counts as one of its focus cities.\n\nAnother airline calls it quits in Cuba\n\nAlaska Airlines is the latest U.S. airline to give up on Cuba. The carrier said its last flight between Havana and Los Angeles will be Jan. 22.\n\nAlaska Airlines cited new travel restrictions proposed for Cuba travel that it expected would dampen demand.\n\nCuba has not proved to be the boon many airlines had hoped for when flights to the nation were opened up to U.S. carriers. Nearly all of the big U.S. airlines rushed in with requests to fly to the island – especially on routes to Havana. But since flights began in 2016, a number of carriers ultimately have cut back their capacity to the island. Three airlines – Spirit, Frontier and Silver – have pulled out of the country altogether.\n\nPortland, Maine, gets some Big Apple love\n\nAmerican Airlines will connect Portland, Maine, to New York’s LaGuardia Airport starting this spring.\n\nThe service will begin April 3, with American’s affiliate Envoy offering two daily round-trip flights on 50-seat Embraer ERJ-140 regional jets.\n\nAmerican Airlines is the largest carrier at the Portland International Jetport. The airline already flies from the airport to its hubs in Charlotte, Philadelphia and Washington Reagan National.\n\nOnce the service begins, American will become the fourth carrier to offer non-stop service from Portland to one of the three big New York City-area airports. JetBlue flies from Portland to New York JFK while United flies to Newark Liberty. Delta flies from Portland to both JFK and LaGuardia airports.\n\nARCHIVES: Alaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love'\n\nIN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/02/google-amazon-might-be-next-addition-to-downtown-okc-skyline/70279050007/", "title": "Google, Amazon joining downtown skyline?

When do you see them building the middle and high school there and leaving Shepherd Mall?\n\nA: Freda Deskin, CEO and founder of Astec, confirms the school is planning to consolidate its operations at the elementary campus at 2600 General Pershing Blvd. As you note, the middle school and high school have been located at Shepherd Mall since the school was started. The school, K-12, has an enrollment of about 1,500 students.\n\nDeskin said the school bought ample land for the elementary with the plan to someday build an adjoining middle school and high school. As a charter school, however, Astec does not get facilities funding. With increased interest rates, construction was delayed. But once costs level out, she said, the wait won’t be very long.\n\nBoutique DNA came to an end with sale of 21c Museum Hotel\n\nQ: Any thoughts on why the 21c Museum Hotel failed and how a different hotel concept might have more success in the old Ford assembly plant?\n\nA: 21c Museum Hotels went from a small boutique hotel chain to being part of a massive global conglomerate. I was not surprised this didn't end well and I'm hearing a similar separation is set for Nashville.\n\nYou say Arts District, they say West Village, I say Film Row?\n\nQ: How many years do you think it will be until the jail is relocated? Also, which of the many branding attempts do you like for this district? West Village? Arts District? Film Row? Downtown? Which has the Lackmeyer seal of approval?\n\nMore:Designer for new county jail/health center selected by Oklahoma County\n\nA: It will take a couple of years, at least, to get a jail designed and built. I am intrigued by the possibility of the current jail becoming a server farm for Amazon or Google. Imagine seeing that name at the top of the jail and development on the surrounding surface parking. It could be a nice transformation. As for the area around 21c, I refer to it by the historic name, Film Row. West Village is a commercial development in the middle of the neighborhood.\n\nPotential airport regional transit line likely to serve nearby employers\n\nQ: Is it possible to extend the Will Rogers World Airport commuter rail line to include the industrial employers along Portland Avenue, like Amazon and the SkyWest Maintenance Hub?\n\nA: I'd be shocked if such a line doesn't extend that way.\n\nCould airport help establish regional transit link to downtown?\n\nQ: The Airport Trust can raise revenue by adding a passenger facility fee (tax) to all departing passenger tickets. It's usually about $3 to $5 per Airport. The funds are used to cover Airport operations and improvements. Now that Will Rogers World Airport has completed its expansion of the terminal, couldn't passenger facility funds go to improve the rail corridor to downtown, without the need for a vote of the citizens?\n\nA: I think you might be right or at least on the right track (forgive me on the pun). The airport also gets revenue from oil and gas royalties from its property. Could that assist in creating a line between downtown and the airport? Maybe. I'll ask.\n\nMore:Regional transit election likely by early 2025, will fund commuter rail network\n\nClean up of Reno Avenue between Bricktown and First Americans Museum likely\n\nQ: Do you know when planned improvements to Reno Avenue between Bricktown and the FAM will be revealed?\n\nA: It's possible with the beautification money provided by MAPS 4 and potential development along the corridor. But nothing is really planned out yet. I do believe the Chickasaw Nation will take an interest in the corridor.\n\nSales tax sole funding source for regional transportation\n\nQ: Can an Oklahoma municipality raise revenue by means of a fuel tax? What about a regional transportation authority?\n\nA: Currently, state law only allows the Regional Transportation Authority of Central Oklahoma to use sales taxes as a funding mechanism.\n\nEngineers ignored request to build bridge wide enough for commuter rail\n\nQ: Reducing or eliminating blocked rail crossings in Edmond is nice, but what about N 7th to N 16th, and along S Shields near Capitol Hill in OKC? Are there any other single-track bottlenecks between Downtown OKC and Norman? Part of that issue is the single-track bottleneck between 36th and Britton. It should've been expanded years ago. The BNSF bridge over I-235 should've been wide enough for two or three tracks when it was designed.\n\nCouldn't OKDOT have understood that commuter rail might use the I-235 bridge, and therefore designed it for two or three tracks?\n\nA: Before work began on widening I-235 between NW 23 and NW 50, former Councilman Pete White urged ODOT to look at building a wider BNSF trestle bridge to accommodate future commuter rail operations. That request got nowhere, and his fellow council members showed no real zeal for pressing the issue.\n\nWhat a missed opportunity. Meanwhile, in Tulsa, ODOT built a double deck bridge over the Arkansas River to allow for a potential future Amtrak line that has yet to go beyond lawmakers who said years ago they want to see such an extension become a reality.\n\nYes, the adding of more sidetracks is expected to eliminate most of the bottlenecks along the BNSF line between Edmond and Norman.\n\nDowntown isn't dead again\n\nQ: Philosophical Question: For decades Oklahoma City has never had a vibrant downtown business environment. For small stretches there have been hopes on the backs of oil & gas companies, but eventually the market changes and we go back to begging companies to move downtown. What will change that? Should we be celebrating the industrial developments more? It is the heart and growth of OKC.\n\nA: I'm not sure I agree with your view of downtown. We've seen a lot of diversity downtown that has allowed us to move away from reliance on energy companies. Yes, Devon and Continental Resources are still very important office anchors for downtown. But we also have the recently completed redevelopment and makeover of the former Cotter Ranch Tower into the headquarters for BancFirst. State agencies now fill up the former SandRidge tower. Heartland Payment Systems employs hundreds in both its new headquarters along Automobile Alley and in the Mideke Building in Bricktown.\n\nPublic Strategies is consolidating its operations in a renovated warehouse just east of Broadway. Law firms, tech and banking are as important to downtown as energy these days.\n\nI agree that industrial development is another important component to our city's growth. We're seeing bio-tech and pharmaceutical manufacturing coming our way with the Convergence development just east of downtown. The city worked with developers Mark Beffort and Dick Tanenbaum to create OKC 577, a new industrial reserve at I-240 and Bryant that also will be focused on attracting new pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\nA boulevard by any other name...\n\nQ: By many (read most) people's accounts, the naming for the \"Oklahoma City Boulevard\" was a horrible choice. Mick Cornett himself was the person pushing for that stale name if I understand correctly. I realize that Mayor Holt was the one-time chief of staff for Mayor Cornett, so Mayor Holt probably won't have the inclination to reverse this horrible naming decision. Mayor Mick was a great mayor (even though his negative gubernatorial campaign was out of character), and he did everything else with excellence except this naming decision.\n\nDo you believe this horrific injustice of a street name could be rectified with a future mayor? My next vote for mayor will be the candidate who has the intestinal fortitude to re-name the lifeless \"Oklahoma City Boulevard\" to something more befitting the gateway into the OKC downtown...such as Scissortail Boulevard or the like.\n\nA: The decision to name the street \"Oklahoma City Boulevard\" is fully owned by Mick Cornett. There was no invitation for naming proposals, no public discussion, not even a city council debate. Mick was \"ad man of the year\" and that was good enough reasoning to push it through. I heard from a lot of people who were not happy with the name, who felt it communicated an insecurity that for years was deep-rooted in our city.\n\nIf it is to be renamed, do it now before the corridor is developed and we end up with property owners not wanting to be inconvenienced with changing their addresses.\n\nMicro-housing coming to downtown\n\nQ: I'm super excited that the Holiday Inn project is moving forward. Did you see the conceptual plans? It appears they are making apartments out of hotel rooms. I've only seen that in homeless shelters? Studios with less than 350 sf seem too small, given the average apartment in OKC is greater than 1,000 square feet (as per Richard Mize). Even the smallest unit at the Muse is over 450 sf. Is this going to create the wrong development in the heart of OKC?\n\nA: Without knowing the buyer and being able to ask questions, most of the information I used to report this story was taken from the building permit filed with the city. Troy Humphrey, who works with the owner, Jonathan Russell, made it clear this is a real deal involving a buyer with the resources and experience to pull off a conversion of the old Holiday Inn into apartments.\n\nThe building permit shows most of the studio apartments will be built within the framework of the old hotel rooms, meaning most of them are between 224 and 260 square feet. That definitely makes this a micro apartment project. A few of the rooms are larger, but even those are no more than 470 square feet from what I can see in the plans submitted to the city.\n\nIn my college days I lived in an apartment that was about 700 square feet, and that was pretty small.\n\nWe’ve seen micro-apartments proposed before for downtown, notably an earlier aborted development proposed for 700 W Shartel where the Muse was recently completed. That proposal was submitted by Rohan Gupta, who also tried to convert the former Sycamore Square (now The Haven) apartments into micro units.\n\nNeither proposal made sense to me. With the opening of the John Rex Elementary within walking distance of Sycamore Square, the need for its larger apartments was going up. Why do away with that scarce product? Ultimately, the development was boiled down to much needed updates and renovations. The project at 700 W Shartel was risky because it was on the fringe of downtown in an area where one doesn’t want to see an experiment done where if it fails it will create a huge problem.\n\nThe Holiday Inn site makes sense. It is next to the under-utilized Sheridan Walker Garage, within walking distance of the Oklahoma City Streetcar and thousands of service jobs. The building permit shows a lot of shared space that are needed with any micro development, including laundry rooms, workspace conference rooms, a clubhouse, bicycle storage room, dog park and grooming, pickleball court, fitness center and pool.\n\nAdd into this mix the northwest bus rapid transit line launching this fall, which can take anyone living downtown to and from the Homeland at NW 18 and Classen, Integris Baptist Hospital and other major destinations and employers. I look forward to learning more, but at first glance this looks like a great step forward for those needing affordable housing options downtown.\n\nDevelopment at NW 13 and Classen includes daycare, OnCue\n\nQ: Is there any update on what is being constructed on the corner of Classen and 13th? Also, will there be a dedicated lane for the northwest bus rapid transit line? I know there will be priority signaling but if the buses are still sharing lanes with the rest of traffic, doesn’t that kind of defeat the purpose?\n\nA: I believe the construction you are referring to is on the northeast corner of NW 13 and Classen where Primrose School is building a Midtown campus.\n\nI expect the daycare will open with full enrollment. Waiting lists have long been an issue downtown with the one YMCA daycare at NW 4 and Broadway and St. Luke’s three urban core locations at NW 4 and Robinson, NW 23 and Douglas, and NW 15 and Harvey.\n\nThe corner of NW 13 and Classen has already seen the replacement of an aging Gulf station and an OnCue on the southwest corner of the intersection.\n\nAs for the bus rapid transit line, Michael Scroggins, EMBARK spokesman, tells me the system will have dedicated bus lanes but not along the entire route. The northwest line will be the first bus rapid transit operation for Oklahoma City and much of the infrastructure is in place and the buses are ready to roll. Expect service to begin this fall.\n\nInfill opportunities abound in Midtown - for now\n\nQ: With any redevelopment, it seems like it exploits a hole after something starts work. Take, for example, the development of the property from Hudson on 10 (Phillips Murrah). Honestly, in the past, I didn't realize how underdeveloped the southside of NW 9 was from Hudson to Walker, except for two houses. Does Midtown Renaissance own all of that land and is there any indication of their potential redevelopment of that area?\n\nA: The block south of NW 9 between Hudson and Walker Avenues is owned by Cosair Cattle Co. (brothers Gary and Robert Smith). The pair were, for a long time, buy and hold speculators who often saw opportunities long before anyone else. In more recent years the pair have redeveloped properties, notably where Jimmy’s Egg is located. I do believe something will be developed on their remaining property in this area, including the closed apartments across from Elemental Coffee that were last home to a halfway house.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that the sprawling empty lots between St. Anthony Hospital and Hudson Avenue was filled with older homes and duplexes. I’ve seen photos of NW 6 that are just heartbreaking – a lot of three-story Victorian style houses that would command top sales prices today. But the area went into a long decline starting in the early 1970s and we lost much of that history due to fires, crime and blight. So now we have huge empty lots in the middle of Midtown.\n\nBut that is changing. And yes, most of these empty lots are owned by Midtown Renaissance Group, which led by Bob Howard, Chris Fleming and Mickey Clagg, has transformed the neighborhood into a carefully curated mix of housing, retail, restaurants, entertainment and offices.\n\nThe Phillips Murrah building will infill one of the largest empty spreads between NW 9, NW 10, Walker and Hudson Avenues. We’re also going to see infill along Harvey Avenue with the construction of a new Palomar campus. We are seeing more than $200 million of development all together in Midtown, making this a game changing year for the district.\n\nMore:More than $200 million going into creating a new skyline in Midtown Oklahoma City\n\nIndustry trends, politics complicate OKC's ability to draw concerts\n\nQ: I have noticed lately that there are a lot of mid-size to larger concerts that are going to places like Rogers, Arkansas, Huntsville, Alabama and Albuquerque, New Mexico and bypassing OKC all together. Specifically, most of them are playing amphitheaters in those cities and not coming to OKC. Looking at Pollstar.com, I can see Smashing Pumpkins, The Cure, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Snoop Dogg, 50 cent, Avenged Sevenfold, Foo Fighters, Fall Out Boy, Beck and many others play those areas, but no scheduled stops in OKC or Tulsa, for that matter. I understand a lot of bands playing Dallas, Houston and Austin, but the others kind of throw me off. Why do you think that is? Management? Venue size? Other places are nicer? Oklahoma politics? Other?\n\nA: I talked to Chad Whitehead, talent buyer with Tower Theatre, Pony Boy and Beer City. He is as good a source as anybody to explain the current situation with the concert scene. Recall that concert venues were hit hard by the pandemic and Oklahoma City was no exception.\n\nMore:New concert venue Beer City Music Hall taps into gap in OKC live music scene\n\nHere is what Chad had to say:\n\n“In the summer, tours LOVE hitting amphitheaters and specifically outdoor spaces. The Zoo Amphitheater is Oklahoma City’s only outdoor spot and, in my opinion, it does pretty solid bringing in some cool stuff. Overall though, what fans don’t understand is the buckets of the concert world; 500- and 1,000-cap clubs (like Tower), 3,000-cap venues (Criterion), and Paycom Center, etc., all operate with the different realities and the scale of pay for bands as they climb is apples to oranges.\n\n“The business is built on helping bands maximize profits so an artist will never really play a smaller venue (and thusly make less money). As a side note though, our politics 100% turn off artists and keep some artists away from Oklahoma, particularly the female fronted bands.”\n\n\"If venue cities of Huntsville and Rogers are the examples given above, I am sure Alabama and Arkansas have the same politics as Oklahoma.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/25/oil-train-conversion-sit-anniversary-healing-garden-expansion-news-around-states/111368136/", "title": "Oil train conversion, sit-in anniversary: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A three-day event is marking the 60th anniversary of the state’s first sit-in against racial segregation. Five of the surviving demonstrators were on hand Monday for a remembrance at Alabama State University in Montgomery. Civil rights lawyer Fred Gray of Tuskegee was also set to participate, according to an announcement from the school. Alabama State, a center of activity during the civil rights era, is also hosting events through Wednesday, including a panel discussion of elected officials and a presentation of scholarly papers about the sit-in and its legacy. A student sit-in began Feb. 25, 1960, at the Montgomery County Courthouse snack bar, where 35 black women and men asked to be served in defiance of the city’s segregation law. They were inspired by the Greensboro four, who started the sit-ins campaign at a lunch counter in North Carolina just weeks earlier. Then-Gov. John Patterson, a segregationist, made Alabama State expel any students who participated by threatening its state funding. Nine students identified as leaders were kicked out of school.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Landslides that caused road closures last year have raised concerns about whether there will be full access to Denali National Park and Preserve for the upcoming tourism season. The National Park Service has said it plans to open the entire Denali Park Road by early June, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The 92-mile road running through steep mountain passes provides the only driving access into the park’s 7,344 square miles. The park service repeatedly closed parts of the road last summer amid heavy rains, rockfall and mudslides. Recent National Park Service surveys found the speed of a landslide at Pretty Rocks section of the road has increased dramatically since September, and the road was slumping nearly 2 inches every day after August. Private vehicles are restricted beyond Mile 15 of the road. But hundreds of thousands of visitors each year use buses run by commercial operators to take them farther into the park. Business owners inside the park rely on the road to bring in supplies for guests.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new task force will focus on decreasing cases of animal hoarding across Pima County. The Pima Animal Care Center and other community organizations will meet Tuesday to discuss how to help overwhelmed pet owners before they get to the point of hoarding. Center officials say animal hoarding is not necessarily just about the number of pets in a home but about whether the owner can actually support them, the Arizona Daily Star reports. Kristen Hassen, animal services director, says the task force wants to change how hoarding cases are handled. It will work with pet owners and connect them with community resources. Two part-time public health nurses will be available to talk with owners, Hassen says. In addition, owners will get assistance with spaying, neutering and pet vaccination services. In 2019, the Pima County animal shelter took in almost 19,000 animals – many from hoarding situations and with medical conditions.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter County Historical and Genealogical Society will meet Tuesday at 6p.m. in the Knox Community Room of the Baxter County Library. Admission is free, and guests are welcome. The evening’s guest speaker will be Roy Stovall, speaking about “The de Soto Entrada” and its significance to Arkansas history and archaeology. Conquistador Hernando de Soto and his men, the first Europeans to explore Arkansas, trekked 4,000 miles from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Brazos River 480 years ago. The adventurers spent two years in what would become Arkansas before de Soto met his death near the Mississippi River. Stovall has made an extensive study of the expedition as a lifetime member of the Arkansas Archeological Society.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The first new state park campground on the California coast in 30 years is expected to feature ocean frontage on Monterey Bay when it opens in 2022. Fort Ord Dunes State Park has 4 miles of ocean beach on the bay and is located near Marina, south of Moss Landing and north of Monterey, The San Francisco Chronicle reports. A former military unit, Fort Ord Dunes opened 10 years ago with little supporting infrastructure and is one of a handful of state parks providing free parking and access. The area is sometimes overlooked because unlike most state parks along the Pacific Coast Highway, Fort Ord Dunes does not have a direct turnoff to parking from Highway 1. A boardwalk has been planned to allow access to the beach without damage crossing sensitive dunes. Two overlook areas are expected to provide views of Monterey Bay, historic Fort Ord, and oceanfront cities Sand City, Seaside and Monterey.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad has debuted its first locomotive that runs on oil, a more environmentally friendly fuel source that holds less fire risk than a traditional coal-burning engine. For the past two years, the D&SNG’s crews have worked to convert the No. 493, an early 1900s coal-burning locomotive, to be able to run off oil. It’s the first of what’s expected to be several conversions from coal-fired to oil-burning engines as the city’s top tourist attraction braces itself for the future. “We need to be prepared and just recognize the changing climate,” owner Al Harper told The Durango Herald. Coal-burning engines can emit small cinders from their smokestacks and start fires. Harper said it’s important to have the option of running oil-powered locomotives during extreme drought. This issue came to a head in summer 2018, when drought, high fire danger and the 416 Fire caused the D&SNG to shut down for more than 40 days.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStratford: A school board member who was accused of sexually assaulting a teen is resisting calls to resign from his post. Stratford Board of Education Member Robert DeLorenzo took a plea deal in the case and was convicted of first-degree reckless endangerment, The Connecticut Post reports. Democratic Town Committee Chair Stephanie Phillips and others have called on DeLorenzo, a Democrat, to resign from the board. But DeLorenzo says he has no plans to step down and insists the efforts to get him to resign are politically motivated. “I said 10 times I am not stepping down,” he told the newspaper. Police said DeLorenzo assaulted a 13-year-old girl, who told authorities that DeLorenzo told her he would kill her if she told anyone about it. DeLorenzo denies ever assaulting the girl.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s Council on Development Finance on Monday approved a $4.5million grant for Amazon, which says it is bringing about 1,000 full-time jobs to the former General Motors plant in Newport. A Nevada-based distribution company that counts Amazon as a client plans those jobs and more seasonal ones for a 3.7 million-square-foot logistics warehouse, according to a presentation from Amazon at the Buena Vista conference center in New Castle. Amazon’s application for the money was not readily available to the public during the hearing. Monday’s agenda offered little more detail on the application, only revealing that Amazon was seeking the $4.5 million to “establish its operations in Wilmington, Delaware.” The $4.5 million will come from Delaware’s Strategic Fund, a pool of state money meant for attracting businesses and growing jobs in the First State.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Children’s Museum of D.C. officially opened Monday. The new attraction is the perfect place to spark a child’s curiosity and creativity, WUSA-TV reports. Located at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, adjacent to the Ronald Reagan Building, it features exhibits including the Dream Machine, which allows kids to climb up to the clouds and slide down a huge slide that is also wheelchair-accessible. The museum was built to connect with all kids and also includes a mother’s room with stroller parking, quiet rooms for sensory-friendly kids, open captioning with audio for every video and, upon request, a personalized verbal description and sighted guide for guests who are blind. Admission is just $10.95 for adults and children over 1 year old. Pop-ups and family workshops are also expected to be a part of the experience.\n\nFlorida\n\nTavares: Seven decades after four young black men were accused of raping a white woman in a 1949 case now seen as a miscarriage of justice, the central Florida county where their case took place has erected a monument in their honor. The monument honoring Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shepherd and Ernest Thomas was unveiled Friday during a ceremony at the Lake County Historic Courthouse. The granite memorial for the men known as the Groveland Four features a bronze plaque imprinted with a written account of the men’s ordeal, which was prepared with the help of their families. “While we cannot change the past, we can learn from it, and we can assure that our institutions today provide equal and fair justice to all,” said Lake County Commission Chairman Leslie Campione. A year ago, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s three-member Cabinet granted posthumous pardons to the men. The case of the Groveland Four is considered a blight on Florida’s history. One of the four was killed before he could be charged. One of the remaining men was fatally shot by the local sheriff and another shot and wounded by the sheriff and a deputy. A third man was wrongly imprisoned.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgians could get a chance to vote on making it easier to sue state government under a constitutional amendment moving forward in the General Assembly. The House voted 163-0 on Thursday to pass House Resolution 1023. It moves to the Senate, where it would need a two-thirds vote to make it to the election ballot for a referendum. “It makes sense to amend the constitution so that people can come to the courthouse and seek redress,” said Rep. Andy Welch, a McDonough Republican who has been pushing the effort for several years. Bills to broaden the grounds for suits have been vetoed twice, first by Gov. Nathan Deal in 2016 and then again by Gov. Brian Kemp last year. However, the governor has no power to reject a proposed constitutional amendment. Lawmakers are reacting to a 2014 state Supreme Court decision that says state and local governments can only be sued when they have waived a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity. That’s a principle descended from English common law, commonly described as “the king can do no wrong.” When Georgia overthrew the king in 1776, that cloak of legal protection transferred to the state government.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A bill aimed at raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco and electronic smoking devices has stalled in the state House of Representatives. The bill proposed to make it illegal for anyone younger than 25 to buy the products, West Hawaii Today reports. Democratic Reps. Richard Creagan and John Mizuno, the chairman of the House Committee on Health, introduced the bill that was unanimously passed by the health committee Feb. 4. The measure also passed a full reading on the House floor but did not secure required hearings before the House Judiciary and Finance committees. The bill subsequently missed a deadline for moving bills with multiple referrals to a final committee. The bill cited the harmful effect of nicotine on developing brains, particularly youth and young adults and unborn children, as well as a study by the Institute of Medicine that found raising the minimum purchase age led to decreases in smoking prevalence and mortality.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A transgender rights group says it’s suing the state over a proposed bill that makes it illegal for someone to change their gender identity on a birth certificate, according to a television station’s report. The National Association of Transgendered People prepared the lawsuit and planned to file it Monday, KBOI-TV reports. The House Education Committee held a hearing on the bill last week and recommended sending it to the full House for a vote. The bill introduced by Rep. Julianne Young, a Republican, would ban changes to a birth certificate if more than a year has passed since the person’s birth. The bill is in conflict with a 2018 ruling by a federal magistrate that said Idaho must accept applications from transgender people who wish to change their gender on their birth certificates to confirm with their gender identity. Idaho has been complying with the federal ruling.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Supporters of the revitalization of the historic Pullman neighborhood say they have the money for more restoration work, five years after then-President Barack Obama designated part of the area as a national monument. Longtime supporters gathered with National Park Service officials Wednesday on the city’s Far South Side to celebrate the five-year anniversary of the monument designation as leaders unveiled the latest renderings for a more than $56 million revitalization project. A central part of the restoration is the Pullman Clock Tower and Administration building, which will convert into a visitors center. That’s expected to be completed next year. The neighborhood was built by industrialist George M. Pullman in the 19th century for people who worked at his state-of-the-art factory building luxurious railroad sleeping cars. The harsh working conditions aboard Pullman’s sleeping cars helped spur the birth of the African American labor movement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local government officials and environmentalists oppose a project proposing to burn or harvest parts of the Hoosier National Forest because they are concerned it could contaminate the only source of drinking water for more than 140,000 people. The U.S. Forest Service approved the Houston South Vegetation Management and Restoration project last week. Federal officials point out that projects such as this are a common means of maintaining forest health. But critics say it could worsen existing water-quality issues in the Lake Monroe reservoir, which serves all of Monroe County. “Lake Monroe is the surface drinking water source for not only Monroe County but also surrounding areas,” said Monroe County Commissioner Julie Thomas, a vocal opponent of the project. “We’re really concerned.” It wasn’t until Lake Monroe was created in the 1960s that Bloomington finally had a stable source of drinking water.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court elected Justice Susan Christensen as its next chief justice Monday, making her only the second woman to rise to chief of the seven-member court. Appointed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2018, Christensen is part of a new, more conservatively constituted court. Reynolds has named three justices to the court since becoming governor and will name a fourth after acting Chief Justice David Wiggins retires next month. Wiggins, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack, became acting chief after the unexpected death of Chief Justice Mark Cady in November from a heart attack. Cady had chosen Wiggins to take the post if he were to become incapacitated. Wiggins announced last month his plans to retire March 13. Christensen was a lawyer before becoming a district court judge. She is married with five children and five grandchildren. Her father, Jerry Larson, was a justice on the Iowa Supreme Court for 30 years until his retirement in 2008.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State lawmakers are considering making changes to the criminal public offender registry system and cutting back on penalties. The expansive system that publicly tracks convicted criminals after they’ve served their time covers a wide range of crimes beyond sex offenses, Kansas News Service reports. Now, some policymakers believe it’s time to ease the rules. Marc Schultz, convicted of manslaughter for hitting and killing a cyclist while driving drunk in 2010, said he didn’t intentionally commit a violent crime but still has to be listed among those who committed crimes like sexual assault, human trafficking or kidnapping. “When people look at that map, they don’t know the difference between the dots that they see,” Schultz said, noting a map with too many offenders makes it less useful for the public. Proposed changes include reducing penalties for not registering properly and changing the 15-year registration term for those convicted of crimes, like drug distribution, to only face a five-year registration term.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Authorities are asking for the public’s help in finding those responsible for poaching two elk. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said on its Facebook page that two bull elk were poached Thursday in the Ball Creek area of Knott County. The post shows a photo of two severed elk heads. The department said it is offering a $4,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. It said the League of Kentucky Sportsmen and Safari Club International’s Kentuckiana Chapter donated toward the reward. Tips can be called in to the department or to Kentucky State Police in Hazard.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A textile museum at Louisiana State University is growing and will reopen its renovated, larger space with an exhibition celebrating four decades of its collection. The opening exhibition in the LSU Textile and Costume Museum’s new gallery will include a 1960s special occasion dress designed by American designer James Galanos; a 1938 SEC Championship LSU boxing robe; and the outfit worn by Baton Rouge WAFB-TV personality “Buckskin Bill” Black. Other items include clothing from past governors and their spouses; an 1840s/1850s day dress; a Haspel labeled seersucker man’s suit; and non-western artifacts such as a 19th century Chinese “dragon robe.” The exhibition can be viewed by the public Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from March 30 to April 6. The museum will celebrate the grand opening of its exhibition gallery March 28. The event will feature local reality TV star Anthony Ryan, winner of “Project Runway All Stars” and an alumnus of the university’s textiles, apparel and merchandising program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State conservation officials are asking residents to take a few steps to cut down the spread of invasive species. The Pine Tree State’s effort is taking place during National Invasive Species Awareness Week. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry said the state suffers from non-native species such as the emerald ash borer and green crab that have a negative impact on natural resources. The department is asking residents to take steps such as clipping the webs of browntail moth caterpillars before they get active. The caterpillars can cause a painful rash in humans. Residents should also avoid releasing aquarium fish and plants, live bait or other exotic animals into the wild, the state said. Another helpful step is to learn how to identify invasive plants that might be growing on private property and take steps to control them.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Some state lawmakers want to ban the practice of offering sexual assault victims a waiver that says they don’t want to go forward their case. The Baltimore Sun reports some legislators want to do away with the waivers so that victims aren’t discouraged to report and prosecute the crimes. Experts say investigators sometimes misuse waiver forms to pressure victims to stop pursuing charges or to get cases off their plate without a thorough investigation. Some police departments have recently stopped the practice. But the Harford County Sheriff’s Office continues to use waiver forms. The sheriff said the waivers are used “sparingly” and only when a victim has requested that an investigation end. The proposed legislation would stop police from presenting victims with forms that prevent prosecution of the crime or waive the victim’s rights.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A week after Plymouth Rock was defaced with graffiti, it appears as if vandals have targeted the historic town’s 9/11 memorial. A statue of a police officer was knocked over sometime over the weekend, and two nearby lamp posts were knocked over. The statue’s head was knocked off. A nearby figure of a firefighter was untouched. On Feb. 16, Plymouth Rock, the symbolic spot of the Pilgrims’ landing 400 years ago, was covered in paint. Vandals also targeted the Pilgrim Maiden statue and several other significant spots. It was not clear if the two vandalism cases are connected. The Sept. 11 memorial, unveiled in 2004, was privately funded by businessman and former Selectman Richard Quintal, who donated the land on which the memorial sits. No arrests have been announced in either case.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State officials have recognized three trails as “Pure Michigan Trails” because they provide access to high-quality scenic views. They also designated three communities as “Pure Michigan Trail Towns.” The label refers to towns or cities along trail routes that provide vibrant experiences for users. The Canada Lakes Pathway in Luce County, the historic Haywire Grade in Schoolcraft and Alger counties, and the Kal-Haven Trail in Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties joined the ranks of Pure Michigan Trails. Cheboygan, Reed City and Oakland County’s Orion Township were added to the roster of Pure Michigan Trail Towns. “With four seasons of trail recreation fun available, Michigan truly is home to a variety of great trails and trail towns,” said Paul Yauk, DNR state trails coordinator. He said the trails and towns receiving Pure Michigan designation provide some of the state’s elite trail experiences; promote healthy lifestyles; conserve natural and cultural resources; and boost local economies.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has paused plans to issue its own identification cards that would be available regardless of a person’s immigration status. Mayor Jacob Frey said Friday that the move was made in part because of concerns that the information could be used to identify immigrants for deportation. He said the city wants to ensure “people signing up for the ID card are protected.” The Star Tribune reports the discussions about how and whether to proceed come at a time when many cities are looking for ways to resist immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump. Minneapolis approved the creation of a municipal ID program in 2018 but had been discussing it for many years. Supporters said having a form of identification is crucial to opening a bank account, receiving health care and, in some cases, picking up children from school.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: About 450 homes were damaged in Hinds and Madison counties from flooding in the Jackson metro area earlier this month. Before the flooding from the Pearl River started, officials had projected up to 2,500 structures, including about 1,000 homes, could be affected. Mississippi Emergency Management officials said Monday in an email that the number is a rough estimate and is likely to change. MEMA on Monday began conducting in-depth damage assessments. In Rankin County, about 18 structures reportedly were damaged, with fewer than five that were homes, Rankin County Emergency Management Director Mike Word said. The Pearl River at Jackson is slowly receding but will take a few days before it reaches below-flood stage levels. MEMA officials said the water has receded across affected areas around Jackson, and river levels will continue to fall throughout the week.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A fired Kansas City Public Schools secretary who was among seven employees accused of falsifying attendance data in a bid to help the district regain accreditation said she and her co-workers were following orders from top administrators. Former Central Middle School secretary LaQuyn Collier told The Kansas City Star that she gave administrators “exactly what they said they needed.” She and another fired employee have hired an attorney to try to get their jobs back. Emails obtained by the newspaper show that administrators asked secretaries to gather at the district’s central office to review “several attendance recording issues” in the summer of 2014 during the time in which an investigation found the tampering happened. Attendance is among the criteria Missouri uses in giving out performance scores that determine whether a district is unaccredited, partially accredited or fully accredited.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana State Parks’ free lease of 337 acres at Hell Creek on Fort Peck Reservoir expires in 2021, and between now and then, the state is planning to negotiate a new 20-year lease with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Hell Creek Marina and adjoining state park create a complexity not found at other state parks, the Billings Gazette reports. Clint and Deb Thomas own and run Hell Creek Marina. The marina operates on a lease from Montana State Parks, which oversees adjacent Hell Creek State Park. “I am not a concessionaire,” Thomas emphasized. He owns the marina buildings, including a small motel, docks, store and other improvements to the property. “I’ve got $2 million invested.” That’s not the case at other areas, such as Tongue River Reservoir State Park, where Montana State Parks owns the marina’s facilities and hires a concessionaire to operate it.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: A wildlife biologist will present a program next month about people-powered science and wildlife observation. The presentation March 15 is part of a Sunday speaker series at Schramm Education Center. The presenter will be Alie Mayes, a biologist with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Her program is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. at the center, which sits along Nebraska Highway 31 near the Platte River, about 6 miles south of Exit 432 off Interstate 80. Contact Amber Schiltz for more information at amber.schiltz@nebraska.gov or 402-332-5022.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sanctuary garden for those affected by the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting is expanding. The city will be adding more features – including a fire pit, a walkway covered in greenery and a pear tree – to the Healing Garden, which was created also as a place to honor the 58 victims, KTNV-TV reports. City officials say they hope to complete the expansion in May, with access for the public in June. A Callery pear tree near the World Trade Center in New York City became known as the “Survivor Tree” after the 9/11 attacks. Its seedlings are given to communities who have also experienced tragedy. The Oct. 1, 2017, shooting during an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The volunteer-built garden features a tree for each of the 58 victims and an oak that represents life. It was dedicated during the shooting’s first anniversary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Statistics released for 2018 show that heart disease was the leading cause of death in New Hampshire, marking the first time in over a decade that it surpassed cancer, state health officials said Monday. More than 2,600 New Hampshire residents died from heart disease that year, the state Department of Health and Human Services said. Nationally, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women. About 647,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, accounting for 1 in every 4 deaths. High blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHardwick Township: A forest fire burning through a popular hiking area that is crossed by the Appalachian Trail and a major interstate highway was about 80% contained by Monday afternoon, state fire officials said. The fire began Sunday afternoon on Mount Tammany, a steep, rugged area of New Jersey’s Worthington State Forest and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border. Fire officials said about 80 acres had burned by Monday. A helicopter and 40 firefighters were working to put the fire out Monday, officials said. Greg McLaughlin, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fires Service, said no injuries had been reported. A cause for the fire had not been determined, officials said. Chris Franek, the state forest fire service’s assistant division fire warden, said fires on similar terrain usually burn upward, but Sunday’s fire, which started below a trail at an elevation of about 1,400 feet, burned downhill because the trail area is rocky and without abundant vegetation. He said fires are rare there at this time of year because the area usually has a layer of snow.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An analysis shows the city’s police are taking 93% longer to respond to 911 calls than nine years ago. KOAT-TV reports an examination on the Albuquerque Police Department’s response times shows officers now take an average of 48 minutes to arrive to a scene. That’s a 23-minute jump from 2011. Albuquerque Emergency Communications Center manager Erika Wilson says police are during the best they can with the resources available. Albuquerque police say the department currently has about 950 officers. In 2011, it had about 1,100 officers. “We are in a pickle,” said Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, the union that represents Albuquerque cops. “The Albuquerque Police Department is understaffed. It has been for a number of years.” FBI statistics show Albuquerque had a violent crime rate of 1,365 per 100,000 residents in 2018. The national rate was about 369 violent crimes per 100,000 residents that year.\n\nNew York\n\nSeneca Falls: A long-simmering leadership dispute in the Cayuga Indian Nation erupted over the weekend with bulldozers razing several buildings on Cayuga land in western New York. The buildings demolished early Saturday in Seneca Falls housed several businesses, a longhouse and a day care center. A statement from the Cayuga Nation said it demolished the buildings for public safety reasons. It said the properties were seized in 2014 by a group that disputes the authority of Cayuga leader Clint Halftown, who ordered the demolition. Halftown’s Cayuga Nation Council is officially recognized by the U.S. government. The opposing faction that controlled the buildings since 2014 is the Traditional Cayuga Nation Chiefs and Clan Mothers. A statement from the traditional faction’s counsel, Joe Heath, called Saturday’s demolition “viciously unlawful.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nForneys Creek: The Hidgon Family Cemetery in the Great Smoky Mountains has become a source of mystery for the National Park Service. On the North Carolina side of the park stands a slanted granite tombstone that says only: “A Black Man” – no name, no date, no epitaph, The Charlotte Observer reports. Now park historians say they’re determined to figure out who he was and why he was afforded a costly grave marker with no hint of identification, as part of a project documenting “the African American experience in the Smokies.” “This research project is facing common obstacles: the African American members of the communities are nameless and faceless in typical historical records,” the park service wrote on Facebook. Some bloggers believe the man was “elderly” when he died around 1920, during a period when the “Spanish Flue” had overtaken Swain County, according to a report in Reflections of Olde Swain.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A nonprofit group that arranges trips for veterans to visit Washington memorials dedicated to them will now have its first honor flight chapter dedicated to area veterans in western North Dakota. The local chapter, Western North Dakota Honor Flight, announced its start a week ago with Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., in attendance, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The local chapter is the first since the Rough Rider Honor Flight Network ceased in 2011 after operating for two years. The group hopes to raise $160,000 through sponsorships, fundraisers and donations to send about 100 area veterans to the nation’s capital on a private plane. The two-day trip planned for this fall will be free to the veterans, but they do have to apply to participate in the program.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a bill under which motorcyclists in the state would be allowed to wear earphones or earplugs while riding to ward off hearing loss. The state House and Senate previously approved the legislation, which would prohibit motorcyclists from listening to music or other entertainment while wearing the ear protection. The Republican DeWine signed it into law Friday, and it takes effect in 90 days. Noise from the wind and engines can produce severe hearing loss for motorcyclists, said Sen. Rob McColley, a Republican from Napoleon in northwestern Ohio. There was no public opposition, and proponents said riders would still be able to hear sirens and car horns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Native American tribes suing the state over tribal gambling compacts oppose requests by two tribes to intervene in the lawsuit. The Dec. 31 lawsuit by the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw nations asks a federal judge to determine whether compacts allowing gambling exclusively at tribal casinos automatically renewed Jan. 1. Mediation was ordered after Gov. Kevin Stitt asked the judge to order the casinos to stop offering certain games, including electronic and table games. Several tribes intervened, but they oppose intervention by the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Kialegee Tribal Town, saying they have no valid claim. “UKB and Kialegee do not conduct gaming pursuant to (Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act) Compacts and are not developing any projects to engage in gaming,” as do the tribes in the lawsuit, according to the Feb. 18 motion.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city intentionally allows drivers to park vehicles illegally close to crosswalks and intersections, making it difficult to navigate the city and potentially deadly for all road users, a lawsuit filed last week in Multnomah County Circuit Court says. The lawsuit seeks to address what attorney Scott Kocher describes as Portland’s “ongoing failure” to provide adequate sight distance at street corners or crosswalks, the Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Kocher is using the 2019 death of a motorcyclist, one of 49 people killed in what was the deadliest year since 1997, as a test case to argue the city’s negligence. The family of Elijah Coe, a 48-year-old chef who was killed on East Burnside Street in May, is seeking $5.9 million in damages and demands the city retrofit its intersections to comply with its own code governing sight distances as well as state law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nState College: Hundreds of Penn State students have raised more than $11 million dollars for pediatric cancer patients in the annual 46-hour dance marathon known as Thon. The $11,696,942.38 total was announced Sunday afternoon at the conclusion of the Penn State Interfraternity Council/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, billed as the world’s largest student-run philanthropy. Money raised benefits pediatric cancer patients and their families at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Child cancer survivors and their families also participate along with the dancers, who aren’t allowed to sleep or even sit and are helped by thousands of other students in support roles. The amount raised this year was more than $1 million beyond last year’s total. Before this year’s event, officials said the dance marathon had raised more than $168 million since 1977.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s main airport is getting a $4.7 million grant to modernize the terminal, acquire land and study effective noise reduction strategies. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, announced the Airport Improvement Program grant for the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the quasi-public agency that oversees the airport’s operations. Most of the federal funding will be used to renovate restrooms and other public facilities in the 24-year-old airport terminal, Reed said. The renovations are expected to be complete this summer. About $400,000 will be used to purchase 1.3 acres of vacant property within a runway protection zone for one of the runways. About $90,000 will be used to help update noise exposure maps that were generated in 2010.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State lawmakers are looking to end a practice that allowed police officers to patrol by themselves for up to a year without training. The idea for decades was to allow small police forces to use newly hired officers immediately after putting them on the payroll because it could take months to get a slot in the state’s only police training academy in Columbia. But the death of an untrained officer in a shooting during a traffic stop in Florence in January and the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy revamping its training program to eliminate the months­long wait have four former law enforcement members writing a bill to change things. The proposal would only allow an officer without the certification earned through 12 weeks of training to patrol or arrest someone if they are with a certified officer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A new app is helping American Indian youth learn math that can be taught in their native Lakota language. The bilingual English and Lakota math video game was created by the Thunder Valley Community Development Corp., a South Dakota nonprofit that promotes Native American issues. The “Making Camp: Lakota” app is free and can be downloaded on mobile devices and computer desktops, KOTA-TV reports. It is meant mainly to help fourth- and fifth-grade students. A historical video introduces each section of the game explaining cultural symbols like eagle feathers, buffalo and horses. Mary Bowman, an Oceti Sakhalin teacher with the Rapid City Area School District, said it’s a key part of the curriculum. Culturally responsive teaching increases children’s achievement levels because the children are more engaged and learn more, she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: As part of the kickoff to its 20th anniversary year, Stax Music Academy will present a special Black History Month concert Tuesday. The event, titled “Let’s Do It Again,” will take place at the Rose Theatre on the campus of the University of Memphis. In addition to performing the classics, Stax Music Academy will show the lasting influence and continuing impact of the label by playing contemporary songs – by artists ranging from Destiny’s Child to Ariana Grande – that incorporate or sample familiar Stax sounds. Pat Mitchell Worley, executive director of Stax Music Academy, said the theme of the concert is a way to connect multiple generations of music fans. The Black History Month concert is typically Stax Music Academy’s biggest show of the year, and “Let’s Do It Again” will feature appearances by all its various groups, including the a capella, jazz, and junior and senior high school ensembles. There will be two performances Tuesday: a daytime event exclusively for Memphis middle and high school students and an evening concert that will be open to the public. Tickets are $20 for adults. Youth tickets are $10.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The “Leaning Tower of Dallas,” a social media sensation born when a part of a building survived implosion, endured scores of blows from a wrecking ball Monday. Dozens of people gathered downtown to watch as a crane was used to batter the former Affiliated Computer Services building. The 11-story building found a second life online after surviving a first demolition attempt. It inspired jokes and comparisons to Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa when a Feb. 16 implosion failed to bring down its core. The company that engineered the blast said some explosives did not go off. In the following week, people flocked to the site to post photos of themselves pretending to prop up the lopsided tower. The remainder of the building proved resilient Monday, and some onlookers were nonplussed by the ball that began swinging about 9 a.m. As demolition work took place, an online petition to “save this landmark from destruction” continued to draw signatures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: U.S. officials have dropped plans to sell energy leases in a popular recreational area renowned for its mountain biking trails. The reversal by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management comes after local businesses, officials and Gov. Gary Herbert raised concerns about potential effects to the Slickrock Trail near Moab. The two lease parcels would have covered about two-thirds of the 10.5-mile trail and been barely a mile from Arches National Park. The 9,000-acre Sand Flats area that includes the trail is visited by 160,000 people a year, many of them drawn to the undulating, rocky trails that pose a challenge to mountain bikers. The U.S. land agency co-manages the recreation area with Grand County, an arrangement in place since 1994. Under President Donald Trump, the amount of acreage leased for oil and gas in Western states has been sharply increasing, raising concerns among conservationists about potential damage to the environment.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is proposing to issue 55 moose hunting permits for this fall in the wildlife management unit along the state’s borders with Quebec and New Hampshire. The October hunt would result in the taking of an estimated 33 moose. The target for the area known as Wildlife Management Unit E is designed to reduce the impact of winter ticks on the moose population. “Moose density in WMU E is more than one moose per square mile, significantly higher than any other part of the state,” said moose biologist Nick Fortin. The suggestion for the number of moose hunting permits came after Fish and Wildlife worked with University of Vermont researchers to study moose health and survival in the wildlife management unit by tagging 36 cows and 90 calves with GPS tracking collars. The study found that chronic high winter tick loads have caused the decline in moose health.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers passed a bill Monday that scraps the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and replaces it with one on Election Day. The House approved legislation that had already cleared the Senate, advancing the measure to Gov. Ralph Northam, who supports it. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slaveholding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. “Voting is our most fundamental right as Americans – and it is past time we stopped celebrating men who worked actively to uphold the system of slavery,” Northam said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Potato farmers in Skagit County suffered big losses after they were unable to harvest some of their crops due to early and heavy rainfall. The county’s farmers were unable to harvest an estimated 3 square miles of potatoes in the fall, with losses valued between $5 million and $10 million, The Skagit Valley Herald reports. Don McMoran of the Washington State University Skagit County Extension said farmers often do not harvest some land each season, but a loss of that size is rare. Farmers are also worried about the condition of potatoes they harvested that are sitting in storage, McMoran said. “When you harvest under wet conditions, you’re going to have the potential for more disease concerns,” he said. Potatoes are the county’s most valuable crop, bringing in about $60 million to growers annually, according to extension statistics.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Wildlife officials have proposed 16 changes to the state’s hunting and fishing regulations. Officials with the Division of Natural Resources met Sunday and explained the rationale for the changes, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The proposals will be voted on during meetings in May and August. Some of the bigger proposals included lengthening the spring turkey-hunting season, changing smallmouth-bass fishing regulations along the New River, expanding nighttime hunting for coyotes and imposing a creel limit on panfish. The proposal to lengthen the spring turkey season from 27 days to 35 days would provide additional days of hunting recreation, said Paul Johansen, the agency’s wildlife chief. The proposal to expand nighttime hunting for coyotes to year-round is an answer to requests from predator hunters.\n\nWisconsin\n\nElm Grove: A historic church and convent is being sold to a local development firm that plans to convert much of that space to apartments. Mandel Group Inc. has agreed to buy the 30-acre School Sisters of Notre Dame complex, according to an announcement Monday. Mandel has done some preliminary work on plans to redevelop the site but hasn’t yet determined how many apartments could be built there, said Dan Romnek, a development associate at the firm. The development would likely blend preserved buildings with new construction, he said. The two main buildings, Notre Dame Hall and Maria Hall, are to be preserved, Romnek said. Mandel is considering plans for the property’s other buildings, some of which could be demolished, he said. A detailed proposal is to be filed with Elm Grove officials this summer for a Plan Commission and Village Board review, Romnek said. Mandel plans to talk to neighbors before submitting those plans.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Land owners on a Native American reservation will be able to sell their property to the federal government through a program meant to return ownership to the reservation’s two tribes. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Land Buy-Back Program for tribal nations will enable the purchases on the Wind River Reservation, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Participation in the program is voluntary, and only tribal members with allotments will be eligible to sell their land. Much of the property was allotted to tribal members by the government but is often underutilized due to a tangle of ownership. The original allotments have been passed down through generations for the reservation’s tribes to control, but tangled ownership webs can result in hundreds or thousands of owners of a single allotment. After the property is returned to tribal jurisdiction, the land could be used for purposes including economic development, right-of-ways, cultural preservation and housing.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/17/infected-minks-airport-layoffs-crawfish-farmers-news-around-states/113304530/", "title": "Infected minks, airport layoffs, crawfish farmers: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: High schools are severely limiting attendance at football games this fall because of the coronavirus pandemic, and at least one canceled sports after deciding it wasn’t worth the risk to play. Opelika High School said it will cap attendance at about 30% of the stadium’s capacity of 8,000 so fans can maintain proper social distancing, and Gulf Shores said attendance at athletic events will be cut by 50%. Other schools are also announcing attendance reductions or still working on plans. The first football games are scheduled for this week, although some schools have delayed contests after players or staff tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. The moves follow an announcement by state health officials on Thursday that fans can attend games despite the pandemic. The agency asked schools to limit crowds and require anyone in attendance to wear face masks and keep away from other people to avoid spreading the virus. In Dallas County, Ellwood Christian Academy decided to cancel its football, volleyball and soccer seasons rather than take a risk during the pandemic.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The food service provider for the Anchorage and Fairbanks airports will lay off more than 140 employees because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the organization said in a letter to state officials. The layoffs will consist of 123 workers from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport and 19 at Fairbanks International Airport, the food service provider, HMSHost, said in letters to state employment officials. The layoffs at the Anchorage airport will affect businesses such as Starbucks, Cinnabon, Humpy’s Great Alaskan Alehouse, Norton Sound Seafood House, Alaska Doghaus, Cream, Mezzanine Bar, Anchorage Marketplace and Local Alaskan Rustic Marketplace, the Anchorage Daily News reported. “The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the travel and restaurant industries, and unfortunately, HMSHost sits at the intersection of both,” the letter said. “Never in the history of aviation and the hospitality industry have we experienced such catastrophic customer traffic declines.” The Fairbanks layoffs will affect businesses such as The Local and Starbucks, HMSHost said. The workers were originally furloughed in March. The layoffs are expected to be permanent on Oct. 15, HMSHost said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Arizona Department of Health Services has approved a reopening plan for more than 20 gyms in the Phoenix area operated by EoS Fitness. The gyms will be some of the first to open their doors after the state announced a number of health benchmarks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and guide the reopening of certain businesses. When the benchmarks were announced on Aug. 10, the spread of COVID-19 in Maricopa County was “substantial” by state guidelines and had not slowed to a safe threshold for opening gyms. Still, the state said it would consider plans for reopening that followed stricter safety policies than will be required when the benchmarks are met. The approved plan for EoS Fitness centers includes limiting occupancy to about 100 members, or 10% capacity. Saunas, steam rooms, hot tubs and basketball courts – places where people are likely to come in close contact – will stay closed, according to the company’s website. The gyms will have water refill stations as opposed to drinking fountains, and will space exercise equipment at least 6 feet apart. EoS Fitness said it would not hold group fitness classes until the spread of COVID-19 is downgraded to “moderate” in Maricopa County, per the health department benchmarks.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff:As of Thursday, Arkansas is sixth in the nation for COVID-19-related cases among inmates in state prisons, and Arkansas is ninth for most inmate deaths, according to data from the Marshall Project. Since March, The Marshall Project has been tracking how many people are being sickened and killed by COVID-19 in prisons and how widely it has spread across the nation and within each state. According to the Marshall Project there have been at least 4,665 cases of coronavirus reported among prisoners in Arkansas, with 3,883 prisoners recovered. Their report states there have been at least 34 COVID-19-related deaths. Since July, a continuous number of inmates have been announced as having died in various hospitals by the Arkansas Department of Corrections. Most recently, an inmate was pronounced dead on Saturday at CHI St. Vincent – Hot Springs. The inmate from the Ouachita River Correctional Unit was undergoing treatment for COVID-19-related symptoms. The inmate was in his late 50s and serving a sentence for criminal attempt at murder in the first degree. The Department of Corrections has extended suspension of inmate visitation until Sept. 1. The suspension includes all prisons and community correction centers, and it applies to regular and special visits.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A judge ordered immediate testing of all detainees and staff at an immigration detention center where COVID-19 was spreading for weeks while officials refused to test for the virus. Federal District Court Judge Vince Chhabria ordered the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to conduct quick-result testing of everyone in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Facility in Bakersfield, The Los Angeles Times reported. At least 54 of the 104 detained people remaining at the facility tested positive for the virus. Initial results from quick tests Saturday found 11 more positive cases, MacLean said. Chhabria’s order also directed about 140 staff members at Mesa Verde to be tested during their next shift, and weekly thereafter. The order followed results Friday showing nearly half of the detainees tested earlier in the week were positive for COVID-19. Deputy Public Defender Emi MacLean of the San Francisco public defender’s office said the judge cited the “deliberate indifference” of ICE and GEO Group, the private company managing the facility. The public defender’s office represents detainees at the facility in San Francisco Immigration Court.\n\nColorado\n\nRocky Ford:The 32nd Arkansas Valley Fair Board has canceled the 2020 Balloon Festival because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival was planned for Nov. 6-8 and has been rescheduled for Nov. 5-7, 2021. The festival was canceled to avoid adding more stress on attendees and participants, the board said in a news release. “We love our ballooning family and want everyone to be as safe as possible,” the statement said. “We considered many scenarios before coming to this decision. The strain of this pandemic has been difficult, and we do not want to put any more stress on our sponsors, pilots, or spectators.” For the last three decades, colorful and vibrant hot air balloons have filled the skies nearly every first week of November. Balloon pilots – professional fliers and often longtime thrill-seekers – have visited the Arkansas Valley and Rocky Ford where, weather conditions permitting, they would take to the skies. Pilots were usually happy to take locals and visitors up with them, too, where one could get a rare, expansive look at the valley.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: Two Connecticut parents filed an appeal in state court challenging a Department of Education requirement that students returning to classrooms this fall wear facemasks. The appeal filed Friday in Superior Court in New Britain seeks to have the department rescind the requirement to wear face coverings and to issue an order stating that neither the department nor local school districts can impose such a requirement, according to the Hartford Courant. “The Defendants’ requirements regarding the use of face coverings, masks, and face shields in schools … place an unconstitutional burden and restriction on the Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to an education, and is a denial of their right to equal protection of the law,” according to the filing. An emailed response Saturday from the Department of Education and the Office of the Attorney General said: “We are reviewing the complaint and will respond in court. Masks keep people safe. Please wear your mask.” The parents named in the filing are Jenna Matos, whose children ages 5 and 7 attend a parochial school in Manchester, and Raena Ferguson of East Lyme, whose 14-year-old child attends the local high school. The parents were joined in the appeal by the Connecticut Freedom Alliance. The mask requirement was included in a plan the education department released this summer stipulating certain rules schools must follow if they open for in-person learning this fall.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach:The 31st annual Sea Witch Festival has been postponed to Oct. 29-31 of next year amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, organizers announced Monday in a Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce email. Organizers stated that COVID-19 regulations and mandates “cannot be met” for such an event. “Next year will be bigger & better than EVER, including more entertainment, more activities, and more FUN!!” they added. The Sea Witch Festival, which welcomes thousands of people to Rehoboth Beach each fall, is one of the latest crowd-drawing events in southern Delaware to be impacted by the pandemic. Last week, the Jazz Festival was also postponed to October 2021. The Sea Witch Festival is a weekend-long event that attracts visitors well after the summer season ends, making Monday’s announcement especially taxing on small businesses. Rehoboth Beach, like many resort towns along the Delaware coast and nationally, has taken an economic punch this summer season, with less visitors, an uptick in hotel cancellations and restaurants facing limited capacity and other strict COVID-19 regulations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus has been a major source of infections in the District, WUSA-TV reported, according to new data revealed by an analysis of the city’s contact tracing cases. In a presentation released Monday, DC Health offered lessons learned from an analysis of 971 confirmed cases of the coronavirus between July 31 and Aug. 13. According to DC Health, more than half of those surveyed, 51%, said they had not come into contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 during the exposure period. To illustrate this, DC Health offered several contact tracing case studies derived from the data, including one in which three branches of an extended family became infected with the virus after attending a birthday party together – despite none of the attendees showing symptoms until the day after the party. The presentation also found troubling reports about large gatherings that have continued to be held in the District. Of those surveyed, 145 people reported attending a large event during their exposure event. More than 60% of those indicated that some part of the event occurred indoors, and the same amount said social distancing wasn’t observed during the event. Also, of those surveyed, 102 said they have traveled during their exposure period, with air travel being far and away the most common (71%), followed by rideshare (33%).\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach:Ninety-three inmates at the Volusia County Branch Jail have tested positive for the coronavirus since July 31, according to a county spokesman. The jail began routinely testing all inmates on July 27 except for inmates who were booked and immediately bonded out, said spokesman Gary Davidson. Before that, the jail had only been testing inmates who exhibited symptoms, Davidson wrote in an email. Davidson provided statistics on Friday going back to July 27 showing that 1,128 inmates have been tested resulting in 93 positive results. Those 93 are in addition to 13 inmates who had tested positive by July 31 at the jail, Davidson wrote. Davidson said that all the inmates who have tested positive since July 27 were asymptomatic. “Because of the proactive testing measures, we’re now able to identify and isolate the inmates as necessary to help prevent further spread,” Davidson wrote. He said the jail has not had any coronavirus-related deaths and none of the inmates who has tested positive has been hospitalized. Jail staff are awaiting the results on about 275 tests; 1,033 inmates have tested negative.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp, who has opposed local mask mandates and even sued over one in Atlanta, has signed an executive order that allows local governments to enact mask requirements to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. As with previous orders, the one issued Saturday said residents and visitors of the state are “strongly encouraged” to wear face coverings when they are outside of their homes, except when eating, drinking or exercising outside. But unlike previous orders, this one allows local governments in counties that have reached a “threshold requirement” to require the wearing of masks on government-owned property. A county meets that threshold requirement if it has had 100 or more confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people over the previous 14 days. Only two of Georgia’s 159 counties were below that threshold, according to data from the state Department of Public Health. Local mask mandates cannot result in fines, fees or penalties against private businesses or organizations, and penalties against individuals for non-compliance cannot included a fine greater than $50 and cannot include prison time, the order said. If people are not in compliance, local authorities must warn them “about the health risks posed by not wearing a face mask or face covering” prior to issuing a citation. Local mask requirements can’t be enforced on residential property and can only be enforced on private property, including businesses, if the owner or occupant consents to enforcement, the order said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Kahului Airport on Maui has completed its second phase of its thermal screening project meant to fight the spread of the coronavirus. The screening uses thermal imaging and facial recognition technology to pinpoint people with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher. Dual lens cameras have been installed at all arrival gates and TSA checkpoints in the airport. When Phase 3 is completed, the cameras will be able to track travelers with high body temperatures so contact tracers can stop and screen them before they leave the airport, The Maui News reported. Maui Airports District Manager Marvin Moniz said he expects Phase 3 to be completed before the end of the year. The technology is being implemented at all five of Hawaii’s main airports. In response to growing privacy concerns, Moniz said the images are erased every 30 minutes. There are also signs throughout the airport that alert travelers about the thermal screening cameras. “It’s not recorded, it’s just like a queue,” said Maui District Assistant Airport Superintendent Larry Miller. “It’s not permanently stored.” Moniz said the airport is using the system to flag people, even before the third phase starts. He said personnel from the American Medical Response and the Kahului Airport Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Unit are tasked with testing passengers who are flagged for high temperatures. He said those who have been flagged so far using the cameras include a person who had a kidney infection and another with an ear infection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A group that had been collecting online signatures for an education initiative called off the effort Thursday following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling against them late last month. The court case remains active, but it’s back at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and not likely to wrap up with enough time left to get the initiative on the ballot. Reclaim Idaho contended it should be allowed to collect online signatures during the pandemic. The initiative would have raised $170 million for K-12 education by raising taxes on corporations and individuals making $250,000 or more annually. “This is an initiative that promised to save Idaho from deep cuts to the K-12 budget, and it’s an initiative that the vast majority of Idahoans support,” said Luke Mayville, co-founder of Reclaim Idaho, in a statement. The group backs initiatives and successfully got Medicaid expansion on the ballot several years ago that ultimately became law. Reclaim Idaho in the lawsuit filed in June said Republican Gov. Brad Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March because of the pandemic didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature-gathering. The group said that violated the First Amendment-protected process of signature gathering, a form of political speech. Idaho does not allow online signatures for ballot initiatives. The state argued in court documents that allowing such signatures undermines the election process. Reclaim Idaho won in U.S. District Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing online signature gathering. But the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Little, putting online signature gathering on hold and sending the case back to the appeals court to be decided on its merits.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced fresh restrictions Sunday for southwestern Illinois after a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The rules, effective Tuesday, include limiting meetings and social events to the lesser of 25 people or 25% of overall room capacity and closing bars and casinos at 11 p.m. The restrictions follow three straight days of a positive test rate of 8% or higher. Illinois’ statewide average is 4.1%. “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, I have made it clear that neither arbitrary dates on a calendar nor political pressure will dictate Illinois’ efforts to protect our people,” Pritzker said in a statement. “If the data shows we need to go backwards in our reopening, I won’t hesitate to tighten restrictions to protect our collective health.” The restrictions apply to seven counties, including Madison and St. Clair.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Arts, cultural and tourism organizations across the state can compete for a share of $10 million in aid intended to give a boost to groups impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch has announced that qualifying organizations whose normal operations have been disrupted by COVID-19 are eligible for the state grants, which are funded by the federal CARES Act. “The arts and cultural sector adds vibrancy and depth to Hoosiers’ lives and is a significant factor in the health of Indiana’s tourism economy,” Crouch said. The funding will be jointly awarded by the Indiana Destination Development Corp. and the Indiana Arts Commission, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Indiana-based nonprofit organizations can apply for the funds through the Indiana Arts Commission website at in.gov/arts/2567.htm. The application deadline is Sept. 8.Lewis Ricci, executive director of the state arts commission, said the funding “will help preserve the arts and cultural community assets that our citizens value.” “In cities, towns and counties both urban and rural, big and small, the arts play a vital role in economy, quality of life, and community identity,” Ricci said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Another three people with COVID-19 have died and there have been an additional 395 confirmed cases, the state reported Monday. There have been a total of 978 COVID-19-related deaths in the state. The state has a total of 52,616 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 395 since Sunday. Of those tested Sunday, 11.8% were positive. Since the state started tracking the positivity rate, 9.4% of people who have been tested were positive.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Teachers who quit because they don’t feel safe returning to teaching in-person classes during the pandemic might have to pay their school districts up to $10,000 for backing out of their contracts. Penalties for quitting or resigning are meant to help districts find replacement teachers, but schools must prove that their penalty fee is based on the cost of replacing that teacher and not just an arbitrary amount designed to punish teachers. Educators said heading back to school seemed a lot safer before the resignation deadlines a few months ago when the coronavirus outbreak appeared nearly under control, KMUW-FM reported. The state had reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in two months and businesses were slowly reopening. Some educators said it’s unfair to charge teachers for escaping their contracts if the situation has changed and they no longer feel safe returning to the classroom. Marcus Baltzell, head of communications for the Kansas National Education Association, said forcing teachers to pay could just lead to more teachers quitting. “You can claw back as much money as you want, but if you’re not careful, then what you end up with is a district with no teachers,” he said. Usually districts ask for about $2,000, depending on how late a teacher leaves. But some districts do more. Emporia Public Schools is asking for $5,000 if a teacher resigns after August. The Syracuse school district near the Colorado border asks for $10,000.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear raised concerns about tightening supplies of testing materials and personal protective equipment in the fight against COVID-19. The Bluegrass State has built reserve supplies of some PPE and is in better shape than most states to deal with shortages of testing materials, Beshear said. “I believe that in Kentucky, we are in a much better place because of our local partnerships,” the Democratic governor told reporters. “But I will warn everybody that we’re starting to see the market tighten in both testing supplies, which are at a very difficult level, and PPE. It’s getting harder and harder, once again, to get certain items of PPE.” His concerns about the availability of crucial supplies come as Kentucky recorded its highest number of coronavirus cases in a single week. The state had 4,333 reported cases last week, Beshear said. He’s hoping the state has reached a “new plateau” in weekly cases.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Crawfish farmers are now eligible for a $16 billion coronavirus aid program run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Crawfish are among scores of commodities added to the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program announced in May. Louisiana’s congressional delegation, state Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, the Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation and the LSU AgCenter have been pushing to add farmed crawfish to the list. “For generations, crawfish have brought Louisianans together to celebrate the change in seasons, our faith, our families, and our heritage,” Louisiana’s U.S. senators and representatives said in a July 6 letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. “While the social impact of the loss of these celebrations on the people of Louisiana can never be quantified, the economic loss to the State is estimated at over $146 million for 2020.” Program details are available at www.farmers.gov/cfap.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine’s community banks are getting credit for swiftly funneling aid to businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. Although national banks prioritized large businesses, Maine banks helped small businesses stabilize and the economy with hundreds of millions of dollars of forgivable loans, the Portland Press Herald reported. More than 46% of Paycheck Protection Program loans over $150,000 were made by just six locally owned banks, according to data from the U.S. Small Business Administration. National banks were far less active in PPP lending in Maine. The top 10 national PPP lenders, including TD Bank, KeyBank, Bank of America and Chase Bank, provided just 13% of loans under $150,000, and about 17% of larger loans in the state. “I think everyone realized that the goal was to get as many of those loans approved and in the system as quickly as possible,” said Kim Donnelly, director of business banking at Gorham Savings Bank. To date, about 28,300 loans worth more than $2.2 billion have been made to Maine employers. The vast majority of loans are below $150,000. The loans could be forgiven if businesses meet certain spending and employment thresholds. Loan balances that aren’t forgiven could be repaid over up to five years at 1% interest.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis:The Maryland Department of Health will keep the results of rapid antigen tests separate from those of more accurate molecular tests in its official count of COVID-19 cases, a state health official said. The antigen tests, which are the centerpiece of Gov. Larry Hogan’s interstate compact to expand COVID-19 testing, can offer results in 15 to 20 minutes, rather than days. But they are also less sensitive than the standard molecular tests, known as PCR tests, experts said. The use of antigen tests in Maryland is limited, said Dennis Schrader, chief operating officer and Medicaid director for the Maryland Department of Health. The rapid tests will form the next phase of testing, he said – one that is focused on fast, high-volume screening. Because the antigen tests will focus more on screening than on diagnosis, he said, the results from those tests will be tracked separately from the results of PCR tests. Schrader said the antigen tests also will not be used to calculate the state’s positivity rate, a key metric that measures what percentage of COVID-19 test results are positive.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s Museum of Science and a top Harvard University health expert have teamed to make it easier for anyone anywhere in the world to get answers to questions about the coronavirus pandemic. The interactive exhibit, featuring Dr. Ashish Jha and using StoryFile’s conversational video artificial intelligence technology, was unveiled Monday, the museum said in a statement. “ Ask a Virtual Expert: COVID Conversations with Dr. Jha “ allows the curious on-site and remotely to ask a digital image of Jha a multitude of questions about COVID-19. The answers are based on Jha’s responses to more than 550 questions. The museum’s goal is to make complex scientific topics accessible, President Tim Ritchie said in a statement. “The suite of COVID exhibit content we present in the museum and online – especially the opportunity to have a “personal” conversation with an AI version of one of the world’s leading public health scientists – does just that,” he said. Jha is a professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “Collaborating with the Museum of Science on this experience was, for me, an extraordinary opportunity to reach people – children and adults alike – with fact-based information about health policy, disease transmission, the importance of masks and social distancing and global efforts to combat COVID-19,” he said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A state employee who was accused of stabbing a man after a face-mask dispute and was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy had been reprimanded for three separate work incidents from 2017 to 2018, according to state personnel filings. Michigan Department of Transportation employee Sean Ruis, 43, was disciplined following interactions with colleagues, according to The Detroit News. The newspaper cites filings it obtained through a public records request. Ruis had worked at the agency for 12 years. In a March 2017 incident, he was issued a notice of reprimand for approaching a coworker and questioning him about his use of leave. “You had been previously instructed, multiple times, by your supervisor and by labor relations, that the employee’s use of leave is confidential,” the notice said. “You continued to confront this coworker even after he had informed you that you were harassing him.” Ruis, 43, was shot last month near Lansing after a stabbing inside a Quality Dairy store. Authorities alleged he stabbed a 77-year-old man after being approached about not wearing a mask. The victim, John Duncan III, was left in critical condition and later died, family members said. Later, a sheriff’s deputy shot Ruiz when he tried to attack. He was holding a screwdriver and knives, authorities said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:Students in the Sauk Rapids-Rice district will return to classrooms for the 2020-21 school year, but how a school day will work and which students can return first could be different between buildings and grade levels. Although the school board voted 6-1 at a special meeting Thursday to begin the school year with in-person learning for all students, the first weeks of classes might not see every student return all at once. “The biggest piece, from my perspective, is giving our staff and our students time to understand what our new normal is,” Superintendent Brad Bergstrom said at the meeting. “What we need to do at the elementary level, time-wise, may look a little different than what we need to do at the secondary level,” Bergstrom said, “and I think that we may need more than one week to do that in some circumstances.” The specific plans for reopening each building and grade level will fall to building administrators with guidance from the district, based on factors like the size of the building’s spaces and ability to allow for social distancing. All students might not return to school at the same time, Bergstrom said after the meeting. In a normal school year, he said, ninth- and sixth-graders begin the school year earlier than other students to get acclimated and transition to a new building. Mark Hauck was the only board member to vote against the in-person plan with building-specific slow starts.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Fall sports and extracurricular activities for students in Mississippi’s second-largest school district have been canceled amid concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson Public Schools announced the decision Friday, The Clarion Ledger reported. “I know how disappointing the cancellation of sports and extracurricular activities may be for students, coaches and parents, but the school district must make decisions that make safety our top priority,” Daryl Jones, the district’s athletic director, said in a news release. “As we will not be able to host competitions with teams in a way that we can comply with the guidance from all levels of government and health officials, we must put safety first.” In the district’s announcement, alternative methods of developing student-athletes were outlined. Seniors can create highlight videos to introduce themselves to college coaches, officials said. Small group workout sessions emphasizing technique and skill development can also be conducted and there will be a winter showcase for senior student-athletes. Small group lessons will be held for band members and small-group tumbling assistance and training will be available for cheerleaders, the district said. The district cited Hinds County’s “hot spot” designation by Gov. Tate Reeves and Mississippi’s high positivity testing rate in making its decision. It also referred to the decision by Power 5 college conferences like the Big Ten and Pac 12 to not play sports this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A security guard who was beaten in a confrontation over facemasks opened fire early Saturday and wounded one of his attackers. St. Louis Police said the shooting happened around 2:30 a.m. after the guard told three men they couldn’t be inside a Shell gas station because they weren’t wearing masks. The city is requiring masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The men left but kept the door open and taunted the guard, police said. When the guard ordered the men to leave the property, they surrounded him and began punching him in the face. One of the suspects grabbed the guard’s baton and struck him several times. The guard then shot at the suspects, hitting one of the men in the abdomen, police said. That man was dropped off at a hospital where he was listed in critical but stable condition. The other two suspects fled.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The number of COVID-19 cases in Montana dipped to 43 on Monday, a 53% drop and tying the lowest figure reported in 22 days. In north-central Montana, Cascade and Phillips counties reported one each. The total number of confirmed reports is now 5,792. Of those, 4,162 have recovered and 1,548 remain active, according to covid19.mt.gov. There are 92 people who are still hospitalized out of 330 total hospitalizations. The number of deaths remained at 82. The number of cases from Saturday, reported Sunday, was 92. There were 120 on Friday, 132 on Thursday and 142 on Wednesday, according to covid19.mt.gov. The last time 43 cases was reported was July 26. The lowest before that was 37 on July 5. Flathead County reported 15 cases, Yellowstone County had 11, Big Horn had 10 and Carbon had two, the state reported. Cascade, Gallatin, Madison, Missoula and Phillips counties each had one.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: Two Wayne State College professors said they are frustrated that their requests to teach remotely this fall were denied. Longtime history professor Don Hickey, 76, said he hired an attorney after college officials rejected his request. “This is a scandal to us – that they’re playing hardball with senior faculty and putting them at risk,” Hickey said. After Hickey told administrators he would teach his classes remotely whether they approved or not he was told his classes would be taught on campus by other faculty members. Hickey has taught at the school since 1978. A request by another Wayne State history faculty member, Joseph Weixelman, 63, also was rejected. Weixelman said he has multiple sclerosis and that medications for that disease suppress the immune system, which could make him more susceptible to severe illness from the COVID-19 virus. “I feel scared,” said Weixelman, who plans to teach his courses on campus. “With my age and a preexisting condition, I’m not sure I would make it through” a bout with COVID-19. A spokeswoman for the Nebraska State College System said fewer than 20 professors requested accommodations for teaching this fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Spokeswoman Judi Yorges said she wasn’t sure how many requests were granted. Yorges said in a statement that decisions “have been made with the best interests of our students and staff in mind. It is unfortunate if these efforts are misrepresented as ‘playing hardball.’ ”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: In a letter to state officials, the food service provider at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas said it will lay off 940 employees. HMSHost sent a letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation about the decisions last Tuesday. The group also said that any workers that were furloughed and not scheduled to return to work by Oct. 15 will also be let go. Most of the layoffs are for those working as fast food clerks, restaurant hosts, baristas, bartenders and servers. Food and retail outlets at the airport have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has greatly diminished air travel. Although some outlets at McCarran have reopened with limited hours, many remain closed. “HMSHost continues to see an unprecedented decline in traffic in airports and on the motorways,” the company’s letter said. “The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the travel and restaurant industries and, unfortunately, HMSHost sits at the crossroads of both. Never in the history of aviation and the hospitality industry, have we experienced such catastrophic customer traffic declines.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: When the coronavirus pandemic shut down schools and museums, the Aviation Museum of New Hampshire used its flight simulator to bring children on a virtual trip around the world in a Douglas DC-3, which is credited with helping the allies win World War II. “Every segment was a learning adventure in which we discussed the physics of flight, in which we discussed the culture and the history and the geography of the areas that we were flying over,” said Jeffrey Rapsis, the museum’s executive director. WMUR-TV reported that the museum celebrated the end of the remote learning program Saturday by displaying one of the 21 passenger propeller planes. Hundreds turned out, wearing masks to get a close look.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The state has a shortage of nearly 3,000 physicians, according to the New Jersey Physician Task Force of the New Jersey Council of Teaching Hospitals. And that shortage could become critically worse if COVID-19 restrictions have a serious impact on medical school students who have to accumulate clinical hours for their accreditation. The deans of Rowan University’s two medical schools are asking Gov. Phil Murphy to create a task force to address the threat of a projected physician shortage. Unless accrediting bodies, government agencies, hospital associations and medical regulators come together to address a possible threat to clinical hours and accreditation, those numbers exacerbate the physician shortage, said Dr. Thomas A. Cavalieri, dean of Rowan’s School of Osteopathic Medicine in Stratford, and Dr. Annette Reboli, dean of Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden. “All these groups are stakeholders in this and need to come together to see to it that the medical schools are getting what they need in order to produce a physician workforce at the state and national level,” Cavalieri said. “If not, there’s a lot at risk. If we don’t address this issue, and we get hit with another pandemic, there will be a serious shortfall of appropriately trained physicians to respond.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A popular music camp in New Mexico is canceling its summer program for the first time in more than 60 years because of COVID-19. KRQE-TV reported organizers for the Hummingbird Music Camp in Jemez Springs recently made the decision as the state remains under health orders because of the virus. Camp Director Teena King said organizers had no choice but to cancel the rest of the 2020 summer season. “It hurt our hearts. We were so prepared to figure it out and go forward,” King said. King said she is keeping her business afloat by renting out the cabins on the camp’s property to families.\n\nNew York\n\nCanandaigua:After a late start to the summer season at the Kershaw Park beach because of the coronavirus pandemic, summer will be coming to an end earlier than usual at the city’s popular swimming area. The last day of swimming will be Saturday, about two weeks before the traditional Labor Day closing, according to City Manager John Goodwin. “I know it’s two weeks early, but unfortunately, we don’t have the staffing,” Goodwin said. The beach typically opens Memorial Day weekend, but that didn’t happen until June this year because of the pandemic. Noting that Ontario County’s Deep Run beach on Canandaigua Lake did not open this summer, Goodwin said “we were fortunate to get the staff to run all of July and most of August.” The city cannot allow swimmers to “swim at your own risk” – which is allowed on private properties such as hotels – because it is not permitted at public parks in New York, Goodwin said. In previous years, the tail end of the summer swim season has also brought beach closures as a result of blue-green algae blooms.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: Another cluster of positive COVID-19 cases within student housing was announced Sunday at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The disclosure of cases within the Hinton James dormitory building marks the fourth such cluster – defined as five or more cases in close proximity – since the semester began Aug. 10 at the state’s flagship public university campus. The other three have occurred within an on-campus dormitory, private student housing and a fraternity house. As with the other clusters, the individuals testing positive in the Hinton James cluster are being isolated and receiving medical monitoring. Contact tracing is also happening.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: All North Dakota counties are aiming to have in-person voting as an option during the general election, a reversal from the June primary when all polling places were closed statewide amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Everyone is really moving ahead on in-person voting,” Donnell Preskey Hushka, executive director of the North Dakota County Auditors Association, said Monday. Election officials in the state’s 53 counties are “determining how many polling places they want or need.” Gov. Doug Burgum, at the request of the group, signed an executive order in March waiving the requirement that counties have at least one physical polling site for the June election, while allowing counties to conduct the primary election entirely by mail. Burgum stopped short of mandating that all polling places close during the state’s June election, despite being urged by county auditors to do so. The governor said he wanted to give counties the option of having open polling places, if they wanted. Hushka said county auditors, who serve as local election officials, have more time to plan for the upcoming election. More personal protective equipment also is available now for election workers and voters, she said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Among the voices of athletes, parents and coaches clamoring for high school sports to proceed during the coronavirus pandemic is a booster with one of the state’s highest-profile platforms: Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted. Husted, a former University of Dayton football player, is working with Ohio’s high school sports oversight organization to develop a plan. He has been outspoken on his personal Twitter account in recent days that sports should go forward. Those tweets come as GOP Gov. Mike DeWine was expected to announce his order governing sports Tuesday – a plan that appears to leave a lot of decision-making to local officials. “What’s the greater risk to people under age 25, canceling in-person learning & extracurriculars (sports) to protect them from COVID or leaving it to chance how they’ll fill this time?” Husted tweeted on Aug. 10 to his more than 25,500 followers. “You can’t take these things away from young people & expect good (health, academic, life) results.” DeWine hinted last week that fall sports, including football and soccer, could go forward with limits and based on local decisions by parents, schools and health officials.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: Women living at an off-campus sorority house at Oklahoma State University have been placed in isolation and are prohibited from leaving the house after 23 of them tested positive for COVID-19, university officials confirmed Monday. “Due to the nature of this situation, the entire chapter house is in isolation or quarantine and will be prohibited from leaving the facility,” the university said in a statement. “One member of the sorority who lives elsewhere is among those who tested positive and will also remain in isolation.” A widely circulated video showed dozens of students without masks packed into a Stillwater nightclub over the weekend. “As a student, I’m frustrated as hell,” said Ryan Novozinsky, an OSU junior from Allentown, New Jersey, and the editor of the student newspaper. “These are people I have to interact with. People will tell you this age group isn’t affected, but there’s always outliers with diseases, and there will be professors they interact with, starting today, that won’t be able to fight this off.” OSU has a combination of in-person and online courses, and students, staff and faculty are required to wear masks indoors and outdoors where social distancing isn’t possible. The city of Stillwater also has a mandate that masks be worn inside businesses, but police Capt. Kyle Gibbs said the department doesn’t typically respond to reports of mask violations.\n\nOregon\n\nOntario: A person imprisoned at the Snake River Correctional Institution died Wednesday after contracting COVID-19, officials said. The death marks the second of an inmate who tested positive for the virus in custody of the Oregon Department of Corrections, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The person who died, a man between the ages of 60 and 70, was tested last Tuesday, officials said. His test results came back Friday confirming that he had contracted the virus. The Department of Corrections did not release the man’s name or exact cause of death. The state generally discloses the deceased person’s name, county of conviction and length of sentence, but officials have changed that practice for inmates who contract the virus. The first inmate to succumb to the disease in the state, a man between 50 and 60 years old, died at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem in May.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state plans to launch a coronavirus exposure-notification app in early September to more quickly break chains of transmission by using the new technology to notify people who might have been exposed, officials said. The state has a $1.9 million contract to deploy and maintain the app with software developer NearForm Ltd, the Ireland-based company whose app has been downloaded by more than one-fourth of that country’s residents. The app is based on smartphone technology developed by Apple and Google, and will undergo a pilot project next week, using state government employees and public health students, staff and faculty, officials told the Associated Press. The app will be interoperable with the state of Delaware’s app, and it also is expected to be interoperable with those of two other states, although Pennsylvania state officials declined to name those states because they are still in discussions with the app developer. It’s use will be limited to people 18 and over. It is similar to the app rolled out by Virginia earlier this month, when it became the first U.S. state to use new pandemic technology created by Apple and Google. North Dakota and Wyoming have also launched an app using the Apple-Google technology in recent days, and a number of other states are interested in it, Google has said. It is designed to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus, and state officials said the app does not store location information, personal information or the identify of anyone who is in close enough range to possibly be exposed. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state launched an online portal to help adults seeking training and work during and after the coronavirus pandemic connect with educational opportunities. The program, RI Reconnect, is a partnership between the state Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner and a grant from the Lumina Foundation. “With RI Reconnect, adult students are matched with a navigator who will work with them to identify and meet their goals, whether that’s earning a certificate, a license for a trade, or finishing a college degree,” Tammy Vargas Warner, the agency’s assistant commissioner, said in a statement Monday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate is coming back into session in two weeks to mull over possible election law updates necessitated by the coronavirus outbreak. In a news release Monday, Senate President Harvey Peeler said state senators would return Sept. 2 to “make plans to protect the voter and the vote” given that the pandemic continues in the run up to the November general election. “If the COVID-19 pandemic is still prevalent in our state, the Senate must make plans to protect the voter and the vote,” Peeler said. “We don’t know what the situation will be like in November, but we need to prepare for safe and secure voting.” State lawmakers had already been slated to return in mid-September, purportedly to discuss possible election tweaks, among other issues. House Majority Leader Gary Simrill said Monday that chamber would stick to its plans to return Sept. 15, not earlier. Ahead of the state’s June primary elections, state lawmakers in May agreed to several changes including universal absentee voting and a waiver of the witness requirement for absentee ballots. Referencing the “bipartisan manner” in which those issues were handled, Peeler wrote he was “hopeful we can do it again and return later in September to address the remaining legislative business.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Mayor Paul TenHaken said a mask mandate for Sioux Falls is possible if cases continue to rise but said the city is in a good position with COVID-19 hospitalizations as schools prepare to open in the area. TenHaken, who said he was “so proud” of how Sioux Falls has responded in the five months since a COVID-19 case was confirmed in the city, spoke positively about where the city is, noting that an increase in the city’s rate of positive cases over the past three months had not been met with an equal increase in hospitalizations. TenHaken was joined by officials from Avera and Sanford on Monday to provide an update on the city’s response to the pandemic. With school starting soon – TenHaken noted his children are heading back this week – the mayor said the leaders of districts and schools have “nearly impossible jobs right now,” and asked the community as a whole to work together to keep transmission down – and to be prepared for when, inevitably, there are COVID-19 cases in schools.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state lawmaker who was criticized for not wearing a mask at a Republican party dinner has been hospitalized, and colleagues said he has the coronavirus. Rep. Mike Carter tweeted Monday morning that he’s feeling better but expects ups and downs during his recovery. Carter, an Ooltewah Republican, was getting treatment for COVID-19 on Sunday in the intensive care unit of Erlanger hospital, his colleagues told the Chattanooga Times Free Press. “Our friend and colleague is battling COVID, and he is in ICU in Erlanger and we covet your prayers and so does he,” said House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison. He said he and Carter texted each other earlier in the day. Carter attended a July 31 Hamilton County Lincoln Day dinner where a number of prominent Republicans were criticized for not wearing masks or social-distancing. He posted a photo of himself with U.S. Senate nominee Bill Hagerty, neither of them wearing a mask, and later tweeted in response to criticism that guidelines don’t require mask-wearing while dining. When the local health department announced on Aug. 5 there was a virus exposure at the event, Hagerty’s campaign said the candidate tested negative for the coronavirus. Carter chairs the House Civil Justice Committee, but was absent during last week’s special legislative session.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The Central Texas Food Bank will distribute free food using its mobile food pantries to help those who are facing increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic from 8 to 11 a.m. Thursday at Nelson Field in Austin and Saturday at Del Valle High School in Del Valle. Attendees will receive one box of assorted produce, 1 to 2 gallons of milk, one protein box weighing 8 to 20 pounds containing pork or chicken products and/or an emergency box of shelf-stable items. To adhere to social distancing requirements, pickup will only be available to those in vehicles. No walk-ups will be allowed. For more information, visit centraltexasfoodbank.org.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Officials on Monday confirmed the first U.S. cases of mink infected with the coronavirus following outbreaks in Europe. Five infected minks have been identified at two farms in Utah, the Department of Agriculture announced. Testing began after the farms reported unusually high mortality rates among the small animals prized for their fur. The Utah mink farms have also reported cases among workers. Infected humans can spread the virus to animals during close contact, but there is no current evidence that animals spread the disease to humans, authorities said. The impacted farms in Utah have been quarantined to stop the spread of the virus. Scientists believe the coronavirus that first infected people in China initially came from an animal source, probably bats, and later spread from person to person. Some animals, including cats and dogs, have picked up the coronavirus from people as it spread around the world. Scientists are studying outbreaks in Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands and exploring whether workers could have caught the virus from minks and, if so, how much of a further threat that type of transmission might pose. More than 1 million minks were killed on Dutch farms with outbreaks to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:Dwindling sales because of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted Nepali Dumpling House in Burlington’s Old North End to close at the end of the month. The only bright side for her customers, owner Sabitra Phuyel said, is “everything is on sale” at the family operated deli and store. Her business, which opened in 2016, sells clothing, food, toys, household items and groceries, as well as takeout meals. The going-out-of-business sale will end on Aug. 31, as will Phuyel’s lease. Phuyel said she plans to put everything that remains, with the exception of perishables, in storage in the off-chance that she (or someone else) might revive the business one day.\n\nVirginia\n\nFarmville: Two outside experts will be allowed to inspect an immigration detention center in Virginia that has seen the worst coronavirus outbreak at any such facility in the nation, a federal judge said during a virtual hearing Monday. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema agreed to a request from attorneys of inmates who have filed a lawsuit over conditions to allow a medical expert to conduct an inspection at the private facility in Farmville. Brinkema also agreed to a request from attorneys representing those running the facility to bring in one of their own experts. The judge instructed attorneys on both sides to draft an order allowing the visit. She could sign it as early as Monday afternoon. The visit could occur as early as this week. More than 80% of the center’s 300 detainees have tested positive for the virus, and one of those detained has died. Last week, the judge ordered immigration authorities to halt transfers into the detention center. She also excoriated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for accepting 74 transfers from facilities in Florida and Arizona. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent in its own team to inspect the facility last week. Dr. Homer Venters, the expert hired by the inmates’ attorneys, wrote in recently filed court documents that he attended a debrief provided by the CDC after its team visited the facility. Based on CDC observations, Venters wrote that it was difficult to maintain social distancing in some areas of the facility. He also wrote that staff do not use personal protective equipment appropriately and that many staff had exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and continued working. Jeffrey Crawford, the director of Immigration Centers of America-Farmville, responded in his own filing. “CDC officials stated that ICA Farmville was largely in compliance with CDC recommendations, with only a few minor operational recommendations offered at that time, all of which I intend to implement at the facility,” he wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The State Department of Health on Sunday reported 576 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 15 deaths. King County continues to have the highest numbers in the state, with 17,623 cases and 694 deaths. Yakima County is second, with 10,625 cases and 221 deaths. Pierce is third with 6,150 cases. Statewide totals from the illness caused by the coronavirus are at 67,461 cases and 1,781 deaths, up from 66,885 cases and 1,766 deaths on Friday. Thirty-seven people with confirmed COVID-19 cases were admitted to Washington state hospitals on Aug. 8, the most recent date with complete data. Late March had two days with 88 people admitted, the highest numbers to date during the pandemic. The total number of tests conducted is temporarily unavailable, according to the DOH. On Aug. 8, 6,394 specimens were collected statewide, with 5.4% testing positive. The average positive test rate for the seven days prior was 7%.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A recently released color-coding system for West Virginia public schools to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic is being tweaked to focus more on community spread, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The model will still use four colors to classify the status of each county’s school system based on the seven-day average of new daily cases per 100,000 people. The colors range from minimal community transmission in green, moderate transmission in yellow, higher transmission in orange and substantial transmission in red. Schools in counties that have an orange or red coding will not be allowed to have athletic competitions, and red counties must suspend in-person instruction and activate remote learning plans, Justice said. The change will now count each employee of a nursing home or prison who contracts the virus as one case. Before, employees were counted as half of a case. The reason for the change reflects the thinking that those people go out into the community, potentially advancing the spread of the virus, officials said. The color-coding map is based on a Harvard University model. But Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s coronavirus czar, said the Harvard model does not separate congregate and community spread of virus cases. “We live in such a a small population state,” Marsh said. “We have basically decided we will just look at what is the community spread.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Temperatures in at least one Wisconsin prison have reached at least 87 degrees this summer, intensifying health concerns in prisons, already considered among the most dangerous environments during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Tony Evers has opted not to consider any clemency requests from inmates, and corrections officials have rejected nearly all applications for early release based on health conditions. Already overcrowded, the population in state-run prisons is rising again after months of decline, though still down since the beginning of the year. More than 21,000 adults are held in buildings designed to house fewer than 18,000. Inmates and their family members have reported troubling conditions, including poor ventilation, high temperatures and the impossibility of social distancing. In at least one facility, staff are forcing inmates to keep doors closed to restrict airflow in response to coronavirus risk. The American Civil Liberties Union has called on Evers to reduce the incarcerated population before further spread of the virus. More than 300 inmates in state prisons have been infected and 21 cases remain active. Outbreaks have been worse in other states’ prisons.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The coronavirus pandemic has local high school musicians marching to a different drummer. That was evident during the morning hours of weeklong band camps for Campbell County and Thunder Basin high schools as band members practiced the fundamentals without their instruments. Whether shaking off rust for the seniors or introducing freshmen to high school marching band for the first time, the young musicians began the new band year marking time to a far-from-familiar cadence. The bands are the first high school activity returning to a semblance of normalcy for the upcoming school year. Fall sports practices began Monday. This fact registered with Thunder Basin band director Steve Schofield, and it was not something he takes lightly, the Gillette News Record reported. “I wouldn’t say it’s nervousness, but it’s a pretty heavy responsibility,” Schofield said. “We could really screw this up for everybody. If my band was to end up with half of them sick or whatever, then that could make people question whether schools should be opening up. So what I told the kids when we started was we have to be extremely serious about this.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/10/goat-house-crasher-hurricane-setbacks-artist-haven-news-around-states/40292455/", "title": "Goat house-crasher, hurricane setbacks: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Thirteen nights of fun, fright and good times are ahead at ZooBoo, which begins Friday. The Halloween-themed evening event at the Montgomery Zoo has provided generations of River Region citizens tons of seasonal fun. Activities include haunted hay rides – as well as a traditional, non-scary version – plus games, bouncy castles, rides, seasonal concessions and much more. Gates open nightly at 6 p.m, with the festivities running Fridays through Sundays until the end of the month. Admission is $17 for ages 3 and older. For zoo members, the price is $8.50. Coupons for $1 off are available online. The Montgomery Zoo says it still needs more than 1,500 volunteers to make ZooBoo 2019 a success.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: New technology is expected to help detect and study conditions that lead to landslides, a researcher says. The landslide detection system in Sitka will monitor soil moisture levels and help residents and scientists understand landslide patterns, the Sitka Sentinel reports. University of Oregon postdoctoral researcher Annette Patton helped install the system funded through a $2.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The project was initiated after heavy rainfall in 2015 triggered a landslide that struck a Sitka subdivision and killed three men, she says. The monitoring stations at three locations in Sitka will transmit data every five minutes and produce a body of information over time. A goal is to study the relation of landslides to different types of storms, Patton says.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: A project to conserve murals inside a historic watchtower near the Grand Canyon’s east entrance is complete. The 1930s murals in the Desert View Watchtower have been worn down by weather and visitors over decades. Crews have been working over the past four years to conserve them. Workers filled deep gouges in window sills and staircases where visitors had carved names. They removed writing left in marker, nail polish or pen. They also removed salt deposits and tried to preserve what was left of the pigment in the murals. Grant funding covered much of the project. Famed architect Mary Colter designed the watchtower, and Fred Kabotie and Fred Geary painted the murals. The 70-foot watchtower gives visitors expansive views of the painted desert and the Little Colorado River gorge.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state will review a proposal to remove waste from the country’s first “national” river watershed after a large hog farm accepted a buyout from the state to close its site following years of environmentalist complaints. The Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment hired Harbor Environmental to draft the closure plan for C&H Hog Farms, which was completed late September. It includes permanently banning medium and large hog farms from the Buffalo National River watershed. C&H took a $6.2 million buyout from the state this summer to shutter the farm. Critics have expressed concern over pollution, but the research has not explicitly found that C&H caused the algae in the river. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports people can submit comments on the plan until Oct. 15.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will limit rent increases for some people over the next decade after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Tuesday aimed at combating a housing crisis in the nation’s most populous state. Newsom signed the bill at an event in Oakland, where a recent report documented a 43% increase in homelessness over two years. Sudden rent increases are a contributing cause of the state’s homeless problem, which has drawn the ire of Republican President Donald Trump. “He wasn’t wrong to highlight a vulnerability,” Newsom said of Trump’s criticisms to an audience of housing advocates. “He’s exploiting it. You’re trying to solve it. That’s the difference between you and the president of the United States.” The law limits rent increases to 5% each year plus inflation until Jan. 1, 2030. It also bans landlords from evicting people for no reason.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A doctor fired after trying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to end his life has filed an updated lawsuit that challenges her firing by a Christian hospital company. In the case against Centura Health filed Monday, Dr. Barbara Morris alleges it retaliated against her in violation of the state’s assisted suicide law and unlawfully inserted itself the doctor-patient relationship. Colorado law prohibits corporations from interfering with a physician’s professional judgment. Morris was fired in August after she and patient Neil Mahoney asked a judge to say whether Centura could stop her from helping him. He has sought help elsewhere and isn’t part of lawsuit anymore. Centura says it’s now only a case about whether an employer can fire a worker who violates its policies. But Morris’ attorney, Jason Spitalnick, says it’s about whether Centura’s polices can violate Colorado law.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The University of Connecticut plans to offer free tuition to in-state students from families with an annual household income of $50,000 or less. UConn President Thomas C. Katsouleas announced the initiative Friday during his inauguration. Undergraduate students will be eligible for the program beginning next fall. UConn says it will be supported by a fundraising campaign and other school resources. Yale University announced this week that parents earning less than $75,000 won’t have to contribute to their child’s education beginning next year. The previous threshold was $65,000. Katsouleas on Friday also called for doubling research at UConn over the next seven to 10 years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A statewide autism respite program will be reinstated with the help of additional state funds, after the at-home care service for students with autism was suspended with little notice at the beginning of the month. The newly allocated state funds will keep the program running through the end of the fiscal year in June. Christina School District, which oversees the Delaware Autism Program, requested $750,000 from the state, said Robert Scoglietti, spokesman with the state Office of Management and Budget. The actual amount the state provides will depend on use of the program through the year, he said. Christina originally decided to suspend respite services because of skyrocketing costs. Over the past year, demand for respite services have risen 350%, said Alva Mobley, spokeswoman for Christina. Costs have increased 400%.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local lawmakers have voted to bar district agencies from cooperating with federal immigration agencies unless provided a judicial warrant or order. WTOP-FM reports the emergency legislation unanimously passed Tuesday aims to ensure the district doesn’t detain people solely for violating immigration law. The measure prohibits the district from inquiring about the immigration status of a person in custody. It also limits district agency compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless provided judicial input or criminal warrants. Limitations include not sharing a person’s release date or providing space or equipment to the agency so it can search a person in district custody.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City: A year after Hurricane Michael, the county hardest hit by the Category 5 storm is still in crisis. Thousands in Bay County are homeless, medical care and housing are at a premium, and officials say domestic violence has been an issue. Michael was among the strongest hurricanes ever to make landfall in the United States. It barreled onto the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10, 2018, with 160 mph winds, ripping homes from their foundations and devastating Tyndall Air Force Base. It left 22,000 of Bay County’s then-180,000 residents homeless and resulted in total insured losses of almost $7 billion. This summer, county officials unveiled a nearly 300-page blueprint to rebuild. Among their ideas: Use shipping containers and 3D technology to build new houses, and offer signing bonuses to lure new doctors.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAmericus: Some residents are opposing a $500 million solar farm in southwest Georgia that would be one of the nation’s largest. WALB-TV reports Sumter County commissioners held a hearing Tuesday on whether to grant zoning approvals for Americus Solar LLC, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Invinergy. Some opponents say the solar farm will hurt property values, harm wildlife and take too much land away from farming uses. The company would cover much of 9,700 acres in solar panels, although it says it’s still evaluating how big a solar farm to build. The company says it will pay $35 million in yearly property taxes and employ 500 people during construction. It also says the project will help rebuild worn-out farmland. The installation would generate 1,115 megawatts of electricity.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A customer satisfaction survey of air passengers has ranked the city’s airport the third worst in North America. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Daniel K. Inouye International Airport has received the ranking in the J.D. Power 2019 North America Airport Satisfaction Study. Inouye airport ranks behind New York’s LaGuardia and New Jersey’s Newark Liberty as the worst among 62 airports. Honolulu ranks second-worst in the large-airport category, where it was fourth-worst the previous year. The annual study is based on responses from 32,276 U.S. or Canadian residents who passed through at least one North American airport. The survey scores airports on terminal facilities, airport accessibility, baggage claim, security check, check-in and baggage check, food, beverage, and retail.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The forest in and around one of the nation’s top ski destinations is in trouble from an ongoing combination of unusually warm temperatures, drought, wildfires, insect invaders and pathogens. So the U.S. Forest Service is starting an environmental analysis to find ways to improve the forest’s health at Sun Valley Resort’s Bald Mountain ski area, a huge economic driver for the region heavily dependent on tourism. The potential Bald Mountain Stewardship Project includes the entire 3,000-acre ski area. Officials say wildfires in 2007 and 2013 surrounded 9,150-foot Bald Mountain with burned forest, increasing bark beetle attacks. Pine beetles, dwarf mistletoe and white pine blister rust are also killing trees on the ski-run-carved mountain that forms a scenic backdrop for the resort towns of Ketchum and Sun Valley.\n\nIllinois\n\nLynwood: The owner of a suburban Chicago flight school is taking responsibility for a wheel found lodged in the ceiling of a house over the weekend. Amy Summers of SummerSkyz Inc. of Lansing says the wheel that homeowner Linda Taylor-Whitt found hanging from the ceiling of a bathroom late Saturday is a helicopter ground-handling wheel. Taylor-Whitt says she and her family discovered the wheel and the damage it caused when they returned from dinner. She says Summers has been in touch with her and explained what happened. Summers says the wheel is used to move a helicopter from one hangar to another. It was still attached to the helicopter when a flight instructor flew it out of Lansing Municipal Airport. Summers says she has reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After making a name in the city’s music community, rapper Sirius Blvck wants to use his reputation to help other artists. Known for solo recordings as well as work with the disbanded Ghost Gun Summer collective, Blvck founded the New Hands Music Festival that debuts this weekend at all-ages venue Healer. “I’ve always wanted to use the social capital that I’ve built to then build a platform,” he says. “And utilize that platform how I see fit, which is to make sure we provide space for marginalized voices and people who get pushed out of the community.” New Hands also includes a focus on philanthropy. The Oct. 11-12 event will raise money for nonprofit organizations such as Ascent 121, an agency that provides long-term trauma care services to teen survivors of sex trafficking.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: A man who spent more than 25 years in prison for a murder he didn’t commit is urging college students to help inmates who may be innocent. Terry Harrington spoke to Coe College students Tuesday, recounting how he was wrongly convicted in the 1977 shooting death of a security guard when he was a teenager. Harrington had exhausted his appeals and was serving a life sentence at the Iowa State Penitentiary when he met a prison barber who believed in his innocence. “One lady made a difference in my life,” said Harrington, now 60. The barber obtained Council Bluffs police records that revealed authorities had withheld evidence showing another man had been a strong suspect but was ignored. Witnesses who had implicated Harrington recanted, saying they’d been coerced. The Iowa Supreme Court overturned Harrington’s conviction in 2003.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state has seen a big jump in syphilis cases over the past five years and a spike in the number of infants born with the sexually transmitted disease. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says Kansas reported 152 cases of primary and secondary stage syphilis in 2018, compared with 60 in 2013. The increase was 153%. The rate of cases per 100,000 residents grew to 5.2 in 2018 from 2.1 in 2013. Kansas had eight cases of newborns being born with syphilis in 2018. The state had only a single reported case from 2013 through 2017. Kansas Health and Environment Secretary Lee Norman said babies born with syphilis may be developmentally delayed, have seizures or die if the infection is not treated during a pregnancy.\n\nKentucky\n\nWhitesburg: A group made up of black lung disease sufferers and supporters is dedicating a memorial to miners who have died of the disease. The Black Lung Association of South Eastern Kentucky is hosting the event in Whitesburg on Sunday. They will dedicate a headstone memorial for miners who have died of the disease in Letcher and surrounding counties. The disease is caused by breathing coal dust, and rates of the disease have risen in recent years. The dedication event will be at 2 p.m. at Riverside Park. The association has been calling attention to a government trust fund that provides about 19,000 sickened miners or their surviving dependents with living and medical benefits. A tax that supplies the fund was cut in half at the beginning of the year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nWinnfield: Federal authorities have dramatically expanded detention of immigrants in the state. Since last year, eight local jails have started holding asylum-seekers and other migrants, making Louisiana an unlikely epicenter for immigrant detention under President Donald Trump. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it’s now detaining about 8,000 migrants in Louisiana out of 51,000 nationally. These new facilities are a mix of old state prisons and local jails and are several hours away from bigger cities. They are far from where most immigrants’ rights groups and lawyers are based. Migrants complain of mistreatment and prolonged detention. ICE refused several requests to comment on why it focused on Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: A crop specialist with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension has told the state’s potato farmers they might need to reduce use of a widely used pesticide that controls blight. Steven Johnson said national and international changes in the regulation of a fungicide called chlorothalonil could prompt the changes, and growers might consider moving to newer kinds of chemicals. The Bangor Daily News reports chlorothalonil has been used extensively in the farming of potatoes and other crops since the 1970s. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers it a “likely human carcinogen” and has attempted to reduce its use. The European Union banned the pesticide in March, and Canada has reduced the amount that can be used during the growing season.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state panel has voted to remove a logo that includes a Confederate flag from a plaque in Maryland’s Capitol that honors the Civil War’s Union and Confederate soldiers, but the state is keeping the plaque. The State House Trust voted 3-1 by email to spend more than $2,400 to remove the logo, which includes a Confederate flag and a U.S. flag, and overlay it with a cast image of the Maryland state flag. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and Laura Mears of the Maryland Historical Trust voted for the change and to keep the plaque. Maryland House Speaker Adrienne Jones, the state’s first black speaker, supported removing the entire plaque and voted against the plan.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway has cut ties with the nonprofit that had tended to the park for the past 10 years. WORK Inc., the region’s largest employer of people with disabilities, has groomed the park for 10 years. The Boston Globe reports the conservancy that manages the 1.5-mile-long park has chosen to move forward with Block by Block, a for-profit firm from Kentucky. WORK Inc. President James Cassetta called the decision an “absolute shock” and a slap in the face to the disabled. Jesse Brackenbury, executive director of the Greenway Conservancy, denied the move discriminates against those with disabilities. He said the Kentucky firm offered a more competitive price. The new contract took effect last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Counselors in the state are cheering after the initial passage of legislation aimed at safeguarding their ability to practice psychotherapy. The state House voted unanimously this week to advance the bill to the Senate. It would clarify the scope of practice for Michigan’s 10,000 licensed professional counselors. The measure is a response to a state department’s proposed revision of counseling rules. A state spokesman says existing law does not give counselors the authority to diagnose and use psychotherapy technique. Counselors say they’ve been doing so for years, however, and the rule changes would have significant consequences for them and the 150,000 people they serve.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: Wildlife officials in central Minnesota are discovering it’s not easy to get rid of deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting disease. The disease was discovered in a wild deer in Crow Wing County earlier this year, the first confirmed case in the state outside southeastern Minnesota. Legislators have set aside $50,000 to set up dumpsters in disease areas. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is supposed to empty the dumpsters and take the carcasses to landfills. But Minnesota Public Radio reports that Marv Stroschein, the Crow Wing County landfill manager, refused to accept any infected deer. He says he’s worried the disease could infect the surrounding environment. The Minnesota DNR earlier this year finally gave the landfill a 15-year-old incinerator.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge will hear arguments in a lawsuit that challenges the state’s unique, multistep process of electing the governor and other statewide officials. Friday’s hearing comes less than a month before the gubernatorial election between Republican Tate Reeves and Democrat Jim Hood. Mississippi’s 1890 constitution requires a statewide candidate to win a majority of the popular vote and a majority of the 122 state House districts. If nobody wins both, the election is decided by the House, now controlled by Republicans. Attorneys for black plaintiffs say because of the way state House districts are drawn, the electoral system dilutes African American votes. State attorneys say the system is not discriminatory.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A newspaper’s review of state records shows taxpayers have spent $366,000 on private attorneys to defend former Gov. Eric Greitens’ use of a self-deleting text message app. The Kansas City Star reports the bulk of the spending was by the governor’s office. About $161,000 of it came after fellow Republican Mike Parson became governor following Greitens’ resignation in June 2018. A state audit in September showed that taxpayers had spent more than $200,000 before Greitens resigned to defend him in a 2017 lawsuit. It alleged Greitens’ office used the app Confide to avoid being subjected to Missouri’s open records laws. A judge dismissed most of the case in July, but the litigation is ongoing. Greitens resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct and campaign violations.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two tribal leaders have resigned from a task force in protest of the state attorney general’s support of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada. Montana Department of Justice spokesman John Barnes confirms Jestin Dupree of Fort Peck and Brandi King of Fort Belknap stepped down from the Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force. State lawmakers authorized Attorney General Tim Fox to create the 11-member panel to better report and find missing Native Americans. On Monday, Fox intervened in a lawsuit in support of constructing the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta’s tar sands. Dupree wrote in a Facebook post that his tribe opposes the pipeline and that Fox’s intervention is a “slap in the face.” Barnes says the resignations are disappointing, and officials will ask the tribal governments to recommend replacements.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State officials have received $6.5 million in federal grants to help prevent and treat opioid abuse. The funding boost announced Tuesday will support the state’s efforts to reduce the number of opioid deaths. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services says 183 people died in the state from a drug-involved overdose in 2017. Officials say the national opioid epidemic isn’t as severe in Nebraska as it is in other states, but it’s still a concern. Officials will use the money for a variety of services, including an addiction medicine fellowship, expanded access to medication-assisted treatment, better tracking of public health data and improvements to Nebraska’s prescription drug monitoring program. It also will help train medical providers and spread public awareness.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Officials say the historic Nevada State Prison needs another $50,000 worth of work before it can open as a museum. Glen Whorton, Nevada State Prison Preservation Society president and former state prisons chief, says about $30,000 has been spent for improvements, including making one bathroom handicap-accessible. Whorton told people touring the facility Tuesday that $50,000 would pay for an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramp, asbestos removal, lighting, and electricity hook-ups. The prison predates Nevada statehood and was used for 150 years, from 1862 to 2012. Former Republican Assemblyman Pete Livermore of Carson City led a push in 2013 to make it a museum. Carson City Chamber of Commerce executive Ronni Hannaman calls the facility part of a unique history that could bring visitors to town.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: There may be some bad blood between a former financial adviser and clients he’s accused of defrauding via a fake charity he claimed involved singer Taylor Swift. The state Bureau Of Securities Regulation recently obtained a court order to freeze the assets of Dain Stokes and prevent him from contacting former clients. Authorities say two of those clients invested more than half a million dollars in what Stokes claimed was a charity project in Africa involving Swift, Bill Gates and other celebrities. In court documents, officials also say Stokes told clients he was engaged to Swift and promised them a 20% return. Stokes, of Fremont, has been fired by LPL Financial in Bedford.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state has greenlighted roughly $13 million in film tax credits for “WrestleMania” and David Simon’s production of the Philip Roth novel “The Plot Against America.” The Economic Development Authority authorized the tax credits at its board meeting Tuesday. It’s the third round of film tax credits under a 2018 law that established awards. About $9 million was awarded in August for two projects, including “Joker,” and $6.2 million was awarded in June for four projects. Former Gov. Chris Christie let a former film tax incentive program expire in 2015. “WrestleMania XXXV” got a $2.9 million award and was shot in April at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford. “The Plot Against America,” starring Winona Ryder and John Turturro, got a $10.2 million award and was shot in Jersey City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has discontinued financial bonuses for top-rated teachers as it delivers the results of job-performance evaluations for the school year that ended in June. Public Education Department spokesman Connor Boyle confirmed this week that no money was allocated by the state for Excellence in Teaching Awards. The performance bonuses of up to $10,000 were devised by former Republican Gov. Susana Martinez. The administration of Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is creating a new teacher evaluation system for the 2020-2021 school year with help from a 46-member task force and suggestions from community meetings. Student test scores no longer figure directly in evaluations. Lawmakers increased teacher salaries by 6% or more this year with additional pay under extended school-year calendars.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city has announced a settlement that prevents floating digital billboards in its waters. Under the terms of the agreement announced Tuesday, Ballyhoo Media must pay a $100,000 fine if its Times Square-style LED billboards are seen on any East River or Hudson River barges. The city sued Ballyhoo Media in March, claiming the floating billboards created a “public nuisance” and broke zoning laws. The agreement comes after the state enacted a law in August that banned floating digital billboards in its navigable waters. Ballyhoo released a statement saying it had complied with all local, state and federal laws and has a legal right to safely operate in New York waters but decided to stop fighting the city and state and focus on pursuing opportunities elsewhere.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The federal government has denied individual assistance for residents in four counties hit hard by Hurricane Dorian just days after approving other funds to help local governments repair infrastructure, the governor said Wednesday. Gov. Roy Cooper had sent a letter to the White House seeking federal aid for households in Carteret, Dare, Hyde and New Hanover counties. The assistance, which would have included funds for uninsured expenses including temporary housing, lodging reimbursement and repairs, was denied in a letter from FEMA, signed by Associate Administrator Jeff Byard, saying that “it has been determined that the impact to the individuals and households from this event is not of such severity and magnitude to warrant the designation of Individual Assistance.” It says the denial can be appealed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A man whose life sentence was overturned in the death of a woman whose baby was cut from her womb was resentenced Monday to 20 years in prison after he apologized and pleaded for leniency in front of a nearly empty courtroom. There were no apologies from East Central District Judge Tom Olson for the life sentence he gave to William Hoehn last year for his role in the 2017 killing of Savanna Greywind, only for the state Supreme Court to overturn it on appeal. “I want to sentence you to as long as I can by law,” Olson told Hoehn. The judge somberly noted that Greywind’s child, who survived the attack, will still be in high school when Hoehn is eligible for parole, although his exact release date will likely be decided by the state Department of Corrections.\n\nOhio\n\nAshland: A homeowner has been busy cleaning up after a large goat broke into her home by ramming through a sliding glass door and then settling down for a nap in a bathroom. The Ashland Times-Gazette reports Logan Keathley returned to his family’s Sullivan Township home Friday to find their German Shepherd agitated and the house reeking. That’s when he discovered “Big Boy,” a goat who had escaped from a farm several miles away, napping in a bathroom. Logan’s mother, Jennifer, began calling friends for advice. Ashland County sheriff’s deputies arrived, put a rope around Big Boy’s neck and tried to entice him outside with food. They finally grabbed the billy goat by the horns and led him outside. Jennifer Keathley says her home “definitely smells like a goat farm.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Democratic lawmaker from the city and other advocates for more restrictive gun laws filed a lawsuit Monday challenging a new state law that will allow people to carry firearms without a background check or training. State Rep. Jason Lowe’s suit argues that the law violates a state constitutional requirement that bills deal with only one subject matter. “This fight is far from over,” Lowe said at a news conference. “We believe this law is dangerous.” Dubbed “constitutional carry” by its supporters, the bill signed by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt would allow most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without the currently required background check or training. Exceptions would include anyone in the country illegally or those convicted of certain crimes. The bill is scheduled to take effect Nov. 1.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s public records advocate says fees charged by the state and local governments for public records requests are high and wildly uneven, creating a barrier for journalists and citizens seeking documents. Ginger McCall, who leaves her job Friday, said in a final report Wednesday that fees, sometimes reaching $180 per hour, are onerous compared to what the federal government and other states charge. She recommended a less discretionary fee structure and low rates and called for the Legislature and others to commit more resources to public records processing. McCall announced her resignation in September, saying Gov. Kate Brown’s office wanted her to secretly work for the governor while giving the impression she was working in the public interest. Brown said she regrets the controversy and is committed to improving transparency.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man who has maintained his innocence in a murder case for nearly three decades has been ordered free from prison after a judge overturned his conviction. Willie Veasy’s long-running appeal came to an end Wednesday morning, when a judge tossed out the murder conviction. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the judge told the 54-year-old Veasy that “you’re a free man,” as a crowd in the courtroom erupted in applause. He’d spent 27 years in prison. Veasy’s case is one of two the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office was reviewing due to ties to two former detectives accused of using threats, false promises or abuse to coerce suspects into confessing to murders they didn’t commit. Veasy insisted for decades that he didn’t kill John Lewis on a Philadelphia street corner in 1992.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Supporters of a free tuition program at the Community College of Rhode Island say graduation rates have improved, but there is room to do better. The two-year graduation rate at the college hit 19% this year, more than tripling its historical average of 6% and putting it above the national average. Enrollment has surged, especially for minority students. But CCRI President Meghan Hughes tells The Boston Globe the college has more work to do when it comes to raising graduation rates for the low-income students the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship free tuition program was designed to help. Hughes said the college is raising private money to better support low-income students. The college expects to spend about $7 million this year on the program.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFripp Island: A family visiting the Palmetto State fished a big package from the ocean, took it to their rental home and opened it up, finding about 44 pounds of cocaine. Beaufort County Sheriff’s Maj. Bob Bromage told news outlets Monday that the family was walking along Fripp Island when they spotted the trash bag-wrapped package floating in the water. They dragged it onto the beach and lugged it to their rental in a golf cart, later slicing it open to discover bricks of white powder. At that point, they figured they’d better call police. Authorities assessed the cocaine’s value at more than $600,000. Officials are working to determine its origin. Bromage said narcotics don’t frequently wash up in the county. He thinks Hurricane Dorian may have pushed it ashore.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBadlands National Park: Bison are about to have more room to roam. People are invited to celebrate expansion of the park’s bison range during a public ceremony Friday. The Return of the Bison Celebration begins at 11 a.m. at Pinnacles Overlook and will feature a ceremonial fence cutting, a bison release and a grass dance performed by students from American Horse Middle School. The park will open more than 22,000 acres to bison. Thanks to $743,000 in contributions, the park installed 43 miles of new fence along with new cattle guards to expand the bison grazing area to 80,193 acres. Park officials say the expanded grazing area will contribute to the health and genetic integrity of a herd estimated at 1,200 bison and to continued health of the prairie.\n\nTennessee\n\nMaryville: A forestry professor says the fall leaf colors in the Smoky Mountains will be more subdued this year. Wayne Clatterbuck tells The Daily Times that color changes probably won’t happen until November. And when they come, they will likely be of short duration. The University of Tennessee professor says the problem is the recent heat and lack of rain. Clatterbuck says some species of trees that require more moisture already will have lost their leaves by the time the leaves start to change. He says species like oaks will retain their leaves and “sort of turn burnt red.” But tulip poplars and cherry trees are expected to just drop their leaves without any color change except to brown.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A federal court of appeals is hearing arguments in a lawsuit accusing the University of Texas of violating free speech rights by removing Confederate statues. The Texas chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued after the university put three statues of leading Confederate figures in storage. The move followed 2017 white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which three people died. The lawsuit argues that the university breached its agreement with Maj. George Washington Littlefield, who donated the statues in 1921. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments Tuesday. The Austin American-Statesman reports Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says the court should dismiss the case. He says the group doesn’t have standing to challenge the university.\n\nUtah\n\nCisco: An artist is trying to revitalize an abandoned railroad town by refurbishing buildings and converting them into residences for artists. KUTV reports that artist Eileen Muza is the sole resident of Cisco, a scattering of old buildings in the high desert 30 miles west of the Colorado line. It was created in the 1880s as a fill-station for a railroad that connected Utah to Colorado. The town was abandoned when Interstate 70 was built a few miles north. Muza first became fascinated by the town when she visited it while on vacation. She purchased it in 2015 and left Chicago. She is fixing up the buildings so other artists can work from them in a residency project she calls “Home of the Brave.”\n\nVermont\n\nEast Richford: A bridge connecting the Green Mountain State and Quebec since 1918 has been restored. The East Richford Sutton International Bridge over the Missisquoi River reopened Monday. Marie-Claude Francoeur, a Quebec delegate, says residents on both sides of the bridge are “not only friends, we are family.” State officials say about 10 to 15 people use the bridge daily, but that number fluctuates with the seasons. Vermont and the Province of Quebec own and maintain the bridge, splitting it about 80% and 20% respectively. Gov. Phil Scott says the newly renovated border crossing will strengthen trade between Vermont and Quebec, which trade more than $2.2 billion worth of goods every year.\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: A review into a panel’s safety recommendations after the Virginia Tech mass shooting shows the state has implemented a majority of the proposals. The Roanoke Times reports Gov. Ralph Northam launched a review into the proposal adoptions after a special legislative session on gun violence was shut down by Republicans. The review found 74 of the proposals have been fully or partially implemented. The review says three recommendations weren’t implemented, including universal background checks, which Northam intended to push during the special session in light of the Virginia Beach shooting that left 12 people and the shooter dead. The Virginia Tech Panel was set up by then-Gov. Tim Kaine three days after a shooter killed 32 students and himself. The panel mostly focused on mental health, not gun control.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An environmental group says state and federal officials are moving too slowly to implement cleanup plans for the state’s waters. The Seattle Times reports a 1998 agreement between Northwest Environmental Advocates and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called for the state Department of Ecology to develop plans for almost 1,600 bodies of water. The group says in a court filing that plans for more than 540 water bodies that were supposed to be done in 2013 are incomplete. The group is suing to force EPA to set a timetable for completing plans for other waters identified as polluted. An EPA spokesman declined comment on the filings. State officials say such plans may not always be the best way, noting lawsuits can delay implementation, and in recent years have tried other approaches.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMadison: This drug-ravaged state has opened its first family treatment court aimed at protecting abused and neglected children while helping parents facing potential loss of custody to overcome substance use disorders. The court’s debut at the Boone County Courthouse in Madison was celebrated Monday. Family treatment courts also will open in Ohio and Randolph counties. Boone County Circuit Judge William Thompson is heavily involved in helping people addicted to drugs turn their lives around and envisioned the idea of a family treatment court a decade ago. He said the new court’s goal is keeping families together. Drug cases have overwhelmed the state’s court system. In a state of 1.8 million residents, more than 30,000 people are in drug treatment. West Virginia has by far the nation’s highest drug overdose death rate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has declared the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, following similar moves in other states away from recognizing it as Columbus Day. WLUK-TV reports Evers signed an executive order making the designation Tuesday at Indian Community School in Franklin. Evers says with the executive order, the state is recognizing and appreciating tribal nations and indigenous people and the contributions they’ve made to Wisconsin, which is home to 11 recognized American Indian tribes. Oneida Nation Chairman Tehassi Hill says the change has been a long time coming and can serve as an educational tool about tribal culture and history. Columbus Day remains a federal holiday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new court filing has revealed the federal government began a fraud investigation into coal company Blackjewel LLC prior to the company’s sale last week of two Wyoming coal mines. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the document filed Saturday indicates the investigation also preceded Blackjewel’s July bankruptcy filing. Court documents say Blackjewel owes the federal government about $50 million. The court filing says the government has been investigating Blackjewel’s potential violations of the False Claims Act, which holds corporations liable for defrauding the government. The government has asked a West Virginia federal bankruptcy court to delay discharging Blackjewel of its debts, which would allow the investigation to continue.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/10"}]}

The work stoppage will affect every major U.S. cargo port from Maine to the Texas Gulf Coast – three dozen ports that handle around half the goods that reach America by sea, including up to three quarters of the nation's banana imports.\n\nThe scene at the Delaware port:'We sacrificed our families': The Wilmington port workers' strike has begun\n\n\"This is going down in history,\" ILA president Harold Daggett shouted in the early morning hours Tuesday in front of a crowd of striking New Jersey dockworkers, on a video posted to the union's Facebook account. Some workers carried signs that said \"Machines don't feed families.\"\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\n\"Nothin's gonna move without us – nothing,\" Daggett said.\n\nThis is the first such strike on the East Coast since 1977, when an ILA strike jammed up cargo imports on the East Coast for 44 days.\n\nThe work stoppage comes after a long dispute between the longshoremen's union and port operator group The United States Maritime Alliance, over wages and the use of automation at the ports. Each side blamed the other for not negotiating in good faith.\n\nIn an American economy increasingly reliant on imported goods, a lasting strike could cost more than $500 million a day to the United States economy, according to an analysis by think tank The Conference Board. A lasting strike is expected to cause cost hikes in a country barely recovering from post-COVID inflation, and clot up the delivery of cars, electronics, pharmaceuticals, fresh produce and seafood, coffee, liquor, holiday toys and Ikea furniture.\n\nThe ILA has said its workers will continue handling military ship cargo, and that the strike would not affect cruise ships. For weeks as the strike deadline loomed, retailers and ports have scrambled to expedite shipments ahead of the busy holiday season.\n\nBut in the end, the deadline came and went. The ports are shut. The cargo will not move. The dockworkers are on strike. Here's what we know about the labor strike at the East Coast's largest ports.\n\nPrevious:East Coast port workers on verge of strike for first time in 47 years. What to know\n\nWhy are ILA workers striking?\n\nThe ILA has long signaled it was prepared to strike over a new contract, arguing that dockworkers who stepped up to work during the pandemic didn't see a fair share of port operators' windfall profits during the first years of the COVID-19 pandemic – and that their expiring contract didn't keep up with recent ballooning inflation.\n\n\"The last agreement between USMX and the ILA predates the COVID-19 pandemic and the severe inflation that happened,\" said Rutgers University professor and port labor expert William Brucher. \"So the value of the wage increases that they negotiated were worth much less.... In fact, you could argue that they've they've since fallen behind.\"\n\nWorkers at East Coast ports have said that they're ill-paid compared with a newer contract signed by their counterparts on the West Coast, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Under the West Coast contract, longshoremen top out at a reported base pay of nearly $55 an hour, compared with $39 an hour for East Coast employees, according to the contract set to expire Oct. 1.\n\nUnion president Daggett signaled his union had sought a $5 increase in hourly rate each year, over the six-year life of the contract.\n\nAnother sticking point is the use of new technology and automation, which union leaders fear would cost hours and jobs. Contract negotiations broke down in June over an automated port gate in Mobile, Alabama, that the union alleged had violated the current ILA agreement.\n\n\"We will never allow automation to come into our union and try to put us out of work as long as I’m alive,\" said union president Daggett in a July statement.\n\nUSMX filed a labor complaint in September saying the union refused to negotiate. The union said management refused to give them a fair offer.\n\nOn Monday morning, the final day of the union contract, ILA president Daggett said USMX was blocking the path to settlement by \"refusing ILA’s demands for a fair and decent contract and seems intent on causing a strike at all ports from Maine to Texas.\"\n\nThat strike has now arrived.\n\nHow long will a strike last? Will President Biden stop a port strike?\n\nThe union has signaled it's prepared to dig in for a fight. But both sides have a strong incentive to put an end to a labor strike, said Rutgers labor studies professor Brucher.\n\nOn the one hand, workers have a lot of leverage because of the size and power of the ILA to shut down cargo shipments across the Atlantic.\n\n\"The threat of consumer disruptions – and the disruptions to the operations of companies like Amazon, Walmart, Target, all of your major retailers – creates a lot of pressure on the shipping companies, constituted as USMX for purposes of bargaining, to substantially increase their offer,\" Brucher said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden helped the labor union's leverage by saying Sunday that he has no intention to interfere in contract negotiations by invoking the 1940s-era Taft-Hartley Act to mandate a \"cool-off period,\" Brucher said.\n\n\"Biden is, and I think this is without hyperbole, the most pro-labor president in decades – you could argue going back to Franklin Roosevelt, or if not Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy in the 1960s,\" Brucher said. \"So you know, the union's in a very strong position. And Biden is not indicating that he's going to reverse course.\"\n\n\"It’s collective bargaining. I don’t believe in Taft-Hartley,” the president said Sunday. His administration has urged both sides to come to an agreement.\n\nBut even if the union is in a strong negotiating position, workers also have a simple incentive to want a deal, Brucher noted: the state of their own finances as they go without work.\n\n\"A long work stoppage does drain resources. Workers do start to worry,\" Brucher said. \"Eventually they wonder if they're getting ahead.\"\n\nThe last ILA strike on the East Coast, in 1977, ended after 44 days. In 2002, President George W. Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to halt a management lockout of West Coast port workers.\n\nPort operator Enstructure wrote last week they'd \"continue to provide support services for our customers until regular operations resume.\"\n\nWhat are the probable effects of an East Coast port strike?\n\nBroad swaths of the economy would be drastically snarled up by a lasting East Coast port strike, according to industry observers – particularly among holiday goods that have yet to arrive on these shores. The East Coast and Gulf ports handle more than half of the country's container volume, and a quarter of the United States' international trade overall.\n\nA one-week strike could cost as much $3.78 billion in fallout, according to think tank The Conference Board, amounting to $540 million per day.\n\n“A port strike would paralyze US trade and raise prices at a time when consumers and businesses are starting to feel relief from inflation,” wrote Conference Board economist Erin McLaughlin in an analysis released Monday.\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,\" UCLA professor and supply chain expert Chris Tang told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nElectronics, like cell phones and computers, now come from Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, according to Tang.\n\nPharmaceuticals. Though air shipping is possible, drug shortages may result if negotiations can’t be settled within a month or so, Tang said.\n\nCars and auto parts. The Port of Baltimore leads the nation in car shipments. European cars come through this port and may experience a shortage, experts said. Auto parts from Europe often pass through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, too.\n\nMachinery parts. East Coast ports surpass others in the U.S. in shipments of machinery, fabricated steel and precision instruments, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nBananas. Three-quarters of the nation’s bananas enter through East Coast and Gulf Coast ports, according to Michigan State University's Jason Miller. “There is (zero) chance of shifting all these imports through the West Coast, and the low dollar value per unit of weight for bananas means putting them on planes isn’t economical,” he wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Moreover, you can’t frontload a perishable product.”\n\nImported wine and liquor. Imported wine and spirits come largely from Europe, and flow through East Coast ports. Distributors began bracing for the strike before it happened, according to Frank Pagliaro of Wilmington-based FranksWine. \"It’s already started with suppliers,\" Pagliaro wrote Monday, \"letting us know to stock up for the holidays as there may be potential shortages.\"\n\n(This story was updated to add a photo gallery and change the video.)\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations that call the First State home.

Cars, seafood, electronics and holiday goods are among the other products that may be squeezed in a port strike.\n\nFlashback:Wilmington is port of call for a world of fruit\n\nPort operators blame the union for the standoff and have filed a complaint over what they allege is a bad-faith break in negotiations. The union calls this a \"publicity stunt\" and says what's at stake is both fair wages and an existential threat to jobs in the form of artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nHere's what we know about the looming labor strike at the East Coast's largest ports.\n\nWhen is the contract deadline and how likely is a strike?\n\nThe union and port operator group the United States Maritime Alliance must reach an agreement by midnight Monday to avoid a walkout.\n\nOtherwise, the ILA has said it's prepared to strike.\n\nBoth sides are publicly playing hardball, and it's not clear an agreement is near. The Maritime Alliance representing port operators filed a complaint on Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging that the union had illegally broken off negotiations.\n\nThe two sides have reportedly not met in person since June after the ILA said they discovered that a port gate in Mobile, Alabama, had violated the current ILA agreement by using automated technology to process trucks without union workers.\n\nBut the union publicly derided at the notion they were the ones negotiating in bad faith and called the port operators' labor complaint part of a \"weak publicity campaign designed to fool the American public.\" Union president Harold Daggett said in September he fields \"low-ball\" offers from the port operators \"several times each week.\"\n\nHe began warning of a potential strike as early as July.\n\n\"As we get closer to our contract deadline, you may hear more about the possibility of a strike,\" wrote Daggett's son, union vice president Dennis Daggett, in a July statement. \"We want you to know that we are doing everything in our power to reach a fair agreement without disrupting the flow of goods you rely on. But in all honesty, we are prepared to stand up for what is right, even if it means taking drastic measures.\"\n\nWhat are workers asking for in a new contract?\n\nIn part, the usual thing: money.\n\nWorkers at East Coast ports have noted publicly that they are ill-paid compared with their counterparts on the West Coast, represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Under the latest West Coast contract, longshoremen top out at a reported base pay of nearly $55 an hour, compared with $39 an hour for East Coast employees, according to the contract set to expire Oct. 1.\n\nUnion president Daggett has signaled his union is seeking a $5 increase in hourly rate each year, over the six-year life of the contract.\n\nUnlike the West Coast port workers' union, the ILA is also holding out against automated technologies already in use at West Coast ports. Safeguards against automation that threatens jobs are one of the main public sticking points in ILA negotiations with port operators.\n\n\"We will never allow automation to come into our union and try to put us out of work as long as I’m alive,\" said union president Daggett in a July statement.\n\nAt the Port of Wilmington, workers for multiple unions serving the port told nonprofit news organization Spotlight Delaware that hours and jobs had been cut since port operator Enstructure took over the port in 2023.\n\nHow is Wilmington's port responding to a potential strike?\n\nOfficials from port operator Enstructure didn't devote much time to a potential strike in their public report to Delaware's Diamond State Port Corp. on Friday. Instead, they touted the port's success at bringing in expanded port shipments since taking over port operations in July 2023 – and in handling the increased ship traffic after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore this spring.\n\nHowever, Enstructure has begun preparations for a potential work stoppage, according to spokespeople.\n\n\"Over the next few days, Port Wilmington is preparing for a possible work stoppage impacting major ports on the East and Gulf Coasts beginning on Tuesday, October 1,\" reads a statement from the company. \"Port Wilmington will continue to operate business as usual until the potential work stoppage. If an ILA strike occurs, we will continue to provide support services for our customers until regular operations resume.\"\n\nWhat products would be affected by an East Coast port strike?\n\nThe ILA has said its workers will continue to handle all military ship traffic, and that cruise ships would also not be affected by a strike. As storm clouds began to gather, retailers such as Costco have also been scrambling to expedite shipments.\n\nBut broad swaths of the economy would likely be drastically snarled up by a lasting East Coast port strike, according to industry observers – particularly among holiday goods that have yet to arrive on these shores.\n\n“A supply chain disruption would undoubtedly lead to price increases across the board and would impact consumers’ ability to find the toys they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead,” Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nAside from holiday goods, experts said other items that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\n\nSeafood, like cod fish from Iceland or Canada and shrimp from Thailand and Ecuador. “Those aren’t as easy to transport by train because they’re refrigerated and perishable,\" UCLA professor and supply chain expert Chris Tang told USA TODAY on Friday.\n\nElectronics, like cellphones and computers, now come from Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand instead of China and are routed through East Coast ports, according to Tang.\n\nPharmaceuticals.

Its wines have been poured in area restaurants including Hearth Kitchen in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, and Capers & Lemons near Wilmington.\n\nChaddsford and White Horse Winery will continue operating separately.\n\n\"White Horse’s commitment to estate-grown, nationally recognized wines will also help Chaddsford further elevate its premium dry wine portfolio – something both organizations are very excited to see,” said White Horse Winery Proprietor B.J.

At that time, the sale price for the 5-acre property at 632 Baltimore Pike was $4.5 million. The final sale price was not immediately known.\n\nChaddsford, one of Pennsylvania's oldest and largest vintners, was founded in 1982 by innovative winemaker Eric Miller, a California native who once lived in Burgundy, France, and made wine in upstate New York, and his wife, Lee Miller.\n\nThe couple retired and stepped away from the business in 2012. The winery was then run by the Petrillo family of New York, who had worked with the Millers.\n\nChaddsford has produced 24,000 cases annually and makes wines from grapes grown in Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland.

Kids and parents in costume greeting their neighbors and getting their favorite candy creates memories that can last a lifetime.\n\nIf you want an earlier start on the Halloween fun, there are some trunk-or-treats around the First State that can get everyone warmed up for holiday itself.\n\nTrunk-or-treats are events where people park their cars and give out candy in a parking lot. Instead of a neighborhood, it's a lot and instead of houses, it's car trunks.

The campaign will have a physical presence in downtown Wilmington, with staffers expected to start working out of Delaware as early as next week.\n\n“My family’s values, my eternal optimism and my unwavering belief in the American middle class as our nation's backbone comes from my home – from Delaware,” Biden said in a statement. “That’s why there is no better place for our reelection campaign to have its headquarters. This election will be about standing up for those values.\"\n\nFour years ago, Biden’s presidential campaign was based in Philadelphia, a city that was key in delivering his presidential victory in 2020. Yet Wilmington became his informal headquarters with the onset of the pandemic, ultimately leading to Delaware hosting the announcement of Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate and later, the Democratic National Convention.\n\nDELA-WHERE?Wilmington as Biden's 2024 campaign HQ? Here's what staffers will find and should expect.\n\nPresidential candidates often choose their self-identified hometown city as their campaign headquarters. For Hillary Clinton, it was Brooklyn, New York, and with former President Barack Obama, it was Chicago.\n\nFor Biden, it is Wilmington – a city he took the train home to every night when he represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for decades. Wilmington carries a strong emotional weight for Biden: His political ideology was formed here, and his two children and first wife are buried here.\n\nSo far into his presidency, Biden regularly travels home to visit his grandchildren in Wilmington or to his oceanfront home near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThere’s been speculation by national media for months that Wilmington will be the campaign headquarters, with some Democratic operatives grumbling privately about the prospect.\n\nKate Bedingfield, former White House communications director for the Biden administration, said Wilmington was discussed as a possible location in 2020.\n\n“It was a very spirited debate between Wilmington and Philadelphia four years ago,” she said, “so it feels very meaningful that he's now going to have the opportunity to headquarter the reelect in Wilmington.”\n\nYet Delaware’s largest city doesn’t carry the same electoral importance as Philadelphia. In 2024, Pennsylvania is once again seen as a key state to win in order for Biden to remain in the White House.\n\nThe president will visit Philadelphia on Thursday, the sixth time since 2021, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\n“Having the campaign headquartered in Wilmington,” Bedingfield said, “is reinforcing a really fundamental piece of what the president believes that public service is all about, which is … serving the families that he raised his kids alongside in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a co-chair of the reelection campaign, said in a brief interview that Delaware “represents all of America.”\n\n“We're urban, we’re suburban, we’re rural, coastal,” Blunt Rochester said. “We have demographics that mirror the country.”\n\n“Pennsylvania is still important; it's his birthplace,” she added. “And it's right up the road.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/10/15/ross-dress-less-stanton-open-late-october/3663277001/", "title": "Ross Dress for Less in Stanton to open in late October", "text": "Ross Dress for Less in Center Pointe Plaza off Churchmans Road in Stanton will open Oct. 24, the company announced Thursday.\n\nThe discount retailer will be in part of the space formerly occupied by Babies R Us, which closed in late 2018.\n\nWith the opening, Ross will have three stores in Delaware, adding to locations in Dover and near New Castle.\n\nAt least in the near term, Ross will be flanked by vacancies: a roughly 16,000-square-foot space making up the rest of the former Babies R Us, and the 14,000-square-foot former Modell's Sporting Goods.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Construction underway at Delaware's third Ross Dress for Less, located near the Christiana Hospital\n\nTwo doors down is T.J.

As it stands, our current criminal justice system is bankrupting our state -- both morally and fiscally. Delaware spends nearly $300 million, or 16% of its state budget, on the Department of Corrections, and has the 11th highest incarceration rate in the country. However, a recent US World News Report ranked Delaware near the bottom for public safety and corrections. Given our high rate of crime and recidivism, it is clear that our prison system is not working to keep our communities safe. We must reform how we police, prosecute, and incarcerate; only then we can begin to rebuild our communities, grow our economy, and stop the cycles of crime, recidivism, and poverty that plague our most vulnerable communities statewide.\n\nMy life has been dedicated to public service and making meaningful changes in my community, from my time as an MLK service fellow in law school, to hosting community policing forums with the Coalition to Dismantle the New Jim Crow, and my commitment to doing court-appointed legal work throughout my career.

The fewer and fewer antiques there are, the more and more valuable there are. I would hate to see this thing closed up. A lot of these things probably were closed up.\"\n\nNord says he's been told there are fewer than a dozen gas houses of this nature shown to the public across the country.\n\nThere may be more that exist, but preservationists at the University of Delaware's Center for Historic Architecture and Design say that gas houses at similar historic sites may be misidentified, with people assuming they are something like a root cellar.\n\n\"The fact that Rockwood estate has an intact one and is restoring it is special,\" said Michael Emmons, historic preservationist specialist at CHAD.\n\nMonday, Rockwood Museum and Park and New Castle County officials launched a project to restore the gas house.\n\nThe mechanism, which is like a gas version of a water pump house, is located a short walk from Rockwood's main parking lot off of the Washington Street Extension and Shipley Road.\n\nIt once housed a generator that produced acetylene gas, which when burned with oxygen produced an orange light brighter than any produced for home lighting at the time. It also was more efficient than coal or kerosene, but only the wealthier could afford it.\n\nRockwood Mansion was built between 1851 and 1854 for a Wilmington merchant banker named Joseph Shipley.\n\nClayton Ruminski, the technical services archivist at the Hagley Museum and Library, noted that the system was extremely rare but he didn't immediately find evidence in Hagley records of more in the Brandywine Valley. Evidence of their existence may be buried in correspondences that are more than 100 years old, he said.\n\n\"Some large estates did use some gas-powered energy sources to light the property, but it’s not that common,\" Rumunski said, \"but obviously it’s reserved for the very wealthy and for the elite.\"\n\nFor decades, the gas house cove was unrecognized, partly because it was overgrown and couldn't easily be seen. Nord said he discovered the structure while walking through the park about four or five months ago when foliage had died back.\n\nThen Madeline Dunn, a historian from the National Register of Historic Places, visited the park in the spring and suggested the site be preserved. She was visiting because the park was looking for ways to re-establish its status on the register, which it first earned in 1976.\n\n\"It would have just died and nobody would know 20, 50 years from now, what the heck this thing was for,\" Nord said.\n\nThe gas house was situated far from the mansion, in case of an explosion. A flame of acetylene gas is 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Fahrenheit), warmer than any other power source of the time, according to the American Chemical Society.\n\nIt's widely believed acetylene burned 10 to 12 times brighter than flames from coal, natural gas and the oil lamps of the day.\n\nThe gas was brought to the mansion from the gas house through underground pipes.\n\nElectrification, which was first launched in 1882, replaced acetylene and other more common illumination methods, but it didn't become widespread until the 1920s.\n\nThomas Wilson of Canada was the first to produce acetylene, which is a chemical compound of calcium carbide, Rumunski said. Wilson did so accidentally in 1892 while trying to find a more efficient way to produce aluminum at the beginning of the second industrial revolution. He believed aluminum would replace most other metals because it was cheaper to produce. He sold the patent for the process to Union Carbide in 1895.\n\nThe park will use a $7,000 grant from the Eastern Brandywine Hundred Coordinating Council to rebuild the gas house into a guest exhibit.\n\nNord plans to construct an iron gate in front of a plexiglass wall over the opening. That will allow visitors to look inside the house, but not enter. A mock acetylene generator will be displayed behind the wall and linked to a light that when activated by guests will demonstrate the process.\n\n\"When I was a kid, Rockwood was a little bit like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory,\" said EB 100 Chairman Terry Wright before he presented a check to Nord and the county.\n\n\"It was a place of wonder and mystery that was hidden away from most of us. EB 100 is proud to be a part of New Castle County’s continuing efforts to both preserve Rockwood’s history and to expand public access to this community treasure.\"\n\nNord's plans are to begin construction on the gas house as soon as possible and open the exhibit in three months. Branches and debris have already been removed from the front of the opening.\n\nIn the late 1800s the mansion became the property of the Bringhurst family, whom it is believed installed the gas house. Today the property is owned and operated as a museum and park by New Castle County.\n\n\"It’s really vitally important that it be preserved and that generations to come know that this is here and understand the chemistry and technology,\" County Executive Matthew Meyer said.\n\nDELAWARE NEWS\n\nPoke Bowls are coming toshopping center near you\n\nThree years, over $230,000 later, Josephine fountain opens next month\n\nOur guide to the 2018 IndiaFest\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2021/11/19/schell-brothers-schellville-holiday-festival-rehoboth-beach/6373977001/", "title": "Schell Brothers bring all-ages holiday festival to Rehoboth Beach area", "text": "A new winter festival is coming to town and it’s promising to bring all the holiday spirit – from snow machines to roller skating under twinkling lights to a beer garden and local holiday shopping.\n\nWhile Schellville was once synonymous with a Christmas village of elf-sized houses featured at Winter WonderFest – a drive-thru holiday lights experience – this year, its creators have transformed it into a full-blown holiday experience behind the Tanger Outlets in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe first-ever Schellville festival, hosted by the homebuilding company Schell Brothers, will open on Saturday, Nov. 20.\n\nHere’s what you need to know before you go.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nLet's start with the best news: The overall experience is free.

Held in the Grand Court of the former Wanamaker Building, now occupied by Macy’s, a recording of actress Julie Andrews leads visitors through the story of the Nutcracker, Santa’s workshop, Frosty the Snowman and more. Scenes from these stories magically come alive through more than 100,000 sparkling LED lights.\n\n“It’s a long-running tradition in Philly and around the entire Northeast,” said Matthew Taft from Macy’s Branded Entertainment. “People drive for hours to visit. Sometimes there are four generations watching the light show.”\n\nThe music coming from the Wanamaker Grand Organ enhances the delight. Built originally for the1904 World’s Fair in St. Louis, the organ was installed in the Wanamaker Building in 1911.\n\nLike Andrews’ voice, the organ music is recorded for the light show with the exception of two showings each day Monday through Saturday. Throughout the year on every day but Sunday, the organ is played twice a day: Noon each day; 5:30 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; and 7 p.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays. At those regularly scheduled recital times, the organist will stick around and play live at the start or finale of the light show.\n\n“There’s nothing like the wind coming through those pipes,” said Taft.\n\nThe crowds can get heavy in the Grand Court, particularly as Christmas draws close.

Hood Territory has year-round snow that sits on the Palmer Glacier. The destination offers adult ski and snowboard camps each summer for people aged 21 and up. High Cascade snowboard camp offers four week long adult snowboard camps in June and July, while Windells Ski Camp has two ski summer camp sessions in July. Both camps have activities on and off the slopes.\n\nFor the wine enthusiast, Camp Chaddsford Adult Summer Camp takes place at the Chaddsford Winery in Pennsylvania in July. The day camp encourages adults to get outside for a day of lawn games, arts and crafts, and wine and beer tastings.\n\nYoga and meditation lovers can visit Kripalu’s summer camp: a yoga-focused summer camp for adults based in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n\n“It can be challenging to meet new people and make friends as an adult,\" Michelle Dalbec, a teacher trainer, said on the Kripalu blog. \"However, I’ve heard back from some former campers that they still keep in touch with their ‘camp-mates’ from years past.”\n\nSome camps offer more traditional summer camp activities.\n\nClub Getaway in Kent, Connecticut has guests stay in cabins and engage in softball, kickball, mountain biking, water skiing, and other sports. There are also social events like wine tasting, burlesque performances and salsa classes.\n\n\"Think lush woods, air-conditioned cabins and all the camp classics like color war, bonfires and ropes courses – I experienced childhood nostalgia at its finest at Club Getaway,\" past Club Getaway-goer Megan Crawford from New York City told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nTraditional outdoor itineraries are not the only types of summer camps offered for grown-ups; there areprograms that are about improving the world or yourself.\n\nYEA Camp is a summer retreat for aspiring activist adults who want to make a bigger difference in the world. Held at an animal sanctuary in upstate New York, the camp helps budding activists build skills like grassroots activism, fundraising, campaign planning, social entrepreneurship and communication skills.\n\n\"I was a 35-year-old camper at YEA Camp last summer,\" Martina Gauderer told USA TODAY. \"The best part was staying up late chatting with my bunk mates, waking up to nature and rescued animals, games, dance parties and educational activities. ... YEA Camp for adults boosts confidence and re-instills a sense of hope in the future.\"\n\nTo satisfy sci-fi, science and space-lovers, Adult Space Academy was created as a three-day program and gives adults the chance to immerse themselves in the concepts of space exploration.\n\nCampers take part in simulated missions to space, build and launch rockets and explore artifacts housed at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nUnited Kingdom resident Nick Brennan heard about space camp in his high school physics class and decided to travel all the way to the U.S. for the camp last summer. \"You get to train like an astronaut on the awesomely fun multi-axis trainer, build a rocket and perform an extended duration simulated mission,\" Brennan said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\nSpace camp is not the only way adults can get their heads in the clouds.\n\nBecause recreational marijuana is legal in certain states, there are retreats and camps that offer cannabis-focused programs. 420 Retreats combines yoga and cannabis in Colorado to create a summer camp that includes s'mores over a campfire, yoga, meditation and other relaxing activities.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/22"}]}

I just knew from that moment I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.”\n\n“After that, he just became obsessed with soccer,” said Fontana’s father, also named Anthony. “The ball was attached to his foot.”\n\nNow, at a time when fellow 17-year-olds are preparing for the start of their upcoming high school seasons, Fontana has already suited up and played for Major League Soccer’sPhiladelphia Union.\n\nBLUE HENS: Top running back Hills ineligible\n\nEAGLES:Smallwood, Clements not distracted playing close to home\n\nOn July 17, the Union announced it signed Fontana, who has one year of high school left, to a senior-team contract that goes into effect Jan. 1 of next year.\n\nFontana first took part in the Union Juniors program at age 10. He’s been a full-time Union Academy participant since entering the YSC Academy in 2014—which provides academic instruction for Union youth players. He’d attended Holy Angels School in Newark through eighth grade.\n\nAs a midfielder, Fontana has spent this summer and last playing for Bethlehem Steel FC, the Union’s top affiliate. He also appeared for the Union in a pair of preseason games, and in its recent 2-2 tie with English Premier League side Swansea City in a friendly match at Talen Energy Stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nOnce he turns 18 in October, Fontana will be free to sign with overseas clubs. As of now, he has a three-year deal with the Union. He’s the sixth Homegrown, or Union Academy product, to sign a first-team contract.\n\n“He’s an exciting prospect and we’re very pleased that we signed him,” the Union’s sporting director, former U.S. National team player Earnie Stewart, said. “When you have good players you need to lock them down.”\n\n“We always knew that Anthony had a lot of talent,” said Union coach Jim Curtin, who was an Academy coach when Fontana first became involved with the club.\n\nThose skills were first exhibited at Kirkwood, where Fontana’s parents signed him up for recreational league soccer when he was 4.\n\n“I always loved it, from the early stages back in Kirkwood,” said Fontana during a break in training this week on the practice field outside Talen Energy Stadium. “I remember the small goals, just running around. I was always pretty good. Not to brag, I would score like 15 goals a game. It was so much fun.”\n\nFirst State rarity\n\nSince Major League Soccer’s inception in 1996, Rob Smith is believed to be the only Delawarean to play in the league.\n\nA McKean High and University of South Carolina grad, Smith played in 92 games as a speedy midfielder for the Columbus Crew from 1996-2000.\n\n“I love representing my state and I just want to keep doing it,” Fontana said, knowing what a rarity he is.\n\nFontana commutes to work from his family’s Glasgow area home in the development of Farmington, where he resides with parents Anthony and Kim and siblings Hailey, 19, Ava, 13, and Andrew, 5.\n\nUniversity of Delaware soccer coach Ian Hennessy, who also coached Fontana as a youth player, called his Union contract, “A lighthouse signing for Kirkwood, for the state of Delaware.”\n\nHennessy played in MLS in 1996-97 for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, now New York Red Bulls.\n\n“It just goes to show you, at that age, what the possibilities are,” added Hennessy, who is also Kirkwood’s director of coaching. Hennessy operates a Union Juniors program and scouts for U.S. Soccer. “He’s a talented kid with a great work ethic and he gets an opportunity to sign for the local pro club.”\n\nHennessy coached Fontana on an under-10 travel team, Kirkwood Celtic. It also included Middletown’s Kalil Elmedkar, who’ll be a freshman at University of Kentucky this fall after going through the Philadelphia Union Academy. Another of Fontana’s Union Academy and Bethlehem Steel FC teammates, Mark McKenzie, from Bear, is beginning his freshman year at NCAA soccer power Wake Forest University after playing for the U.S. under-18 team this year.\n\n“We didn’t have a league,” Hennessy said of the Celtic program. “It was really more training – we played some occasional friendlies – and the parents bought into us. It was just a general kind of introduction and getting the basics right.”\n\nSoon after that, Fontana’s family moved him to the West Chester United Soccer Club in Pennsylvania for some increased competition which, Hennessy said, because of improvements in Delaware youth soccer, is no longer necessary.\n\n“When the Union found him they were just starting the process with the Academy,” Hennessy said, “and touching base with people who could identify the best talent in the area. It was perfect timing really for Anthony.”\n\nUnion Academy director Tommy Wilson remembers traveling to the Kirkwood Soccer Club complex south of New Castle and having his attention quickly snared by a player with dazzling skills.\n\n“I thought, ‘Whoa!’ and it was Anthony Fontana,” Wilson said. “He’d been recommended. He just stuck out the way he operates, head up, the way he plays, his qualities. He always seems to have time on the ball. He was one who stuck out right away for me and I was so glad we could get him. He’s a top prospect.”\n\nThe Union Academy program gave Fontana the opportunity to train and compete year-round, which, even as a 9-year-old, he craved, said his father, a 1989 St. Mark’s High graduate. Later, Fontana was called to the U.S. under-16 and under-18 team camps.\n\nAfter missing the early part of the 2017 United Soccer League season with a stress fracture, Fontana has seen action in eight games for Bethlehem Steel FC (8-8-3), which plays at Lehigh University’s Goodman Stadium. After a visit to Ottawa Saturday, Steel’s next home game is Aug. 13 against Toronto II.\n\nHe’ll complete graduation requirements at YSC Academy during the 2017-18 school year. He'll still have to make the Union roster next season but could play for Steel until he's ready.\n\n“This is just the beginning now,” his father said. “I told him, ‘You’ve worked your butt off to get here, now you’ve got to work twice as hard just to stay.’ But he was thrilled . . . He’s definitely happy to start his career with Philadelphia.”\n\nHennessy, who had guided the Blue Hens to three NCAA Tournament berths the past six years, remains a major supporter and Fontana considers Hennessy one of his prime influences.\n\n“He’s got great belief, great self-confidence,” Hennessy said of Fontana.\n\nMemorable matchup\n\nThe Union friendly match against Swansea City on July 15, in which Fontana played the final 14 minutes, demonstrated his flair.\n\n“Anthony is one of those players that through his experience with the academy and Bethlehem Steel always seems to have the solution already in his mind,” Stewart said. “So that means he scopes and scans the field as you should as a player and that’s why he’s always a step ahead in a lot of solutions that he has.”\n\nFontana's Swansea City performance included taking a pass on the outer right corner of the penalty area, cutting the ball back to his left to clear space from a defender and rocketing a left-footed shot that sailed just over the crossbar. “When I woke up that day I was like, ‘I’m going up against a Premier League team,'” he said. “It didn’t really feel real. As the day went on and it came closer I got a little nervous.”\n\nHis message to himself – “Let’s just go out and do my best,” he said – did the trick.\n\n“I felt great,” he said. “I need to try to score and try to put on a good show for the fans and even the players who play. They always help me just relax and stay calm and [are] always pushing me to get better each day.”\n\nAs a box-to-box central midfielder, capable of thwarting opposing attacks but also creating and scoring goals, Fontana identifies with some of soccer’s best recent playmakers.\n\nAs those he admires most, Fontana named Chile’s Arturo Vidal (Bayern Munich), Italy’s Andrea Pirlo (long-time Milan and Juventus star now with New York City FC in MLS) and Spain’s Isco (Real Madrid). But he singled out the Czech Republic’s now retired Pavel Nedved (last nine seasons with Juventus).\n\n“Every time I saw him, I was in awe,” Fontana said.\n\nThe word that often comes to mind for Curtin when he watches Fontana is “fearless,” he said, a valuable quality for a slightly built 5-foot-8, 150-pounder.\n\nAs he embarks on his pro soccer career, Fontana said he will draw on that 2006 World Cup memory frequently for inspiration.\n\nIt has worked well up to now so why not?\n\n“I keep that in the back of my head every training session,” Fontana said. “Just keep it there so if I’m ever down or not doing so well, I push through it and, hopefully, I’ll be getting that opportunity to just bring the joy.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Total recommendations across positions would reach about $232 million over four years.\n\nLast week, lawmakers got to dig in.\n\nMembers of House and Senate Education Committees called attention to local school district responsibility, meeting jointly last Thursday afternoon, while expressing concerns that all districts could foot the bill lined out in Public Education Compensation Committee's report. This comes as the state would be responsible for 70% of the salary swells, while districts handle the remaining 30%. Members also discussed increasing incentives within the process.\n\nDEEPER:Delaware lawmakers are headed back to Dover. Here's what they're focusing on in 2024\n\nThe recommendations come across education jobs, with pay adjustments that bump salaries with annual raises and stipends. Teachers and professional staff could see a 2% increase plus a $1,875 stipend, while paraprofessionals see a 1% increase and stipends ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. More examples, from food service to IT, fill the committee report.\n\n\"We anticipate that when the Governor’s recommended budget comes out in just a few weeks that some of this will possibly be addressed,” said Secretary of Education Mark Holodick as he presented the report.\n\nThe hope is to see Delaware regionally competitive, meeting ongoing efforts to strengthen an educator pipeline. Lawmakers can accept some, all or none of the report's points.\n\nGov. John Carney is expected to announce his budget plans this month.\n\nDelaware State, Wilmington University land millions from the Longwood Foundation\n\nThe Longwood Foundation calls itself a catalyst for nonprofits.\n\nBy the end of last year, its grantees in education included Wilmington University and Delaware State University affiliates — with gifts totaling nearly $4 million combined.\n\nFor Delaware's HBCU, that includes the Delaware State University Foundation's receiving $1.75 million to support the expansion of the Department of Nursing, according to Longwood's announcement, aimed at growing the number of nursing and allied health graduates.\n\nStill down in Dover, Longwood awarded $1.2 million toward \"Braven,\" helping to launch student-support programming at Delaware State. Braven partners with colleges, universities, and employers aiming to offer a \"career-accelerating experience\" through a credit-bearing college course and a post-course opportunity after graduation.\n\nWilmington University saw $1 million given to support the expansion of its Brandywine Campus. This makes way for a new convocation center and law school building.\n\nICYMI:Smyrna joins school systems headed to referendum at the top of the year: Education roundup\n\nIs your kid's school in good condition?

So, this facility assessment tool aims to help school districts review and assess their conditions in a standardized way.\n\nAs districts respond — required each year in May, alongside a board-approved repair and maintenance plan — the assessments are intended to find areas that need attention.\n\nDDOE will continue to provide technical support. May 2024 marks the first deadline.\n\nThe legislation also directed the Department of Public Health to establish a routine indoor air quality monitoring program and temperature and humidity standards for schools.

I couldn't always make ends meet.\"\n\nBut as Carla's illness continued and the kids grew older, it became more difficult to help with homework and provide discipline. The brother of Carla's sister-in-law, Robin Moxley, worked at the Milton Hersey School in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The free, pre-K through 12 coed home and school serves children from families of low income, limited resources and social need.\n\n\"When my wife was sick, she thought that was a good idea for them to go there,\" Jim said. \"They would get a good education, and that would help out a lot.\"\n\nThe family toured the school and decided to enroll the three youngest children – daughter Alex and sons Ben and Noah. The oldest son, Sam, did not go to Hershey.\n\n\"We took them up there, let them see what it was like, and we talked to them about it,\" Jim said. \"It was really tough. My kids cried when I took them up there. They didn't want to go. … I didn't want them to go there, but it turned out to be a good thing for them.\"\n\nTearful transition\n\nThe Milton Hershey School was founded in 1909 by the chocolate magnate and his wife, Kitty, who were unable to have children. The school's 1,900 students live in houses on campus, supervised by married houseparent couples experienced in child care. Each child shares a bedroom with one or two other children, and 10 to 12 students of the same gender and close to the same age live in each home.\n\nAbout 40 percent of the students also have a brother or sister at the school, and all come from challenging backgrounds. The change in environment often comes as a shock for new students.\n\n\"When I first went up there, in fifth grade, I hated it. I hated it a lot,\" Ben said. \"I couldn't sleep. I cried myself to sleep every night for a year.\n\n\"It's a great school. It's just hard for a 10-year-old kid to go up there, away from his family and everything he knows. It's like going to college when you're in the fifth grade.\"\n\nTheir father did what he could to ease the transition.\n\n\"Many times when we would drop them off, on the way up there they would get sick,\" Jim said. \"They didn't want to be there. It was tough. There were a lot of tears.\n\n\"I was up there many times, as many times as I could,\" Jim added. \"And as many times as they could come home, they were home.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the family continued to deal with Carla's illness.\n\n\"She was in the hospital all of my life,\" Ben said. \"I don't even remember what my mom sounds like. It was really hard.\"\n\nCarla's brother, Scott Moxley, was a 100 percent match for a stem-cell transplant, and the treatment initially showed promise. But then Carla developed graft-versus-host disease, a complication that occurs when transplanted cells regard the recipient's body as foreign and attack those cells.\n\n\"She was there, but she wasn't there. That's how I felt,\" Ben said. \"I knew she was there, but I couldn't call her, couldn't talk to her. She couldn't physically talk.\n\n\"She lost her vision. I remember seeing her at Christiana Hospital. We walked in there, and she just freaked out because she couldn't see us. She didn't know who my brother and I were, because she couldn't see us. I just started bawling my eyes out, because that's my mom. I didn't want to see her like that.\"\n\nThe family's insurance coverage limited the amount of time Carla could spend at Christiana or St. Francis Hospital. The closest nursing home that could accommodate her needs was in Baltimore.\n\n\"When the kids came home from Hershey, we'd have to drive to Baltimore,\" Jim said. \"That was an all-day thing, go to Baltimore, see their mom for a couple of hours and then drive back. There was never enough time.\"\n\nCarla died on June 16, 2011, at the age of 45. It was Ben's final day of eighth grade.\n\n\"My wife passed away the day before they were coming home for the summer,\" Jim said. \"That was really bad, devastating.\n\n\"I wouldn't wish it on anybody. I wish they could have had their mom, I really do. My daughter [Alex], her mom was my daughter's best friend. She still has trouble with it. My youngest son [Noah] has trouble with it. It was a lot, way too much for kids.\"\n\nCarrying on\n\nAfter Carla's death, Alex and Ben continued to attend the Milton Hershey School.\n\n\"I hated it up until high school. I knew that I had to be there, and that's the only reason I did well,\" Ben said. \"I knew my dad needed me to be up there and be strong and get through everything we were going through.\n\n\"I took the opportunity to the fullest. I did everything for my mom. I got good grades all the time, I was on the honor roll. I played as many sports, stayed out of trouble as much as I could.\"\n\nAlex graduated from Milton Hershey and now attends Wilmington University, with almost all of her college expenses paid for by Hershey's multibillion-dollar trust. The school's graduates are eligible to receive up to $80,000 for college, and Ben was on track to join his sister.\n\nBut following his sophomore year – after leading the school's football team to a 6-4 record as the starting quarterback – Ben wanted a change.\n\nJim relinquished his business in 2007 and went to work for Wohlsen Construction, where he now serves as a superintendent. He remarried in 2012, and he and his new wife, Sandralynn, felt they could provide the stability needed for Ben to return.\n\n\"He wanted to come home,\" Jim said. \"Believe me, I wanted him to come home, too. I brought both of my boys home after I got remarried. Now they live with us.\"\n\nBen decided to attend Newark High as a junior. He met with Butch Simpson, the school's longtime football coach.\n\n\"He's a very open guy with me,\" Simpson said. \"He has sat with me and told me the story, and it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nThe Yellowjackets were coming off of a 1-9 season. They needed some help at quarterback.\n\n\"I saw film of him when he was a sophomore, and I thought he was gifted,\" Simpson said. \"I'm thinking 'The football gods have been good to me, they just brought me Ben Campbell.'\"\n\nBut even with his talent, Ben was going to have to fit in. He was the new guy.\n\n\"I didn't know anybody on the team. I didn't know anybody in the school,\" he said. \"I really didn't know anybody around here.\"\n\nSimpson was amazed that after just three weeks, Ben's teammates elected him junior captain. But the Yellowjackets struggled again, finishing 3-7.\n\n\"There was a transition. There was a lot for him to adjust to,\" Simpson said. \"Him moving down here and moving out of that environment, then into a new, challenging environment. It would have weighed on anybody.\"\n\nTurning the corner\n\nBen briefly considered going back to Milton Hershey for his senior year. But now he is comfortable – at home, at school, and most of all, on the football field.\n\n\"I'm building friendships that are going to last forever,\" he said. \"I love the people I play with. They're like my brothers. I'd do anything for them, and I know they'd do anything for me.\"\n\nHe spent much of the summer working with Damon Daniels, a local personal trainer who focuses on quarterbacks, receivers and defensive backs.\n\n\"I want to be great. I don't want to be average,\" Ben said. \"I put in so much work over the offseason for this year. I want to go far.\"\n\nBen's senior season is off to a great start. In two games, the quarterback has passed for 449 yards and seven touchdowns, and rushed for 284 yards and two more scores. The Yellowjackets are 2-0 going into Friday's 7 p.m. kickoff at Glasgow.\n\n\"I just want to make my family proud,\" he said. \"I want to make my mom proud. I pray every night that she looks down on me. I do my best in every game. I play for her.\"\n\nNewark opened the season with a 40-25 win over Oxford (Pennsylvania) on Sept. 5. Ben threw for 234 yards and five touchdowns, and he spread them around – two to Peter Suski, one each to Jim Bond, Brendan Sherman and Joe Burton.\n\n\"Last year, he was a little iffy on the short patterns and his accuracy,\" Suski said. \"But he's worked so hard this summer, and it's showing. You can tell how much he has improved.\"\n\n\"He's making good decisions,\" Simpson said. \"He's finding the open receiver, and he's throwing an absolutely accurate pass to those open receivers. He's a different quarterback this year.\"\n\nBen followed with 215 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 35-21 victory over Charter of Wilmington last week. He was just as effective with his feet, rushing for 138 yards against Oxford and 146 yards against Charter. He ran for a touchdown in both games.\n\n\"I love running the ball,\" he said. \"My coaches yell at me all the time to get on the ground, but I just love hitting. I love contact, I love being physical. I use football to release anger.\"\n\nSimpson described him as \"a tough guy, not just one of those quarterback guys,\" and said Ben could be one of Newark's best defensive players. But the Yellowjackets can't risk an injury to someone already responsible for nine touchdowns, so he plays only offense.\n\nBen's primary goal is to continue his football career in college. So far, he has received recruiting interest from only Morgan State. But Simpson, who has seen dozens of Newark players earn scholarships from every level of college, has no doubt that will change soon. Ben's size (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) and ability to both run and throw will take him to the next level.\n\n\"He'll play college football, and he'll be a very good college quarterback,\" Simpson said. \"Someone will be blessed to have him.\"\n\nJim Campbell is amazed when he sees what his son has become as a high school senior.\n\n\"Ben is just the strongest kid,\" Jim said. \"He keeps a lot to himself, but he's very driven. He loves football. It's like his release. He's such a strong-hearted person, and he just won't give up.\"\n\nJim didn't play football at McKean, opting for the pole vault, soccer and diving instead. But he has traveled to all of Ben's games – even when he was in Hershey - and loves watching his son play.\n\n\"I haven't been the greatest father in the world,\" Jim said. \"But I've always been there, pushed and supported, put a roof over their heads and food on the table and paid the medical bills. I do what I can.\"\n\nBen knows his father had to make some very difficult decisions.\n\n\"He's a great dad,\" Ben said. \"He did everything that he could to provide for us.\"\n\nAfter the Charter game, when Ben rallied Newark from an early 13-0 deficit, Simpson said, \"Ben's a special player right now, and he's carrying us.\" Charter coach Larry Cylc said, \"Newark's back. There's no question about that.\"\n\nThe Yellowjackets have the potential to field their best team since 2011, when they went 11-1 and reached the DIAA Division I championship game. Much of their success will come from the arm and feet of Ben Campbell.\n\n\"He deserves success,\" Simpson said. \"I admire how he has overcome and gotten through issues in his personal life.\"\n\nThe biggest compliment comes from his father.\n\n\"He's a great kid. He's doing really well,\" Jim Campbell said. \"I'm proud of him. His mom would be proud of him.\"\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

We hang out all the time. We had a house that we shared. They’re cool. They go everywhere together. They do everything together.\n\nGIVING BACK:3 NFL stars from Delaware conduct a football clinic for area youths\n\nFIRST STATE NFL STARS:Delaware's pipeline to the NFL: How these 5 high school stars ushered in a golden era\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n\"It’s cool to see their friendship has taken off the past couple of years because obviously I was friends with Avonte first (both attended the University of Pittsburgh), and then I met Dallas going into my rookie year. Since they were on the Eagles together, they’ve been really close.\"\n\nAnd if you can picture three multimillionaires in their mid-20s sharing a large house in Newport Beach, California ... \"without driving each other crazy,\" as the introduction to \"The Odd Couple\" TV show begins, then you can certainly imagine the hijinks that ensued with the three of them living together.\n\nBut first, here's how the three became besties.\n\nO'Neill went from Salesianum to Pitt and became close friends with Maddox, who grew up in Detroit. Then when O'Neill was preparing for the 2018 draft, he met Goedert who was part of the same agency. The two trained together for the draft and quickly became close friends.\n\nOf the three, Goedert was picked first when he was taken in the second round, No. 49 overall by the Eagles. O'Neill went 13 picks later to the Vikings, and Maddox was taken in the fourth round by the Eagles.\n\nIt was O'Neill who introduced the two when he saw they were both drafted by the Eagles.\n\nThat's when Goedert and Maddox began their friendship, moving in together in South Philly, then moving to South Jersey where they lived in a large house. They shared that house up until this summer, often using their cavernous house for Nerf-gun battles.\n\nRecently, Goedert revealed that he and Maddox are each moving into new houses during this six-week break that the Eagles are on until training camp starts in late July.\n\n\"It’s going to be a little bit of a change,\" Goedert said. \"The toughest part is probably going to be that each of us is going to have to drive to work. It’s not going to be where one of us is going to be able to sleep on the way.\n\n\"We got places that are pretty close together, so hopefully we see each other from time to time.\"\n\nWith gas prices soaring, why not a carpool to the NovaCare Complex once training camp starts in late July?\n\nEither way, this hasn't changed their friendship, as Maddox put it.\n\n\"We’re starting to get older now, time to settle down with loved ones, things like that,\" Maddox said with a laugh last season. \"So I’ll let Dallas free, finally.\"\n\nOf course, they also have the financial means to afford their own places. That holds true for O'Neill as well.\n\nBoth Goedert and Maddox signed contract extensions during the 2021 season. Goedert's is worth as much as $57 million over four years with $35 million guaranteed. Maddox's is worth as much as $22.5 million over three years.\n\nIt's also likely that the three upgraded their living arrangements when they were in California after O'Neill, who was selected to the Pro Bowl last season, signed a five-year extension worth as much as $92.5 million last fall.\n\nO'Neill said he'll have opportunities to see his best friends before training camp. That's because he said he'll be with his family in Delaware for a few weeks before heading to Minneapolis to get ready for camp.\n\n\"Whenever I’m (in Delaware), I get to see the both of them, which is really cool,\" O'Neill said. \"But I live full time in Minneapolis now, so I'll be going there. The best time to be in Minneapolis is the summer, so I’ve got to make it count.\"\n\nBut they'll keep in touch while they're apart.\n\nThat was apparent in early May when the schedule came out, and O'Neill saw the Week 2 matchup between the Vikings and Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, scheduled for Sept. 19, a Monday night.\n\n\"We’ve been talking smack ever since,\" O'Neill said. \"I think we have a ton of talent and a great new coaching staff that has been unbelievable. And being from Wilmington, I’m excited to come to Philly Week 2.\"\n\nFor now, O'Neill has the bragging rights. When the three were rookies in 2018, the Vikings beat the Eagles, who were coming off their Super Bowl season, 23-21 at the Linc. The next season, in Minnesota, the Vikings won again, 38-20.\n\nNo doubt, Goedert and Maddox mentioned the NFC Championship game in January 2018, three months before they were all drafted, when the Eagles beat the Vikings 38-7. The Eagles then went on to win the first Super Bowl in team history.\n\nBut O'Neill was quick with a retort: \"That was before I was there.\"\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Travis Laster wrote on Friday that all three counties calculate tax bills with property values that are so outdated some taxpayers get an unfair discount while others pay taxes on a larger share of their property’s actual worth.\n\nThose inequities violate the state constitutional requirement that property owners be taxed equally, Laster said in a 149-page ruling in Delaware's Court of Chancery.\n\n\"By continuing to use the decades-old valuations when preparing their assessment rolls, the counties treat owners of similar properties differently,\" Laster wrote.\n\nThe ruling could eventually affect every property that is taxed in Delaware, and begins a debate on how to make the state's property tax system fair in the eyes of the courts.\n\nLaster's opinion asks attorneys for both sides to submit a schedule in 45 days to govern that discussion, which is likely to be litigated in court before any residents see changes to their tax bills\n\nLaster's full, 149-page ruling can be read at the end of this story.\n\nThe plaintiffs, a group of education funding activists and Wilmington officials, want property values to be reassessed — a potentially costly, months-long process in which assessors visit each property and update its value in current housing market conditions.\n\nIt could lead to property tax increases for those who are currently underpaying relative to the market value of the property, decreases for those who are overpaying and some tax bills changing very little.\n\nUSE OUR CALCULATOR: Are you a winner or loser in property tax system?\n\nChanges in the tax rolls would likely be tempered by state laws, which curb the amount of additional revenue that counties, cities and school districts can bring in after a reassessment.\n\nDelaware's three counties assess property values, which are generally applied to county, city and school tax rates to calculate tax bills. Those taxes are a third of the state public schools' revenue.\n\nLaster wrote that disruption in the system could affect government services — as well as those who might have to pay more — making the coming debate in the lawsuit's remedy phase important.\n\n\"The effects of the pandemic likely will introduce additional and significant considerations for the remedial calculus, particularly regarding the timing of a remedy,\" Laster wrote.\n\nPenalties for not paying property taxes are currently suspended because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt is unclear now if the defendants will appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nSpokesmen for New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer and Sussex County Administrator Todd Lawson, whose counties are defendants in the suit, declined comment on the ruling shortly after it was issued.\n\nKent County Administrator Michael Petit de Mange did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki, whose administration joined the plaintiffs challenging the current system, said he did so with \"confidence\" the court will \"right this wrong\" of \"some residents paying two and three times their fair tax amount.\"\n\n\"I could not be any more pleased with Vice Chancellor Laster's decision,\" Purzycki said in a written statement.\n\nPlaintiffs challenged the taxing system as part of ongoing litigation claiming Delaware’s school funding system fails to provide enough resources for disadvantaged students.\n\n\"Fixing the counties’ inequitable and outdated system of property tax assessment is an important step toward ensuring that education funding in Delaware is fair and adequate,\" said Mike Brickner, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware, in a written statement Friday. The ACLU was one of the plaintiffs.\n\nIf regular reassessments occurred, the plaintiffs have said, school districts could take a relatively small increase in revenue. Instead, districts resort to often doomed referendums to keep up with rising costs.\n\nOdd comparisons\n\nThe system creates tax disparities among residential property owners.\n\nThe News Journal wrote about fairness questions in Delaware’s property tax assessment systems last year, detailing the problem, why it has festered, and giving readers a way to calculate where they stand relative to their fellow taxpayer.\n\nTHE FULL STORY: Delaware's unequal, outdated property tax system on trial\n\nThe problems that Laster ruled make the current system unconstitutional stem from property values being assessed at a projection of what they would have been worth the last time each county reassessed all of its properties. That assessment value is then paired with the school district or county's tax rate.\n\nThe last general reassessment occurred in 1983 in New Castle County, 1987 in Kent County and 1974 in Sussex County. Delaware is one of about a half-dozen states that does not require regular property reassessments.\n\nTax assessors currently dial back a property’s value to a projection of what it would have been worth in those “base” years.\n\nSince then, some areas and types of properties have grown rapidly in value. Others have not, or decreased. This creates disparities between the value residents are taxed on, and the actual market value of their property.\n\nA QUICK TOUR: Examples of Delaware's unequal property tax system\n\nThe end result can lead to odd comparisons where one person is paying a tax bill that is based on the full value of their property and others, often those who own more expensive properties, are being taxed based on single-digit percentages of their home’s actual value.\n\nTake three homes within walking distance in Wilmington.\n\nThe first, a three-story stone colonial in the city's upscale Highlands neighborhood, sold for $1.25 million in 2016. Its assessed value is $205,000 – about 16% of its market value – and its owner was billed $9,732 in city, county and school taxes in 2018.\n\nNow go down the banks of the Brandywine to the Carriage House Row townhomes.\n\nOne townhome there was purchased for $600,000 in 2015. It is assessed at $281,600 – nearly 50% of its market value – and the owners owed $13,335 in city, county and school taxes last year.\n\nSo, despite the Carriage House Row townhome being worth half that of the million-dollar colonial, the townhome has a much higher tax bill.\n\nNow go back up the hill to the Dorset condominium building along Pennsylvania Avenue. A unit in that building sold for $98,500 months before the stone colonial changed hands. That condo unit is assessed at $96,400, about 100% of its market value.\n\nThe Highlands mansion has double the taxes than the condo, but it is worth approximately 12 times more on the open market.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in trial last July, presented a study from a tax assessment expert showing property tax values to be a fraction of market value in all three Delaware counties. The proportion of one's tax assessment value compared it its actual, market value can vary so greatly from property to property, it's considered unacceptable by professional assessing standards, the expert argued.\n\n'Time-machine approach'\n\nThe counties’ assessment methods have been largely untouched over the decades, even as academics, education funding advocates and News Journal reports warned the gulf would only grow between actual property values and the ones used for taxes.\n\nWHAT'S TAKEN SO LONG? Delaware's politicians haven't acted\n\nThe counties have defended their methods as fair by saying all property owners’ values are dialed back to the same “base” year. In his ruling, Laster described that argument as a \"cloak\" to \"conceal\" inequity baked into the system.\n\nIt also creates a legally-difficult situation for tax assessors and those tasked with hearing tax appeals.\n\nIn the past three years, Delaware courts have allowed modern factors to trickle into how select properties – mainly Wilmington office buildings – are assessed. New Castle County officials now must consider how building depreciation and office vacancy rates affect commercial property values, allowing owners of struggling city buildings to lower their tax burdens.\n\nLOST REVENUE: With latest ruling, city may see largest loss yet from tax appeal\n\nA city attorney recently described these new methods in a letter to county officials as a “time-machine approach” that attempts to factor in present-day building conditions \"but in economic circumstances and in a market that existed in 1983.”\n\nCounty officials themselves have struggled to apply that formula to the individual property assessments they oversee.\n\nWilmington officials, who use the county’s values to impose city taxes, said the issue has caused havoc in the city’s tax base, prompting them to join the property tax fairness lawsuit.\n\n'DEATH BY 1,000 TAX APPEALS':Why Wilmington is fighting for reassessment\n\nMeyer and New Castle County's law department fought the lawsuit, primarily by poking holes in the tax assessment expert’s methods and arguing the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to sue.\n\nLaster ruled the plaintiffs are both harmed by the lack of reassessment and have legal footing to challenge it in Chancery Court.\n\n\"The fact that school districts are forced to conduct referendums is itself part of the harm,\" he wrote.\n\nOne such referendum is pending before voters in the Christina School District, which has approved nearly $10 million in cuts should the tax hikes fail.\n\nMeyer told The News Journal last year he agreed a reassessment was needed, but not at the order of a judge. He has said he was sympathetic to those that may see tax bill increases.\n\nConcerns over those impacts will potentially be part of the discussion in court.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

The survey took place Sept. 11-19, and the margin of error is plus or minus 5.76 percentage points.\n\nHarris leads Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump with a 55.6% share of the vote. Trump received 35.6% of the votes in the survey, and 3.3% went for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. Additionally, 4.4% of respondents said they were unsure.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBlunt Rochester, a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate and who is the current U.S. House representative, got 52.1% of the votes in the survey while Republican opponent Eric Hansen gained 31.6% of the vote. Independent Mike Katz won 6.1% of the vote.\n\nMcBride, the current state senator representing parts of Brandywine Hundred and Bellefonte, received 52% of the votes over Republican John Whalen, who had 30.9% of the votes for U.S. representative among those surveyed, while 17% of respondents said they were unsure in the race.\n\nNew Castle County Executive and Democratic governor candidate Matt Meyer leads Republican Mike Ramone, a state representative for Pike Creek and the House minority leader, with a 51% share of the votes compared with 32.3%. Nearly 16.7% of respondents didn't vote for either in the poll.\n\nIndependents who participated in the poll broke heavily for most Democrats: 41.2% went with Harris, 41.2% went for Blunt Rochester, 35.7% supported McBride. Independents went for Meyer and Ramone equally, with each candidate sitting at 36.5%.\n\nThere is a notable gap between male and female voters. Women supported every Democratic candidate more than men. The poll showed 65% of women supporting Harris.\n\nDelaware is a true blue state, so Democrats being heavy favorites in the First State isn't a surprise. But, women and independents backing Democrats at such a strong rate was notable to Dannagal Young, director of UD's Center for Political Communication and a professor.\n\nYoung said while the economy is the main concern for the majority of voters, abortion and reproductive rights were a very close second, especially with women. She said their support for Harris also extends beyond identity politics.\n\n\"Abortion and reproductive rights are really important to female voters, and those women are more likely than men to hold more pro-choice attitudes on abortion,\" Young said. \"It's possible that some of what's going on is that we're in this sort of post-Roe world where that is an issue of increasing relevance to female voters.\"\n\nRespondents rated the economy as the most important issue in the election. Abortion was the second-most important issue, and immigration was the third-most important. The economy was at least a \"very important issue\" for 88% of the respondents.\n\nYoung said the results of the poll are similar to the party registration of voters in the state. She said people are voting on party lines. She also said this poll is a snapshot of the current situation and shows who is eligible for debates as the campaigns hit their final stretch. If a candidate has 10% or more of the votes, then they qualify for debates.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nShane Brennan covers New Castle County with a focus on Newark and surrounding communities.

Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nTrump, 78, reckoned with a new November opponent, one almost 20 years his junior, as some Democratic donors celebrated what one called the \"shot of adrenaline\" Harris could bring to the pivotal race.\n\n\"Now we have to start all over again,\" Trump complained in a Truth Social post Sunday evening.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's updates.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nSenate fundraising arm triples individual donations\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tripled its fundraising record for the cycle in “individual grassroots” donations in a single day on Sunday, a DSCC aide told USA TODAY, though they did not provide exact fundraising numbers.\n\nOther major fundraising arms, including the House’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, are reporting big fundraising hauls the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nDifferent biographies\n\nTo make her case against former President Donald Trump, Harris, in a visit to her new campaign headquarters, sought to highlight their sharp biographical differences.\n\n\"As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse,” said Harris, a former prosecutor. \"Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.”\n\nHarris continued: “As attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.\"\n\nSimilar to Biden’s agenda, Harris vowed to fight for “reproductive freedom” if elected, take action to ban assault weapons and work to pass the John Lewis voting rights bill, among other policies.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for,” Harris said.\n\nShe ended her remarks saying, \"God bless you all and God bless the United States of America -- and Joe Biden.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\n‘I’m watching you, kid,’ Biden tells Harris as she takes over campaign\n\nPresident Joe Biden dropped in by conference call as Vice President Kamala Harris met with her full campaign staff Monday evening for the first time since taking the torch from Biden as the likely Democratic presidential nominee\n\n“I watching you, kid. I’m watching you, kid. I love ya,” Biden, 81, told 59-year-old Harris before she delivered remarks to her campaign staff – which was previously Biden’s campaign staff – at the campaign’s headquarters in Wilmington. Del.\n\nIn remarks that lasted about 20 minutes, Harris praised Biden’s accomplishments as “unmatched in modern history.”\n\n“I know it's been a rollercoaster, and we're all filled with so many mixed emotions about this,” Harris said. “I just have to say: I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden.”\n\nHarris announced that she retained Jen O’Malley Dillon, who served as chair of the Biden campaign, to lead her presidential campaign. She said Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, will remain in her role as well.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris trails Biden in battleground states\n\nLess than a day after President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, the national political landscape has dramatically shifted. While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Biden-Trump race, an InsiderAdvantage poll showed 9% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nGeorgia: An exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMichigan: Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President.\n\nNevada: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Trump-Biden poll that offered a hypothetical matchup against Harris, Trump received 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%\n\nNorth Carolina: There are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump.\n\nPennsylvania: No current polls show Harris-Trump results but before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump.\n\nWisconsin: A Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error.\n\n-Maya Homan\n\nHarris fundraising boom continues, campaign says\n\nThe Harris campaign announced $81 million in donations in the 24 hours since the vice president announced her bid Sunday.\n\nThis number includes money raised through the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\n“The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Kevin Munoz, campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with Democratic lawmakers, major donors had raised concerns about Biden following his debate performance and threatened to withhold their financial support if the president continued toward the nomination.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Republican campaign arm hits Harris\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, released a messaging memo to candidates Monday titled: \"Harris creates strong down-ballot opportunity.\"\n\nThe group argues that the case against Biden − that he was \"mentally unfit to hold office\" − didn't work well against down-ballot Democrats. But Harris \"owns the Biden Administration's baggage,\" they write, making her \"arguably a bigger threat to Democrats' Senate majority than Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe memo details Harris' policy positions and concludes with a section titled \"weird,\" including noting that she laughs at \"inappropriate moments\" and loves Venn diagrams.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris quickly securing votes to become Democratic nominee\n\nA USA TODAY count of delegates shows the 59-year old Harris is more than 40% of the way to the 1,968 delegates needed to become the party's nominee in the first round of voting. There are 3,936 Democratic delegates in total, including former presidents, state and local party leaders, members of Congress and governors.\n\nAfter announcing Sunday afternoon that he no longer sought the nomination, the 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, a move that likely inspired delegates pledged to him to endorse her.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the delegates to pick the nominee, but it remains unclear whether that decision will come by a remote roll call vote early next month as was originally planned by the party or at the Democratic National Convention that's scheduled to run August 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer, Jeffries praise Harris in statement, stop short of endorsing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a joint statement Monday saying that Harris is \"off to a great start\" with her pledge to pursue the nomination \"in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process\" set forth by the DNC.\n\nHarris is \"rapidly\" gaining support from delegates, they said, but stopped short of endorsing her for president themselves.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nVance mocks Harris over debate\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is already taking more than a few shots at Harris, including her debate skills.\n\n\"I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's gonna get to debate her?!\" Vance said during a homecoming speech in Ohio.\n\nHe added: \"I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJeffries, Schumer to meet with Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris \"shortly,\" Jeffries told reporters Monday.\n\nThere's no exact time for that meeting yet, he said, but they're waiting for Schumer to get back into town. The Senate doesn't return until Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm excited for that meeting,\" Jeffries said when asked why he has not yet endorsed Harris for president, as many of his high-profile Democratic colleagues have. Harris \"has excited the community, she's excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she's exciting the country.\"\n\nHe said he and Schumer will have more to say about \"the path forward\" once that meeting is over.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nPelosi backs Harris as the vice president locks up congressional support\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday as she continues to pick up key support from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris,” Pelosi said in a statement. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for president is official, personal and political.”\n\nPelosi played a key role in Biden’s eventual exit from the race. The former speaker served as a sounding board for Democratic lawmakers who were concerned with Biden’s campaign. Her comments on Biden that were hardly enthusiastic endorsements of Biden over the past weeks gave the green light to Democrats to publicly come out against the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' Kamala Harris meme resurfaces after Biden drops out\n\n\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nNo, that isn't a quote from an ancient philosopher or a classic author. It's from Kamala Harris.\n\nAs rumors swirled in recent weeks over Joe Biden's ability to win and complete a second term in office, and following the recent news of him stepping down as the Democratic nominee, Harris (as well as the internet-famous coconut tree) has drawn increased interest in the political sphere as voters look to her as Biden's potential replacement on the Democratic side of the ticket.\n\n− Emily DeLetter\n\nHarris celebrates student athletes at the White House\n\nHarris on Monday spoke at an event celebrating college athletes, her first public appearance since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNCAA Sports Day brings championship teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the White House. Harris also spoke at the event in 2023, which saw more than 1,000 student athletes from nearly 50 teams, according to Harris' remarks.\n\n\"Some of you have represented our nation on the international stage in world cups and world championships, and later this month six of you will represent our nation at the 2024 Olympics in Paris,\" Harris said.\n\n\"When you play, you inspire people across our nation. You remind all of us what can be achieved with hard work and ambition,\" she added.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn first remarks since launching campaign, Kamala Harris pays tribute to Joe Biden, Beau Biden\n\nIn her first public remarks since she became the de facto presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris payed tribute to Joe Biden and his son, Beau Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" Harris said during an NCAA event at the White House.\n\nSaid she first met Joe Biden through his son Beau Biden. Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware while Harris served in the same role in California. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"Back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is,\" Harris said. \"The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president. His honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family. His big heart and his deep love of our country.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFlorida Democrats endorse Harris\n\nSamuel Vilchez, chair of the Orange County Democratic Party in Florida, said in a press call Monday that the Florida Democratic National Committee is endorsing Harris.\n\n“I’m thrilled to announce a unanimous endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris by the Florida Democratic National Committee members, all 15 of us, we have come together and a resounding show of unity and purpose to stand with (the) Vice President.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKamala Harris expected in Delaware Monday afternoon\n\nKamala Harris, who Joe Biden endorsed Sunday after announcing he will no longer seek reelection, is coming to Delaware, according to U.S. Sen. Tom Carper.\n\nHarris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nIt's unclear whether the president will be joining the meeting, as today is Day 5 of COVID isolation after he tested positive Thursday. He's been in Rehoboth Beach battling his latest round of COVID and is expected to address the nation later this week regarding his decision to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n– Isabel Hughes and Esteban Parra\n\nTrump's strategy (so far): Link Harris to Biden\n\nThe Trump campaign is making its opening bid in the new campaign against Harris: Linking her to Biden.\n\n\"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,\" said a memo from Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, describing the vice president as an \"enabler\" for Biden.\n\n\"They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nInside KamalaHQ: How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nKamala Harris was at the vice president’s residence when she got the call from POTUS. President Joe Biden was ending his reelection campaign. And he was endorsing her.\n\nHarris got to work immediately. Still in her Howard University hoodie, workout sweats and sneakers, she whipped up a statement. She placed calls to lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders and union bosses.\n\nInside KamalaHQ:How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\n– Francesca Chambers and Rebecca Morin\n\nHow to pronounce Kamala Harris\n\nDespite decades in the public spotlight, mispronunciations of the vice president's name have not gone away. Several of her political opponents at the Republican National Convention last week called her \"Camel-a,\" \"Kuh-MAHL-a,\" or \"Kuh-MEL-a\" – none of which are correct.\n\nIt's \"COM-mah-la,\" with emphasis on the first syllable. When pronounced correctly, the vice president's name sounds like comma-la.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nUAW thanks Biden, says Trump did nothing as workers were 'left for dead'\n\nThe United Auto Workers issued a statement Sunday reacting to Joe Biden's announcement he would drop his reelection bid. The UAW, behind President Shawn Fain, endorsed Biden in the race, though Fain earlier this month expressed concern about Biden's ability to defeat Donald Trump.\n\n\"Today, the United Auto Workers thanks President Joe Biden for his incredible term of service, and the leadership he has shown in putting country before self, once again, in passing the torch to a new generation,\" the organization based in Detroit, Michigan, said in a statement.\n\n– Detroit Free Press Staff\n\nMike Pence says Biden made right decision for country\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that Biden made the “right decision” for the country in dropping out and thanked him for “putting the interests of our Nation ahead of his own.”\n\n“After the assassination attempt on President Trump and President Biden’s decision to end his campaign, now is a time for leaders in both parties to project calm and send a message of strength and resolve to America’s friends and enemies alike that, whatever the state of our politics, the American people are strong and our American military stands ready to defend our freedom and our vital national interests anywhere in the world,” he added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMinnesota governor backs Harris nomination\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Pritzker endorses Harris\n\nIllinois Gov.

On the rumored list for Harris’ running mate, Moore said he had “lengthy conversations” with both her and Biden Sunday.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHouse Democratic campaign chair endorses Harris\n\nRep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats’ campaign arm, endorsed Harris on Monday morning as scores of top Democratic lawmakers come out in support of the vice president’s campaign.\n\n“To continue to move our nation forward and fulfill the promise of the American dream for everyone, it’s absolutely essential we return the House majority to Democrats and together with President Kamala Harris, we’ll deliver real results for working families and everyday Americans,” Delbene said in a statement.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff?\n\nKamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is an American lawyer. He quit his law practice in 2020 to take on the responsibilities of his new role as second gentleman.\n\nEmhoff and Harris met on a blind date in 2013 after being set up by a friend and married the following year. Harris became “Momala” to his two children, Cole, 26, and Ella, 21, from his first marriage.\n\nEmhoff traveled to key battleground states to campaign for Biden and Harris before the president dropped out of the race. He's also the first Jewish spouse of a vice president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat’s next for the upcoming presidential debate?\n\nJoe Biden’s announcement that he will not seek another term has cast uncertainty on yet another facet of the election year: The upcoming presidential debate.\n\nBack in May, ABC News announced that a debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. ET. But with Biden exiting the race Sunday and endorsing Kamala Harris, the debate schedule may not go on as planned.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday evening, Trump called for Fox News to host the debate, rather than “Fake News ABC.”\n\n“Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,” he wrote.\n\nABC News has not issued an update on the debate schedule.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nAs Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\nPresident Joe Biden's announcement Sunday that he's dropping out and backing Vice President Kamala Harris shakes up the 2024 presidential election in many ways. Perhaps most significantly: Biden's decision could bring millions more voters to the polls, according to a new analysis of the U.S. electorate.\n\nResonate, a consumer data and intelligence company, released exclusively to USA TODAY a new set of 10 distinct voter groups. From its database of 250 million Americans, the 10 groups emerged as company's AI data engine culled and matched thousands of U.S. voter attributes.\n\nEricka McCoy, chief marketing officer for Resonate, predicted Friday that a new Democratic nominee would likely reenergize Gen-Z Zealots, based on insights from these groups. They're the largest of the 10 groups, which include younger, independent voters who advocate for environmental regulations and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nMore:As Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\n– Jim Sergent and Veronica Bravo\n\nUS allies react to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 election race\n\nPraise, acknowledgment it was a difficult decision, maybe a little relief.\n\nThese were some of the reactions from world leaders and officials to Joe Biden's Sunday announcement that he was dropping out of the presidential race. Biden had been under intense pressure to step aside after a poor performance in a June debate against former President Donald Trump that highlighted concerns about his age.\n\nWhile diplomatic protocol tends to limit what American allies will say in public about an active U.S. election, many international officials applauded what Biden had, in their view, done to give new energy to the NATO military alliance, his administration's support for Ukraine and for democratic principles around the world.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nBiden news leaves some voters feeling panicked. If you're stressed, read this.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection. It's a move many voters have called for on social media and around their dinner tables. Yet, the news that Biden was dropping out had many expressing anxiety and nerves, rather than relief.\n\n\"I'm so nervous now,\" one commenter wrote Sunday beneath an @UnderTheDeskNews summary of day's events. \"Very scary times. I have no words. I'm shaking,\" another added.\n\nExperts say the ups and downs of the political world can cause serious stress for people who feel like all they can do is watch helplessly. \"We're in a state of flux, and brains really don't like ambiguity,\" psychotherapist Stephanie Sarkis says. \"They like knowing what to expect, and so this one more thing that's changed.

Wes Moore has yet to publicly throw his support behind Harris, though his name has been floated as a potential VP pick.\n\nMoore, 45, told CBS last month he would not pursue the nomination himself.\n\nMoore became Maryland’s first ever Black governor after being elected in 2022. He's only the third Black person to be elected governor in the country.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Mark Kelly?\n\nArizona’s junior senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly quickly cast his support for Harris as nominee Sunday, fueling speculation that he could be tapped to become her running mate.\n\nKelly, 60, has been in Congress since 2020.

Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot and severely injured at a public event in 2011.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump knocks Biden on Truth Social\n\nWhile the rest of the political world tries to figure out the new realities, Trump took to social media to mock Biden for pulling out of the presidential race.\n\n\"He loses the Debate badly, then panics, and makes mistake after mistake, is told he can’t win, and decide they will pick another candidate, probably Harris,\" Trump said in a series of Truth Social posts. \"They stole the race from Biden after he won it in the primaries - A First!\"\n\nQuestions surrounding Biden's candidacy spiked after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month. He did win Democratic primaries across the country earlier this year.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTop Democratic leaders come out for Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark D-Mass., and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 2 and No. 3 ranking House Democrats, respectively, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.\n\n“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all,” Clark said in a statement.\n\nAguilar said in a statement he will “do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States.”\n\nHarris is quickly locking up support from congressional Democrats for her campaign. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has yet to weigh in though.– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear endorses Harris\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear suggested Monday he would be open to joining the Democratic presidential ticket as Harris’ running mate.\n\n“If somebody calls you on that, what you do is at least listen,” Beshear said during an interview on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nBeshear, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president or vice president, endorsed Harris for president and pledged to do everything he can to support her. Harris “is smart and strong, which will make her a good president,” he said, “but she's also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president. The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn't be clearer.”\n\nBeshear, who is in second term as Kentucky governor, said while it’s flattering to be mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, “the only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nHunter Biden shares emotional post on his father\n\nHunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, gave an emotional tribute to his father after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday.\n\n“For my entire life, I've looked at my dad in awe. How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?” Hunter Biden wrote. “Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.”\n\nHe said that over a lifetime, he’s seen his father “absorb the pain of countless everyday Americans who he's given his personal phone number to, because he wanted them to call him when they were hurting.”\n\n“That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?\n\nGavin Newsom has served as California governor since 2019.\n\nNewsom had been seen as a potential presidential candidate to replace Biden, until the 56-year-old came out in support of Harris Sunday evening.

Joe Manchin says he won’t seek the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nManchin, an independent who left the Democratic Party in May, reportedly had considered registering again as a Democrat and seeking the party’s presidential nomination after Biden announce he won’t run for a second term.\n\nBut Manchin told CBS News on Monday he’s not running. “I’m not going to be a candidate for president…,” he said. “I don’t need that in my life.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nMore:Biden's legacy: Triumphs, heartbreaks and a turbulent finale\n\nIs Kamala Harris eligible to run for president?\n\nYes, Harris is eligible to run for president.\n\nShe fulfills all the requirements needed to run for president, which is that a candidate must be 35 years or older, a natural born U.S. citizen and a resident of the U.S. for 14 years. Harris is 59 years old and she was born in California.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does Harris fare against Trump in the polls?\n\nSome polls show Harris beating Trump by one or two points and others showing her almost neck in neck with the former president.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between July 5 and July 9, found that 49% of registered voters would choose Harris while 47% would choose Trump.\n\nBut an NBC News poll conducted after the debate found Trump leading Harris 47% to 45% among registered voters. Likewise, a Fox News poll conducted between July 7 and July 10 found that 48% of registered voters would choose Harris if the election were held today compared to 49% for Trump.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden Cabinet members praise his leadership\n\nTwo of President Biden’s Cabinet secretaries – Attorney General Merrick Garland and Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of Homeland Secretary – praised his leadership for following the rule of law and protecting the country.\n\nThe praise contrasted with years of Republican attacks against Biden and his administration. Republicans have investigated the president’s son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted of gun charges and who still faces tax charges. Biden didn’t block the prosecutions.\n\nBiden sat for an interview with a special counsel for investigated how classified documents were found at his home and former office. Republicans are fighting for the recording of the interview, despite the Justice Department releasing the transcript.\n\n“From the beginning of his tenure, President Biden has made clear in both word and deed that he stands for the rule of law and for the Justice Department’s critical mission to protect the safety and the civil rights of everyone in our country,” said Garland, who was held in contempt by the House after refusing to release the recording.\n\nRepublicans have also accused the administration of weakening border security, allowing unprecedented waves of undocumented immigrants to enter. But Mayorkas said the country and world are better for Biden’s leadership in protecting the American people.\n\n“When it comes to homeland security, he has taken and directed bold, innovative, and decisive actions to help safeguard our communities, secure our borders, harness the power of artificial intelligence, advance our cybersecurity, eradicate the scourge of fentanyl, and more – all while standing up for our nation’s values,” said Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over border security. “It is a privilege to advance his vision of and for a strong, secure, and prosperous America.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris is frontrunner to become Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democratic Party won’t officially name its presidential nominee until its convention in August, but Harris is the immediate frontrunner.\n\nBiden, who chosen Harris as his vice presidential running mate four years ago, emphatically endorsed her to be the party’s nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nSome other prominent Democrats also endorsed her, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Others, including Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued statements lauding Biden but without explicitly endorsing Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris, however, has several advantages. She has already been vetted for national office during her tenure as Biden’s second-in-command. She has also been a part of Biden’s reelection apparatus for months.\n\n–Karissa Waddick and Michael Collins\n\nDelegates will pick Democratic nominee\n\nBiden endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president, but it’s the party’s 3,896 delegates who will pick their candidate.\n\nDelegates can vote for someone other than Biden even if he won their states’ primaries earlier this year.\n\nThat's possible because of a section in the DNC rules referred to as the \"good conscience\" clause, which states delegates shall \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" The word “sentiment” is where much of the delegates' support will hinge and opens the door to interpretation.\n\nSo delegates could vote for Biden, Harris or someone else. There is no system to automatically transfer the delegates from Biden to Harris.\n\n–Kathryn Palmer and Michael Collins\n\nSecond gentleman Douglas Emhoff: Biden 'a true patriot'\n\nHarris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, has offered his thoughts on Biden’s withdrawal from the race.\n\n“I am deeply grateful to @POTUS and @FLOTUS for their years of friendship and support,” the second gentleman wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “President Biden is a true patriot who leads our nation with honesty, decency, and integrity.

Today is Thursday, August 15th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, Harris leads Trump in a number of battleground states. Plus, why a housing voucher program is failing many poor families. And how much in emergency savings do you really need?\n\n♦\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is ahead or tied with former President Donald Trump in six of seven battleground states, according to a new survey out yesterday. The latest data erases the leads Trump saw before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month. The Cook Political Report survey of seven key swing states found Harris leading Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona, and tied with him in Georgia. Nevada is the only battleground state that Trump still leads, the poll found. Harris's lead in three states is within the margin of error.\n\nThe finding suggests multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election have opened up for Harris. Biden's relative struggles in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina had forced his campaign to increasingly bank on the so-called Blue Wall states; Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump led Biden in six of the seven battleground states and was tied with him in Wisconsin in a survey the same pollsters conducted in May.\n\n♦\n\nColumbia University President Minouche Shafik resigned yesterday. The decision comes after her handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus earlier this year and nationwide debates over the Israel-Hamas war. Shafik, a former official at the World Bank, said that the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary asked her to serve in a high-ranking government role, and she will return to England. Like the now former presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, Shafik's testimony before Congress in April put her in a precarious position. Harvard's Claudine Gay, who stepped down in January, was just six months into the job, and the University of Pennsylvania's Liz Magill was president for just over a year and resigned days after Republicans summoned her and Gay to Washington last December. You can read more about the context around Shafik's resignation with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nA voucher program is supposed to help poor families rent a home, but it often fails. I spoke with USA TODAY reporter Lucy Tompkins to learn more.\n\nLucy, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo, just starting with this, Lucy, what is a Section 8 voucher?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nA Section 8 voucher is sort of a rare golden ticket for affordable housing. It's the largest rental assistance program that the federal government runs. It subsidizes your rent. It's for low-income renters, disabled elderly renters, and it limits how much someone has to pay each month to only 30% of their income. The program is underfunded, so it's a pretty rare thing to get, and it can take many years on a wait-list to get it, but then once it does, it's really a lifeline for several million renters across the country.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So what did this analysis out of NYU reveal about many people across the country who are losing their vouchers before they can use them?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nThe Furman Center at NYU looked at data from thousands of housing authorities across the country, and those are the agencies that give out vouchers. And they found that in 2022, about 45% of people who were awarded vouchers were unable to use them. People get a voucher, they have a window of time where they have to find a home and use it, and if they can't, then it expires and it goes to the next name on the list.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Lucy, all this begs the obvious question to me. Why do authorities hand out more vouchers than they have funding for?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nI found that this success rate that the researchers were looking at, how often people are able to successfully use their vouchers, that's not something that the federal government or housing agencies are really that focused on. What they're incentivized to do is to use all of their funding and make sure every voucher gets used eventually. And there's good reason for that. Any unused funding is considered a wasted opportunity to help a family in need. Housing authorities have learned that a lot of people get vouchers and can't use them, and so to make sure that they're still using all their funding, they'll give out two vouchers for every one slot that the program has, which keeps the utilization of the program high, but makes half the people who are losing their vouchers along the way invisible in this program.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what are some of the other complications to this voucher program?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nIt depends on private landlords to accept voucher holders, and landlords have a lot of complaints about this program. It can be slow. There can be a lot of red tape. There's an inspection required before a tenant can move in to an apartment, and then an inspection every year to make sure the home lives up to the government standards. Sometimes the voucher isn't worth as much money as maybe a landlord could get from a different tenant, especially in places where rents are going up really quickly. Sometimes people with vouchers have evictions on their backgrounds or poor credit or other things that landlords might not find appealing. And then the program also doesn't include funding for things like security deposits, application fees, broker fees, all of these hidden costs of moving into a new apartment.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou spoke with members of several households whose vouchers expired or were revoked. Just how much stress is this voucher limbo putting on them?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nI spoke to a handful of families and people in that situation and they were really devastated, and some of them are stuck in difficult situations; living in a motel room, relying on GoFundMe donations or sleeping outside. It's really difficult.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAre there any parts of the country where this program is working, and what lessons could we take from them?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nThere are places that stood out for positive reasons. One of those places is Boston, which surprised the researchers and surprised me, because Boston is one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. It's competitive and difficult to find housing, but they have found a way around these limitations by pairing every person who gets a voucher with an organization or a service provider who helps them look for housing, find housing, negotiate with landlords, cover some of these extra costs. It helps them move in and then helps support them as they are living in their new home, as much as they need. I think the lesson from there, and Seattle's done some similar things, is that it can really make a big difference when people just have some help using these vouchers.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIs that really where the conversation around solutions is right now? And what's next for this going forward?\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nRight now, HUD, which is the federal agency that oversees this program, is thinking about a lot of different solutions. The navigation help is definitely one of them. They're also trying to find ways to make the program more appealing to landlords. HUD also recently started looking into the idea of direct rental assistance. So instead of giving people a voucher, they're starting to look into maybe just giving tenants funding directly that they could then use to pay for a home. So that kind of cuts the landlord/middleman out and could potentially streamline things. It's unclear if they're going to do that, but they're starting to look into it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Lucy Tompkins, really revealing work on this excellent piece. Thanks for doing it and coming on to discuss.\n\nLucy Tompkins:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe World Health Organization yesterday declared Mpox a global public health emergency. The WHO issued an emergency for Mpox for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in DR Congo that has spread to neighboring countries. Mpox can spread through close contact. The disease is usually mild, but can be fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body. WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said yesterday, WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and plan to release more in the coming days. WHO's response would require an initial $15 million, and the agency plans to appeal to donors for funding.\n\n♦\n\nHow much do you need in emergency savings? More than you might think. I caught up with USA TODAY Personal Finance reporter, Daniel de Visé for more.\n\nDaniel, thanks for hopping on today.\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nIt's a pleasure.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Daniel, this new report touched on emergency savings. So I'll just ask you, how much money should folks actually have in an emergency fund?\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nWell, this intrigued me because Investopedia, which is a great site, very educational, came up with an actual number, and you don't see that very often. They said you need, grab your seats here, $33,100. That's the average household. That is how much they think you need to save for an emergency.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWow. So, how does this recommendation compare then, Daniel, with how much money many Americans actually have saved?\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nWell, I don't have that much. I don't know about you. No, in all seriousness, the typical family, the median family has about $8,000, and that's just a snapshot of probably what was in their combined checking and savings account when some federal survey person called them. You know how if you fill out a FAFSA form and it says, \"How much do you have in your bank accounts?\" And so that could have been purposeful emergency savings or just money people happen to have sloshing around, but that's the average.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo this strikes me as a big number. How does this 33,000 and change dollar figure break down? What are the main estimated expenses?\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nWell, I'm going to scare you even more, because it's actually a pretty conservative number. Advisors would say you should save three to six months worth of expenses, but six months, you need that much if you lose a job. And it covers medical care, which gets a lot more expensive if you're unemployed, because you're getting into COBRA where you're paying the company share of your healthcare. It covers car use, housing, rent and/or mortgage payments, utilities and food. And they have it down to the dollar and cent.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Daniel, as you write in the piece, it appears folks' financial discomfort with savings really is rising. What do you mean here, and what do the numbers say?\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nI tapped another survey, which is an annual survey from Bankrate, which is very good, and it shows a really strikingly rising share of people say they're uncomfortable with how much emergency savings they have. Maybe that's because they're reading these scary articles that we write. It was only 37% in 2018 before the pandemic. And then that quotient rose to 44%, almost half in 2020. And now it's 59% of the people they surveyed this year said, \"I'm not comfortable with how much I have saved for emergencies.\" And that tells me people know they should have more saved than they do have saved.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWow. So just really quickly picking up there in the last few years. So Daniel, I'm sure there are some listeners thinking, \"Maybe I really should put more focus on emergency savings, hearing this podcast.\" What tips do the experts offer up, Daniel, on how to do so?\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nI can offer my own tip. When I started it, here's what I did. Anytime I got any kind of a windfall, like a tax refund check, or in my case, I get occasional book royalty checks, anything that you're not expecting, especially if it's four figures, a thousand bucks or something, drop that right into your emergency savings account. If you do that, it'll build up quicker than you think. And then the more slow and steady way to build it up is just to withdraw a little bit out of every paycheck, little enough that you don't really notice it, maybe a hundred bucks or something. And if you keep doing that automatically every time you get paid, it'll build up to four figures and then five figures before you know it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Good advice as always. Daniel de Visé covers personal finance for USA TODAY. Thank you, Daniel.\n\nDaniel de Visé:\n\nThank you, sir.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErnesto intensified into a Category 1 hurricane yesterday as its swirled north of Puerto Rico.

Biden wasn't the first choice for a lot of young people, but at the end of the day, living in El Paso, because of Trump, there's no hesitation to vote for Joe Biden.\"\n\nQuesada, who is 18 and involved with College Democrats at UTEP, thought it was significant to have Jill Biden in town.\n\n\"I think oftentimes as a blue city in Texas we feel forgotten about … but when you have someone who could potentially be the first lady coming to us when it’s early voting, it proves that our votes do matter,” she said.\n\nDiana Duron, 65, who has volunteered with O'Rourke, sat in the audience in a Biden/Harris shirt and a mask with the word \"vote\" on it. A \"Rosie the Riveter\" and \"Joe\" pen were fashioned to a black ball cap that read \"Beto\" on the front.\n\nShe said issues that matter to her include immigration, climate change and the economy.\n\n\"Because we are way on the corner of Texas, so we get forgotten, especially with funding,\" Duron said.\n\nJoseph Frausto, 18, said he liked that Biden emphasized voter turnout in her speech. His big takeaway was that Texas is in play this year.\n\nEl Paso Pastor Michael Grady, whose daughter was shot in the Aug. 3 shooting and survived, said Biden was correct in saying \"Texas is up for grabs.\"\n\n\"And we're going to be the catalyst here in El Paso,\" Grady said.\n\nBefore the event, people were waiting in line to vote at UTEP's Union Building East Wing.\n\nSylvia Acosta, YWCA El Paso Del Norte director, was in line wearing a black mask with \"vote\" on it and a YWCA T-shirt that read, “eliminating racism, empowering women.”\n\nWhile she declined to say who she was supporting in the election, noting that she works for a nonprofit, she said she had been waiting for the day to come.\n\n“I’ve been waiting 1,434 days to vote since the last election,” she said. “For me, it is about unifying the country. It is about bringing stability. The coronavirus is No. 1.”\n\nAhead of her in line were Eric Suh, 40, and Leon Cruz, 53. The men didn’t know each other, but their two top issues were the same: the pandemic and climate change. Both said they were worried about family and friends suffering from the devastating wildfires in California.\n\nSuh, a former Army soldier and current hydrology student at UTEP, said, “It all boils down to the negligence of our current leader — the pandemic, the wildfires in California.”\n\nCruz is IT director of infrastructure at UTEP.\n\n“The obvious issue is COVID but also climate change,” he said. “I’ll be voting for Joe Biden. He is level-headed, not condescending, and understands that climate change is not going away.”\n\nEleanor Dearman may be reached at 361-244-0047; edearman@elpasotimes.com; @EllyDearman on Twitter.\n\nStaff writers Bret Bloomquist and Lauren Villagran contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/joe-biden/2024/07/21/president-joe-biden-suspends-bid-for-re-election/74292559007/", "title": "President Joe Biden suspends bid for reelection", "text": "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., the 46th president of the United States and highest U.S. political office holder in Delaware history, announced Sunday that he will withdraw his bid for reelection.\n\nThe announcement comes after a growing chorus of calls for the president to step down as he otherwise remained resolute about staying in the race, as well as three weeks after a debate that left allies, donors and Americans unsure about the president's fitness for another term.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a written statement. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nHe quickly threw his endorsement behind Vice President Kamala Harris in a separate announcement shortly after the publication of his full letter on X.\n\nThe winding political ascent of Delaware’s best-known and adopted political son to the Oval Office started with a New Castle County Council win in 1970, a rare Democrat win that year, which took only 10,573 votes to secure.\n\nIn 2020, he earned more than 76 million votes nationwide to defeat Donald Trump to win the presidency, the most ever in American history. He is also the oldest president in the nation's history.\n\nAn influential U.S. senator for 36 years before serving two terms as vice president beside Barack Obama, the country’s first Black president, he twice ran for president and failed before he finally found success against Trump.\n\nIt was fitting that the 2020 election, reshaped by COVID-19, forced the Biden campaign to headquarter in Delaware, nearly making the state an unofficial running mate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's official unveiling was at A.I. du Pont High School in Greenville, Biden met with community and religious leaders in the wake of George Floyd's killing at Wilmington's Bethel AME Church, and the Democratic National Convention abandoned Milwaukee for the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. In between were Wilmington campaign events at The Queen, Delaware Museum of Natural History, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center and the Hotel du Pont.\n\nTen years earlier, Wilmington was also where then-President-elect Obama picked up Biden on a whistle-stop train tour in 2009, en route to the inauguration in Washington.\n\nIt was as vice president alongside Obama when Biden and his oversized personality first found widespread fame outside of the world of politics.\n\nPart of Biden's charm is his Everyman demeanor and not just because of his glad-handing or gift of gab.\n\nIt is also for decisions like having the U.S. Secret Service hang back when he made his rounds at hometown spots like a Capriotti’s sandwich shop, Happy Harry’s pharmacy, Brew HaHa! coffeehouse or University of Delaware football games as vice president, so as not to make them an “embarrassing” event.\n\nBiden (finally) wins the White House\n\nWhen Biden lifted his right hand for the oath of office and said, \"I do solemnly swear,\" he was also marking his sixth decade in politics.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person ever to be sworn in and arguably the most prepared, given his experience.\n\nAfter eight years as Obama’s No. 2 and “the last guy in the room” for every major decision Obama made, he finally shook Obama's long shadow when he became the man to beat Trump.\n\nIt started with him beating out nearly 30 fellow Democratic candidates in the primary, the largest field in decades, after jumping into the race late, declaring in March 2019. In the end, Biden became the presumptive nominee when Sen. Bernie Sanders, the last candidate in the race, suspended his campaign in April 2020.\n\nThe key to Biden's win came in South Carolina where he won nearly 50% of the vote, buoyed by the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn. Even though Biden had won the Iowa caucus, his South Carolina win came after Sanders won both New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\nBy June, Biden passed the threshold of 1,991 delegates to win his party's nomination and made Delaware history as the first Delawarean to be nominated for president.\n\nIn the general election, Biden never trailed Trump, breaking open a double-digit lead nationally down the stretch after Trump's heckling performance in the first debate.\n\nWhile the election was not called on election night due to tight races, Biden passed 270 electoral votes four days later, setting off celebrations nationwide and across Delaware. Backyard fireworks were blasting in the city at the same time as fireworks and a drone-assisted light show lit up the Riverfront as Biden, Harris and their families basked in victory.\n\nBiden's busy term\n\nWhen Biden was sworn in at the U.S. Capitol, it was 14 days after the Jan. 6 insurrection when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the seat of the nation's legislative branch, assaulted police officers and caused lawmakers to flee. While the attack delayed the joint session of Congress to officially certify the election, legislators reconvened that night to finish the job.\n\nBiden's time in office began with a flurry of executive orders, many of which reversed Trump-era orders with the United States rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization.\n\nHe marked the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 by signing his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act into law, the economic stimulus relief package that included direct payments to Americans, as well as an extension of increased unemployment benefits.\n\nFive months later, the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill became law with his signature, and in August 2022, the $750 billion Inflation Reduction Act did the same – a smaller version of Biden's proposed $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act.\n\nEarly in his term, Biden's popularity hit a high of nearly 55%, but the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 hastened his already-slow decline in popularity. Televised scenes showed Afghans running alongside American planes transporting some of the more than 120,000 Americans and Afghans from the Kabul airport to safety as the country quickly fell into Taliban hands.\n\nA suicide bombing at the airport during the \"messy\" withdrawal, as Biden himself called it, killed 13 American service members and about 170 Afghans, sparking criticism from nearly all quarters.\n\nThat's when his approval numbers went underwater, hitting a low of 57% disapproval by July 2022 as the country struggled with high inflation and fuel prices as global supply chain problems due to the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine both hindered U.S. economic recovery.\n\nAmong the highlights of his first term so far was uniting NATO and other nations against Russia's war, the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson following Stephen Breyer's retirement and the successful targeting and killing of Al-Qaida leader and Sept. 11 attack planner Ayman al-Zawahir and ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi in separate strikes.\n\nControversies, dissent\n\nThe final year of Biden's term has been rife with growing dissent across the country, with protests surging in reaction to the president's responses – and nonresponses – to wars overseas.\n\nMany have criticized his support of Israel in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, sparking a wave of protests at college campuses across the country in the spring. Biden announced a cease-fire proposal supported by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June, calling for a truce between Israel and Hamas after nine months of fighting.\n\nThe conflict in Palestine was not the only war to characterize Biden's presidency. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the president and his administration have been staunch supporters of Ukraine, approving billions of dollars in aid. The continued support has drawn criticism from some, who argue that the U.S. should not be investing as much in an outside war.\n\nCritical attention has also come to Biden and his family closer to their home in Delaware, as the president's son Hunter Biden became the first child of a sitting president tried for a crime. A jury of Delawareans determined on June 11 that Hunter Biden committed three felonies when he purchased a gun while actively using drugs. He faces a maximum of 25 years in prison.\n\nWhile the president himself was not involved in the crimes or the trial, many of those opposed to him linked the guilty verdict to him and his administration. Biden said he supported his son in his recovery, but said following the verdict that he would not pardon or commute any sentence given to Hunter Biden.\n\nThroughout his time in the White House, Biden has never been far from home after famously riding Amtrak home from Washington nightly as a U.S. senator. He often vacations at his Henlopen Acres summer house near Rehoboth Beach and comes home often to Greenville where he has been seen taking in a grandchild's game at Sanford School, grabbing a cup of coffee at Brew HaHa! or attending church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine. And whether in Greenville or at the beaches, the Bidens are often seen enjoying their favorite restaurants.\n\nThe temporary traffic backups caused by his motorcade during home state visits have earned a shorthand nickname from many Delawareans, \"Joe jams.\"\n\nHeartbreak in '72\n\nBiden's adult life has been book-ended by family tragedy, starting with the unthinkable in 1972 when his wife of six years, Neilia, and 13-month-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in a car crash that also injured sons Hunter and Beau.\n\nThe accident came a little more than a month after Biden, then 29, scored a major upset against Republican incumbent Sen. J. Caleb Boggs, a statewide officeholder for 26 years. Biden had become the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history.\n\nIt was Dec. 18, 1972 – seven days before Christmas – when the family’s Chevrolet station wagon collided with a tractor-trailer loaded with corncobs at Limestone and Valley roads in Hockessin, not far from where the Hockessin Athletic Club now stands.\n\nHeartbreaking photos by News Journal photographer Fred Comegys from the accident scene showed the devastation.\n\nBiden was interviewing possible staffers in Washington when the crash occurred. Neilia was supposed to join him in the nation’s capital the next day to finalize the purchase of a home there. He immediately flew home on a rented plane and went straight to the hospital.\n\nShe was 30. Biden had celebrated his own 30th birthday a month prior.\n\nWith his sons hospitalized, Biden wasn’t expected at the memorial service for Neilia and little Naomi. But he attended, staring down unspeakable grief as he stood beside the colorful stained-glass windows of St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church on Concord Pike in Talleyville.\n\nIn front of a crowd of 650, he spoke candidly about his “two girls.”\n\nOnly 18 days after the accident, Biden became a U.S. senator.\n\nInstead of the hallowed halls of the U.S. Capitol, Biden placed his left hand on a Bible held by Neilia’s father, Robert Hunter, and raised his right in the chapel of Wilmington Hospital, then called Delaware Division.\n\nIt was after that devastation that Biden decided to remain home in Wilmington and commute daily to Washington on Amtrak, which he continued to do until he joined Obama in D.C. in 2009. That’s when he moved into the official vice-presidential residence at Number One Observatory Circle, still visiting his home state regularly as vice president.\n\nIn his 2008 book, “Promises to Keep,” he detailed the harrowing time, saying he could understand how deep despair could lead some to “just cash it in” and how “suicide wasn’t just an option, but a rational option.”\n\nHe remarried in 1977 to Jill Jacobs, and the couple had one child, Ashley, in 1981.\n\nAnother familial heartbreak\n\nForty-two years after the death of Neilia and Naomi, Delaware would once again grieve alongside Biden when Beau, then 46, succumbed to an aggressive brain tumor.\n\nThe May 2015 death of the Delaware Army National Guard major and former state attorney general who had announced he was going to run to be Delaware’s 74th governor dealt Biden another tragedy to overcome with the world watching.\n\nBiden himself had a pair of cranial aneurysms in 1988, the first of which was near-fatal. He underwent a pair of surgeries that year to repair the damage.\n\nBeau was 46 when he died. And when Biden's win made him the 46th president, noting the coincidence was unavoidable.\n\nBiden rises in the Senate, joins Obama\n\nIn the years between his twin family tragedies, Biden rose to become one of the most influential senators on Capitol Hill, chairing a pair of powerful committees, including the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (2001–2003 and 2007–2009) and the Senate Judiciary Committee (1987–1995).\n\nDuring that time, he pushed for NATO intervention in the Bosnian War in the mid-1990s, which was marked by ethnic cleansing and genocide. The intervention led to a 1995 peace agreement and the prosecution of war crimes.\n\nIn 1994, he also pushed the passage of both the largest crime bill in U.S. history and the $1.6 billion Violence Against Women Act, which he had drafted. In 1997, he helped negotiate a chemical weapons ban.\n\nThose years left Biden on a first-name basis with every American politician of note, along with nearly every world leader, eventually placing the self-described “workhorse, not a show horse” in prime position to be picked by the much more inexperienced Obama.\n\nHe was a foreign policy wonk.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2008, Biden was announced officially as Obama’s running mate as national media camped outside his Greenville home on Barley Mill Road. It was a momentous moment of redemption for the two-time presidential election loser, but also a gleaming moment of pride for Delaware with both state Democrats and Republicans cheering his pick.\n\nBiden’s years of watching Washington from the inside, combined with his blue-collar appeal and sturdy campaign skills, helped Obama make history with Biden’s \"white hair waving like a flag of experience,\" The News Journal wrote at the time.\n\nThe workhorse was in full stride during the campaign against Sen. John McCain and Alaskan Gov. Sarah Palin in the 74 days between his selection and Election Day.\n\nHe led about 90 rallies and fundraisers as he crisscrossed the country stumping everywhere from ice cream stands and burger joints to college gymnasiums and retirement villages, visiting more than 20 states and doing more than 200 media interviews.\n\nDuring his time representing the First State, he never faced a serious threat of being voted out. Not in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002 or 2008. He garnered between 58% to 63% of the vote in each reelection race, a testament to his durable statewide support.\n\nAs Biden campaigned with Obama in 2008, Carol E. Hoffecker, a Delaware historian and author of “Democracy in Delaware,” placed Biden’s position in state history thusly: “No one else except Caesar Rodney, who was there at the founding of the nation, is historically more significant than Joe Biden.”\n\nWith his election as president of the United States, Biden's place atop Delaware history was unofficially enshrined.\n\nVice President Biden as 'last one in the room'\n\nAfter the pair defeated McCain and Palin on Nov. 5, 2008, Obama’s East Coast whistle-stop tour in a 1930 Pullman car en route to the inauguration in Washington pulled into Wilmington Train Station. Two years later, it would be renamed the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station.\n\nThousands swarmed the train on that 19-degree day to send off the state’s most favored son, along with the president-elect.\n\nBiden repeated his well-known line, “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart,” to the cheering crowd.\n\nThree days later, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens was swearing in Biden as 1.8 million people, the largest inauguration crowd in American history, looked on in freezing temperatures.\n\nBiden reveled in his active role in the administration. He oversaw the 2009 economic stimulus and the draw-down of troops in Iraq in 2010 while also negotiating down-to-the-wire fiscal agreements.\n\nSome historians rank Biden among the most active American vice presidents. In 2012, The Atlantic magazine published a story headlined: \"Joe Biden: The Most Influential Vice President in History?\"\n\nBiden’s policy choices have subjected him to criticism. In particular, some hawkish foreign policy leaders criticized what they saw as Biden’s lack of faith in the military. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote Biden had been wrong about “nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”\n\nBiden argued against the now-legendary raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He opposed the military’s call for a surge of new troops in Iraq in 2007, as well as a similar surge in Afghanistan in 2012.\n\nIn Biden’s final days as vice president, Obama shocked the 36-year public servant in the White House’s State Dining Room with the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\"For your faith in your fellow Americans, for your love of country and for your lifetime of service that will endure through the generations, I'd like to ask the military aide to join us on stage,\" Obama said, revealing the surprise honor.\n\nWith swollen eyes, Biden accepted, turning his back to the crowd to regain his composure while wiping away tears: “I don't deserve this, but I know it came from the president's heart.”\n\nA month prior, Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate paid tribute to him on the Senate floor as an emotional Biden looked on from the presiding officer's chair. The tributes were scheduled to last an hour, but it went on for more than two.\n\n\"There's a reason 'Get Joe on the phone' is shorthand for 'time to get serious' in my office,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said.\n\nBiden's stumbles\n\nFor all his accomplishments and honors, Biden has not been without faults and missteps.\n\nHis failed 1988 presidential campaign was torpedoed by plagiarism accusations after he failed to credit a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock at an August Democratic debate at the Iowa State Fair. (He had cited Kinnock in previous speeches.)\n\nThree years later, when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas, he presided over Anita Hill’s testimony detailing her accusations of sexual harassment against the judge.\n\nCritics, especially in later years and even more so in the wake of the #MeToo movement, blamed him for the accusatory and suspicious tone of Hill’s questioning by the panel of 14 male senators. Biden has since said he owed Hill an apology, adding that he believed her.\n\nNearly 30 years later, Hill would support Biden's candidacy against Trump \"notwithstanding all of his limitations in the past, and the mistakes that he made in the past.\"\n\nThat same famously loose mouth, which political opponents used to paint him as a buffoon, also could be used to his advantage.\n\nLike in 2007, at a Democratic debate, when he said Republican presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani only mentions three things in a sentence: “a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"\n\nLike in 1988, he lost the 2008 presidential primary as well. It was won by his future boss, Obama.\n\nAfter 2½ months of campaigning in Iowa to meet a presumably attainable goal of a third or fourth-place finish against a field of six, he was trounced.\n\nBiden finished fifth with less than 1% of the vote behind Obama, former vice presidential candidate John Edwards, Clinton and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.\n\nIt was a devastating blow, and it was written on the faces of his family who stood behind him teary-eyed as he announced the end of his campaign that night.\n\nSeveral months later, at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver after Obama selected him as running mate, he said, \"Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.\"\n\nFrom Scranton to Claymont\n\nBiden was born in 1942 in the industrial Scranton, the first of four children for Jean and Joe Biden, a car dealership manager. Biden was 11 when the family moved 135 miles south to Claymont, another blue-collar town just over the state line.\n\nAfter living in an apartment in the Brookview neighborhood off Philadelphia Pike, the family moved to a spilt-level home in Brandywine Hundred. It was there that he overcame the stutter that earned him the callous nickname of “Joe Impedimenta,” as he wrote in “Promises to Keep.”\n\n“I was going to beat the stutter. And I went at it the only way I knew how: I worked like hell. Practice, practice, practice. I would memorize long passages of Yeats and Emerson, then stand in front of the mirror in my room on Wilson Road and talk, talk, talk,” wrote Biden, whose encouraging father called him “Champ.”\n\nAfter graduating from Archmere Academy in Claymont, Biden became a true Blue Hen, earning a bachelor’s degree at the University of Delaware, double majoring in history and political science.\n\nAfter meeting Neilia while on spring break in the Bahamas in 1964, the two began dating. She attended Syracuse University and that is where he would go to get his law degree, graduating in 1968, two years after they married in upstate New York.\n\nThe Bidens returned to Delaware, where he worked as a law clerk and public defender before starting his own firm, originally called Biden and Walsh.\n\nBiden the underdog\n\nBut law was not for the 6-foot former UD football halfback.\n\nBy 1969, he was running as a Democrat for a seat on New Castle County Council, winning the seat in a Republican-leaning district. He served for two years before taking on Boggs and the political machine the incumbent had built up over the years as a U.S. representative and two-term Delaware governor.\n\nThe underdog campaign lacked the funds and experience to win, most thought. Managed by Biden’s sister, Valerie, who would later manage more campaigns and grow into a political confidant, he overcame poor early polls and upended Boggs by 3,000 votes.\n\nA month later, the station wagon holding his family was struck and his Senate career officially began in that Wilmington hospital chapel cramped with media with Senate Secretary Frank Valeo traveling to Delaware from Washington for the swearing-in ceremony.\n\nPale, but smiling, he became the first U.S. senator in decades to take the oath of office away from the Senate chamber. But he made clear that his surviving family was his priority – a priority that led him to forgo a presidential run in 2016.\n\n“I make this one promise,” he said to the media after the sterile swearing-in. “If in six months or so, there’s a conflict between me being a good father and a good senator … I promise you I will contact [the governor] … and tell him to get another senator.\n\n“[The boys] can’t get another father.”\n\nIn the end, he pushed onward, using the advice his own father regularly gave him as a child: “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up.”\n\nBiden captured and recaptured the soul of Delaware every time he got back up, especially when he did it five years after Beau's death to finally win the presidency.\n\nThis story includes information and reports from The News Journal archives.

For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON − President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race − already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life − into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before. We’re proud to endorse her for president.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden’s viability as a candidate. She praised him for “prioritizing our nation’s needs” and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n“When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,” Bush said.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream.

But I think our President Joe Biden has made his endorsement clear.

He then criticized Trump for his 34 felony convictions and stances on issues like abortion.\n\n“As we extend our gratitude toward President Biden and reflect on his many accomplishments, we must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House,” Pritzker said. “I will work everyday to ensure that he does not win in November.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nThe 'ultimate statesman'\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus PAC in a statement called Biden the “ultimate statesman” in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“He’s dedicated his entire career, amid great personal sacrifice, in service to the values of democracy; civility, freedom and opportunity… Americans and democracy loving people around the world owe Joe Biden a great debt of gratitude,” the statement says.\n\nThe group added that it joins Biden in “supporting Kamala Harris as our party’s nominee.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden among most significant US presidents, Pete Buttigieg says\n\nTransportation Secretary and former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Sunday lauded Joe Biden as one of the \"most consequential presidents in American history,\" after the president announced he would not seek another term.\n\nButtigieg has popped up as a potential vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris, who is the frontrunner to replace Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee.

Kennedy Jr. said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he commends President Joe Biden for stepping out of the 2024 race.\n\n“His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration — and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles — that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump,” said Kennedy.\n\nHe also called on the Democratic Party to “return to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.”\n\n“Instead of anointing a candidate hand-picked by DNC elites, the party should use neutral polling to identify the candidate who can best beat Donald Trump.

But, “Joe understands better than anyone the stakes in this election — how everything he has fought for throughout his life, and everything that the Democratic Party stands for, will be at risk if we allow Donald Trump back in the White House and give Republicans control of Congress.”\n\nBiden, who served as vice president during the eight years of Obama’s presidency, has never backed down from a fight, Obama said.\n\n“For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,” the former president said. “But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country — and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.”\n\nBiden has been “one of America’s most consequential presidents,” Obama said, and “a patriot of the highest order.\n\nObama’s statement made no mention of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is considered the frontrunner to replace Biden on the ticket.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden adviser Klain bemoans ‘donors and electeds’ who pushed the president\n\nJoe Biden’s former White House chief of staff Ron Klain called on Democrats to unite behind Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee – and took at shot at Biden’s Democratic detractors in doing so.\n\n“Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it’s time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign — our outstanding VP, Kamala Harris!

Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans’ concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n−Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B.

Candidates still in the race", "text": "The 2024 presidential election took a turn on Sunday after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his potential successor atop the ticket for the Democratic Party.\n\nBiden, 81, who faced increased pressure to leave the race after he appeared disoriented at a televised debate with Trump last month, passed the torch to Harris, who soon announced her bid for the party's nomination. Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nHarris is expected to be in Delaware Monday, according to U.S. Sen. Tom Carper. Harris is expected to arrive in New Castle County Monday afternoon, where she will meet with members of the Delaware delegation and go to Biden's campaign headquarters in Wilmington, which is expected to transition to hers as she mounts her presidential campaign.\n\nHere's what to know about who is running for president in the 2024 election.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump formally accepted the Republican Party's nomination on the final day of the Republican National Convention last Thursday in Milwaukee.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump, in his first public remarks since narrowly escaping a would-be assassin's bullet, described in a hushed and somber voice being hit in the ear, ducking for cover, finding his hand drenched with blood and then raising his fist in the air − an effort, he said, to reassure the supporters at the Pennsylvania rally that he was alright.\n\n\"I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God,\" he told the crowd at the Republican National Convention, calling for national unity.\n\nKamala Harris\n\nHarris is now the presumptive favorite to earn the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago.\n\nOn Sunday, after Biden called to tell her he was ending his reelection campaign, Harris whipped up a statement and placed calls to lawmakers, governors, civil rights leaders and union bosses, thanking them for their endorsements and telling them how she planned to earn the presidential nomination.\n\nHarris would ultimately make more than 100 calls over the next 10 hours, speaking to Biden multiple times as she took the reins of the flailing 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nInside KamalaHQ:How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nRobert F.

An encouraging economic report released Friday morning showed stronger-than-expected job growth.\n\nKamala Harris:Liberals saw Harris as a unique champion. Lately, they're disappointed.\n\nWhat Americans want Biden to do:What's the one thing Americans want Biden to do in 2022? We asked them.\n\nThat said, the survey illuminates the size of the hole Democrats need to dig out of as they look toward the elections in one year – on Nov. 8, 2022 – that will determine control of Congress and shape the second two years of Biden's term.\n\nAt the moment, views of the president have soured.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nNearly half of those surveyed, 46%, say Biden has done a worse job as president than they expected, including 16% of those who voted for him. Independents, by 7-1 (44%-6%), say he's done worse, not better, than they expected.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans, 64%, say they don't want Biden to run for a second term in 2024. That includes 28% of Democrats. Opposition to Trump running for another term in 2024 stands at 58%, including 24% of Republicans.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' approval rating is 28% – even worse than Biden's. The poll shows that 51% disapprove of the job she's doing. One in 5, 21%, are undecided.\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly support the infrastructure bill Biden is about to sign, but they are split on the more expensive and further-reaching \"Build Back Better\" act being debated in Congress. Only 1 in 4 say the bill's provisions would help them and their families.\n\nIf the election were today, those surveyed say, they would vote for their Republican congressional candidate over the Democratic one by 46%-38%, an advantage that would bode well for GOP hopes of gaining a majority in the House and the Senate. In a president's first midterm election, his party usually loses ground, and this time the GOP needs to flip just five seats in the House and one in the Senate to claim control.\n\nThat outcome would make it even harder for Biden to pass legislation – already a difficult task in a Democratic-controlled Congress – and open the door to aggressive Republican oversight of his administration.\n\nAnalysis:Paleologos on the Poll: Republican hold notable advantage heading into 2022\n\nThe poll of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nTony Emmi, 62, a retired health care worker from Wilmington, Delaware, who was among those surveyed, voted for Biden for president and derides Trump as \"deceitful\" and \"malicious.\" But the Democrat says Biden hasn't done enough to hold his party to account and get things done.\n\n\"I think this country is moving in a direction that is dangerous,\" Emmi says.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans (66%) say the country has gotten on the wrong track; one in five (20%) say it is headed in the right direction. That's no better than the public's uneasy view during the final weeks of the Trump administration.\n\n'Stuff that's keeping me up at night'\n\nThe infrastructure bill, which passed Friday with some bipartisan support, is backed by 2-1 (61%-32%) among those surveyed. The supporters include a third of Republicans.\n\n\"We're not keeping our infrastructure updated – I don't mean currently updated, I mean since 1930, some of these things have been in place,\" says Kathleen Loyd, 70, a retired juvenile court officer from Piedmont, in southeast Missouri. She dodges potholes when she drives and had to remodel her kitchen after a water main broke.\n\nVirginia, New Jersey elections:How Democrats lost voters, and what it means for 2022\n\nAmericans are closely divided on the \"Build Back Better\" act pressed by congressional Democrats. In the poll, 47% support the $1.85 trillion bill; 44% oppose it. The sweeping measure includes more than $500 billion in climate change and clean energy funding. It would establish pre-K for all 3- and 4-year-olds; extend the child tax credit for one year; expand Medicaid coverage in some states; add hearing coverage to Medicare; and finance affordable housing programs.\n\nThe White House and its allies haven't persuaded most Americans that the measure would benefit them, at least not yet. Those surveyed are a bit more likely to say its provisions would hurt their families rather than help them, 30%-26%. Thirty-one percent say it would not have much effect.\n\nThose findings reflect either a failure of communication by the bill's backers or a disconnect with what voters feel they most need.\n\n\"Is this spending bill out of control? I don't know,\" says Nia Anderson, 45, a stay-at-home mother of three in Minnesota's Twin Cities. She voted for Biden and says he's doing \"fine,\" but \"I'm worried about my kids, and I'm worried about my family.\"\n\nShe was getting ready to take her children, ages 13, 9 and 6, across town to get vaccinated against COVID-19. \"That's the stuff that's keeping me up at night,\" she says.\n\nIn the poll, Congress gets dismal ratings: 12% approve, 75% disapprove. Congressional Democrats have a 29% favorable rating; congressional Republicans 35%.\n\nBiden's job approval rating is dismal, too, at 38% approve, 59% disapprove. He has the lowest rating of any modern president at this point in his term except Trump. Studies have concluded that a president's job approval rating is one of the most powerful factors affecting midterm elections.\n\nMore:Paleologos on the Poll: Republican hold notable advantage heading into 2022\n\nThe party of a president with an approval rating that has dipped below 50% often faces a blowout. In the 2017 midterms, when Trump's approval was at 37%, Republicans lost 41 House seats. In the 1994 midterms, when President Bill Clinton's approval was at 48%, Democrats lost 54.\n\nLast week, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe for governor in a closely watched off-year election in Virginia. In the poll, 48% agree the outcome is a \"telling sign of a Republican sweep in 2022.\" Thirty-nine percent say it was \"one state election and doesn't have national implications.\"\n\nBiden loses ground with voters who backed him 2020\n\nBiden has lost ground with voters since he won last year's election, but Trump hasn't gained it. Over the past year, two-thirds of those surveyed say, their opinion of Trump hasn't changed. Fourteen percent say their view of him has gotten better, 19% say it has gotten worse.\n\nBut Trump commands more loyalty among his core supporters than Biden does.\n\nAmong those who voted for Biden last year, almost 4 in 10, 39%, say they hope he doesn't run for another term; 50% hope he will run. Among those who voted for Trump last year, 1 in 4, 26%, hope he won't run again; 65% hope he will.\n\n\"I thought he did a great job then, and I know he'll do a great job in the future,\" says Lynda Ensenat, 54, a Trump voter and independent insurance adjuster from New Orleans. \"There's a whole lot going wrong in this society right now, and all the Democrat liberals – that's what they're 100% for.\"\n\nShe says Biden has \"been wrong on absolutely everything he's touched.\"\n\nIf the presidential election were today between Biden and Trump, 44% say they would vote for Trump, 40% for Biden, 11% for an unnamed third-party candidate. In the election last year, Biden beat Trump 54%-47%.\n\nLoyd, the retiree from Missouri, used to think of herself as a Democrat but voted for Trump in 2016, then left the presidential ballot blank in 2020. She's so disenchanted with politics that she has stopped watching news coverage as closely as she once did.\n\nShe worries that the president isn't competent but says her Republican congressman panders to the right with a false claim that Biden didn't win the election, and she hates the name-calling that is now commonplace in politics.\n\n\"I don't think anybody is talking to the average American citizen,\" she says.\n\nAfghanistan takes toll on Biden:Americans' harsh judgment on Afghanistan costs Biden's approval, down to 41%, according to USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll\n\nUSA TODAY/Suffolk Poll in January:Americans, braced for violence at the inauguration, see democracy damaged after Trump", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/06/election-results-updates-biden-trump-georgia-pennsylvania-nevada/6183784002/", "title": "Election results updates: Biden, Trump await election results", "text": "We're days past Election Day and USA TODAY'S coverage of the 2020 election continues as states work to finish counting the ballots.\n\nAll eyes on are the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election.

With 264 electoral college votes in hand, any one of the states would provide Biden the 270 votes required to clinch the White House.\n\nBiden leads in Pennsylvania by 28,833 votes, Nevada by 22,657 votes and Georgia by 4,395 votes. Georgia’s secretary of state has already announced a recount.\n\nBiden also leads Arizona, which has been called in his favor, by 29,861 votes. But Trump has hoped to reclaim that state.\n\n“As slow as it goes, it can be numbing,” Biden said.\n\nHis comments echoed a brief statement he gave Thursday at The Queen theater urging patience in waiting for voting to be completed.\n\n“We have to remain calm, patient, as we count all the votes,” Biden said.\n\nMore:Joe Biden stresses every vote must count and asks for 'a little patience'\n\nBiden said he is beginning to act without waiting for the vote to be completed. He and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, met with health officials on Thursday to plan how to deal better with the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden said they also heard about how the recovery is slowing because of the pandemic.\n\n“We’re going to work on day one to put our plan into action,” Biden said. “We don’t have any more time to waste on partisan warfare.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nUnprecedented double runoff: None of Georgia's candidates receive 50% of votes\n\nGeorgia Sen. David Perdue is headed to a runoff election in January against Democrat Jon Ossoff, potentially leaving the Senate majority undecided until January.\n\nAfter counting votes and tallying absentee ballots, Ossoff caught up to Perdue to force a runoff, which is done in the state if no candidate wins 50% of the vote. The Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel also appeared to have chipped away at Perdue’s vote share.\n\nThe state is one of the last remaining hopes for Democrats, who have watched a list of more than a dozen potential pickups dwindle as Republicans defeated challenge after challenge across the country, despite Democrats enjoying strong polls in their favor and spending millions of dollars on key races.\n\nDemocrats need at least two more wins to flip the Senate, three if Biden does not win the White House.\n\nThe last remaining options for Democrats lie in North Carolina, where GOP Sen. Thom Tillis appears to have the lead and Alaska, where Democratic candidate Al Gross hopes to unseat Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan. The other is another January runoff in Georgia between incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nTrump focuses on legal path that experts say may not exist\n\nPresident Donald Trump made clear in a series of tweets Friday that he views the courtroom as his best option to winning reelection even though experts say the lawsuits his campaign has filed so far lack a discernible strategy that could deny Joe Biden a widely expected win.\n\nThe Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in battleground states but many of them involve a small number of votes or have been written off by legal experts, such as Rachael Cobb at Suffolk University, as \"throwing a lot of stuff at the wall.\"\n\n\"I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by,\" Trump tweeted, reiterating a claim that has been widely debunked for days. \"Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!\"\n\nTrump jumped out to an early lead in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and other key states on Election Day because officials counted in-person, day-of votes first -- as they always do. Those votes favored Trump. Officials then turned to the record number of mail ballots that were cast this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those votes favored Biden, and there have been enough of them to give Biden the lead in most of the remaining battlegrounds.\n\nTrump's latest message was more consistent with the sort of grievance-airing he has offered in two appearances at the White House since Tuesday's election. It was a departure from the more measured statement issued by the Trump campaign earlier Friday in which he vowed to \"never give up fighting for you and our nation.\"\n\nThe latest tweets also underscored that Trump sees his path to victory through a legal fight. The president has repeatedly threatened to put the administration of the election before the Supreme Court, but it's not yet clear on what grounds such a case would be made.\n\nThe recount and legal battle of 2000 that cleared the way for George W. Bush to assume the presidency was focused on one state: Florida. Trump faces a much more difficult challenge in pursuing litigation and recounts in multiple states at the same time — assuming those states are called for Biden.\n\nA loss in any of them would mean losing his legal path to the White House.\n\nBut Twitter isn't a courtroom; arguments there don't have to be based in the law.\n\n\"Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President,\" Trump asserted Friday in a tweet. \"I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!\"\n\n— John Fritze\n\nWith ballots still being counted, turnout among Americans eligible to vote is close to breaking a 40-year record, a USA TODAY analysis shows.\n\nThe vote could hit a 120-year high by the time counting is done, according to Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor whose U.S. Elections Project tracks voter participation.\n\nThe current turnout rate is only half a percentage point lower than the highest level since 1980, 61.6%, in 2008.\n\nAs states count remaining ballots, the turnout could eventually reach more than 66%, the U.S. Elections Project said.\n\nThe project estimated that nearly 160 million Americans voted in this election among about 240 million Americans who are eligible to vote. The last time the rate went any higher was 1900, when 73.7% of eligible voters turned out, and the highest ever was 82.6% in 1876.\n\nAs of Friday night, 42 states had already exceeded their 2016’s voter turnout rates, based on USA TODAY examination of Associated Press vote counts and the U.S. Elections project’s estimates of eligible voters. So far, Hawaii has the biggest growth from 2016, at nearly 15 percentage points, followed by Montana, at 10 percentage points, and Vermont, at 9 percentage points.\n\nFor 2020 voter turnout, Minnesota so far has the nation’s highest rate with nearly 80 percent, followed by Wisconsin and Maine, both with 75 percent.\n\n— Dian Zhang and Dan Keemahill\n\nNonwhite voters are driving Biden’s numbers up in Georgia\n\nNonwhite voters are driving former Vice President Joe Biden’s success in Georgia as outstanding ballots are being counted over the past several days.\n\nUSA TODAY looked at the percentage of Democratic votes won in each Georgia county in 2020 versus the nonwhite population of that county. Just under 80% of Biden’s success in Georgia’s 159 counties can be attributed to the nonwhite population in each county.\n\nUSA TODAY used statistical regression to figure out the correlation between Biden’s share of the vote in each county as of Friday morning and the proportion of nonwhite people in the county according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nGeorgia’s statewide population is just under 33% Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, compared to 13% nationwide. Georgia’s largest city, Atlanta, where many of the state’s outstanding mail-in votes have been counted in recent days, is 52% Black.\n\nThe Rev. James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP, said numerous advocacy groups in the state spent about eight years registering voters, educating them on issues, and getting them to the polls. This year, advocacy groups encouraged mail-in voting.\n\n“We’ve pushed our folks to vote by mail and wear masks and socially distance, primarily because we want our people to stay alive while still being able to enfranchise their voices through the ballot process,” Woodall said, pointing to the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on Black Americans.\n\nWhere the election stands:How Biden has a clear path to 270 electoral votes\n\nIn many places, mail-in ballots have been the last votes to be counted due in part to the tedious nature of removing the paper ballots from security envelopes and verifying signatures, and also due to mail delays. The national NAACP is party to the ongoing federal lawsuit that has forced the U.S. Postal Service to ensure timely delivery of mail-in ballots, including in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nAmong the other four states that have remained battlegrounds this week as outstanding ballots are counted — Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania — none showed as strong of a correlation between nonwhite voters and Biden’s success as Georgia’s did.\n\nThe analysis of Pennsylvania’s counties by votes and nonwhite population showed a modest correlation — just over 63%. One of Pennsylvania’s major jurisdictions with outstanding ballots has been Philadelphia County, which is 44% Black.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nTrump calls for 'full transparency' as Biden builds lead\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for \"full transparency\" in the counting of ballots and vowed to \"never give up fighting\" in a statement Friday that came as Democratic nominee Joe Biden edged closer to winning the election.\n\nTrump's latest thoughts on the race, which came in the form of a statement from his campaign, was more subdued than the bombastic remarks he gave at the White House a day earlier in which he leveled a series of baseless accusations about Biden's growing lead in Pennsylvania and other states.\n\n“We believe the American people deserve to have full transparency into all vote counting and election certification, and that this is no longer about any single election,\" Trump said. \"This is about the integrity of our entire election process.\"\n\nTrump has claimed without evidence that the process is faulty and has said incorrectly that mail-in ballots being counted after Election Day are fraudulent. In fact, counties and states almost always count absentee and mail-in ballots after Election Day. This year, the number of those mail ballots was dramatically larger because of the pandemic.\n\nThough Trump's rhetoric was less contentious, he offered no sign he is contemplating a concession.\n\n\"We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee that the American people have confidence in our government,\" he said. \"I will never give up fighting for you and our nation.”\n\n– John Fritze and David Jackson\n\nBiden to make primetime speech Friday\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will give a primetime speech Friday, a campaign aide said, as the former vice president continues to widen his lead in battleground states.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Dr. Jill Biden, and Harris' husband Doug Emhoff will also be in attendance, the aide said.\n\nThe former vice president is currently at 264 electoral votes, and is ahead by a slim margin in battleground states Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. If one of those states gets called in his favor, he will pass the 270 electoral votes to become president.\n\nToo close to call:Georgia will recount votes for president because of a slim margin, official says\n\nHarris will speak before Biden, another aide confirmed. Although it’s not customary for the vice presidential candidate to speak at an address of this sort, Harris would be the first woman and first Black vice president in history. Black voters in Detroit, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Milwaukee have been credited with pushing Biden closer towards the presidency.\n\nDuring remarks Thursday, Biden called for his supporters to remain calm and said his campaign has “no doubt that when the count is finished Sen. Harris and I will be declared the winners.”\n\n“The processes work, the count is being completed, and we'll know very soon,” he said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden expands lead to nearly 2 points in Nevada as state counts mail ballots\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden on Friday added another 8,000 votes to his lead over President Donald Trump in Nevada, inching closer to winning the perennial presidential battleground and securing a spot in the White House.\n\nState election officials on Friday started releasing some 51,000 late-arriving mail-in ballots cast in the contest. Biden won nearly two-thirds of the first batch of around 30,000 votes, extending his lead over Trump to 22,000 ballots – or roughly 2 percent of votes tallied so far.\n\nNevada, with its six electoral votes, is among a handful of states left to be called in the election, along with Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n– James DeHaven\n\nFlipping counties not a likely factor in 2020 presidential race\n\nLarge numbers of counties flipping support from one party to another is not likely to be a major storyline in this year’s election outcome.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump won in part by flipping over 200 counties that supported President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile there are still a handful of key counties yet to be called, as of Friday morning few have shifted from supporting one party to another.\n\nOf the 489 counties that voted for Clinton in 2016, only 23 have, so far, flipped to Trump.\n\nMost of those counties are small. Thirteen are rural, and not a single large metro county flipped to Trump’s favor. The largest was Nassau County on New York’s Long Island, though the margin is small and the count is not yet finalized.\n\nAs poorly as Trump fared flipping counties, Biden did arguably worse. Of the 2,620 counties that supported Trump four years ago, only 60 appear to have thrown their support to the democratic candidate.\n\nSeven are major population centers, including Maricopa County in Arizona, the fourth-most populous county in the country.\n\nThe vote counts in the counties are nowhere close. The counties that Biden appears to have flipped contain nearly 10 million votes. Those won by Trump have just over a million, combined.\n\nThere are 3,141 counties and population is concentrated: Half of the country’s population lives in just 150.\n\n– Matt Wynn\n\nUSPS finds thousands of ballots in PA and NC, races to deliver them\n\nSweeps of U.S. Postal Service mail-processing facilities in Pennsylvania and North Carolina on Thursday found 2,243 undelivered ballots, according to a filing in the U.S. District Court of Washington D.C. early Friday.\n\nIn each case the ballots were delivered to local elections offices, the USPS said in the filing, which is part of an ongoing lawsuit to ensure the delivery of mail-in ballots cast in the general election. Pennsylvania accepts mail-in ballots for up to three days after the election if they’re postmarked by Election Day.\n\nFor this election, North Carolina accepts ballots up to nine days late, as long as they were postmarked on Election Day.\n\nBoth are battleground states where votes continue to be counted in the race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nPostal service officials will be in court again today with District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan at 11 a.m. EDT. Sullivan has ordered the agency to conduct twice-daily sweeps to ensure all outstanding ballots are found and delivered.\n\n- Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nGeorgia will have a presidential recount, state official says\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said Friday morning the state would have a recount because of the slim election margin.\n\n“Right now, Georgia remains too close to call,” he said. “There will be a recount.”\n\nUnder Georgia state law, candidates can request a recount if the margin of victory is less than 0.5%. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden gained a small lead over President Donald Trump early Friday morning. The two candidates are separated by about 1,100 votes.\n\n“We are literally looking at a margin of less than a large high school,” Georgia’s voting system implementation manager Gabriel Sterling said. According to Sterling, the state had about 4,169 votes left to count. A recount could take until the end of the month, he noted. The state pays for recounts in Georgia.\n\nTrump and his allies, without citing evidence, have alleged election fraud, but Sterling rejected the claims.\n\n“We’re not seeing any widespread irregularities,” he said.\n\nA recount in the Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was unlikely given current vote totals, Sterling said. The two Senate candidates are separated by close to 100,000 votes, or about 2 percentage points. The Senate race is instead poised to head to a runoff election in January.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nKudlow: 'I think there will be a peaceful transfer of power'\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his staff say they are not giving up on the election, despite signs Joe Biden could capture enough states to carry the Electoral College. But they are also saying the president will respect a peaceful transfer of power if it comes to that.\n\n\"I think there will be a peaceful transfer of power,\" Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview on CNBC. \"This is the greatest country in the world and we abide by the rule of law as will the president.”\n\nKudlow also said he has spoken with the president and that he \"intends to fight\" and prevail, a message also delivered by the president's reelection campaign.\n\n\"This election is not over,\" said Matt Morgan, the Trump 2020 campaign general counsel.\n\nThe statements come the morning after an angry tirade from Trump in which he falsely accused election officials in contested states of trying to \"steal\" the election from him. There is no evidence that is happening.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Here we go guys!': Biden supporters await news in Delaware\n\nWith Joe Biden on the cusp of a presidential victory Friday morning, his supporters gathered in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. The excitement was palpable in a parking lot outside the Chase Center, where Biden is expected to speak later.\n\nSupporters, who held signs and American flags, exchanged shouts of, “It’s gonna be a great day” and “Here we go, guys!”\n\nThomas Kunish, 40, likened it to a tailgate party. He had arrived in Wilmington from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with his five-year-old son. He perched a stuffed dinosaur holding a Biden-Harris sign on his pickup truck and tossed a football back and forth with his son as they waited.\n\nSome supporters, like Zach Rossetti, 25, have been here for days. After watching Biden vote in their shared hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Election Day, Rossetti drove to Wilmington to await a result. He’s been spending his days at the Chase Center and nights at a hotel — but today felt different. “I am so certain we’re going to have a result today,” he said.\n\nBeverly Relyea, 62, a Wilmington native, hasn’t been keeping vigil in the parking lot. But she said she knew it was time to come after a Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania earlier this morning. “Got my clothes on, put my hat on, and I came,” she said.\n\nFor now, the wait continues.\n\n– Camille Caldera\n\nBiden takes lead in Pennsylvania\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden edged ahead of President Donald Trump in the all-important battleground of Pennsylvania for the first time Friday, adding to a sense of inevitability that the Scranton native would reach the 270 electoral votes he needs to capture the presidency.\n\nBiden leads the president by more than 13,000 votes, a difference of 0.2%.\n\nVotes were still being counted and Biden had not been declared the winner in the Keystone State. Republicans argued that at least some of the outstanding ballots would go for Trump.\n\nBut the momentum and the math increasingly appears to be on Biden’s side.\n\nPennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, was part of the so-called “blue wall” that had carried past Democrats to the White House until 2016. Two other states in the wall, Michigan and Wisconsin, were called for Biden on Wednesday.\n\nTrump got out to an early lead in Pennsylvania Tuesday, but Biden has been closing the gap ever since as a crush of mail-in ballots were counted. Polls had always suggested Democrats were more likely to vote by mail because of concerns about the pandemic. In this case, the polls were right.\n\nAlso, Trump had cast doubts on the security of mail voting for months before the election, a line of attack that had made some Republican operatives in states like Pennsylvania and Florida nervous that it would affect their own voters.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Trump’s margin narrowed even as his campaign aides prematurely declared they had won the state. It closed as Trump incorrectly claimed he had won the election. It got smaller as aides alleged widespread fraud, without citing evidence, and threatened lawsuits.\n\nTrump led Biden in the state by several hundred thousand votes immediately after the election, which was the count of people who turned out in person on Election Day.\n\nTrump won the state by about 44,300 votes in 2016 over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, a 0.72% difference.\n\n– John Fritze and Nicholas Wu\n\nFAA restricts airspace over Biden’s home\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration placed restrictions on airspace over Joe Biden’s home, affording the Democratic nominee the same security restriction provided to other political VIPs such as the president and vice president.\n\nWhile the temporary flight restrictions (TFR) appeared to be activated on Friday, it was not clear when they were announced. The FAA referred questions about the restrictions, which limit flights through the area, to the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nThe TFRs, which will be in place over Wilmington, Delaware, for several days, are commonly imposed when the president or vice president is traveling out of Washington for an event, such as to a rally.\n\nLike other candidates, Biden received Secret Service protection earlier this year. His security detail was set to grow in coming days as the Secret Service prepared for the possibility he wins, The Washington Post and CNN reported this week.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden takes the lead from Trump in Georgia\n\nDemocratic candidate Joe Biden officially took the lead in Georgia Friday, after a new round of results were released.\n\nAs of 4:30 a.m. EST, the former Vice President leads by 917 votes with thousands of ballots remaining to be counted.\n\nBiden caught then passed Trump in the traditionally red state due to an onslaught of mail-in ballots from Democratic-leaning counties. Democratic voters utilized early voting and mail-in ballots across the nation more so than Republicans.\n\nGeorgia is critical to Trump’s reelection, but not necessary to Biden’s path to the White House.\n\nThe state has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, when Bill Clinton won the state by 13,000 votes. Trump beat Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Georgia in 2016 by 211,141 votes, or 50.4% to 45.3%.\n\nClayton County, which was represented by the late Rep. John Lewis, was one of the counties that put Biden over the top in Georgia.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nTrump draws closer to Biden in Arizona ballot count\n\nPresident Donald Trump inched closer to former Vice President Joe Biden in Arizona as results from Thursday's ballot counting were released, but he fell off the pace needed to win the state's 11 electoral votes.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Biden on Wednesday, but the Trump campaign hopes votes still to be counted will change the outcome.\n\nStatewide, Trump chipped away 22,000 votes from Biden's lead, closing the gap to 46,667 votes as of Thursday night. But unless the next batches of votes show Trump with a higher percentage than what the president managed Thursday, he will fall short.\n\nThe Arizona Republic estimates there were 300,000 votes left to count statewide as of Thursday evening, with 218,000 of those votes left to count in Maricopa County.\n\n– Rob O'Dell, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Caitlin McGlade (Arizona Republic)\n\nCould today be the day?\n\nNo states were called Thursday in the presidential election, but Friday may well be the day the election ends when most of the remaining battleground states hit the home stretch in counting and even call some races.\n\nBiden begins the day with 264 Electoral College votes to Trump's 214. That means Biden needs to win one of the four remaining battleground states: Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia. All of them are expected to make significant progress or finish counting outright.\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic nominee Joe Biden took the lead Friday morning as vote-counting continues.\n\nMore:Georgia solidifies its swing-state status thanks, in part, to Stacey Abrams\n\nIn Pennsylvania, major counties such as Philadelphia have been counting through the night, and the president's lead there is also narrowing.\n\nBiden gained ground due to an onslaught of mail-in ballots from Democratic-leaning counties.\n\nMore:We fact-checked President Trump's speech about the election. Here's what we found.\n\nMore:Election protests across US: Trump, Biden supporters gather in Philadelphia; Facebook shuts down 'Stop the Steal' group; Portland on edge\n\nArizona and Nevada finishing up\n\nVoters can also expect updated results Thursday morning from Arizona, where Trump has been narrowing Biden's lead, and Nevada, where Biden leads by around 11,500 votes.\n\nAn estimated 190,150 ballots remained uncounted in Nevada on Thursday, according to the Reno Gazette Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nState elections officials announced nearly two-thirds of that total were either returned by mail or dropped off in-person on Election Day. The remaining 66,596 votes were cast by same-day registrants either in-person on Tuesday or during the state's two-week early voting period.\n\nSome 90% of the outstanding ballots are in Clark County, a southern Nevada stronghold for Democrats where the party built up a daunting 89,000-voter edge over Republicans in early voting turnout.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/06"}]}
