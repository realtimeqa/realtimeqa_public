Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters\n\nA police curfew that was earlier imposed in several police divisions in the Western Province of Sri Lanka was lifted on Saturday. Several politicians and the Bar Association in Sri Lanka referred to the curfew as being “illegal,” saying there had been no instances of violence to justify imposing the measure.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, the Bar Association called on Rajapaksa to “consider whether he can continue” in light of the protesters storming the President’s House. It also urged the government and MPs “to immediately ensure that political stability of the nation is secured forthwith. There should be no delay in ensuring such transition.”\n\nTens of thousands have taken to the streets in recent months, calling for the country’s leaders to resign over accusations of economic mismanagement.\n\nIn several major cities, including Colombo, hundreds are forced to queue for hours to buy fuel, sometimes clashing with police and the military as they wait.\n\nOn Saturday, crowds of anti-government demonstrators protested outside a stadium in Sri Lanka’s southern coastal city of Galle during the country’s Test cricket match against Australia, the world’s No. 1 ranked team, though the protests didn’t stop play.\n\nLocal media showed videos of large crowds protesting against the government outside the Galle International Stadium, which is about a two-hour drive from Colombo. They waved Sri Lankan flags and carried banners with signs reading “Power to the people” and “GotaGoHome” – demanding Rajapaksa step down.\n\nMany protesters then defied a police ban to march to the top of a fort overlooking the stadium grounds, where they continued to hold banners and chant their demands.\n\nMeanwhile, images from Colombo painted a chaotic scene, with pictures showing demonstrators running from tear gas, and clashing with police in body armor.\n\nSchools have been suspended and fuel has been limited to essential services.

Adnan Abidi/Reuters\n\nThe grounds have now been taken over by protesters who are gathering in celebration, following standoffs with armed police at the gates of the property. At least 30 people have sustained injuries and been admitted to the hospital, according to the Colombo National Hospital.\n\nA nurse at the hospital told CNN that many people were brought in due to tear gas inhalation, while others had cuts and bruises likely received when trying to jump over fences. The nurse did not confirm any gunshot injuries.\n\nAs per Sri Lanka’s constitution, Rajapaksa’s resignation would only be considered official once the speaker of the parliament receives a letter stating it.\n\nSpeaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that Rajapaksa had reassured him of his resignation over the phone on Wednesday, but that he is still waiting for the official document confirming it.\n\nAt the colonial-era prime minister’s office, people could be seen on the balcony, lighting firecrackers and waving the Sri Lankan flag, according to witnesses.\n\nDemonstrators outside demanded that neither the President nor the Prime Minister “be spared.”\n\nThis follows months of escalating anger over the economic crisis, with Rajapaksa accused of high-level corruption and mismanagement that ultimately bankrupted the country.\n\nAs demonstrators took to the streets, acting President Wickremesinghe appointed a committee of senior armed forces commanders headed by the Chief of Defense Staff Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva to “restore law and order” in the nation, a high-ranking military official told CNN Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe declared a state of emergency across Sri Lanka and a curfew on Wednesday only to later cancel both orders, according to the prime minister’s office.\n\nIn Colombo, a handful of protesters also entered the premises of state broadcaster Sri Lanka Rupavahini on Wednesday, negotiating a “deal” with broadcast staff to not give airtime to politicians such as Wickremesinghe. The broadcaster instead played history and culture programs.\n\nSri Lanka army soldiers patrol near the official residence of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa three days after it was stormed by anti government protesters in Colombo.

A spokesperson for Nasheed did not confirm or deny the intervention.\n\nSri Lanka’s Air Force on Wednesday confirmed Rajapaksa’s departure, saying in a statement: “Pursuant to the request of the government and in accordance with the powers vested in a President in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka air force provided a plane early today to fly the President, his wife and two security officials to the Maldives.”\n\nRajapaksa was previously blocked from departing Bandaranaike International Airport, on Monday after refusing to join a public immigration queue, a high-ranking military source told CNN.\n\nAides for Rajapaksa arrived at the airport in Colombo on Monday with 15 passports belonging to the President and members of his family – including First Lady Ioma Rajapaksa – who had booked seats on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight leaving for Dubai at 6:25 p.m. local time, according to the military source.\n\nPolice use teargas on Wednesday as protesters storm the prime minister's office.

So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj.

Ukrainian troops trapped in the city are holding out against the Russian onslaught despite overwhelming odds. But they are confined to pockets of resistance, and their numbers are unclear.\n\n“There are still our military forces, our soldiers, so they will fight until the end and as for now they are still in Mariupol,” Shmyhal said on ABC News’ “This Week.”\n\nAn adviser to the mayor of Mariupol also rejected the Russian ultimatum earlier on Sunday.

Much of the city has been destroyed by Russian shelling. Civilian structures targeted included a maternity hospital and a theater where up to 1,300 people were seeking refuge.\n\nThe military governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, where Mariupol is located, said Tuesday up to 22,000 people may have died in the city. CNN cannot verify the figures, as there are no independent casualty figures from the fighting in the city available.\n\nThough many have fled, an estimated 100,000 people still remain in Mariupol and its immediate surroundings, which are reported to be largely under Russian control.\n\nAccording to Russian state media, most of the Ukrainian defenders are located in the Azovstal steel works, one of the largest such plants in Europe with a network of rail tracks and furnaces.\n\nAndriushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, said resistance to the Russians continued beyond the plant.\n\n“Despite the occupiers’ desire to show that the place of hostilities is limited to the Azovstal Steel Plant, this does not correspond with reality,” Andriushchenko said. “Last night there were fights on the Taganrog Street that is located five kilometers away from Azovstal.”\n\nHe said “during the fighting, the occupiers shelled private residential houses with heavy artillery again. The shelling of the port area also continued.”\n\nOn Saturday during a late-night address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the situation in Mariupol “inhuman” and “as severe as possible.” He and his administration had been trying every day to end the siege through both military and diplomatic channels, he said.\n\n“Russia is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there in Mariupol,” he said in the video address.\n\nIn a separate article posted on the presidential website, Zelensky said he was open to talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but negotiations would be impossible if further Russian war crimes surface.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Sunday the situation in Mariupol “may be a red line” in negotiations with Russia.\n\n“The situation in Mariupol is both dire militarily and heartbreaking,” Kuleba said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\n“The city doesn’t exist anymore. The remaining of the Ukrainian army and a large group of civilians are basically encircled by the Russian forces. They continue their struggle, but it seems from the way the Russian army behaves in Mariupol, they decided to raze the city to the ground at any cost,” he added.\n\nThe foreign minister said he is anticipating the intensification of heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine in the “coming weeks.” He also said he expects “desperate attempts of the Russia forces to finish with Mariupol at any cost,” adding he anticipates missile attacks on Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine to continue.\n\nRussia claims advances into Mariupol\n\nOn Friday, the Russian military claimed it had made advances into Mariupol.\n\n“The grouping of Russian troops and units of the Donetsk people’s militia have completely liberated Illich Steelworks from Ukrainian nationalists as a result of the offensive in Mariupol city,” said Russian military spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov in a statement. CNN cannot independently verify the claim.\n\nThis came two days after the last remaining defenders in Mariupol carried out a “risky maneuver” to join forces and consolidate their defenses, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. Both units have been involved in a last-ditch attempt to resist the Russian offensive.\n\nHowever, one of the unit commanders in Mariupol acknowledged some Ukrainian defenders had surrendered.\n\nIn a statement earlier this week, members of the Ukrainian Marines posted a video statement vowing to fight on “until the end,” despite being surrounded by Russian forces and running low on supplies. “We did not give up our positions,” the Marines said in the video.\n\nUkrainian officials have warned of a major humanitarian emergency in Mariupol as food and water run out, with electricity and gas cut, urging the establishment of evacuation corridors to allow civilians to escape.\n\nBut several attempts have failed, including an evacuation effort Saturday, with wet weather halting operations.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Logan had come to the temple to pray one last time, and to tell Minkowicz what he had decided.\n\nMinkowicz, who leads Chabad Lubavitch of Southwest Florida, has been working to counsel those distraught by the attack. Many in his congregation have lived in Israel or have family there, sheltering in bunkers or joining the army. A number of them feel adrift, terrified for their loved ones abroad, he said.\n\nSome, like Logan, have left to join the fight. Others wish they could help protect their country and their families. But the fact that they can’t is a constant source of pain and anger.\n\nLogan, who holds dual citizenship with the U.S. and Israel, is one of roughly 360,000 reservists Israel has mobilized, and could soon be deployed on a ground offensive into Gaza.

Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas who's the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Hamas onslaught Saturday likely resulted from a \"failure of intelligence'' and that it was uncertain how both the U.S. and Israel were caught by surprise.\n\n“We know that Egypt had warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” McCaul told reporters. \"We know that this had been planned perhaps as long as a year ago.''\n\nMcCaul added that \"a warning was given,'' but it wasn't clear at what level of government.\n\nNetanyahu has denied having prior knowledge of the attack, calling those reports \"absolutely false.\" Other reports indicate the information may have been passed along but never reached his desk because it lacked details.\n\nMcCaul said the focus now is on keeping the conflict from expanding with the involvement of other militant groups in the region.\n\n\"We're very concerned about the fidelity of our intelligence and the escalation of a conflict in the Middle East that could turn into a global Jihad movement in Israel,'' he said.\n\nUS casting wide net in search for missing Americans\n\nIn addition to the 22 Americans killed, 17 Americans are still missing in Israel following the Hamas attack, the White House said Wednesday – and the figures could rise further.\n\n\"I think we all need to steel ourselves for the very distinct possibility that these numbers will keep increasing,\" said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters. \"We might find out that more Americans are part of the hostage pool.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. knows some of the Americans − a \"very small\" number − are being held hostage by Hamas but does not know their condition or location. He said the administration is doing \"everything we can\" to locate them and bring them home.\n\n\"We don't know if they're all in one group or broken up into several groups. We don't know if they're being moved and with what frequency and to what locations,\" Kirby said. “Tough to get more detail.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. is \"casting the net wide\" on hostage-recovery efforts, citing discussions with the Israeli government, other Middle East allies and countries such as Qatar that \"that have open lines of communication with Hamas.\"\n\nThe rising death toll is eight more than the 14 Americans who were confirmed dead Tuesday. The number of unaccounted Americans decreased from 20 to 17.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nSecond US aircraft carrier heading to Mediterranean\n\nA second U.S. aircraft carrier will be sent to the Mediterranean Sea and will be ready to help defend Israel if needed.\n\nThe USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its strike group will be leaving in the coming week on a long-scheduled deployment to the European Command Area, Kirby said Wednesday. \"She will be deployed into the Mediterranean and will be an available asset as well as her escort vessels,'' he said.\n\nKirby pointed out no decision has been made on whether the warship will join the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier off the coast of Israel, where it was deployed shortly after the Hamas attack. But the combination gives the U.S. a powerful presence in those waters.\n\n\"We’re sending a loud and clear message that the United States is ready to take action should any actor hostile towards Israel consider trying to escalate or widen this war,\" Kirby said.\n\nIsrael announces bipartisan war Cabinet: 'Israel first of all'\n\nThe Israeli government established a bipartisan war Cabinet to focus on war issues. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be joined by a leading opposition figure, former Defense Minister Benny Gantz and current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\n\"Israel first of all,\" Gantz tweeted.\n\nHamas has said it kidnapped more than 100 Israeli soldiers, men, women, children and older adults and are holding them in Gaza. The Israel government, under intense public pressure to eradicate Hamas, has mobilized 360,000 reservists and could be preparing to launch a ground offensive into Gaza, possibly within days.\n\nEU will continue to financially support Palestinians\n\nEU foreign ministers, meeting in a teleconference, agreed overwhelmingly to continue financial support for Palestinians, said Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Borrell cited a \"clear distinction\" between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the smaller West Bank enclave. Hamas is a terrorist organization while the Palestinian Authority is an EU partner, he said.\n\n\"Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists,\" Borrell said. \"So a collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair and unproductive. It will be against our interests and the interest of the peace.\"\n\nThe ministers also reiterated a long-term commitment to a political solution based on creation of a free Palestinian state. Israel has balked at any plan that would allow Palestinians to have their own military.\n\nEU warns Musk to halt war 'disinformation' on X\n\nThe European Commission warned Elon Musk that X, formerly known as Twitter, could face penalties if it does not take action against \"illegal content and disinformation\" since Hamas' attack on Israel. A letter from Thierry Breton, European commissioner for the internal market, said the company may be non-compliant of \"very precise obligations regarding content moderation\" in Europe's new social media laws. The company could be fined up to 6% of its global revenue under EU rules.\n\nIn response to the letter, Musk wrote on X: \"Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports. Please list the violations you allude to on 𝕏, so that that the public can see them.\"\n\nBreton replied: \"You are well aware of your users’ − and authorities’ − reports on fake content and glorification of violence. Up to you to demonstrate that you walk the talk.\"\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nSon with missing mother hoping Blinken can help\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will have more than officials and dignitaries waiting to meet him when he arrives Thursday in Israel. Nahar Neta, whose mother is missing, would like a word too.\n\nNeta said he has reached out to U.S. embassy officials in Tel Aviv but has had no new information or contact since he believes his mother, dual Israeli-American citizen Adrienne Neta, 66, was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Be’eri on Saturday morning. He's hoping Blinken can provide updates on his mother and the 16 other Americans who remain unaccounted for.\n\nNeta said he was on the phone with Adrienne when Hamas fighters stormed in. \"We heard a lot of shouting and screaming, but no shots were fired and it’s our belief she was taken,” he said.\n\nHe took an immediate flight to Israel and arrived Monday. Now he awaits Blinken.\n\n“I expect the administration and secretary of state to act as responsible for the lives of the American citizens held hostage by Hamas,” Neta said.\n\n− Nick Penzenstadler\n\nGaza communities devastated by 'belts of fire'\n\nIsraeli aircraft and artillery are pounding Gaza towns with what Palestinians are calling \"belts of fire.\" The term refers to intense, successive raids launched against a small target in a short period of time, the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam reports. The raids began at dawn Wednesday and continued into the day, targeting farmland, police stations, government buildings, factories and other crucial locations, the online outlet reported. Emergency vehicles have been unable to reach some of the battered areas because of the intensity of the raids.\n\nWho is Hamas leader Mohammed Deif?\n\nIsraeli airstrikes late Tuesday struck the family house of Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, killing his father, brother and at least two other relatives in the southern town of Khan Younis, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said. Deif has not been seen in public and Israeli authorities say they don't know where he is.\n\nOnline hate heats up as war intensifies\n\nGroups that study online hate speech say it has spiked in recent days – not just for Jewish communities but also for Palestinians. And representatives of both communities agree on one thing: U.S.-based social media companies are still not doing anywhere near enough to rid their platforms of hate against targeted groups.\n\n“When it comes to serious crises like these where you're going to see the worst of the worst types of violent content, gore, incitement to violence, it's really incumbent on social media companies to coordinate across platforms,” said Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Tech and Society, “in order to make sure that the platforms play the minimal amount of role possible in inflaming further violence.” Read more here.\n\n− Will Carless and Jessica Guynn\n\nSome colleges pull students from study abroad programs\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to more than two dozen colleges, many with a history of having a presence in Israel or large study abroad programs, to ask how their programs have been affected by the unfolding crisis.\n\nSome schools confirmed students have safely left the area. Others said students and staff remained in the region while their institutions monitor the situation and put in place new safety protocols. A small number of schools reported that by chance this semester they have no students and faculty studying in Israel.

The struggle to come home – and the fear for loved ones left behind in the deadly war zones of Gaza and Israel – is very real for many Americans as the world watches the violence abroad unfold.\n\nThe U.S. citizens longing to return to America include several people from church groups, including those in Naples, Florida, visiting Jerusalem for religious reasons, Salt Lake City-based Palestinian-Americans visiting family members and New Jersey Jewish residents who were celebrating the Simchat Torah holiday. They told the USA TODAY Network their trips turned from a tranquil, joyous crusade away from home into a nightmare from which they needed to swiftly escape.\n\nMark Schwartz, a councilman and volunteer firefighter in Teaneck, New Jersey, and his friends where among those who traveled to Israel for Simchat Torah.\n\n\"I got a flight to Bulgaria and will somehow get to New Jersey,\" Schwartz told NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network. “Everyone is in a mournful mood.\" Read more here.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhy did Hamas attack Israel now?\n\nHamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and for years has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says the assault was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.\n\nBut Hamas leaders also say they were pushed to attack because of unrelenting Israeli crackdowns on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − thousands of prisoners being held in Israeli jails and Israel's blockade of Gaza.\n\nIsrael countered by declaring war against Hamas and ordered its military to undertake take a \"complete siege\" of Gaza.\n\nOnline hate surges:Why everyone is blaming social media.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel, which prides itself on its military prowess, and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since 1948 when Israel was founded and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nAt the center of the conflict: Who has the right to the land? Both Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem.\n\nBefore Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. In 1947, the United Nations adopted a resolution that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish. Large-scale migration of Jewish people to escape persecution, including by Nazis, prompted the U.N. solution.\n\nA war between Israel and its Arab neighbors surrounding its founding in 1948 led to Israeli expansion into 77% of Palestinian mandate territory, and over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N.\n\nSeveral conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. The war also led to a second expulsion of Palestinians, according to the U.N.\n\nHamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation beginning in 1987 and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-fighters-russia-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Ukraine: The foreign fighters and ukrainian expats taking up arms to ...", "text": "Shehyni, Ukraine CNN —\n\nThe gray asphalt road that leads to Ukraine’s Shehyni border crossing with Poland has for the past week seen 30-mile tailbacks as people try to flee the country, often saying tearful goodbyes to the family members and friends staying behind to fight the Russian invasion.\n\nWednesday brought a different sight: groups of young men, laden with heavy bags and military kit, entered Ukraine from Poland as they answered President Volodymyr Zelensky’s call for “citizens of the world” to fight “Russian war criminals.”\n\nAmong them, New York resident Vasyk Didyk, a 26-year-old carpenter wearing a fluorescent Carhartt beanie who is originally from Ukraine.\n\n“This is our motherland,” he told CNN in Shehyni. “We couldn’t stay in our comfortable lives in America and watch what is happening here.”\n\nDidyk, accompanied by his friend Igor Harmaii, had spent 24 hours traveling from New York to Poland before crossing back into his homeland carrying a canvas backpack and pulling a suitcase on wheels.\n\nI haven’t been back to Ukraine in four years – but it wasn’t even a choice. Vasyk Didyk\n\nHe has no military training and came despite his parents, who do not live in Ukraine, weeping on the phone when they heard he was joining the fight.\n\n“I haven’t been back to Ukraine in four years – but it wasn’t even a choice,” he said. “I had to come and help my country.”\n\nThe world has watched in horror since Russia invaded Ukraine late last week, triggering what could be the largest land war in Europe since World War II. And Zelensky’s defiance has not only united Western opposition to Russia, but also inspired foreign volunteers and Ukrainians abroad to fight for the cause.\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Zelensky said on Sunday. “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules, and peaceful coexistence.”\n\nUkrainian embassies have been helping recruit foreign fighters, while at least one senior politician from a Western government that has previously prosecuted those who joined foreign wars indicated support for citizens taking up arms in Ukraine.\n\n“If people want to support that struggle, I will support them doing that,” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nAsked by CNN whether it consented to French foreign fighters in Ukraine, the French government said: “Ukraine is a war zone, classified as a red zone in the travel advice, updated on a permanent basis and available under the following link (Travel advice). As a result, we formally advise against any travel to Ukraine.”\n\nThe question was not directly answered by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nWhen asked about American foreign fighters he said the US has been “clear for some time” in telling “Americans who may be thinking of traveling there not to go.”\n\nVasyk Didyk (left) and Igor Shehyni (right) arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday after more than 24 hours of travel from New York. AnneClaire Stapleton/CNN\n\nIf Americans want to help Ukraine, “there are many ways to do that, including by supporting and helping the many NGOs that are working to provide humanitarian assistance; providing resources themselves to groups that are trying to help Ukraine by being advocates for Ukraine,” he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Zelensky said the first of 16,000 foreign fighters were making their way to Ukraine “to protect freedom and life for us, and for all,” he said. CNN has not been able to confirm those numbers.\n\n“An attack on Europe”\n\nIn the English city of Milton Keynes, more than 1,200 miles west from Shehyni, British builder Jake Dale said the call for foreigners to join Ukraine’s International Legion inspired him to book a flight to Poland on Friday. He aims to cross into Ukraine by Saturday afternoon.\n\n“As soon as I heard his [Zelensky’s] call – it made me think he needs help,” the 29-year-old said from his home he shares with his girlfriend and two children. “I think it is a worthy cause to risk my life, and my girlfriend feels the same. Obviously, she gets upset, as anyone would, but she supports it as she can see I want to help.”\n\nBack in 2015, Dale wanted to join a Kurdish militia group, the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which was leading the fight against ISIS in Syria, but decided against it due to warnings by the British government.\n\nThis time, he is not worried about the potential legal trouble he could face on his return from Ukraine. “I’m willing to deal with it,” he said after the British government distanced itself from Truss’s comments.\n\nDuring a trip to Poland, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was not “actively” supporting volunteers going to fight. “I can understand why people feel as they do, but we have laws in our country about international conflicts and how they must be conducted,” Johnson told reporters.\n\nDale is heading to Ukraine with Peter Hurst, a 36-year-old former infantry soldier with the British Army, who did a tour of Afghanistan before leaving the military in 2011.\n\nThe father of five, who lives in the northern English town of Pontefract, spoke to CNN on a video call while he picked out kit from an army supplies store in a nearby town. He said wanted to fight to protect democratic values and freedoms.\n\nBritish citizen Jake Dale (left) is pictured with his family. Peter Hurst (right) is pictured with his wife on their wedding day. Both men plan to be in Ukraine by Saturday.\n\n“It feels like an attack on Europe. If you don’t help stop war there [in Ukraine], it will probably spread,” he said.\n\nBoth Hurst and Dale met this week on a Facebook group – created to help supply British medical and military aid to Ukraine. They have been working with a liaison – whose name is listed on an information pack sent by the Ukrainian embassy – who will provide them with body armor and vests in Poland.\n\nDale has spent £300 ($400) buying kit and plane tickets and worries about the financial impact of him not working. “It will be a strain on my family when I leave,” he said. “But I am sure we will be fine.”\n\nNot everyone is supportive of the idea of foreign fighters in Ukraine.\n\nUS-based extremist tracking organization SITE Intelligence Group has warned of the involvement of outfits such as Azov, a paramilitary group whose logo is the Wolfsangel, a symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany.\n\n“Following Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, far-right communities online have rallied to the side of groups like Azov, both in terms of fundraising and stating their intent to fight alongside them,” a SITE report says.\n\nThe British government has told those without military training to avoid the fight.\n\nOn the Facebook group Hurst and Dale met on, one user warns: “That is absolutely no place to be for someone with no weapon handling skills and doesn’t speak the language. Apart from being a danger to others it’s not fair on the lads themselves.”\n\nDale says he is aware of such warnings but insists his skills as a qualified mechanic could be useful.\n\n“People can say it is wrong to go in without a military background, but I believe by fighting alongside Ukrainians, I am answering their call for help,” he said. “Putin’s regime is ruthless – it is not just Ukraine we are protecting.”\n\n“As long as we have to”\n\nUkrainian citizen Valery, who asked for his last name not to be published, lives in eastern France, but felt compelled to return to visit his elderly parents as Russia massed troops on Ukraine’s border.\n\nThe February 24 invasion began soon after he arrived in Kyiv, where it was heralded with pre-dawn warning sirens.\n\n“I woke up around five o’clock in the morning with the very strange sound,” he said. “I thought I was still dreaming. I couldn’t believe my ears. But the sound was so persistent I couldn’t fall asleep any further.”\n\nValery said his mind then turned to one thing: “How useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be.”\n\nHow useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be. Valery\n\nAfter enlisting at a conscription center, the 45-year-old said he “felt this sense of nausea” when he received his weapon, realizing normality had been shattered. “Kyiv has been a very peaceful town since 1943,” he said.\n\nValery is serving with five others in a military unit. “Many of them have families, have children. Nonetheless, they joined,” he said, adding that morale is high within the forces. “There is a lot of determination to defeat the enemy.”\n\nAll foreign fighters share that determination – but the people crossing into Ukraine vary wildly in terms of their organization and experience.\n\nCNN spoke to a group of six volunteers, made up of Americans and one Briton, with military equipment in a packed train station in Pzsemysl, Poland. “If more people would have joined the fight in 1936 we wouldn’t be dealing with fascism now,” the British man said. Most said they are veterans; one said he is not and has never fought in a war.\n\nNone speaks Ukrainian, Russian or Polish, and they did not have a translator or a plan to get to the conflict.\n\n“We’ve tried to get in touch with (the) embassy but (traffic) crashed all the websites,” one said. “There’s women and children dying indiscriminately and you know – we gotta be here,” said another.\n\nElsewhere, CNN spoke with a band of Brits and Canadians who had met each other in a Polish airport, all determined to cross the border and join the Ukrainians in battle.\n\nWali, who is French Canadian, said he had served as a sniper in Afghanistan and volunteered previously to fight against ISIS in 2015. He added that he has contacts in Ukraine who can supply him with weapons. “My friend … called me and said, OK, we really need you,” he said.\n\nBack at the border crossing in Shehyni, New Yorkers Didyk and Harmaii wrangle with their canvas backpacks and wheeled suitcases.\n\nWhen asked how long they plan on staying in Ukraine, they both pause and say almost at the same time: “As long as we have to.”", "authors": ["Tara John Anneclaire Stapleton Joseph Ataman", "Tara John", "Anneclaire Stapleton", "Joseph Ataman"], "publish_date": "2022/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Russian forces strike targets in western Ukraine, killing dozens at ...", "text": "Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country.\n\nThe attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n\nAs the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia’s relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.\n\nBut Russia’s war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv’s military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.\n\nA witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a “sudden clap” from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.\n\nLocal authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine’s Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a “terrorist attack” on peace and security “near the EU-NATO border.”\n\nThere were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO – unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.\n\n“Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,” Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. “Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.”\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,” Sullivan said.\n\nAmbulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nA senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia’s invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about reports of Russia’s request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, “I’ve never heard of that.”\n\nAs attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.\n\nZelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country’s delegation “has a clear task – to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nAmerican journalist killed in Ukraine\n\nHeavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain’s Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to “envelop” Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.\n\nRussian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia’s Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.\n\nBrent Renaud is pictured at the Peabody Awards Ceremony in New York City on 2015. Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nAmid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.\n\nRenaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.\n\nThe US State Department confirmed Renaud’s death on Sunday. “We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,” department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. “This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin’s indiscriminate actions.”\n\nSocial media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.\n\nTIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,” TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.\n\nUkrainians take to the streets to protest\n\nUkrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.\n\nResidents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation. From Telegram\n\nWaving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.\n\nIhor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show “Kherson is Ukraine” and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.\n\nBut the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city “can’t receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.”\n\n“Our main weapon is unity,” he added.\n\nIn recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the “Kherson People’s Republic.” If true, the move would mirror Moscow’s establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.\n\nPutin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.\n\nSchool demolished by Russian strike\n\nRussia’s air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.\n\nA school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.\n\nKim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. “Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,” Kim said.\n\nMissiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.\n\nIn the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been “massive shelling” of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.\n\nThe bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.\n\nUkrainian forces in Kyiv’s suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces’ attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Ukraine’s National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant’s electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.\n\nAs the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.\n\nMariupol’s city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.\n\nAs the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and “to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.”\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.\n\n“The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,” Vereshchuk said. “The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.”\n\nNew round of talks\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.\n\n“Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,” Podoliak said on Twitter. “Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.”\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.\n\nPodoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will “achieve concrete results.”\n\n“Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,” Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nThis comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said “significant progress” has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.\n\nTalks between Ukraine’s and Russia’s top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.\n\nIn Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.\n\nImages of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia’s riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.\n\nAccording to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Mohammed Tawfeeq Olga Voitovych Simone Mccarthy Tara John", "Tim Lister", "Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Olga Voitovych", "Simone Mccarthy", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}]}

He alleged that the suspect, an Austrian citizen, had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.\n\nAnother suspect was later arrested in Vienna.

Local media, citing police sources, said three suspects were still on the run.\n\nTaylor Swiftterrorist threat suspect confessed he intended to kill fans: Officials\n\n\"The cancellation of the Taylor Swift concerts by the organizers is a bitter disappointment for all fans in Austria,\" Nehammer wrote in an X post translated by the social media site.\n\nHe thanked emergency services that are investigating at \"full speed.\"\n\n'Making sure that her fans are kept safe'\n\nOfficials initially said police would increase security measures at the shows, but the performances were ultimately called off. Swift has performed 126 Eras Tour concerts so far, and these are her first cancellations. Other dates have been postponed due to weather.\n\nThis isn't the first time a concert has become a target. In 2017, a suicide bomber killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The brothers responsible for the attack wanted to \"advance the ideology of Islam,\" according to the judge who sentenced the surviving sibling.\n\n“It’s a choice you never want to make, but she would have a really good rapport with the local police and government agencies,” says Andrea Davis, the president and CEO of the Resiliency Initiative, a global consulting company focused on crisis management and risk mitigation planning. “These were credible threats, and it was the right thing to do. She has a pattern of making sure that her fans are kept safe.”\n\nIn fact, Swift confessed in Elle magazine in 2019 ahead of her Reputation Stadium Tour that her biggest fear concerns her fans' safety.\n\n\"After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months,\" she wrote. \"There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.\"\n\nSwift's only remaining European tour dates are five nights at Wembley Stadium in London from Aug. 15-20. She then returns to North America in October before wrapping up the Eras Tour in December.\n\nTaylor Swift fans react: 'It's really devastating'\n\nIt's not uncommon for Swift's fans to cross oceans to see her perform, and many ticketholders are heartbroken over the cancellations.\n\nEmily Reyes drove with her boyfriend John Bechtel and his sister Hannah Bechtel from Greenville, South Carolina, to Charlotte, North Carolina. \"We paid for parking and we had just gotten around to our gate when I saw that all the Vienna shows had been canceled,\" Reyes, 23, says.\n\nIn April, she got three tickets to a Vienna show because it was cheaper than Swift's fall shows in Miami, and she wanted to surprise her sister-in-law. She made a custom \"Reputation\" catsuit to wear Saturday night.\n\n\"A lot of people are traveling for these shows, and it's really devastating,\" she says. \"I wish that they could have rescheduled and just had a really high security to check everything and all belongings — even if that means clear bags and getting patted down and going through metal detectors.\"\n\nAround 65,000 people were expected to attend each night as well as up to 15,000 people outside the stadium without tickets, which fed security concerns.\n\nOther Swifties took to social media to share their disappointment over the jarring development.\n\n“Sitting in a Vienna hotel room processing the fact that the Taylor Swift concert I've been looking forward to for a year, that I flew halfway around the world for, has just been cancelled,” @wordnerd212 wrote on X.\n\n“Good job I’m not currently sat on a plane to Vienna for Taylor Swift… oh wait,” X user @carleypagett wrote.\n\n“We were meant to go and see Taylor Swift in Vienna tomorrow night,” @jessiblah wrote on X. “We were just saying we would start to make our friendship bracelets, I had packed the beads in my case. I’m heartbroken.”\n\n“I am devastated. For over a year I looked forward to this,” X user @Natascha_Strobl wrote. “I made all the bracelets. Taylor Swift in my home city. And now it’s not happening. I have no words. She will never come to Vienna again. That‘s just it. This meant so much. I so wanted to go this concert.”\n\n“I will need 3-5 business years to recover emotionally from Taylor Swift‘s shows being cancelled in Vienna,” @DJChenks wrote on X.\n\nFirst cancellations of the Eras Tour\n\nOf Swift’s 126 Eras Tour concerts, she has postponed two shows, delayed a show and canceled two opening acts due to weather.\n\nIn Nashville on May 7, a torrential downpour delayed the concert by four hours. Swift didn’t wrap until 1:30 a.m. On July 1, Gracie Abram’s opening set in Cincinnati was canceled after heavy rain delays. Swift brought Abrams out for a duet during her surprise set. In Buenos Aires, Swift pushed back her Oct. 10 show to Oct. 12 after heavy rain fell on the Argentinian capital.\n\n\"I love a rain show but I’m never going to endanger my fans or my fellow performers and crew,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nA week later in Rio de Janeiro, she moved her Nov. 18 concert to Nov. 20 because of sweltering temperatures, one day after a fan died at her show.\n\nOn Feb. 23, Sabrina Carpenter’s opening set was canceled in Sydney due to lightning.\n\nTickets to be refunded for Taylor Swift's Vienna shows\n\nFor fans with resale tickets through StubHub, the company says it will provide buyers with a 120% voucher toward another purchase. “Buyers who prefer a 100% cash refund can make the request directly in their StubHub wallet,” the site said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nBarracuda Music, the Austrian tour promoter, posted that fans can expect full refunds within 10 business days and can get updates at https://www.oeticket.com/help/updates/.\n\nSecond violent incident involving Taylor Swift fans\n\nThis is the second Swift-related violent incident in just over a week.\n\nOn July 29, three children — ages 9, 7 and 6 — died after a mass stabbing that injured 10 others in Southport, U.K., during a Taylor Swift-themed class meant for children.\n\nSwift spoke out on the incident the day after the attack, saying she was \"at a complete loss.\"\n\n\"The horror of yesterday's attack is washing over me continuously and I’m just completely in shock,\" she wrote on her Instagram story.\n\nAn 18-year-old has been charged, and a wave of false messaging online that wrongly identified the suspect as an Islamist migrant triggered days of rioting.

The man intended to kill a large number of people before killing himself, according to Austrian officials.\n\nOmar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of Austria's Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, released some details of the planned attack at a news conference.

Or two-time MVP Patrick Mahomes. Or how the Jags' defensive scheme will look under new coordinator Ryan Nielsen.\n\nInstead: Is Taylor Swift coming to Jacksonville?\n\nWherever the Chiefs are traveling, it's a question that has become inevitable.\n\nThat's because Swift, whose relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been headline material for the past year across the United States for nearly a full year, has traveled to watch the AFC West team's games for much of the past year, including the Super Bowl.\n\nMany fans speculated that Swift might come to Jacksonville for last year's Week 2 game at EverBank Stadium on Sept. 17, 2023, but she didn't make the trip on that occasion.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIs Taylor Swift coming to Jacksonville for the Jaguars-Chiefs preseason game?\n\nAs recently as the start of the week, the answer was short: No.\n\nBut the singer's schedule has changed. Keep reading.\n\nA schedule for Swifties: Taylor Swift could make it to quite a few Chiefs games this season. See the list\n\nWhat was Taylor Swift's original plan for Saturday night?\n\nInstead of Jacksonville, Taylor Swift was scheduled to spend her Saturday night on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThink a little less Lynyrd Skynyrd, a little more Mozart.\n\nThe pop star was scheduled to finish a three-night stretch of touring (Thursday, Friday and Saturday) at Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna, Austria, part of the European portion of her worldwide tour. The stadium has held numerous major sports events, including the 1995 UEFA Champions League final and the Euro 2008 championship game in soccer.\n\nThat followed stops in Germany in Hamburg and Munich at the end of July; a three-night stay in Warsaw, Poland, in the opening week of August; and then a span of five concerts in six nights at London's Wembley Stadium between Aug. 15-20.\n\nWhat changed Taylor Swift's concert plans?\n\nAll three of Taylor Swift's concerts in Austria were canceled Wednesday, after the arrest of two suspects in connection with a terror plot. Austrian authorities arrested a third individual Friday.\n\nThe Vienna Federal Ministry of the Interior said a 19-year-old had planned an attack involving \"bladed weapons as well as the construction of a bomb\" and his residence included \"chemical substances, liquids, explosive and technical devices that could be used to manufacture explosives\" as well as machetes and instructions for bomb construction. Austrian officials said the suspect had pledged allegiance to ISIS, and he reportedly confessed that he intended to kill Swift fans.\n\nPlans for Swift's London concerts remain unchanged. That, in theory, means the singer would have time to travel to Jacksonville for Kelce's preseason opener against the Jaguars, then return to London with plenty of time before the Aug. 15 concert.\n\nAs of Friday, Swift has given no indication that she plans to come to Jacksonville for Saturday's football. So, for now, it's one for the \"So you're saying there's a chance\" file.\n\nEven if Swift does indeed spend her Saturday on the European side of the Atlantic, those who occupy the Venn diagram intersection of Swifties and Jaguars fans need not despair.\n\nAlthough the Jags won't face Kansas City during the regular season, there's still a chance that the Chiefs — and possibly Swift along with them — could come to Jacksonville for a playoff game in January 2025.\n\nFor that to happen, the Jaguars first would need to qualify for the postseason, most likely winning the AFC South Division, and would need to hold home field advantage by way of superior seeding for a playoff game against Kansas City. That would bring the Chiefs, back-to-back Super Bowl champions, to EverBank Stadium.\n\nAnd if the Jags aren't able to nail down a home playoff game and miss out on the chance to meet the Chiefs in Jacksonville? Just one more item to add to the franchise's \"Would've, Could've, Should've\" list.\n\nWhen has Taylor Swift performed in Jacksonville?\n\nSwift has made three musical stops on the First Coast. The first came on Aug. 10, 2007, when she performed inside Veterans Memorial Arena in a concert headlined by Brad Paisley.\n\nThe Times-Union's comment on her first Jacksonville appearance: \"It's going to be interesting to see what happens to her career in the next few years.\"\n\nShe played the same venue on May 1, 2009, along with Kellie Pickler — also a performer in the 2007 Jacksonville concert — as a stop on her Fearless tour.\n\nSwift's most recent Jacksonville concert came on Nov. 11, 2011, part of her Speak Now tour. Fans waited in line outside the arena beginning at 6 a.m. to watch a performance highlighted by \"ballet dancers and flying stages and aerial acrobats swinging from enormous bells.\"\n\nWhile her current Eras Tour covers five continents, the tour's closest approaches to Jacksonville were Tampa and Atlanta in 2023. She is still scheduled to perform at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium from Oct. 18-20.\n\nJacksonville is the only AFC South market without a Taylor Swift visit on the tour; she performed in Houston and Nashville last year, and is scheduled to sing at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis from Nov. 1-3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/08/07/taylor-swift-tour-vienna-concerts-terrorism-plot/74706868007/", "title": "Taylor Swift's tour concerts were site of suspected terrorist plot", "text": "Two suspects have been arrested after a suspected terrorism plot at Taylor Swift's upcoming concerts in Vienna.\n\nVienna Federal Ministry of the Interior officials confirmed the arrest of two individuals who are \"suspected of having planned attacks at major events,\" including Swift's scheduled concerts in Vienna on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night.

What did he say about this moment and rate cuts and really the Fed's role in all this?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nHe admitted that that jobs number that we got last Friday for July, was weak. However, he did not think it was as bad as maybe other people thought it was, because down in the details, he said that really the unemployment rate rose because there were more people looking for jobs not because of layoffs, which is what would happen in a recession. So he was not quite as negative about it. As far as the market sell-off, he said the market sell-off made people panic, economists were revising their estimates and some were calling for emergency rate cuts to stave off the recession. He says that he doesn't look at that. He said the Fed's mandate is price stability and full employment, and that is what they focus on. So he said there's nowhere in the law that says the job should be trying to make investors whole again after market gyrations.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Medora, do we have any sense on what the Fed's next move will be?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSo having said all of that, he suggested or hinted that it might be time to look at lowering rates soon, making the point that we have had our Fed funds rate at a 23-year-high now for just over a year, and when they put it up that high, it was a very different economy than it is now. And since then, inflation has come down and the economy has weakened a bit. So suggesting that maybe it's time to take a look.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo there are clearly fears about the possibility of a recession. How likely is that at this point Medora?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSo it depends on who you talk to, but I think that a lot of people would say that the market sell-off was an overreaction, that we're not really there yet. So there are a lot of differing opinions. And again, like the Chicago Fed president said, this is only one month of data. That doesn't really necessarily mean anything. And some people said that it was Hurricane Beryl that goosed those unemployment figures.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo it was clearly a rough day stateside. What's happening around the world Medora, and what impact is that happening on the U.S. markets?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nThat's another thing that the Chicago Fed president also mentioned. He said that he also thinks that Monday's sell-off, there are more factors than just the monthly jobs report. He said the Bank of Japan raised rates more than expected last week and that fueled some technical trading that maybe people were doing. They were borrowing money in Japan at low interest rates and then reinvesting it into higher yielding investments like U.S. stocks and things like that. And so now that Japan's raising rates, we might look like we're going to lower rates, people might be redoing their portfolios and selling off their high yielding assets and moving money around.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Medora, folks tend to freak out in moments like these, right? What do experts advise investors to do in this moment?\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nSo the financial advisors always come out and tell everybody, don't look at your 401k balance today, and you have to remember this, you're investing for the longterm. And the longterm, ultimately, the markets go up.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Medora Lee covers money and personal finance for USA TODAY. Thank you, Medora.\n\nMedora Lee:\n\nThank you. Have a good day.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday rejected an effort by Missouri's Attorney General, Andrew Bailey, to delay former president Donald Trump's September 18th sentencing in his New York hush money case until after the November election. The high court dismissed his request without comment. Bailey argued the sentencing and a gag order impedes Trump's ability to campaign for president, making it difficult for Missouri's voters to get the information they need to cast a ballot. New York Attorney General, Letitia James, told the court that Missouri was attempting an extraordinary and dangerous end run around Trump's court proceedings. James also said Trump is free to speak about all the topics voters want to hear about, including Trump's views on the prosecutor, witnesses, jurors and judge. Originally scheduled for July, Trump's sentencing was moved to September to allow him to argue his conviction should be thrown out because of the Supreme Court's July immunity ruling. That landmark decision found that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution. Trump was convicted in May of falsifying 34 business records in order to cover up a 2016 election interference conspiracy involving hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n♦\n\nA Virginia man has been arrested and charged with threatening to kill Vice President Kamala Harris six days after she launched her presidential campaign. Frank Lucio Carrillo was charged in federal court in Virginia on Friday, with threats against the Vice President of the United States after posting messages targeting Harris and other elected officials including President Joe Biden and FBI Director Christopher Wray, on a conservative social media site, according to court records. Messages threatening Harris were posted July 27th, court record said. That's less than a week after Biden announced he would not seek reelection and two weeks after an assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump.\n\n♦\n\nAt least five U.S. personnel were injured in an attack against a military base in Iraq yesterday. It's still unclear whether the attack was linked to threats by Iran to retaliate following the recent assassinations of senior Iranian-backed militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran. For more on continued tensions in the region, I spoke with USA TODAY Pentagon correspondent, Tom Vanden Brook. Hiya Tom.\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nTaylor, good to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood to have you on as always, Tom. So let's just start with this. Tensions clearly remain high in the Middle East. What do we know about the recent assassinations of senior Iranian-backed militant leaders?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, we know that they happened. We know that Israel claims credit for the first one, with an airstrike in Beirut on the Hezbollah leader, and that followed an attack that killed 12 children in Israel. Israel's not claiming credit for the Hamas leader who was killed in Iran last week, but the suspicion is that they assassinated him, and that's what has brought this to the brink of what appears to be some sort of retaliation by Iran.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So what have the Israeli and Iranian responses been like after those killings?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nSo far, just a lot of angry rhetoric coming out of Iran. Israel's not claiming credit for this latest assassination in Iran, but we'll see what happens. The last time Iran made major threats like this in April, they fired 300 missiles and drones at Israel. So it's a serious issue and the Pentagon is taking it as such, and has sent F-22 fighter jets and numerous ships to the region in order to deter Iran from attacking Israel.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, I want to hear a little bit more about the U.S. response here, Tom. They've also sent officials to the region, I know. What is the U.S. strategy really, amid all this?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nTo put up a big show of force at the moment, to deter Iran from doing what it did last time, or at least to be able to prevent Israel from being struck by these missiles. A number of these ships that are being sent have anti-ballistic missile capability. The extra fighter aircraft, in addition to being a deterrent to Iran because they could do serious damage if it ever came to that, and hopefully it won't, but in the last go round, the Air Force shot down a number of these drones that were headed toward Israel. So deterrence and then failing that, to be able to defend Israel against an attack. And at the moment, the chief US military official for the region, General Erik Kurilla, is in the Middle East speaking with allies, speaking with Israel, about what the contingency plans are to protect them and hopefully to prevent it from happening in the first place.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So as you mentioned, US officials worried last week that an attack by Iran was imminent. Do they still feel that way? What's the chance Iran attacks Israel now and really what are the concerns about Iran's proxy groups, as well, in the region?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nYeah, those are good questions. The attack still seems, according to officials I speak to, they think it's inevitable. Of course, that could change. Whether it's imminent or not, it's another thing. In speaking to officials, they've been telling me that an attack does not seem imminent right now, that there are no indications that it's going to happen anytime soon. But there is a feeling that it's inevitable. A big issue is the control that Iran has, these proxy groups that it has: Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen. They've armed them, trained them, and whether or not they have complete control over how they respond to this is, an open question. Adam Smith, the ranking member of the Armed Services committee, was talking about how Iran may not have the leash that it thinks it has on these groups and they could respond on their own unilaterally and attack Israel.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, interesting insight as always. Tom Vanden Brook covers the Pentagon for USA TODAY. Thank you, Tom.\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nYou're welcome, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThird-party presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted a video to social media on Sunday, of him talking with actress Roseanne Barr, where he admits placing a dead bear cub in New York's Central Park and staging it to look as if a cyclist had run over the animal. Kennedy said he was on his way to go falconing in the Hudson Valley in New York in 2014, when a van in front of him hit and killed the bear. Kennedy said he picked up the bear and put it in his car with the intention of skinning it and putting its meat in his refrigerator. But he had a dinner back in New York City that ran late and had to travel to the airport right afterward. The video was apparently released to get ahead of a story by the New Yorker, Kennedy said, adding that the outlet had found out about the incident.\n\nAnd in a strange twist of events, a reporter who first covered the story for the New York Times when the bear was found in 2014, was Tatiana Schlossberg, Kennedy's second cousin and the daughter of Caroline Kennedy, the outlet reported. After the news broke Sunday, Schlossberg told the New York Times that she had no idea who was responsible for the incident when she wrote the story.\n\n♦\n\nIn the most significant legal ruling against a major technology giant in more than two decades, a federal judge says Google illegally monopolized online search and advertising by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to install Google as the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers. By monopolizing searches on smartphones and browsers, Google abused its dominance in the search market, throttling competition, and harming consumers, according to U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta. Google owes much of its more than $300 billion in annual revenue to search ads.\n\nYesterday's ruling did not include remedies. Those will be decided separately, likely after an appeal, which Google said it would make. One remedy could see Google lose its ability to strike device deals that have helped make its search engine so ubiquitous. Google has argued that its distribution deals are common in the business world and that it pays for its search engine to be on phones the way a food manufacturer pays to promote its products at eye level in a grocery store aisle. You can read more about the implications of yesterday's ruling with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nSimone Biles added yet another medal to her massive career haul yesterday, winning silver in the women's gymnastics floor exercise final, giving her four medals, including three golds at these games. But it was the first time Biles had not won gold in a floor exercise final ever. Still, the medal is the 11th of her Olympic career. Brazil's Rebecca Andrade won gold, and after an inquiry, Team USA's Jordan Chiles score was updated to move her into third place and the bronze. Meanwhile, American Caroline Marks won gold in Tahiti in the women's shortboard surfing competition. And Team USA also captured medals in triathlon, shooting, pole vaults and three-on-three basketball. Medal events are scheduled for today in track, boxing, cycling, diving, equestrian, sailing, skateboarding, and wrestling.

You are not supposed to keep river otters, bobcats and fishers,” he said about dead animals found along highways.\n\nMotorists are advised to report the deceased animals to the agency.\n\n“Pretty much anything they want to collect along the road, they are supposed to call 1-833-PGC-HUNT (1-833-742-4868) or 1-833-PGC-WILD (1-833-742-9453) and report it and (apply to) get a permit. The permits are free,” he said.\n\nThe phone lines are staffed 24-hours a day and the dispatcher can provide a permit number immediately.\n\n“If a game warden would ask, you would have proof that you called in and got the OK to keep it,” Frye said about the permit number.\n\nMore outdoors:Illegal poaching happens in Pennsylvania.

Some animals, such as trophy-sized bucks, may be kept by the agency for educational purposes or a public use like a museum.\n\n“It’s not a guarantee that you get to keep everything, but when you call and report it, you can certainly make that request,” he said.\n\nThere are fees if you intend to keep some of the non-edible parts. For a whitetail deer, the person would have to pay $10 a point to keep a buck’s antlers. For elk, it’s $20 a point.\n\nThere are other fees if the person wants to keep an animal’s hide or cape for tanning purposes.\n\nIf you plan to eat an animal that was killed by a vehicle, Frye suggests having the meat processed as soon as possible.

For the latest news, view our file for Tuesday, July 16.\n\nPresident Joe Biden rejected accusations that he has engaged in violent rhetoric that could have incited the gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally Saturday.\n\n\"How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?\" Biden told NBC host Lester Holt in an interview Monday. \"Look, I've not engaged in that rhetoric. Now, my opponent has engaged in that rhetoric.\"\n\nBiden pointed to Trump’s past comments about a \"bloodbath\" if he loses the 2024 election, his promise to pardon convicted Jan. 6 insurrectionists, and his jokes after Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was attacked by a home intruder with a hammer.\n\nRepublicans, including Trump’s newly tapped vice presidential nominee, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, have blamed rhetoric and hostility toward Trump by Biden and Democrats for the assassination attempt. Helen Comperatore, the widow of the fireman killed in the attack, Corey Comperatore, told the New York Post that she declined to take a call from Biden but absolved him of blame.\n\nBiden was asked about comments he made to campaign donors on July 8, when he said: \"It’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.\"\n\n\"It was a mistake to use the word,\" Biden said. \"I didn't say crosshairs. I meant focus on him, focus on what he's doing. Focus on his policies. Focus on the number of lies he told in the debate.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Biden's security detail has been adjusted in light of the attack on Trump, whose Secret Service protection was enhanced. Mayorkas also told reporters an independent review of the attempt on Trump's life will begin in the coming days and its findings will be made public.\n\n∎ Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle is scheduled to testify next Monday about the agency’s \"security lapses\" at the rally before the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, Chair James Comer, R-KY, said in a statement. \"We are grateful to the brave Secret Service agents who acted quickly to protect President Trump after shots were fired and the American patriots who sought to help victims, but questions remain about how a rooftop within proximity to President Trump was left insecure.\"\n\n∎ An Allegheny County sheriff’s deputy was stationed Monday outside the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where Crooks had worked as a dietary aide. \"We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,\" said Marcie Grimm, the facility's administrator.\n\n∎ The shooting has raised grave security concerns as thousands of GOP politicians, delegates, supporters, and media personnel attend the Republican National Convention, which began Monday in Milwaukee.\n\n∎ Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump’s official running mate, called for an investigation following Saturday’s shooting. \"Clearly mistakes were made,\" Vance told Fox News Monday evening. \"The Secret Service ran up there, and they put their bodies over him, they reacted quickly. That's not what worries me. What worries me is why was there a shooter 150 yards from the (former) president of the United States. It doesn't make an ounce of sense.\"\n\n∎ Top officials at the Trump campaign told staff members they are re-doubling security measures at their offices in light of the assassination attempt. \"We are enhancing the armed security presence with 24/7 officers on-site,\" said a staff memo signed by senior campaign officials Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita.\n\nSlain fireman's widow rejects Biden's call but doesn't blame him\n\nThe widow of Corey Comperatore, the fireman who was killed protecting his family during the shooting at Trump's rally Saturday, said she rejected a phone call from Biden out of deference to her husband but that she holds no grudges against the president, the New York Post reported Monday.\n\nHelen Comperatore told the newspaper she has not heard from Trump but Biden's office reached out, presumably to offer condolences. She described herself as not involved in politics, adding that her husband was a \"devout Republican\" who would not have wanted her to talk to Biden.\n\n\"I support Trump. That’s who I’m voting for, but I don’t have ill will towards Biden,\" said Helen Comperatore, according to the Post. \"He didn’t do anything bad to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did.\"\n\nBiden questions whether Secret Service should have anticipated shooting\n\nIn an interview with NBC's Lester Holt on Monday, Biden said that he wants to see the results of an independent analysis he requested before he decides whether the Secret Service did enough to prevent the attempt on Trump's life.\n\nHe noted agents around Trump risked their lives to protect the former president.\n\n\"The question is should they have anticipated what happened? Should they have done what they needed to do to prevent this from happening,\" Biden said. \"That's an open question.\"\n\nBiden also said he feels safe with his protective detail.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDA not planning to file charges in Trump shooting\n\nBETHEL PARK, Pa. − Butler County District Attorney Richard A. Goldinger said Monday his office isn't planning to file any criminal charges related to the assassination attempt at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally, which the FBI said it's investigating as potentially domestic terrorism.\n\nGoldinger said because gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks died at the scene and appeared to be working on his own, there are no charges to file. Goldinger added he was unaware of any potential criminal charges being filed against Crooks' parents, who live in Bethel Park, about 50 miles from where the shooting took place.\n\nAny criminal charges would be communicated by the Pennsylvania State Police, Goldinger said. State Police Spokesman Lieutenant Adam Reed said there are no plans to hold a press conference Monday with updates on the investigation.\n\nThe FBI is trying to determine a motive for the attack and said Monday it has gained access to Crooks' phone, although it's not clear what information that shed. The bureau also said its specialists are analyzing the shooter's electronic devices as part of an investigation that has included nearly 100 interviews and a search of his home and vehicle.\n\n− Sheridan Hendrix, The Columbus Dispatch\n\nQuestions remain over how the gunman was able to get shots off\n\nThe Secret Service has implemented changes to Trump's security detail since the assassination attempt to \"ensure his continued protection for the convention and the remainder of the campaign,\" agency Director Kimberly Cheatle said Monday. Cheatle issued a statement crediting the agency's counter-sniper team for \"neutralizing\" the shooter, and its agents for actions ensuring Trump's safety in the chaotic moments after the shots rang out Saturday at a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut questions remain about how Crooks was able to open fire with an AR-15-style rifle from a rooftop about 400 feet outside the rally. CNN, citing a source familiar with the investigation, said the Secret Service did not sweep the building, instead leaning on state and local law enforcement to conduct security at that location. Pennsylvania State Police, however, told CNN they were not responsible for the area where the building was located.\n\nTrump was wounded in his ear, one spectator was killed and two others were critically injured. The Secret Service is working with federal, state and local agencies to understand details of the shooting and \"how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again,\" Cheatle's statement said.\n\nThe Secret Service has been the subject of scrutiny and criticism since the shooting occurred. At a media briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden still has confidence in Cheatle.\n\n\"The men and women of the Secret Service have a hard job,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"Their mission is critical, and we need all hands on deck in this moment and right now we're focused on getting all the facts so we can get to the bottom of what happened.”\n\nKevin Rojek, a special agent in charge of the FBI's field office in Pittsburgh, said the gunman appears to have acted alone and there was no ongoing threat to the public.\n\nBiden extends Secret Service protection to RFK Jr.\n\nThe Biden administration will extend Secret Service protection to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. following the assassination attempt on Trump.\n\n“In light of this weekend's events, the president has directed me to work with the Secret Service to provide protection to Robert Kennedy Jr.,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at a White House press briefing Monday.\n\nKennedy has long demanded Secret Service protection during his long-shot presidential run but had previously been denied. Kennedy is the son of the late Democratic icon Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated by a gunman as a Democratic primary candidate in 1968. Kennedy's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was the last president to be assassinated.\n\nTrump pushed on social media Monday for Kennedy to get Secret Service protection, and later Kennedy addressed rumors about the subject of their morning meeting. Politico reported Trump was seeking Kennedy's endorsement.\n\n\"Our main topic was national unity, and I hope to meet with Democratic leaders about that as well,'' Kennedy said on the X platform. \"No, I am not dropping out of the race.''\n\nGun store near Crooks' home cooperating in investigation\n\nA gun store in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, one mile from Crooks’ home is working with law enforcement agencies investigating Saturday's attack. Josh Rowe, co-owner of Allegheny Arms and Gun Works, said police reached out to him Sunday morning.Rowe did not address whether he recognized Crooks as a customer but pointed out he does not often work at the cash cashier. “If we had any info, we would have gone to the police,” he said Monday.Rowe said his gun store has an open line with local law enforcement in any gun-related crime, adding, “We are community members, but we are also stewards.”\n\n− Bryce Buyakie\n\nKing Charles reaches out to Trump\n\nKing Charles III has sent a private letter to Trump delivered via the UK embassy in Washington, according to Buckingham Palace. The palace declined to give details about the contents of the letter. United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday said he was “appalled by the shocking scenes at President Trump's rally and we send him and his family our best wishes.”\n\n\"Political violence in any form has no place in our societies and my thoughts are with all the victims of this attack,” Starmer wrote in a post on X.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nShooter was planning to attend college in fall term\n\nCrooks was set to attend classes this fall at Robert Morris University, a school spokesman confirmed to reporters Monday. Staff at the private university said they would “stand ready” to assist in the law enforcement investigation, although Crooks had yet to attend any classes.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to former President Trump, the family of Mr. Corey Comperatore, and anyone physically or emotionally harmed by this tragic event,” said Brian Edwards, Chief Brand Officer at RMU. “We stand against violence in all its forms and are committed to fostering a safe and supportive community for all.”\n\nThe university is located in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, roughly 20 miles from Crooks' home in Bethel Park. The university did not share which program he would be studying under.\n\nCrooks attended the Community College of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh, where he graduated with an associate’s degree in engineering science in May. The college said in a statement that it will cooperate with investigators and release information in accordance with policies and protocols.\n\n“We are grateful that former President Trump is safe and recovering, and we extend our condolences to the family of Corey Comperatore on their loss,” the college said, referring to the Pennsylvania firefighter who was killed while shielding his family from gunfire.\n\n− Garret Roberts, Kristine Phillips, USA TODAY Network\n\nCrooks was member of local sportsmen's club\n\nCrooks, a one-time registered Republican and a nursing home worker with no criminal record, was a member of the Clairton Sportsmen’s Club about eight miles from his home.\n\nThe club's sprawling complex of 180 acres includes a rifle, pistol, archery and competition range, an area for dog training and a clubhouse, according to its website. With over 2,000 local members, it also provides safety classes and youth activities. Robert Bootay III, a lawyer for the club, confirmed Crooks was a member but would not provide additional details, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n“The Club fully admonishes the senseless act of violence that occurred on Saturday,” Bootay wrote in a statement to USA TODAY on Monday. “The Club also offers its sincerest condolences to the Comperatore family and extends prayers to all of those injured including the former President.”\n\n− Bryce Buyakie\n\nLawmaker who sat near Trump at rally pushes for independent probe\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., wants a full, independent investigation of the security lapses that led to Trump's shooting.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anybody,\" Kelly said. \"I'm hearing now people saying that the Secret Service didn't do their job. Somebody else didn't do their job. Let's wait and see how this plays out before we start doing the criticism of who didn't do what when they should have.\"\n\nKelly, who was thrilled to have Trump back in his congressional district for Saturday's rally, was seated to the right of the former president, about 50 feet away, when gunfire erupted. Trump began talking about the economy and inflation, Kelly said, \"and then those shots rang out.\"\n\n\"It was pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,\" he said. \"I looked up, saw the president and said, 'Oh, my God. Somebody just shot the president. Behind me in the grandstands, I heard people say, 'He's been shot, he's been shot.' I looked back over my shoulder and about 12 rows up in the stands some people were surrounding somebody who was down on the ground. And it just kept going. People were yelling and screaming. Secret Service was on top of the president right away, within a second or two.\"\n\n− Matthew Rink, Erie Times-News\n\nAll quiet near home of Trump shooter\n\nA red SUV and a blue pickup were parked Monday in the driveway of the modest family home where Crooks apparently lived with his parents. On Monday, two unidentified law enforcement officers knocked on the Crooks family home at about 10 a.m. and were let inside. The officers emerged about five minutes later. A short time later, two other officers began knocking on neighbors’ doors and speaking with those who answered. One of the officers wore a shirt that said FBI Pittsburgh SWAT.\n\nNeighbors who were evacuated Saturday night were allowed to return to their homes around 10:30 p.m. Sunday. Police then tightened the perimeter to just the street, allowing reporters and curious locals to get a view of the Crooks’ brick home for the first time since law enforcement descended on it following the shooting. Several neighbors who live down the street from Crooks said they had either never met him or only saw him walking around the neighborhood.\n\nSandy Kovalik, 66, said she’s never met Crooks or his parents but has walked past their home hundreds of times. Maura Eichner said she may have seen Crooks walking to work and at a local supermarket, but only briefly.

Then the Trump rally shooting happened.\n\nTrump backers blame Democrats\n\nThe shooting provoked deep anger and outrage among Trump supporters as shock quickly turned to blame. Already seen as a persecuted figure by many in his party, Trump again was cast as a man whose critics will stop at nothing to keep him from public office. A top Trump campaign aide and a leading candidate to be his running mate both said rhetoric from Biden and Democrats contributed to the climate that led to the shooting.\n\n“Leftist activists, Democrat donors and now even (Biden) have made disgusting remarks and descriptions of shooting Donald Trump,” Trump senior adviser Chris LaCivita said on X. “It’s high time they be held accountable for it, the best way is through the ballot box.\"\n\nOhio U.S. Sen.

Did Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter and John Artis brutally kill two people and fatally wound a third there on a June night in 1966? Or were Carter, then 29 and a well-known boxer, and Artis, 19 and a former high school track star who spent his days driving a delivery truck, unjustly imprisoned for most of two decades?\n\nBACK IN THE NEWS:Revisiting the Hurricane Carter murder case: Son resurrects his detective father's memoir\n\nTo study the original case records now is to walk a path littered with perplexing questions and strands of facts that have been woven into myth. At the same time, such a journey also reveals evidence that has never been challenged – and, yet, still contributes to the mystery.\n\nThat night, there were two gunmen. One carried a 12-gauge shotgun, the other a .32-caliber pistol — probably a 7-shot, German-made revolver, say police ballistics experts. Both were black. Both came in through the front door.\n\nIt was early in the morning of June 17, 1966, a Friday. The 3 a.m. closing time at the Lafayette Grill drew near.\n\nInside were three men and one woman, all white, all of them regulars at the tavern, long known as a quiet watering hole on the border between Paterson's working-class Lithuanian and black neighborhoods. The place had a television above the bar, a pool table in the middle of a checkerboard linoleum floor, and a kitchen that served up burgers and fries.\n\nTwo men nursed drinks as they sat on bar stools. On the wall above the bar and surrounded by musical-note decorations, a framed portrait photo of President John F. Kennedy looked down. Beneath Kennedy's photo sat a clock designed to look like a large pocket watch. Beneath that, crime scene photos show a shelf with three White Rose whiskey bottles nestled amid a cluster of gins, vodkas and other spirits.\n\nTo the right of the two men sat a lone woman, who got off work earlier than usual that night from her waitress job at a country club. The day before, she had managed some free time to go shopping with her pregnant daughter for baby furniture. On this night, she stopped by the bar on the way to her Hawthorne home to drop off a deposit for a trip to Atlantic City later in the summer.\n\n\"It was prom season, so she usually worked later,\" recalls the woman's daughter. \"She thought she was having an easier night, I guess.\"\n\nBehind the counter, by a cash register and a sign that announced Budweiser \"on tap,\" the bartender counted the day's receipts.\n\nPerhaps bartender Jim Oliver recognized the killers when they came through the front door from 18th Street. Maybe he just saw their guns and knew trouble was coming. Whatever his thoughts at that fearsome moment, police say, one of Oliver's last acts of life was to hurl an empty beer bottle at the killers.\n\nThe bottle smashed against the wall by the door. As Oliver turned to run the length of the bar, past an ice cooler and toward the overhead television set, a single shotgun blast from about seven feet away tore into his lower back, the 12-gauge round ripping open a 2-inch by 1-inch hole and severing his spinal column.\n\nOliver died instantly, police say. He was 51 and had volunteered to tend bar that night because his girlfriend — a widow named Betty Panagia, who owned the Lafayette and lived in Saddle Brook — had been putting in long hours as Oliver recovered from a recent hernia operation.\n\nAs Oliver fell, a $10 bill and four $5 bills scattered on the floor. The cash register drawer remained open.\n\nThe next to die was Fred Nauyoks. The killer with the pistol shot him.\n\nNauyoks, a 60-year-old machinist who had stopped by after working at a local factory before heading to his Cedar Grove home, took a .32-caliber bullet just behind his right ear. The lead slug plowed into his brain stem, killing him instantly, autopsy records say.\n\nNauyoks was well-known in the area as a billiard player, and his relatives remember that he went by two nicknames — \"Paterson Bob\" and \"Cedar Grove Bob.\" That night, Nauyoks' wife was in Michigan, visiting relatives. The next day, when she arrived home and was told of her husband's killing, grandson Tom Vicedomini remembers that she walked silently upstairs and donned a black dress.\n\nWith death arriving instantly, Nauyoks slumped on the bar, seemingly asleep, a cigarette still burning between his fingers when police arrived, his shot glass still standing on the bar next to cash to pay for his drink, his right foot still propped on the chrome leg of his bar stool.\n\nSeated two stools away, William \"Willie\" Marins, 42 and also a machinist, had been battling numerous health problems, including tuberculosis, police say. The Lafayette even kept a special glass for Marins to drink from so he would not spread tuberculosis to other customers.\n\nMarins, who lived nearby in Paterson, was also shot in the head by the man with the pistol. But he was lucky. The .32 slug hit him in the left temple and passed through his forehead near his right eye without killing him. He stumbled to the floor, and, he later said, played dead.\n\nHe would lose the use of his right eye, but could still describe the killers to police. He died in 1973 of causes unrelated to the shootings.\n\nThe woman was the killers' final target. And for her, court records indicate, one of the gunmen finally spoke.\n\nAs the others were shot, Hazel Tanis, 56, a waitress at Westmount Country Club in then West Paterson, was trying to hide near the front door.\n\n\"No,\" she cried, according to trial testimony from a witness in an upstairs apartment who heard a woman's scream as the man with the shotgun fired a blast into her upper right arm and shoulder.\n\n\"Finish her off,\" the man with the shotgun reportedly told his partner.\n\nAs Tanis slumped to the floor, the man with the .32-caliber pistol fired five shots at her from as close as 10 inches, hitting her four times — in the right breast, the lower abdomen, the vagina, and the genital area.\n\nMiraculously, Tanis would struggle to live another month before finally succumbing to an embolism. But during that time she would give police a description of the killers and, says her daughter, would tell in detail how she tried to beg for her life.\n\n\"'I'm a mother. I'm a grandmother. Please don't shoot me,'\" Tanis' daughter, Barbara Burns, now 55, recalls her mother telling her later in the hospital. Burns would later insist that her mother picked out mug shots of Carter and Artis, explaining: \"You don't look a man in the eyes and plead for your life and forget what he looks like.\"\n\nBut the police say Tanis chose photos of other men — hence, another thread of mystery.\n\nAt the hub of almost every aspect of the mystery, however, are Carter and Artis. That night, neither was able to provide an ironclad account of their whereabouts at the time of the Lafayette Grill killings.\n\nCarter, now 63 and a prisoners' rights activist in Canada, did not respond to numerous requests for an interview, although he has long proclaimed his innocence. Artis, 53 and a youth counselor in Virginia, reaffirmed his innocence in an interview, adding that \"my heart goes out\" to the victims' families \"but, simply stated: I'm not the one.\"\n\nMany police officers not only disagree with Carter's and Artis' not-guilty claims, but still resent being accused of railroading the two men. \"I would never be involved in framing anyone,\" said retired Paterson Deputy Police Chief Robert Mohl, 66, of Toms River, who was a detective in 1966 and played a key role in the case.\n\nThat night, cops surmise that the killers needed only a minute — maybe less — to unleash their fusillade on all the victims.\n\nLeft behind, according to the original police report, was $72 in Nauyoks' wallet, $51 in Tanis' white purse, $30 on the floor by Oliver's body, and cash in the register that \"appeared to be untouched.\" Police discovered months late that someone — but not the killers — removed cash from the register.\n\nAnd from there, other mysteries would spread like those haphazard mirror cracks — mysteries (and pieces of mysteries) that have endured for 34 years.\n\nNot even the precise time of the shootings is certain. All that's known is that someone — there is no indication whether the voice was male or female — telephoned the Paterson police headquarters at 2:34 a.m. with the message that \"people had been shot\" at the Lafayette Grill.\n\nWho were these two gunmen?\n\nWhat was their motive?\n\nWhy this bar, on this night, and these victims?\n\nIn a house a block away, the phone rang.\n\nFinally home, after a long day, a Paterson police detective with a name that bespoke a humorous irony for his profession picked up the receiver.\n\n\"It was headquarters,\" recalls Jim Lawless, now 72, retired, and living in Fort Pierce, Florida, after rising to the rank of deputy chief in the Paterson Police Department. \"They told me there was a shooting. I grabbed two guns and ran out the door.\"\n\nArmed with his .357 Magnum service revolver and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, Lawless stepped through the front door of the Lafayette Grill only minutes later, not knowing what he might confront.\n\nThe lights were on, he recalls. Near one end of the bar, he remembers hearing Tanis groan in pain. Gazing across the room, past the pool table, Lawless noticed Nauyoks and Marins. Pools of blood dotted the linoleum. At Nauyoks' feet sat a spent shotgun shell.\n\n\"It was,\" said Lawless, \"like a slaughterhouse.\"\n\nBefore he had time to check behind the bar, Lawless heard the sirens of approaching police cruisers and an ambulance. Indeed, the scene was so gruesome that an ambulance technician would later testify that he slipped on the bloody floor. But the technician's testimony underscores a fact that has since come to hover over the killings: Cops were so lax in securing the crime scene that they were never able to detect whether the killers might have left footprints in the blood as they departed.\n\nWhat's more, police never took fingerprints at the crime scene, never photographed tire skid marks from the getaway car even though witnesses said the car screeched away, never took fingerprints from the spent shotgun shell that was found on the bar's floor.\n\n\"There was something really wrong,\" said Richard Caruso, a former Essex County sheriff's detective who was part of a team of investigators assigned by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office to reexamine the killings in 1975. \"What's wrong with the physical evidence? How come they didn't take fingerprints?\"\n\nCaruso, now a lawyer in Brick Township and one of several members of the team who raised questions about the original police investigation, said he was eventually reassigned to \"cleaning up a file room.\" In an interview, he said prosecutors and police not only stonewalled attempts to examine the case with a fresh eye but deliberately manipulated evidence.\n\nThat night in June 1966, there was no second-guessing of the police. After Lawless entered the bar, other detectives arrived to take over.\n\nLawless had another important case to resolve — a killing in another bar that night. But at that moment, as he stood on the bloody floor of the Lafayette Grill, he did not know how the two shootings would eventually be linked in the minds of prosecutors.\n\nSix hours earlier and five blocks away from the Lafayette Grill, another bartender had been shot to death.\n\nThe death of Leroy Holloway, 48, the bartender-owner of the Waltz Inn, bore three distinct parallels to the Lafayette Grill shootings. Holloway was killed with a blast from a 12-gauge shotgun. The killer did not steal any money. And — perhaps most significant to prosecutors — Holloway's killer had a different skin color from his.\n\nHolloway was black. His killer was white.\n\nJim Lawless had spent much of the previous six hours collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses at the Waltz Inn. But unlike the Lafayette killings, the Waltz Inn case was relatively easy to wrap up.\n\nThe killer, Frank Conforti, 48, who had recently sold the bar to Holloway, had stormed into the Waltz Inn to confront Holloway about lax payments. Witnesses said Conforti and Holloway argued, and then Conforti left and went to his car.\n\nMinutes later, Conforti returned and without saying a word shot Holloway in the head, killing him instantly.\n\nPolice soon arrived, and escorted the handcuffed Conforti through a gauntlet of black residents to a waiting police car.\n\nConforti was eventually convicted of second-degree murder and spent almost 15 years in prison. \"I've lost track of him,\" said his lawyer, Joseph J. Vanecek of Wayne. \"But when he got out, he came by and thanked me.\"\n\nWhatever the motives, the clientele at the Waltz Inn and Lafayette Grill underscored a well-known fact of life in Paterson. Like much of America in 1966, Paterson was a city divided by color lines. When it came to taverns, whites had their neighborhood bars, like the Lafayette Grill, and blacks had theirs, like the Waltz Inn.\n\nThe Lafayette Grill was on what was considered a border of sorts, a line of streets and frame homes that was slowly being integrated by black and Hispanic residents. Lafayette bartender James Oliver was said to have excluded or discouraged black patrons, according to trial testimony.\n\nBut that may be more of an accident of social customs than an outright act of racism. Paterson police say the Lafayette Grill occasionally had black customers. Bill Panagia, 64 of South Hackensack, the son of owner Betty Panagia and an occasional bartender there, said he doubted there was a whites-only code, but \"every time I went in there, there were only whites.\"\n\nAdds John Artis: \"The Lafayette — the black contingent just didn't go there.\"\n\nTo go back 34 years in Paterson or many other American cities is to return to a time when America's racial crucible boiled with idealistic promise and fiery violence. Congress had passed landmark legislation to expand civil rights and social programs to eradicate poverty. But riots had erupted in Watts, Detroit — even in Paterson. And in Harlem, Malcolm X had been gunned down by three black men, one of whom was from Paterson. Newark's devastating riots were still a year away, the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. two years down the road.\n\nIn Paterson that night, police immediately suspected that the shooting of whites at the Lafayette Grill might have been an act of revenge for Leroy Holloway's killing at the Waltz Inn. Their suspicions were not just based on a hunch, though.\n\nAfter Holloway was pronounced dead, his stepson, Eddie Rawls, went to police headquarters. Speaking to an officer, he wanted to know what was being done on his stepfather's case.\n\nThe officer told Rawls not to worry. But Rawls was not satisfied, according to trial and grand jury testimony. As he left the police station, Rawls reportedly shouted that if police didn't handle the case properly, he would take matters into his own hands.\n\nEddie Rawls was a bartender at the Nite Spot, a tavern just five blocks from the Lafayette Grill, on 18th Street. The Nite Spot was Rubin Carter's favorite hangout. The place even had a special \"champ's corner\" for the popular boxer.\n\nFor John Artis, the Nite Spot also was a favorite place to dance.\n\nFor prosecutors, this mere coming together of Rawls, Carter, and Artis became the basis for what they later called their \"racial revenge theory\" to explain the killings at the Lafayette Grill. For Carter and Artis, the theory would become one of the cornerstones of a decision by a federal judge in 1985 to free them from prison.\n\nIt was party night for Rubin Carter, and time to dance for John Artis.\n\nOn Thursday, June 16, Carter spent the day assembling boxing equipment and packing his rental car, a 1966 white Dodge Polara with blue and gold New York plates. He was scheduled to fight in August in Argentina against Juan \"Rocky\" Rivero, and this would be his last chance to let loose before training camp.\n\nCarter's boxing career had suddenly reached a plateau. After four years of success, Carter lost a 1964 fight for the middleweight title. He would win only seven of his next 14 fights, losing six and tying one.\n\nBy Monday, he planned to be at a former sheep farm in Chatham, where he would begin the harsh physical regimen of running, weight lifting, and boxing that he would need to put his career back on track.\n\nCarter had dinner at his Paterson home with his wife at about 5 p.m., then put on an outfit that surely would attract attention — black pants, red vest, and white sport coat. With his shaved head and bushy goatee, he was one of the most recognizable residents of Paterson.\n\nArtis was also looking to have a good time. Two years earlier — June 17, 1964 — he had graduated from Paterson's Central High School, with an offer of a track scholarship to Adams State College in Colorado. One of his best friends was also heading to Adams to play football.\n\nBut only five weeks after graduation, Artis' mother died of kidney disease. Artis, an only child, remembers being devastated. \"It was pretty difficult,\" he recalls. \"My father and I were trying to regroup.\"\n\nArtis put off college and got a job driving a truck for a local food deliverer. He played semi-pro football with the Paterson Panthers and kept in shape. But most nights, he headed for a club where he could show off his dancing skills. \"My nickname was 'Dancing Boy,'\" said Artis.\n\nBy 1966, he felt he was ready to try college. \"My mom only got to the third grade, and my dad only made it to the ninth grade,\" said Artis. \"I would be the first to go to college.\"\n\nPlus, Artis was worried about being drafted into the Army and being sent to Vietnam. He had recently lost his student deferment and had been reclassified as 1-A for the draft. If he went to college, he wouldn't be drafted.\n\nOn the night of June 16, Artis put on a light blue mohair sweater with his initials monogrammed on the breast, light-blue pants, and gold suede loafers.\n\nWhat happened with Carter and Artis over the next six hours is open to all manner of speculation — even today.\n\nCarter and Artis, a decade apart in age, knew each other — both acknowledge that. But both say they did not know each other well. Prosecutors, however, say the two had spent considerable time together before June 16.\n\nPaterson's current mayor, Marty Barnes, who knew Carter and Artis in the 1960s, said the two \"didn't really hang together.\" Of Artis, Barnes said, \"I always called him a wannabe. He was a little too young.\"\n\nBy 1966, Carter was well known in Paterson — and not just as a boxer. Like many black athletes, he had begun to speak out on race relations.\n\nIn 1963, Carter went to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate for civil rights and to hear Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. In 1965, however, Carter opted not to march with King in Selma, Alabama, because he feared he couldn't adhere to King's strategy of non-violence.\n\nPerhaps most controversial, however, was a 1964 profile of Carter in the Saturday Evening Post just before his middleweight title fight. Among other things, Carter reportedly suggested to a friend that they \"get guns and go up there and get us some of those police.\"\n\nPaterson police would remember that.\n\nCarter was at the Nite Spot tavern, according to trial testimony, when Eddie Rawls arrived with the news of his stepfather's murder.\n\nWhat happened next is open to speculation. Prosecutors insist that Carter started talking about guns that had been stolen from him a year earlier — and that he suddenly wanted to find them. Carter denies this.\n\nCarter notes, however, that after the news of the murder of Rawls' stepfather, many blacks talked of a possible riot or some sort of trouble — \"a shaking,\" as Carter described it in his grand jury testimony.\n\nWhat both sides agree on is that nothing even remotely resembling a riot took place.\n\nSometime between 2 and 2:30 a.m., Carter and Artis found themselves together at the Nite Spot. Artis said he needed a ride home and remembers Carter telling him he had to \"earn\" his ride — meaning that Artis would have to drive Carter home, too.\n\nArtis recalls that he nodded. Carter flipped him the keys to his white Dodge.\n\nWhat emerged next is a tale with two distinct plots — or, as U.S. District Court Judge H. Lee Sarokin said in his landmark 1985 decision overturning Carter's and Artis' convictions, \"two dramatically different versions of events\" with evidence that is \"often conflicting and sometimes murky.\"\n\nWhat is known is that within minutes after Paterson police arrived on the gruesome scene at the Lafayette Grill, they were told by witnesses that the killers had escaped in a white sedan with blue and gold license plates.\n\nA radio call went out to Paterson police cruisers to be on the lookout for a white car. But as with other bits of evidence, this radio call was framed by a simple problem: What time did the call go out?\n\nEven today, no one is entirely sure.\n\nPolice say that just after the 2:34 a.m. call to headquarters about a shooting, a police cruiser heading toward the Lafayette Grill spotted a white car with New York license plates, followed by a black car, speeding along 12th Avenue in a direction that might have been heading toward Route 4.\n\nInstead of turning the corner and chasing the cars, the cruiser took a roundabout route by the Passaic River in what police later explained was an attempt to cut off the white car near the Paterson-Elmwood Park border. When the police cruiser arrived at the border, no car was in sight.\n\nDrifting slowly down Broadway back into the center of Paterson, the cruiser, driven by Sgt. Theodore Captor, again saw a white sedan with New York plates — Carter's car, with Artis at the wheel. Another man, John Royster, who has been described in trial records as something of a local barfly, was in the passenger seat. Carter was in the rear, lying on the seat.\n\nCaptor, who recognized Carter, politely told the three men that there had been a shooting, and then let Artis drive away. Captor then headed to the Lafayette Grill, where witnesses told of a getaway car with blue and gold license plates and a distinctive butterfly design for the rear lights.\n\nCaptor says this description fit Carter's car. He and his partner returned to the streets to try to find it.\n\nAround 3 a.m., Captor found the car — this time, with only Artis and Carter inside — at Broadway and 18th Street. Other police cars pulled up, and Carter and Artis were ordered to follow a police convoy back to the Lafayette Grill, about 10 blocks away.\n\nAgain, here is where the tales by the prosecution and defense split into distinctive sets of facts.\n\nWitnesses, including shooting victim Willie Marins, described the gunmen as light-skinned, thin, black men, both about 6 feet tall, wearing dark clothing, and with one having a pencil-thin mustache.\n\nCarter is 5-foot-7, Artis 6-foot-1. Carter was stocky and muscular, Artis angular, but not thin. Both have dark skin. Neither had a pencil-thin mustache, but Carter had a thick goatee.\n\nAnd both were dressed in light-colored clothing.\n\nBut at the scene, police were interviewing two other witnesses who would play integral — and controversial — roles in the case.\n\nPatricia Graham Valentine, then 23, and a waitress at a delicatessen across town near the courthouse, lived in an apartment one floor above the Lafayette Grill. Valentine says that when she heard gunshots and a woman's voice scream \"no,\" she looked out the window and saw two black men escape in a white car. The other witness, Alfred Bello, also 23, told police he was on the sidewalk outside the bar when two black men left the Lafayette and sped away in a white car.\n\nCarter's car seemed to match Valentine's and Bello's descriptions of the getaway car — right down to the distinctive butterfly description of the taillight chrome that both reportedly gave to police. But, again, there was one important difference.\n\nValentine and Bello said the rear lights lit up across the back of the getaway car. The taillights on Carter's Dodge Polara had a butterfly chrome setting, but they lit up only on the edges, not across the back. Another type of Dodge — the Monaco — had across-the-back butterfly lights.\n\nThis distinction — and a later reference in grand jury testimony by Valentine to a Monaco — later prompted Detective Richard Caruso to wonder if police might have been coaching witnesses on the scene to frame Carter. Caruso even made note of his concerns in a secret file — later dubbed \"The Caruso File\" — that was a subject of a bitter legal fight after Carter and Artis were convicted again for the Lafayette Grill killings in 1976.\n\nThe file was never made public because Judge Sarokin stepped in and set Carter and Artis free. But Caruso agreed to talk about its contents, and The Record obtained affidavits corroborating his findings.\n\nAmong other concerns, Caruso believed Valentine had changed her testimony to the police — \"hardened it,\" in police lingo — to adapt her description of the getaway car to Carter's rented Dodge. What also struck Caruso as being especially odd was that the police never bothered to photograph tire skid marks even though Valentine and another witness told police the getaway car screeched as it sped away. If the police were able to obtain photos of tire tracks, they could have compared them to Carter's car, said Caruso.\n\nWhat's more, even though police said they searched Carter's Dodge, Caruso discovered that they did not test the carpet for possible bloodstains from the killing scene. Caruso also noticed that shooting victim Willie Marins, who failed to identify Carter — even after Carter was brought to the hospital where he was being treated — was, in fact, familiar with Carter's face and should have recognized him.\n\nAnd finally, said Caruso, when he and others tried to question Valentine and other witnesses, they discovered that a Passaic County prosecution detective, Lt. Vincent DeSimone, may have been coaching them in ways that would implicate Carter.\n\n\"There was even a code word that we had to use that would indicate that a witness would be free to talk to us,\" said Caruso. \"The code meant that we had been cleared by DeSimone.\"\n\nDeSimone died in 1979. But his son and others doubt that he engaged in such tactics. \"The people involved in the prosecution are people of the utmost integrity,\" said Passaic's current prosecutor, Ronald Fava. \"They would never do anything unethical, much less participate in a framing.\"\n\nThe questions of police tactics would soon come to dominate almost every syllable of testimony by the other witness police encountered outside the crime scene, Alfred Bello — in part because of what he was doing on Lafayette Street at 2:30 a.m. when he lived several miles away in Clifton.\n\nBello told police he was walking down Lafayette Street to buy a pack of cigarettes when he heard shots and saw two black men with guns leave the bar and jump into the white getaway car with blue and gold plates and butterfly taillights.\n\nActually, Bello later admitted that he was trying to burglarize a nearby warehouse with a partner, Arthur Bradley, when he went for cigarettes and saw the gunmen and getaway car. His actions — to defenders of Carter and Artis, anyway — beg this question: Why would someone interrupt a burglary to buy cigarettes?\n\nAsked in a recent interview, former Paterson Deputy Chief Robert Mohl has an answer: \"Are you a smoker? If you are, you understand when you get the urge.\"\n\nBeyond that, however, Bello's actions seem odd.\n\nAlso odd — or morbid — is what Bello did before police arrived at the Lafayette. Bello stepped over the bleeding bodies and took $62 from the cash register. When police learned of this theft, they would pressure Bello to tell more about what he knew of the gunmen — while also promising him leniency.\n\nIn the minutes after the shootings, Bello told police only that the gunmen were black. Two months later, complaining of threats by friends of Carter, Bello told then-Sergeant Mohl that the man with the shotgun was Carter. Bello also admitted to Mohl that he and Bradley later returned to the warehouse after the Lafayette killings and broke in.\n\n\"My father had no use for Alfred Bello,\" said James DeSimone of Wyckoff, the son of the detective who promised leniency to Bello in exchange for his testimony identifying Carter and Artis as the gunmen. \"Alfred Bello was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nBut that night, with Carter and Artis on the scene of the killings, Bello was not identifying anything more than a getaway car that resembled Carter's Dodge. Carter's white jacket had no evidence of blood that might have spurted from the shooting victims. Neither did Artis' clothes. A police search of the Dodge at the scene turned up no guns, no bloodstains — nothing to indicate Carter and Artis were linked to the killings. Police never found the weapons.\n\nNonetheless, police ordered Carter and Artis to headquarters for questioning, this time by then-Lieutenant DeSimone.\n\nLooking back now, both sides in the case are still deeply split over whether police had any reason to be suspicious of Carter and Artis.\n\nCal Deal, a former reporter for The Herald-News of Passaic and Clifton, who covered the 1976 trial and befriended police and victims' families, now runs an anti-Carter website from his office in Fort Lauderdale, where he works as a graphics consultant for trial lawyers.\n\nDeal says he has traced the movements of Carter's car on the night of the shootings and concludes that Carter and Artis were the killers. \"If you study the evidence, it just makes sense,\" says Deal.\n\nOn the other side, Carter biographer James Hirsch says Carter's and Artis' movements actually prove their innocence. \"Rubin's behavior on that night is inconsistent with guilt,\" said Hirsch, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who shares royalties with Carter from his biography, \"Hurricane.\" \"If you believe that Carter did this, you have to believe that he and Artis would manage to get rid of the weapons and their bloody clothes, and casually drive around the streets of Paterson until police picked them up.\"\n\nHirsch contends that the expected behavior of killers would be to speed out of Paterson as quickly as possible — hence, the theory that police missed the real getaway car when they took a roundabout route to chase.\n\nNonsense, says Deal. \"What's the likelihood that there would be two white cars with blue and gold license plates in that part of Paterson at that hour?\"\n\nThe question still rings as lively today as it did 34 years ago.\n\nIt was just after 3 a.m. on June 17 when Carter and Artis arrived at Paterson police headquarters.\n\nBy 4 a.m., the two would be confronted by two pieces of damning evidence. Even though police searched Carter's Dodge at the Lafayette Grill, another search was conducted at police headquarters.\n\nIn the trunk, under some boxing equipment, police say they found an unused 12-gauge shotgun shell. On the floor of the front seat, they said, they found an unused .32-caliber cartridge.\n\nNeither the shotgun shell nor the pistol bullet would match those in the shootings, but the fact that they were the same calibers as the killers' weapons heightened police suspicions of Carter and Artis.\n\nBut Carter's and Artis' defense lawyers became suspicious for their own reasons. Although the police say they found the shotgun shell and bullet the night of the shootings, they did not log the items in as evidence until five days later. In later trials, the defense would suggest that the shotgun shell and bullet were planted by the police. \"Whatever happened to bag and tag?\" asked Fred Hogan, an investigator for the state Public Defender's Office, in referring to common police procedure to log evidence from a crime scene immediately and seal it in a plastic bag.\n\nHogan, who assisted Carter and Artis in their appeals, would later become a controversial figure himself. Prosecutors charged that he offered money to witnesses in exchange for their testimony — a charge that was never proven despite three grand jury investigations. Today, Hogan says he offered no money to witnesses. \"Absolutely not,\" said Hogan, still an investigator for the state Public Defender's Office. \"If I had done anything illegal or immoral or unethical, I would have been given two things — an indictment and a pink slip.\"\n\nBut that night, if police were suspicious of Carter and Artis, it's hard to fathom what happened in the hours after the shootings.\n\nPolice did not conduct paraffin tests to detect traces of burned gunpowder on the hands or clothes of Carter and Artis. Such tests were common in 1966, and in a June 29, 1966, appearance before a grand jury, Lieutenant DeSimone was asked why a test was not conducted.\n\n\"We do not have the facility to take a paraffin test at present,\" said DeSimone, adding that the authorities would have had to bring in an expert fairly fast before gunpowder residue had disappeared. Added DeSimone, \"With the time element, it would have proved naught.\"\n\nBut DeSimone and the police that day decided to bring in an expert to conduct lie detector tests.\n\nCarter and Artis were asked to take lie detector exams — and both agreed. Also, Eddie Rawls was brought to police headquarters for questioning and asked to take a lie detector test.\n\nEach side would later use the lie detector results — and immediate police reaction to them — to try to prove its case.\n\nIn a written report on the tests, obtained by The Record, Artis was said to have \"no knowledge\" of the Lafayette Grill shootings but had \"suspicions as to who was responsible.\"\n\nThe report, written by a polygraph expert brought in from the Elizabeth Police Department, said Carter did not participate in the killings \"but had knowledge as to who was responsible.\"\n\nEddie Rawls was the last to be tested. The report said that \"Rawls had done the shooting and/or had knowledge of it.\"\n\nWith Rawls, however, the report cautioned that the \"short test conducted on Rawls was not conclusive because of the fact that Rawls was in a state of fatigue.\"\n\nFive days later, Rawls was asked to take the test again, but he refused. Later, he would be implicated — but never charged — in trying to help arrange for witnesses to offer false alibis for Carter and Artis. He would also refuse to testify, telling prosecutors through his lawyer that if subpoenaed, he would cite his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\nWhat's more — and adding to the controversy — another polygraph report that turned up in 1976 tied Carter and Artis to the killings. Carter's and Artis' lawyers say the 1976 report is a forgery.\n\nRawls was never arrested, but that didn't ease suspicions. In the 1976 trial, Prosecutor Burrell Ives Humphreys said, \"Eddie Rawls is all over this case,\" and he theorized that Carter and Artis hid the weapons at Rawls' house.\n\nHumphreys and DeSimone were so convinced of Rawls' involvement that they obtained a court order in 1976 to dig up the grave of Rawls' murdered stepfather to see if the guns had been hidden in the coffin. No guns were found.\n\n\"He's probably a co-conspirator,\" said former Paterson Deputy Police Chief Robert Mohl, \"but I can't prove it.\"\n\nSaid Carter's biographer: \"Eddie Rawls is definitely the wild card.\"\n\nToday, Eddie Rawls' whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAlfred Bello and Arthur Bradley have also slipped from view.\n\nAfter testifying in 1966 that Carter and Artis were at the Lafayette Grill, Bello and Bradley both recanted their testimony to Fred Hogan in 1974 — thus setting in motion a series of legal steps that led to a new trial.\n\nIn the 1976 retrial, Bello withdrew his recantation and said Carter was at the scene with a shotgun. Bradley refused to testify again for the prosecution. In 1981, Bradley told a court that he had \"no memory\" of what happened that night in 1966 at the Lafayette Grill.\n\nCarter's and Artis' lawyers went on to other cases, including assisting on appeals with the Baby M surrogate mother case. Artis' first lawyer, Arnold Stein, became a judge.\n\nSeveral members of the prosecution teams also became judges — namely Humphreys, Vincent Hull, Ronald Marmo, and Fred Devesa.\n\nH. Lee Sarokin, the federal judge who set Carter and Artis free, retired and is now living in California. He told colleagues he inquired about playing himself in the recent film on the case, but was turned down by the movie producers.\n\nBefore he died in 1979, Vincent DeSimone wrote a memoir of his experiences in the case with a retired Paterson journalist. The memoir, which was never published, was titled \"The Media Meddlers.\"\n\nPatricia Valentine now lives in Florida, and recently released a statement through the anti-Carter website saying that there is \"absolutely no doubt in my mind\" that the car she identified 34 years ago on Lafayette Street was Carter's. \"Rubin Carter is an evil man in love's clothing,\" said Valentine.\n\nThe Lafayette Grill is now called Len's Place. Today, its clientele mostly reflects the neighborhood of Hispanics and other immigrants who have moved into Paterson.\n\nAfter the killings, the Panagia family never reopened the Lafayette Grill. Owner Betty Panagia refused to return, said her son, Bill Panagia. She died in 1984 of liver cancer.\n\nEach Christmas, Bill Panagia says he makes a special trip to a cemetery in Paramus and places a wreath on the grave of Jim Oliver, the bartender who took his mother's place that night at the Lafayette Grill.\n\n\"He was a very nice person,\" said Panagia.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/14/pa-grand-jury-report-catholic-clergy-sexual-abuse-names-details-catholic-dioceses/948937002/", "title": "Pa. priest abuse: List of 301 names, with details, from grand jury", "text": "On Aug. 14, Pennsylvania released a statewide grand jury report on what the state attorney general's office called an \"honest and comprehensive accounting of widespread sexual abuse by more than 300 priests.\"\n\nThe report, more than 800 pages long, lists the name of 301 priests and provides details into specific accusations.

Gillespie. The victim reported that, while he was an altar boy at about the age of ten at St. Joseph's in Girardville, Gillespie began grooming him for future abuse.\n\nThe victim reported that he stayed the night at Gillespie's residence on several occasions. The victim reported that Gillespie would drink alcohol during the sleepovers. The victim recalled an occasion when Gillespie gave him cold medication and in addition had him drink alcohol.

Terms such as \"sick leave\" or \"health leave\" were often used to reference an absence from ministry related to child sexual abuse.\n\nRichard J.

In 1980, three separate complaints were made against him. The complaints asserted that Soderlund had engaged in sexual acts with three different children. The children were aged 12 to 13 years old. The Diocesan record, a \"summary of case\" relating to Soderlund, generalized the sexual conduct without referencing specific acts or crimes.\n\nOn June 11, 1980, a meeting was held at the Chancery during which photo albums were examined depicting nude photographs of a young boy engaged in sex acts with Soderlund. Soderlund admitted to Chancery officials that he engaged in sexual activity with the three young boys. While documents created at the time of the admission minimized the conduct, the facts became available through a detailed account of the abuse obtained from a victim in 1997 by the Diocese. The victim reported that: he was not a willing participant, but Soderlund threatened to harm or kill him.\n\nSoderlund also took pictures of the victim engaged in sexual acts and threatened to use them to embarrass him. Soderlund offered to leave the priesthood if the victim would go away with him. The victim then indicated that he knew of many other boys who were victimized by Soderlund.\n\nIn 2009, Soderlund, now living in Dubois, Wyoming, within the Diocese of Cheyenne was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to incarceration for two to five years for sexual exploitation of children and possession of child pornography on his computer. He is a registered sex offender in Wyoming.\n\nHenry E.

On April 29, 2004, Yarrosh was removed from priestly ministry and entered St. John Vianney Hospital for evaluation and treatment. 2004, the Pennsylvania State Police filed charges against Yarrosh, specifically, 110 counts of sexual abuse of children after discovering hundreds of child pornography photos, books, magazines, videos, and DVD's in his possession. As law enforcement began its prosecution, Diocesan Support Services conducted an audit and determined that Yarrosh embezzled approximately $23,000.00 from the parish.\n\nCharges were filed related to this theft. On April 27, 2005, Yarrosh entered a plea of guilty to charges of theft and possession of child pornography. Yarrosh was sentenced pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement to imprisonment for three to 23 months, $250.00 in fines, and restitution to the parish.\n\nOn July 21, 2005, Yarrosh left St. Francis Villa and moved into a motel.

The victim began regular counseling sessions with Zmijewski.\n\nZmijewski proposed a course of alternative treatment. He directed the victim to come to his personal residence where he could help the victim through hypnosis. The victim complied and attended four hypnosis sessions with Zmijewski at his residence. After the first three attempts were unsuccessful by Zmijewski to hypnotize her, she agreed to a fourth session. In an effort to expedite her \"treatment,\" she faked hypnosis during her fourth session. While she pretended to be hypnotized, Zmijewski instructed her to take off one piece of clothing after another. The victim was scared and complied until she was nude. Zmijewski then left the room for a short period of time and upon his return, he instructed the victim to get dressed.

In the summer of 1984, Gross resigned from teaching at St. Francis School in Minersville, Schuylkill County.\n\nIn the narrative of his last evaluation from June 1984, the victim also reported that he was sexually abused by a Carmelite priest named Father David Connell and physically abused by a Carmelite brother named Timothy Johnson while attending Nativity High School. The abuse was reported to the Provincial of the Carmelites, Father Michael Kissane, in October 2007. The victim stated that his family's house had burned down and the Carmelites took him and his brother in and had them live in a priory. During the time he was living in the priory, the victim was sexually abused by Connell. The victim remembered drinking juice that Connell gave him and the next memory the victim had was waking up in his own bed naked, with Connell in the room. The victim had no memory of the prior evening but, on waking, he was bleeding from his rectum.\n\nThe victim told Johnson he was going to also report the abuse to the police. Johnson told the victim not to report the abuse to the police but the victim insisted on reporting. At this point Johnson began to severely beat the victim with a big leather belt and told the victim that, if he reported the abuse to the police, he would beat him even worse.\n\nMichael S.

The grand jury has found documents that the Diocese of Hawaii and possibly the Diocese of Erie knew Father Hannon had admittedly abused at least twenty youths between ages 12 and 19.\n\nOf the eight victims acknowledged by the Diocese of Erie, one is categorized as \"claim denied, not verified\" based upon a denial by Hannon. This victim was abused in Hawaii and occurred when Hannon was visiting the victim’s parents. While tucking her into bed, he allegedly fondled her under her underpants.\n\nWhen the victim was interviewed in 2004, the Diocese of Hawaii found her “extremely credible.” But the Diocese of Erie sided with Hannan, as he had previously admitted to abusing only boys. Hannon denied abusing females stating, “they do not have a penis.”\n\nThere are eight known victims within the Diocese of Erie.

Bishop Trautman detailed that the victim was a junior at Mercyhurst Preparatory when she was targeted by Hudock. This sexual abuse occurred in several different locations within the victim's parish community. Trautman documented that Hudock and the victim had engaged in kissing prior to a trip to Wasington, D.C. Records revealed that Hudock groped and kissed the victim on numerous occasions, and it was reported he showed he pornography.\n\nIn 2008, the victim was having a difficult time dealing with the psychological issues from being victimized by Hudock.

Jerge in early 1989. That year, he was sent for psychological therapy. In the fall of 1989, he was released and signed an aftercare contract that restricted his contact with young boys. He was placed back into ministry at St. John the Evangelist.\n\nIn 1991, Jerge had a meeting with several members of the clergy where concern was voiced about him violating his post-care contract. Bishop Trautman re -assigned Jerge to St. Francis Xavier parish.\n\nOne victim is well-documented by the ministry. He was a high school sophomore when Jerge took him on trips along and fondled him on multiple occasions. Later in the victim’s life, he was blackballed from employment and blocked from attempts to be admitted to seminary. The grand jury found documentation that Bishop Trautman personally instructed school administrators not to hire the victim, noting that he might be homosexual and might have attempted suicide. It is also noted that the Diocese paid at least $1,200 of the victim’s counseling fees.\n\nAnother victim stated that he was sexually abused by Jerge between approximately 1981 and 1985. He stated that all of the assaults took place in Jerge’s car. The victim made his history of abuse known to Trautman in 2003 and obtained an attorney. A letter stated Trautman advised Jerge to consider both legal and canonical counsel. According to the letter, Trautman called the District Attorney of Erie County to tell him of the situation and assure him of their compliance with the applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nStephen E.

When he said he did not have the proper clothes, Kondzielski suggested that they lift weights naked. They then proceeded to lift weights together while they were naked. When he told his parents about the naked weight lifting incident, they were shocked and told him to stay away from Kondzielski.\n\nWhen confronted with this allegations, Kondzielski claimed he did not remember the incident, but did not deny it because it could have happened.\n\nGerard Krebs\n\nWhere he served:\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Secondary Education Venango Christian, High School, Oil City, PA\n\n7/26/1964 - 6/3/1970: Weekend Assistant, St. Stephen's, Oil City, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Parochial Vicar, Our Lady Queen of the Americas, Conneaut Lake, PA\n\n6/3/1970 - 9/8/1970: Resident, St. Stephen's Rectory, Oil City, PA\n\n9/8/1970 - 12/6/1978: Parochial Vicar, Erie, St. John the Baptist\n\n12/6/1978 - 1/27/1983: Pastor, Holy Cross Church, Brandy Camp, PA\n\n1/27/1983 - 6/30/1990: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n3/1/1990 - 5/4/1990: Health Leave, Guest House, Rochester, MN\n\n6/30/1990 - 1/6/1992: Pastor, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 12/31/2003: Director of RCIA, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/6/1992 - 2/4/1994: Resident, Blessed Sacrament, Erie, PA\n\n2/4/1994 - 3/27/2004: Resident, St. Joseph/Bread of Life, Erie, PA\n\n4/10/1996 - 10/1/1996: Chaplain, Soldiers & Sailors Home\n\n11/17/1996 - 5/8/1997: Weekend Assistant, St. Patrick, Erie, PA\n\n11/22/1996 - 12/31/2003: Director of Activities/Coming Millennium, Diocesan Office, Erie, PA\n\n1/1/04 - 5/25/2005: Retired, Priest Retirement Residence, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: Three known victims came forward indicating that they were sexually abused by Father Gerard Krebs.\n\nOne victim alleged that Krebs led him through \"a series of sexual rituals to both prove my faith and the fact that I was not a homosexual.\n\nThe grand jury found no documentation indicating that law enforcement was ever notified about any of Krebs interactions with his victims.\n\nJerry (John) Kucan\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1952-1954: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1954-1961: St. Joseph's, Bethlehem, PA\n\n1961-1972: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1972-1973: Our Lady of Peace Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1973-1977: St. Anthony's, Sharon, PA\n\n1977-1978: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1978-1979: Beaver Falls Friary, Beaver Falls, PA\n\n1979-1982: St. Mary's, Steelton, PA\n\n1982-1985: St. Jerome' s, Chicago, IL\n\n1985-1986: Sacred Heart, Milwaukee, WI\n\n1986-1988: St. Anthony's, Chicago, IL\n\n1988-1994: St. Augustine' s, West Allis, WI\n\n1994-1995: Sacred Heart, Chicago, IL\n\n1995-2005: St. Anthony's Friary, Chicago, IL\n\nSummary: In February of 2005, a 29 year old man wrote a letter to the Diocese of Erie in which he stated that he had attended St. Anthony's School in Sharon, Pennsylvania and that in\n\n1974 he began serving midnight mass. Victim #1 stated that \"Father Jerry\" began an inappropriate relationship with him at that time. They would have special meetings together. Kucan told the victim that if he ever told anyone about their relationship, his mother would lose her job in the school kitchen and he would be kicked out of school. The victim wrote in the letter that he would go to confession weekly to confess his sins and that Kucan would tell him that the slate was wiped clean.\n\nKucan would perform oral sex on the-then eight year old. The letter also alleged that Kucan would have a brother in a brown robe present on some occasions and that this brother would also perform oral sex on the victim.\n\nFather Kucan was taken out of the ministry in March 2005, when the Order received its first complaint against him. The Order settled with the victim filing the complaint. The file note also indicated that Kucan was then in his mid- eighties and in the early stages of dementia.\n\nThere is nothing contained in this file that shows that any actual correspondence between the Church and the District Attorney occurred.\n\nLouis Lorei\n\nWhere he served:\n\n9/1981 - 9/1985: Pastor, Our Lady of Peace, Erie, PA\n\nUnknown: Possibly Gannon University\n\nSummary: In December 2009, Father Mark Hoffman called the Bishop's office to report an allegation involving child sexual abuse by Monsignor Louis Lorei. The parents of a boy had approached him to report that their son stated he \"was touched by Monsignor Lorei\" in the early 1980's. Bishop Trautman later met with the victim.\n\nThe victim stated that about 1980 or 1981, he was a student, roughly age 11 to 13, at Our Lady of Peace school. He was also an altar server during early mass with Lorei. On one occasion, Lorei invited him into the rectory and into his bedroom. Lorei had the victim sit on the bed while Lorei sat next to him and hugged and kissed him on the lips. This would occur several days in a row, stop, and then begin again. The victim eventually refused to serve mass with Lorei.\n\nLorei was soon removed by then -Bishop Murphy. In his own handwritten words, Trautman expressed the personal belief that Lorei' s sudden departure may likely have been indicative of some kind of significant event. Trautman offered the victim counseling services. Financial assistance was also discussed. In a memorandum dated March 30, 2007, Hoffman also documented an additional victim of Lorei. Hoffman found out through the father of the second victim that his son was allegedly abused by Lorei. The victim reportedly described the incident during a United Methodist retreat in 2000.\n\nA small note in the file states \"Review Board found no merit in processing since supposed victim did not come forth even after requests.\"\n\nIt is unknown who the request refers to.\n\nSalvatore P. Luzzi\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/09/1962 - 8/29/1968: Faculty, Venango Christian High. Residence at St. Joseph, Oil City, PA\n\n8/28/1968 - 8/28/1969: Sp.

Luzzi was moved to St. Mark's Seminary, where he filled several roles. Over the course of his 30 year ministry, he was accused of sexual misconduct by eight male victims ranging in age from early teens to early twenties. Some of these victims were groped, inappropriately kissed, hugged, and/or fondled. He also faced allegations of responsibility for the suicide of a former student/victim.\n\nLuzzi worked extensively with young would-be priests at St. Mark's where he and fellow priest Leon Muroski served as Spiritual Directors to the seminarians. Luzzi's inappropriate touching and fondling of at least two seminarians prompted the Diocese to settle with those seminarians for large sums of money. The first former Seminarian's case was settled in civil court for $34,500 and this individual received several thousand dollars over the course of the many years that the Diocese paid for his counseling and medication costs.\n\nSeveral other former juvenile victims of Luzzi received letters or phone calls of apology from the Diocese. These victims were counseled by the Diocese through correspondence or in person interviews wherein Luzzi's behavior was dismissed as \"Sal's way of expressing himself and his \"touching approach\" to ministry was attributed to his Italian upbringing.\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Trautman sent both Luzzi and Muroski to St. Luke's Institute for therapy. The Diocese publicly announced that Luzzi was going on an extended sabbatical for \"personal, spiritual and academic growth.\" Once Luzzi was discharged, the Bishop welcomed him back into pastoral ministry by letter on February 14, 1995. However, the welcome also came with several conditions and a Penial Precept, a formal notification in the church that restricts ministry.\n\nTrautman directed Luzzi to refrain from all contact with youth under 19 years of age and to avoid travel and social interaction with such parishioners. Later that same year, in September 1995, Trautman had Luzzi' s faculties as a priest removed and Luzzi began residing in a private residence, where he remains today.\n\nRicahrd D. Lynch\n\nWhere he served:\n\n6/01/1963 - 5/26/1972: Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n5/26/1972 - 2/18/1983: Headmaster, Secondary Education Bradford Central Christian High School, Bradford, PA\n\n2/18/1983 - 8/30/1999: Pastor, Erie Holy Rosary, Erie, PA\n\n1984-1994:Dean, East Erie Deanery, Erie, PA\n\n8/31/1999 - Death: Pastor, St. Mark's the Evangelist, Erie, PA\n\nSummary: The victim claims Lynch slammed him into the wall and this resulted in a trauma to his head.\n\nIn a letter dated June 3, 2016, the victim stated that he wanted to write the Bishop to get some things off his chest. He alleged that Father Richard Lynch was responsible for the sexual abuse that he went through while attending Bradford Central Catholic Christian High School 1978-1979. He said he told Bishop Trautman about some physical abuse, but was too ashamed to talk about the sexual abuse.\n\nDaniel Martin\n\nWhere he served:\n\n1943 - 1945: Parochial Vicar, Sacred Heart, Sharon, PA\n\n1945 - 1962: Faculty, Erie Cathedral Preparatory High School, Erie, PA\n\n1948 - 1962: Assistant Headmaster, Erie Cathedral Preparatory, Erie, PA\n\n1950-1962: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College\n\n1962-1970: Pastor, St. Boniface, Kersey, PA\n\n1962-1970: Headmaster, Elk Co.

Calvary, Erie, PA\n\n1987: Chaplain, Mercyhurst College for Religious women\n\n2003: Blessed Sacrament, Residence\n\nSummary: Monsignor Daniel Martin was a priest the in the Diocese of Erie for 43 -three years who faced two known allegations of sexual abuse. The grand jury's review of his files found very little documented evidence of his abuse of a teenager who was an alter server in his parish. That victim would go on to become a priest himself and appeared in front of the grand jury to tell his story.\n\nHe reported that when he was upset over the troubles of his life, he would seek Martin's counsel. He testified that Martin sexually fondled him on at least sixteen occasions between the ages of sixteen and nineteen.\n\nOther victims came forward with similar encounters.\n\nRedacted – pending litigation\n\nThe name of the priest, where he served and the exact incident was entirely redacted in the grand jury report.\n\nLeon T.

This ministry lasted from 1982 until1995, but was abruptly halted when in the early 1990s Muroski was accused of sexual misconduct while he was a Spiritual Director at the seminary. Muroski was sent to St. Luke's Institute in Suitland, Maryland, for individual psychotherapy in 1994 after he admitted to inappropriate contact with the seminarians under his watch. These seminarians were all male, eighteen to twenty-three-year olds, when Muroski would counsel them. This counselling included allegations of full body massages, kissing, masturbation and fondling of the seminarians' buttocks and genitals. Muroski would eventually be placed back into ministry after therapy at St. Luke's and served in the Diocese of Erie and in The Christophers program in New York City.\n\nIn 2001, Muroski returned to the Diocese of Erie from The Christophers and was retired. Muroski was permitted to move into the retired priest home in 2002, which is where he still resides. In 2016, the Diocese rostered a list of all the retired clergy living in the home and made it public. Muroski was not listed as a resident. It was at this residence that the grand jury found him living in 2017, however.\n\nEdmundus Murphy\n\nNo further details regarding where he served were provided.\n\nSummary: On December 21, 2007 an e-mail communication was sent to Monsignor Robert Smith, Vicar General of the Diocese of Erie from the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Ilinois. The purpose of the e-mail was to inform Smith that a victim was sexually abused by a staff member while he was a minor at Sacred Heart High School in 1964. This school was operated by the Society of the Divine Word Missionaries in Girard.\n\nThe victim claimed that during the summer between his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Brother Edmundus Murphy, who was 33 years of age at this time, was the wrestling coach at the school. Murphy encouraged the victim to join the team and, under the pretense of teaching him some wrestling moves, the two wrestled naked \"as the ancient Greeks and Romans did.\" The victim alleged that during these \"wrestling\" sessions he was sodomized by Murphy.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the victim asked Murphy what he was doing and, according to the victim, Murphy sat on the floor and began to cry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation found no documentation that the Diocese notified local law enforcement or the District Attorney's Office about Murphy's behavior.

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/11/john-seigenthaler-tennessean-editor-dies/12531011/", "title": "Prominent editor, activist John Seigenthaler dies at 86", "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — John Seigenthaler, a legendary Tennessee journalist, intimate confidant to two near-presidents and fierce advocate for racial equality, died Friday.\n\nHe was 86.\n\nSeigenthaler passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by family.\n\n\"We celebrate his life — his devotion to social justice, his advocacy of human rights, and his enduring loyalty to friends and family,\" said his son, John Michael Seigenthaler. \"He was proud of his hometown, Nashville, and grateful for the opportunity to share his energy and passion with this community.\"\n\nAs a reporter for The Tennessean, Seigenthaler once saved a suicidal man's life on a bridge over the Cumberland River — a bridge eventually named after him. As the newspaper's longtime editor, he led coverage of the civil rights movement when most Southern newspapers, including the rival Nashville Banner, ignored the growing resistance to racial segregation in the South.\n\nSeigenthaler also exposed corruption in the Teamsters union, grave deficiencies in the state's mental health system and illicit activities of the Ku Klux Klan in Tennessee. And he inspired several generations of journalists to greatness.\n\nBut that would not have happened if gunshots had not ricocheted across a California hotel kitchen on June 5, 1968. Seigenthaler acknowledged in an interview before his death that if Bobby Kennedy had lived, and gone on to win the Democratic nomination and the presidency, Seigenthaler would have left journalism and gone to work for his dear friend in the White House.\n\n\"I'm afraid I would,\" he said in a lengthy interview. \"Truthfully, I would not have wanted to. But you can't say no to someone like that.\"\n\nBut Seigenthaler, described by author Thurston Clarke as one of a small group of people known as \"honorary Kennedys,\" was emphatic that it all turned out just right.\n\n\"I think journalism was the most important thing I could have done with my life,\" he said. \"I just can't think of anything I could have done with my life that would have been more meaningful.\"\n\nThat view is shared by countless thousands of friends and admirers whose lives were shaped by his work and who survive to mourn his passing.\n\n\"John Seigenthaler was not just an amazing student of history, he made history,\" said Phil Currie, retired senior vice president/news of Gannett Co. Inc.\n\n\"Throughout his life, John led the way as a journalist, as an editor and publisher at The Tennessean, as a vital member of and adviser in the Kennedy administration, as founding editor of the USA TODAY editorial pages, as an author, as a civil rights advocate and historical expert, as the creator of the First Amendment Center, and as an expert proponent of the First Amendment, emphasizing its importance to everyone.\n\n\"He was a great teacher, storyteller, inspiration and friend. John will be painfully missed, but his ideals and his enthusiasm for them will live on in hundreds of people who benefited from knowing and learning from him.\"\n\nA humble upbringing\n\nThe young John Lawrence Seigenthaler Jr., who once won a $25 war bond in a Father Ryan High School speech contest and who dutifully attended Catholic Mass, had no aspirations to be a world-renowned newspaper editor or to work for famous politicians. He wanted to be a teacher.\n\nHe was born July 27, 1927, to Mary Brew and John L. Seigenthaler, the oldest of eight siblings, four boys and four girls. They had a modest but comfortable upbringing in Nashville.\n\nSeigenthaler played softball, baseball and tennis in Centennial Park as a boy, recalling in a 1984 article that the park was also the go-to place for family picnics, feeding the ducks and where he experienced his first sorrow: \"My first dead duck, slain by some mean kid with a B.B. gun.\"\n\nHis siblings reported that at age 10, he would come home and read Shakespeare under the covers until 2 a.m.\n\nIn a nod to his future, he worked as editor-in-chief of The Panther, the school paper at Father Ryan, and on the yearbook staff.\n\nSeigenthaler served three years in the Air Force, and when he returned home in the spring of 1949, his father was dying of lung cancer.\n\nHis father, a building contractor, died later that year. (His mother, a state employee, died in 1989.)\n\nSeigenthaler attended George Peabody College for Teachers but never graduated. Instead he got a job from his uncle, Walter Seigenthaler, who was circulation director for The Nashville Tennessean and The Nashville Banner, as The Tennessean's lowest-paid reporter.\n\nLike all cub reporters, the young John Seigenthaler covered his share of routine police beat stories, Christmas parades, house fires and obituaries.\n\nOn a hot June day in 1953, he begrudgingly headed to Centennial Park to write a story about a concert being held there. On stage was a young and very pretty blonde named Dolores Watson, a classy big band singer.\n\n\"It was Father's Day, as a matter of fact, and I was singing a silly song,\" she recalled. \"The song was called 'Daddy,' and he made some silly comment on it in the newspaper.\"\n\nThe two were married in 1955.\n\nDolores Seigenthaler gave up her singing career when son John Michael was born, even though she was featured on national radio and television shows, singing with a bevy of big stars. But she took great pride in her husband's work.\n\n\"I think (John) made such a difference in so many lives,\" she often said. \"He helps them. It's wonderful. If he says he's going to do something, he does it.\"\n\nLocal author Alice Randall, who wrote \"The Wind Done Gone,\" said it was a marriage for the ages.\n\n\"The John and Dolores show, the John and Dolores reality, the John and Dolores love seemed miraculous,\" Randall said. \"He still called her 'baby.' There was still so much feistiness and glamour, and she didn't put up with anything from him. He saw family as the center — being a husband, being a father, being a grandfather.\"\n\nA journalist and a prankster\n\nWhen Seigenthaler began his journalism career, the South was experiencing the first hint of the movements to secure civil rights for black Americans and careers for women. The Tennessean had a newsroom full of talent, mostly men, loyal to one another and extremely competitive.\n\nNot only were they competing to win the lead story on the front page, they tried to out-prank one another. Seigenthaler was known as the master. He penned fake memos that looked as if they came from the editor, knowing which reporters would sneak a peek. He substituted raw eggs for boiled ones in the lunches of colleagues, a prank repeated for decades in the newsroom.\n\nHe also quickly became known as a guy who could get the story. He and a photographer tracked down a man and his wife who had faked their own deaths to flee with the insurance money. He won a national Headliner Award for that.\n\nAt least once Seigenthaler became part of the story: He pulled a suicidal man from a bridge over the Cumberland River. Although the man vowed never to forgive him, after spending time in a mental health ward, he thanked Seigenthaler and the two became friends. Earlier this year, that bridge was named for Seigenthaler.\n\nIn 1959, after a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University, he returned to Nashville and was promoted to the job of assistant city editor, then city editor and special assignment reporter.\n\nFlirting with politics\n\nDuring much of that period, Seigenthaler was flirting with a career in politics, not journalism. For two years, he moved in and out of The Tennessean newsroom, taking leaves to work with the Kennedy family in various positions, then returning.\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, there was much speculation about who would become his attorney general. JFK and his father wanted JFK's brother Bobby to do it. Bobby didn't want to. Seigenthaler was at breakfast at Ethel and Bobby Kennedy's house when the decision was made.\n\n\"Snow on the ground. House in Georgetown. Cold, cold, cold,\" he recalled. \"Reporters parked out front. The president reaches out and touches me on the hand, and talks to me for about 10 minutes, saying, 'I'm going to have a circle of advisers and I'm not going to know them. Here I am going to be dealing with great problems of great magnitude. I've got to have someone who has my best interests.' And when he gets through, it's really clear.\"\n\nThe president-elect got the coffee pot and refilled Seigenthaler's cup but not Bobby's. Then he said, \"That's it, general. Let's grab our balls and go.\" The group went out into the snow to talk to reporters. The president, Seigenthaler recalled, said, \"Bobby, you know there are photographers out there. Comb your hair.\"\n\nAnd so Seigenthaler became a member of the Kennedy inner circle. As attorney general, Bobby wanted loyal people next to him, too. He made Seigenthaler his administrative assistant in the U.S. Justice Department in 1961.\n\nIn February 1962, while Seigenthaler was still on Bobby Kennedy's staff, a fake story citing an anonymous source was planted in Washington and picked up by The Tennessean: John Seigenthaler was going to resign from Kennedy's staff to become the new Democratic National Committee chairman. Seigenthaler was traveling around the world with Kennedy when the \"news\" broke and so was not reached for comment.\n\nWhether it was bait set by Seigenthaler's supporters to lure him back to Nashville, or simply an ill-reported rumor, no one has ever revealed where it came from. The rumor ended March 21 of that year when Seigenthaler was named editor of The Tennessean at age 34.\n\n\"For 12 years, The Tennessean was my life,\" Seigenthaler said after the announcement. \"And now it is again.\"\n\nUnder his leadership, The Tennessean entered a renowned time. Journalists Seigenthaler either hired or worked with included author David Halberstam; Bill Kovach, former editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Jim Squires, former editor of the Chicago Tribune; Tom Wicker, former New York Times columnist; and author David Vise of the Washington Post.\n\nHalberstam, in an 1994 article, wrote: \"If there was a dominant figure on the paper in those days it was John Seigenthaler, who seemed to connect both cultures to each other. He was a local boy, son of a building contractor who had died young, and he was the oldest of eight children. There were Seigenthaler brothers and sisters placed all over Nashville, placed there, it seemed to me, for no other reason than to help him on stories.\"\n\nSeigenthaler sent a reporter undercover into Central State, Nashville's mental health hospital, to expose the abysmal conditions there.\n\nHe assigned reporters to probe conditions in the city workhouse, in nursing homes and migrant worker camps. He sent a reporter to live undercover for 18 months in the Ku Klux Klan. And he fought for open government records and meetings. Seigenthaler would never back off, no matter how many lawyers threatened him or how many times the newspaper was sued.\n\nReporters never had to learn the same lesson twice from Seigenthaler. If they did, they didn't last long.\n\n\"Early in my editorial-writing days, I wrote a piece about an accident in downtown Nashville,\" recalled Sandra Roberts, retired Tennessean opinion editor. \"I obviously thought the accident was particularly tragic, because I used that adjective three times in an 8-inch editorial. I was in John's office as he read it, and my redundancy — or laziness — didn't escape him.\n\n\"He read aloud, 'Tragic … tragic … tragic.' He then reached behind his desk to a bookshelf, grabbed a thesaurus and tossed it to me. I didn't make that particular mistake again.\"\n\nThe Kennedy connection\n\nSeigenthaler was not with Bobby Kennedy, his best friend and political hero, in Los Angeles when he was assassinated. He was 347 miles north with Kennedy's brother, Sen. Ted Kennedy, waiting for election returns in a Masonic Temple.\n\nHe had met Bobby Kennedy in 1957. That they became friends is not really that surprising. Here were two men, separated by two years in age, born to large Catholic families. They were of like mind politically and believed they were smart enough to change the world. Both believed social justice was worth the fight.\n\nKennedy met Seigenthaler because the young reporter had written a number of news stories about growing corruption in the organized labor movements, particularly involving Jimmy Hoffa and his Teamsters union. The next year, Kennedy was chief counsel for the Senate labor rackets committee, which investigated \"labor goon squad activity in Tennessee,\" according to one news report of the day.\n\nHoffa was indicted and tried, but the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.\n\nSeigenthaler got a tip that a Chattanooga judge was taking bribes from Teamsters union members. The story led to the judge's impeachment, trial and conviction by the state legislature.\n\nIt also led to a new federal grand jury, which indicted Hoffa and six others on charges of jury tampering. That case was tried in Chattanooga.\n\nKennedy recognized Seigenthaler's talent and in 1959 asked him to edit his book about the Teamsters, called The Enemy Within. Seigenthaler took a leave of absence from The Tennessean to do that, having just completed his Nieman Fellowship.\n\nAs attorney general, Kennedy wanted loyal people next to him. Seigenthaler became his point man in dealing with developing hysteria over civil rights.\n\nAfter Seigenthaler was named editor of The Tennessean, his relationship with the Kennedys didn't falter. Their story picks up again in 1968. Bobby Kennedy had resigned as attorney general and won a New York Senate seat by then. He traveled widely, and Seigenthaler sometimes went with him — to Vietnam and India, most notably, writing about his experiences.\n\nIn early 1968, rumbles began about whether Kennedy should run for president. Seigenthaler did not want him to, and told him so. He was afraid Kennedy couldn't beat then-President Lyndon Johnson, but Kennedy said he felt a moral imperative. He entered the race and asked Seigenthaler to run his campaign in Northern California.\n\nThat's where Seigenthaler was during the California Primary on June 4, 1968.\n\n'How the hell could this happen twice?'\n\nThe primary was key for Kennedy to win the Democratic nomination. Returns were four hours slow to come in that night, and the parties in L.A. and San Francisco, where Seigenthaler had opted to stay, were dragging.\n\nSeigenthaler's wife, Dolores, also was there. So was their then-12-year-old son.\n\n\"It was a typical San Francisco crowd,\" Seigenthaler recalled. \"Ted made one hell of a speech. Bobby died while Ted was speaking.\"\n\nThere was no Twitter to spread the word. No cellphones. Television reports of the shooting not long after midnight were coming in, and word spread through the crowd in San Francisco like a tsunami.\n\n\"It was chaos,\" Seigenthaler recalled. \"By the time I got back to the hotel, Ted had contacted the airport. Dolores rushed upstairs and packed.\"\n\nAn airplane was chartered. A helicopter took them to the hospital. Bobby Kennedy was on life support, and he was given last rites.\n\n\"You don't think you're a witness to history, because you're caught up in it,\" Seigenthaler said later. \"Sure, I thought what everyone in the country was thinking: How the hell could this happen twice? You want to say something, but there's not a damn thing you can say.\"\n\nSeigenthaler said he had no regrets. And, yes, he would have left journalism to become one of the president's men had things turned out differently. Instead, he painfully recounted what happened. The moment when \"victor was victim, promise and presumption had perished, dreams were shattered.\"\n\nThe assassination, he said, made him feel like \"the world had collapsed.\"\n\nHe remembered how calm and kind Ted Kennedy was to him, knowing how much Seigenthaler revered his brother. And he remembered the long train ride across the country.\n\n\"It was an Irish wake on a train,\" Seigenthaler said later. \"Miles of wall-to-wall people. Children saluting. Veterans. People waving flags.\"\n\nAnd on the train, dozens of grieving people, mostly men, drinking and wandering from car to car to share stories of their fallen hero, the man they were certain would have changed the world.\n\nSeigenthaler was a pallbearer at Robert Kennedy's funeral. He recalled when they arrived at Arlington National Cemetery and pulled the coffin out of the hearse:\n\n\"We stop. And suddenly they are singing, 'This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine,' \" he said, tears streaming down his face. \"And we got lost going up that hill. And the undertaker says, 'That was very good, gentlemen. But you went the wrong way.' \"\n\nThe fight for civil rights\n\nSeigenthaler championed racial equality, both as a journalist and in his job in the Kennedy administration.\n\nThe Tennessean and its staff became crusaders for civil rights early on. A Texas liberal named Silliman Evans bought the newspaper out of receivership in the 1930s. His views formed the political core that would remain there until John Seigenthaler's retirement.\n\nWith a newsroom full of cocky young egos spoiling for a good story, secure finances and family owners willing to take chances, it became one of the only Southern newspapers to aggressively cover the fight to end segregation. That was not always popular with hometown readers, particularly the old Southern guard.\n\nThe Tennessean covered the downtown lunch counter sit-ins and other stories, when other newspapers wouldn't, as the civil rights movement swept through the South.\n\nFor Seigenthaler, it was a learned passion. He was not proud that he ignored a lesson right under his nose as a youth. As he explained to an audience at Lipscomb University in 2009, he remembered his family's black maid as practically being his \"surrogate mother.\"\n\nYet when he would walk to the bus stop with her — he to go to a movie downtown and she to go to her North Nashville home — he didn't notice that she went to the back of the bus, while he sat up front.\n\n\"I grew up in that environment without seeing it. I never saw the injustice of their lives,\" he said.\n\nThat contrast between holding progressive social views in a segregated world where they were living quite comfortably was something he and Bobby Kennedy had in common. When Seigenthaler went to work for Kennedy, race riots and violence were becoming widespread.\n\nGroups of Freedom Riders were boarding buses at Southern universities to spread the nonviolent protest message they were using to desegregate lunch counters. They would drive to a city's bus station, go inside and try to use the segregated restrooms and buy food. In May 1961, it wasn't going well at all.\n\nThe first group of Freedom Riders left Washington, D.C., and made it to Anniston, Ala., before they were mobbed by Klan members. Their buses were burned. In Birmingham, Freedom Riders were jailed. Bobby Kennedy got word that another group, including Fisk and Peabody students, planned to leave from Nashville the next weekend.\n\nKennedy asked Seigenthaler to try to talk them out of it, but to no avail. So Seigenthaler, at Kennedy's direction, negotiated a deal with then-Alabama Gov. John Patterson that state troopers would protect the group between Birmingham and Montgomery. Local police were supposed to take over from there.\n\nSeigenthaler traveled to Birmingham from New Orleans, following the bus in a rental car with Justice Department attorney John Doar. There were troopers in cars guarding the bus, helicopters in the air and men with guns on the roadside. Seigenthaler said he believed it would be a \"walk in the park,\" with no problems.\n\n\"John and I stopped for breakfast, thinking the bus was not due for 45 minutes,\" Seigenthaler said later.\n\nBut the bus driver was terrified and \"made it an express run.\" Instead of stopping to allow challenges at lunch counters and bathrooms along the route, he drove straight to Montgomery. When Seigenthaler and Doar pulled into town, they noticed there were no police to be seen. Later, all local law enforcement and every ambulance driver would swear they were \"on call\" and unavailable.\n\nDoar and Seigenthaler pulled up near the bus station, rolled down the car windows, and \"you can hear the screaming. I can see baggage being tossed,\" Seigenthaler remembered. \"It's going to be bad. It is a teeming anthill of violence. These kids were just getting the hell beat out of them. The screams and shouts — you've never heard anything like it. They were wild. I almost ran over some black student. I'm in shock. I'm thinking, 'What in the hell am I going to tell Bob?' \"\n\nSeigenthaler saw two black girls get in a cab, but the black driver would not let their white friend get in. As Seigenthaler rushed down the sidewalk, he saw a man with a cigarette pack rolled up in his sleeve.\n\n\"As she backs away, he punches her in the face. As she turns, I see she is bleeding from the mouth. I thought, 'I can get them out,' \" Seigenthaler said.\n\nBut the girl said, \"Please, mister, I can handle it. I'm trained for this.\"\n\nSeigenthaler was kicked in the ribs and fell to the ground. That's all he remembered, thanks to the lead pipe used to crack him on the head.\n\n\"I was out for 25 minutes,\" he said. \"I never felt any pain. Never felt the blow. I didn't come to until I was in the front seat of the car.\"\n\nHe had borrowed a clean white dress shirt from Doar that morning.\n\n\"The first thing I saw was this shirt drenched in blood,\" Seigenthaler said. \"My first thought was, 'Doar's going to get pissed off.' \"\n\nKennedy sent 400 federal marshals to Montgomery, while Seigenthaler was taken to a hospital, drifting in and out of consciousness.\n\nA week later, more students headed out on the Freedom Rides, including 14 from Tennessee State University. Tennessee's governor expelled them, and they never graduated. In 2008, Seigenthaler helped Congressman John Lewis, himself a Freedom Rider, lobby to get those 14 students honorary degrees from TSU.\n\nIt was a sweet victory and one of his proudest accomplishments.\n\n\"They risked their lives to change the law,\" he said at the time.\n\nA newspaper's legacy\n\nThe Tennessean turned 100 in 2007, and Seigenthaler captured the essence of his agenda as its editor and publisher — a position he assumed in 1989 — in a piece he wrote for the commemorative edition. Beginning in 1938, the paper pushed an editorial agenda designed to enrich the quality of life for the Midstate region, he wrote, presenting on the editorial pages each day a list of prioritized challenges identified for extensive news coverage and editorial support.\n\nThat agenda changed over the years but included strong and integrated public schools, merging city and county governments, smog (from the days of coal burning to new EPA regulations), development of the Tennessee Valley Authority, recreational opportunities, interstate highways and organized labor. And, always, an involvement in elections and politics.\n\nRoberts, the retired opinion editor, said Seigenthaler had a commitment to a vital and involved editorial page. No matter how busy he was, \"He made the time to go over editorials, line by line, to have the editorials read to him when he was out of town, to work with the editorial board on crafting positions, to write many editorials himself, even to quibble about the use of specific words,\" she said. \"He believed in the power of ideas, and he believed that the editorial page had a responsibility to use that power to influence public debate.\"\n\nHis influence on issues, from key tax hikes to education reform, was unsurpassed by any other newspaper in the state. But Seigenthaler also changed the lives of individuals, time after time.\n\nFormer Mayor and Congressman Richard Fulton owed his first election to The Tennessean's dogged investigation of a corrupt ballot box scam.\n\nTennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander was the first Republican whom Seigenthaler ever endorsed, in the 1982 governor's race.\n\n\"I thought he was the better candidate, so I supported him,\" Seigenthaler said at the time.\n\nRole in Gore's political career\n\nProbably no one else living today has seen their life change more than Albert Gore Jr., who came to work as a reporter at The Tennessean in 1971.\n\n\"He was one of the most important teachers and mentors and role models in my life,\" said Gore, the former U.S. vice president. \"He had a passion for seeking the truth that pulled him and everyone working for him in an extremely powerful way toward the core truths about whatever subject was under investigation or being reported.\"\n\nGore, from Carthage, Tenn., was the son of U.S. Sen. Albert Gore Sr. and his wife, Pauline. He was disgusted by politics after seeing his father lose his 1970 re-election campaign because he voted against the Vietnam War.\n\n\"When I went to Vietnam in the Army, I felt that politics would be the very last thing that I ever did with my life,\" Gore recalled. \"When I came from Vietnam, I actually had absolutely no idea what I was going to do.\"\n\nHis wife, Tipper Gore, was working as a photographer at The Tennessean. She showed Seigenthaler some articles Gore had written while serving in the Army, which led to a reporting job offer.\n\n\"I loved it,\" Gore said. \"In the process, I began to see politics and public service through a completely different lens. Some of the things that had earlier caused me to feel disillusioned began to appear in my mind as things that needed to be exposed and fixed. It was because of John Seigenthaler that I really came back to thinking that maybe I had some contribution to make in that field.\"\n\nGore began writing editorials and taking classes at divinity and law school. Seigenthaler didn't mention politics to him until 1976.\n\n\"John called me at home on the phone and said, 'There's going to be a story in the paper that Joe Evins is going to announce his retirement after 30 years representing the old Fourth Congressional District,' which included Carthage. 'And I thought you'd want to know about that, and for what it's worth, I think you ought to run,' \" Gore said.\n\n\"I said thanks and put the telephone down and turned to Tipper and said, 'I think I'm going to run for Congress.' And she said, 'What?' I got all my friends together the next day, which was a Saturday, and I said I think I'm going to run for Congress, and they said, 'What?' And one or two days later, I walked out on the steps of the Smith County Courthouse and made my first speech running for Congress.\n\n\"He was that central to my life's trajectory. And he was that influential to me because of the respect he commanded and because of the force for good he represented.\"\n\nLove of books\n\nAlong with being a newspaper writer and editor, Seigenthaler also authored four books: A Search for Justice (1971), with former Chicago Tribune editor Jim Squires, Frank Ritter and John Hemphill of The New York Times; An Honorable Profession, co-edited with others; The Year Called Watergate; and, in 2003, James K. Polk\"\n\nHe had a deep and abiding relationship with other writers that led to a weekly public television show for Nashville Public Television called A Word on Words.\n\nIt began in 1972, when A Search for Justice was released. The book, about the trials of three assassins including Sirhan Sirhan, who shot Bobby Kennedy, was the subject of a public television interview. After Seigenthaler's appearance, he was asked if he would like to do a weekly show interviewing local and nationally known authors.\n\nHe jumped at the chance. Seigenthaler interviewed the famous and not-so-famous: Halberstam, John Lewis, Will Campbell, Marshall Chapman, Carol Higgins Clark and John Updike, to name a few.\n\nHe read every book. That's why, wife Dolores said, their bedsheets were stained with ink marks — he brought a book to bed almost every night, making notes about his upcoming interview.\n\nRecent years\n\nSeigenthaler may have slowed down in recent years, but not by much. He traveled routinely to Connecticut to see his son, daughter-in-law Kerry Brock and especially his beloved grandson. In fact, when Jack starred in a school production of Bye Bye Birdie, his grandparents flew up to see every single show.\n\nOn the political front, Seigenthaler led the presidential debate panels during the last election and maintained an office at the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University until his death. He hosted panels and discussion groups. He led the effort to raise money to restore Centennial Park and worked on the John Seigenthaler Chair of Excellence at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nOnce a brutally competitive tennis player, Seigenthaler had to quit because of a knee injury, so instead, he played golf every day the weather and his health were decent.\n\nFor years Seigenthaler made fun of newspaper chains, proudly bragging that he worked for a family-owned newspaper. But when Gannett Co. bought The Tennessean in 1979, he glibly quipped that he had \"been sold into chains.\"\n\nHe turned it into a new life experience and challenge, insisting that the chain leave The Tennessean alone editorially and operationally. For many years, he would urge reporters to spend freely when they traveled. His belief was that, at budget time, it was best to show how much it cost to do things his way, rather than cut corners to make the bean-counters happy.\n\nWhen Gannett CEO Al Neuharth decided to launch a new national paper called USA TODAY in 1982, it was John Seigenthaler he asked to create a unique style of editorial page. There, he met John J. Curley, the paper's editor.\n\nFor a decade, Seigenthaler did the unthinkable: Monday through Thursday or so, he was in Washington, D.C., supervising a new back-and-forth-style editorial page that featured not just \"experts\" and what the paper's editors believed, but real voices from the community.\n\nThen, he would fly home to Nashville and run The Tennessean. He was on the phone with both constantly, Dolores and secretaries on both ends spending endless hours making scheduling arrangements.\n\nSomehow, he made it all work.\n\n\"I was honored to work closely with John Seigenthaler during the planning and start-up days of USA TODAY. Since we had offices next to each other, I saw a lot of him and listened to the editorial page discussions on issues, which he moderated. Seig was effective in getting all of the participants to think through their positions and reach a logical conclusion,\" said Curley, retired chairman and chief executive officer of Gannett Co. \"He was able to do first-rate work at USA TODAY and effectively run The Tennessean. Seig was a great editor, great publisher and great person and an effective advocate for the First Amendment.\n\nSeigenthaler retired as publisher, chairman and CEO of The Tennessean, and from USA TODAY, in 1991.\n\nAt retirement, he called being a newspaper editor \"the greatest job in American journalism.\"\n\nBut he didn't really retire. He founded the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University that same year, some say with a push from his wife so he wouldn't drive her nuts. He created a presentation on the First Amendment that he used as he traveled. A $3 million First Amendment Studies chair was created in his name at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nA brilliant storyteller, Seigenthaler accumulated many in his lifetime. He once danced with Tina Turner, had a bit part in Shakespeare's Othello, and counted the late Johnny Cash as a confidant. Those who knew him well loved him both as a journalist and a mentor — and their feelings ran deep.\n\n\"John was an advocacy newsman, but he reported every story fairly,\" said Tom Ingram, a GOP political operative and public relations guru, and also one of Seigenthaler's closest friends. Ingram worked as a reporter at The Tennessean from 1965 to 1972.\n\n\"He changed my life. This guy is my mentor, my hero, my friend. He is why I am who I am.\"\n\nHow perfect, then, that Seigenthaler's favorite quote from his own friend and mentor, Bobby Kennedy, was this one:\n\n\"Few will have the greatness to bend history, but each of us can work to change small events, and those acts can write the history of our generation.\"\n\nMourners can pay their respects for Seigenthaler on Sunday at the First Amendment Center on the Vanderbilt University campus.

Ohio St.\n\nWe moved to our current location, 307 N. Pennsylvania St., in 1907. On Sept. 29, we're moving again, into spiffy new offices in Circle Centre mall. The guiding concept for the new space is openness.\n\nWe will miss our former home, even though the place was strange and confusing. From the street, The Star building looked like most other buildings, uniform with a mid-century modern facade. But it actually was several buildings, purchased separately, that had been cobbled together — \"at least three,\" said Cathy Knapp, a Star researcher since 1969.\n\n\"More like four or five,\" said Dawn Mitchell, who coordinates the online feature Retro Indy.\n\nThe building is a warren of hallways and big rooms and small rooms. It doesn't all match up, floor-level-wise. To get from the newsroom to editorial you went down five steps. But to get from the newsroom on the second floor to the cafeteria, just one floor up, you had to go up two flights of stairs — 22 steps.\n\nAt one time, you could get from the news department, where most reporters and editors sit, to the photo department via a dizzying spiral staircase. It saved space but at least one person — photographer Joe Vitti — broke his ankle on it. About 2011, the spiral staircase was removed.\n\nThen there are the elevators. Some go to all six floors, while others stopped at four. Visitors frequently were puzzled by the layout, and that made it impossible for them to storm out in a huff, if they had a mind to.\n\nStill, despite its shortcomings, 307 N. Penn was a memorable old place.\n\n1907: The same year The Star moves into 307 N. Penn, it hires an artist and cartoonist. His name was Charles Bacon \"Chic\" Jackson, and his \"Bean Family\" comic strip runs from 1913 until 1934, when Jackson died.\n\n1910: The Star hires its first photographer and publishes its first locally snapped photographs.\n\n1914: Mary E. Bostwick joins The Star staff. She becomes sort of famous, performing stunts like being the first woman to loop the Speedway and entering a balloon race. Her advice for making it in \"a man's world\": \"You have to drink with them, swear with them and jump on the back of the police wagon with them.\" Bostwick keeps a loaded pistol in her desk.\n\n1925: Corbin Patrick joins The Star; becomes drama critic, 1941; retires, 1988, having reviewed, by his count, 5,000 plays.\n\n1927: Robert P. Early joins The Star as a reporter. He is named managing editor in 1960. As such, Early decreed that no photos of rats or snakes could appear in The Star, nor could the word \"stink.\" (Nearly a half-century later, in January 2004, Neill Borowski, named assistant managing editor for news, issues an edict that no sentence can start with \"it.\")\n\n1942: Robert Clark, a junior at Tech High School, takes a job as a messenger in The Star's advertising department. Years later, after he changes his name to Robert Indiana and becomes a famous artist, he says he wishes he could have worked in news instead of advertising.\n\n1944: Eugene C. Pulliam buys The Star.\n\n1945: Lowell Nussbaum is hired to write human interest stories; he writes repeatedly about how nice zoos are and how Indianapolis should have one. He heads a fundraising drive that in 1964 leads to Indianapolis' first zoo, a modest affair on 30th Street but a zoo nevertheless, Indianapolis' first.\n\n1946: Pulliam buys The Indianapolis News, an afternoon paper.\n\n1948: The Star's wise-cracking cartoon character that appeared daily, \"Jim Crow,\" undergoes a name change, to \"Joe Crow.\"\n\n1951: The Star changes its motto from \"Fair and First\" to \"Where the Spirit of The Lord Is, There Is Liberty\" II Cor. 3:17.\n\n1960: John F. Kennedy, running for president, visits The Star building — alone, no entourage — to meet with Pulliam. It is no sale: The Star endorses Kennedy's Republican opponent, Richard Nixon.\n\n1962: The Star falls for a prank: A caller tells The Star that a distinguished Englishman will be a guest at the 500-Mile Race — \"Sir Ossis of Liverpool.\" Get it? Cirrhosis of the liver? The Star didn't get it and printed the item.\n\n1963: \"A Prayer for Today\" debuts on the editorial page.\n\n1968: \"A Prayer for Today\" moves to Page 1.\n\nEarly 1970s: During this period, more than a few pressmen pass their down time by watching porno films on an 8-millimeter, reel-to-reel movie projector in The Star's basement. Frequently, popcorn is served. Not kidding.\n\n1974: The Star falls again for a hoax, reporting the death (phoned in by unknown persons) of H. Earl Capehart, a prominent local attorney and the son of U.S. Sen. Homer Capehart. Earl Capehart had not died and in fact lived another 22 years. \"What was most curious,\" he said of his premature death report, \"was that a number of people said they were glad to see me back, as if I had been gone and then returned.\"\n\n1975: The Star wins a Pulitzer Prize for its 1974 series on police corruption, reported and written by Dick Cady, Harley Bierce and Bill Anderson.\n\n1976: First computer system is installed in the newsroom; the thing is called Hendricks.\n\n1977: A one-day strike by Teamsters May 2 prevents publication of The News and limits publication and delivery of The Star.\n\n1978: A blizzard hits Indianapolis Jan. 25, preventing some staffers from going home.\n\n1980s: A guy named Jim, a parking attendant (in the days before The Star had a parking garage), positions staffers' cars according to what gifts they brought him — baked goods, sometimes outright cash.\n\n1984: The Star's Sunday lifestyle section changes its name to \"Trends.\" It had been \"FemmeFare.\"\n\n1985: The Star's \"Joe Crow,\" formerly \"Jim Crow\" (see above), is discontinued Jan. 28; Coretta Scott King's weekly syndicated column begins running in The Star Nov. 6.\n\nMid-1980s: The exact date is not known but at around this time, a career newsroom messenger named Edwin O. Park, who had both self-confidence and a developmental disability, got on an elevator with Eugene S. Pulliam, publisher and patriarch of a newspaper dynasty. \"Morning, Edwin,\" Pulliam said. \"Hit two, would ya, Bub?\" was Park's reply.\n\n1986: The Star builds a parking garage for its employees, who begin the tradition of watching the July 4 fireworks from atop it.\n\n1987: A scene from the not-great movie \"Viper\" is shot in The Star newsroom Oct. 17. Becky Walter, a 39-year staffer who left the paper in 2013, recalls certain logistical problems with the script, such as when the protagonists announced they'd hide out in the mountains of Indiana.\n\n1988: On Aug. 16, Republican presidential nominee George Bush makes Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle his vice presidential running mate. Quayle was unknown outside Indiana, plus he was a relative of the Pulliams, who owned The Star. This also was before the Internet. Phone calls come flooding in from around the world seeking more biographical information on Quayle. The calls are routed to research librarians, who claim this was the busiest day in the history of The Star's telephone lines.\n\n1989: Shares of stock in Central Newspapers Inc., The Star's parent company, are traded publicly for the first time on Sept. 21.\n\n1990: Lawrence \"Bo\" Connor retires as The Star's managing editor. He had worked at the paper since 1949. As he exited the building the last time, quietly, without fanfare (it was late in the day and the newsroom was up against deadline), someone in the newsroom noticed him and began applauding. Others joined in, and soon the entire newsroom was standing and applauding as Connor strolled away — like a scene out of a movie but totally real, totally spontaneous.\n\n1991: The Star wins the Pulitzer Prize for a series on medical malpractice. In the newsroom, champagne is poured over the heads of triumphant reporters Joe Hallinan and Susan Headden.\n\n1992: Newsroom staffer Jennifer Morlan meets newsroom staffer Scott Horner in February. They marry and later have a son. They're still married and still work here (and still have a son). Staffer Dawn Mitchell met her husband, Wendell Mitchell, in 1990. They, too, are still married. These couples are among dozens of couples who met at The Star and married, or at least hooked up for a while.\n\n1998: Ernie Banks, the great Cub, visits The Star newsroom to promote high blood pressure awareness. Sixteen years later, Banks is still alive. He's 83.\n\n1999: The News, its circulation having fallen for decades, ceases publication Oct. 1. In an unusual homage-type gesture, company executives appear in the newsroom on The News' final day, as staffers assemble the final edition of a newspaper that first published Dec. 7, 1869, and offer coffee and danishes.\n\n2000: The Star, including its building, plus the other properties of Central Newspapers Inc., is sold to Gannett Co. for $2.6 billion on June 28.\n\nEarly 2000s: A small cadre of copy editors led by Carl Sygiel begins pooling money to buy lottery tickets. Since then, the group has mushroomed to as many as 150 investors. Twice in a decade, the group has won $100. Still, Sygiel continues to claim each time the jackpot gets big that victory is close at hand.\n\n2001: On Oct. 16, The Star furnishes its staff with rubber gloves, for wearing while opening the mail. The reason: anthrax. The gloves are widely mocked, but an actual anthrax scare would come seven years later.\n\n2002: The Star is printed offsite with new presses on the Northwestside. The presses formerly had been in the basement of 307 N. Penn, and when they ran, the building hummed.\n\nDec. 5: The U2 lead singer Bono visits 307 N. Penn on a tour with other celebrities to urge the United States to do more to help Africa's dire situation regarding AIDS. Actor Chris Tucker accompanies Bono, but Ashley Judd stays on the tour bus. Star administrative assistant Kim Mitchell over the years has met governors and senators and other movers and shakers, but she was blown away by the Irish rock star's charisma, even in a brief, mundane exchange. \"In the hallway,\" Mitchell said, \"Bono said to me, 'Excuse me, love, can you find me a phone with a bit of preevacy?' \"\n\n2006: Wicked storm sweeps through Downtown, blowing out windows at The Star building's southwest corner. The Star's library takes a hit, and the publisher's office is practically destroyed.\n\nJuly 3: Star photographer Mpozi Mshale Tolbert, working the photo desk, collapses, is rushed to Wishard Hospital and dies an hour later, at age 34.\n\nSept. 18: In a meeting at The Star's editorial board office, U.S. Rep. Julia Carson advises that her formidable opponent in the upcoming election, businessman Eric Dickerson, 15 years earlier had \"beat his wife to a pulp.\" A police report is found, Dickerson is undone, and Carson is re-elected for the 17th time.\n\n2008: The Star's building is placed on \"lockdown\" Nov. 3 after an envelope purportedly containing anthrax is opened. The substance was later determined not to be anthrax.\n\nApril 25: Barack Obama, then Illinois senator campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, visits The Star and is calm, cool and collected, said Mitchell, Obama's building guide. \"He stopped and talked to people on his way to his meeting\" with the editorial board, she said. Four days later, Mitchell escorted Obama's rival, Hillary Clinton, through the building. She was, by contrast, guarded. \"It was as if she expected people to ask her hard questions, whereas Obama seemed to expect that people would like him,\" Mitchell said. The Star endorsed Clinton.\n\nMay 23: Jim Nabors visits newsroom. Does this qualify as a moment? Maybe.\n\n2009: A cardboard box containing excrement arrives in the mail, addressed to editor Dennis Ryerson, following the newspaper's investigation of how gun permits are issued.\n\n2011: On July 29, Christopher Wray played a trick on his girlfriend, Jacquelyn, who worked in advertising. At his bidding, her boss arranged a fake \"team building\" exercise. It involved Jacquelyn being led around blindfolded. When she removed the blindfold, there stood Wray. Right then and there, in front of a coterie of ad salespeople, he took a knee and popped the question. Yes, she said.\n\n2013: David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on \"Mr. Rogers,\" stops by The Star to promote a WFYI event. Certain staffers squeal with excitement, especially reporter Dana Benbow, who gets Newell's autograph.\n\nOn May 9, The Star building is sold to developer The Whitsett Group, which plans to convert it into apartments and, on the ground floor, retail.\n\nSources: Star research; Star interviews; \"Star in the Hoosier Sky,\" by Lawrence Connor.\n\nContact Star reporter Will Higgins at (317) 444-6043.

He added that there appears to be no “disastrous consequences” for their health.\n\nThe allegation “followed a call by Russia’s proxies in the Donbas to use chemical weapons against Azov”, the news site added. Azov’s witness claimed the substance was “distributed by a drone” and left victims suffering from a “shortness of breath”.\n\nIn a late-night address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not confirm the use of chemical or biological weapons, but said: “We treat this with the utmost seriousness.\n\n“I would like to remind world leaders that the possible use of chemical weapons by the Russian military has already been discussed,” he added. “And already at that time it meant that it was necessary to react to the Russian aggression much harsher and faster.”\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nRussia has previously claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was planning to deploy chemical weapons in order to repel its invasion. The intervention in late March prompted Joe Biden to warn of a possible “false flag” attack to justify the use of banned weapons.\n\nWarning that Putin’s back is “against the wall”, the US president said claims by the Kremlin that Ukraine has access to non-conventional weapons was “a clear sign” he was planning to deploy his own, adding: “He’s already used chemical weapons in the past.”\n\nUK Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told Sky News that “all options were on the table” if it is confirmed that Russia has already used chemical weapons. “The fact that they are part of the discussion is deeply sobering,” he added.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby said the US would monitor the situation. “These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,” he said.\n\nRepeat performance\n\nAfter Biden’s warning over the use of chemical weapons, Andy Weber, Barack Obama’s assistant secretary of defence responsible for nuclear, chemical and biological programmes, told The Telegraph that “despite Putin’s reckless bluster on nuclear weapons, the use of biological weapons in Ukraine is much more likely.\n\n“The USSR had the largest biological weapons programme the world has ever known and parts of it have continued uninterrupted since the break-up of the Soviet Union,” he said. “Russia has three military biological facilities that have never, to our knowledge, been visited by non-Russians. We don’t fully know what they're up to.”\n\nRussia also cut a lone voice in 2018 when it claimed that a chemical attack on the Syrian city of Douma was “staged” with the help of the UK.\n\nActivists, rescue workers and medics said more than 40 people were killed following the deployment of “various chlorinated organic chemicals”, the BBC reported at the time. Bashar al-Assad’s government denied the attack, despite the Syrian Civil Defence and the Syrian American Medical Society claiming that more than 500 patients had been admitted to hospitals with “symptoms indicative of exposure to a chemical agent”.\n\nFive years earlier, “rockets containing the nerve agent sarin hit the Ghouta suburb of Syria’s capital” in “the deadliest chemical weapon attack since the Iran-Iraq war”, The Telegraph reported. “Between 281 and 1,729 men, women and children died before dawn broke over Damascus,” the paper said. Assad’s government again denied the attack.\n\nAt the time, Putin wrote in The New York Times that “there is every reason to believe [poison gas] was used not by the Syrian Army, but by opposition forces”.\n\n“Novichok, biological agents, chlorine and radiation poison” are all thought to be “part of Russia’s arsenal”, The Telegraph reported. Chlorine is considered the most “likely chemical agent for Russia to use in the Ukraine war” given that Moscow has watched al-Assad “use chlorine repeatedly against civilians in rebel-held areas, as well as run misinformation campaigns to obscure his culpability”.\n\nChlorine is also “easily manufactured from readily obtainable precursors without sophisticated laboratory equipment” and can be “dispersed by relatively crude munitions to cause death and widespread panic in built-up areas”, the paper added.\n\nWhat next?\n\nWhether the West steps up its response “obviously depends on how that verification process goes”, said Politico’s Alex Wickham. “If confirmed, this would be the first known use of chemical weapons by Russia in the Ukraine war”, he added, “and would mark a significant escalation of Moscow’s aggression”.\n\nArmed forces minister Heappey told Sky News that the government would “maintain some ambiguity” as to the response to a confirmed chemical attack. The broadcaster added that he “signalled” the response would “vary depending upon the severity of the use”.\n\nThis echoed comments by Biden in late March when he told reporters in Brussels that the use of chemical weapons “would trigger a response in kind”, adding: “We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”\n\nIt is “too soon to say definitively what happened”, The Guardian reported, and some chemical weapons experts are “sceptical” about the Azov Battalion’s claims.\n\nDan Kaszeta, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, tweeted that “it is legitimately difficult to assess these situations remotely, particularly when we largely have second-hand or third-hand reports rather than actual evidence from the scene”.\n\n“We have a handful of sick, but not dead, Ukrainian soldiers,” he added. “They’ve had difficulty breathing and ataxis. This does not tell us much. People leaping onto nerve agent diagnosis from this presentation of signs and symptoms are way off.”\n\nHe also cautioned that in the area under attack there is “lots of scope” for “conventional or incendiary weapons to cause chemical problems because of fires and explosions”.\n\nEliot Higgins, founder of the Bellingcat investigative journalism agency, added in a tweet that the symptoms described by troops on the ground are “inconsistent with any nerve agent I’m familiar with, with no reports of pupil constriction or dilation, convulsions”.\n\n“If the site is still accessible then they should be able to go back there and find the munition remains”, he added, describing this as “the most solid evidence they could hope to produce” of a Russian chemical attack.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Elliott Goat", "Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/06/russia-ukraine-invasion-updates/9401259002/", "title": "Russian military to hold fire, open corridors in several Ukraine cities ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps the news from Ukraine on Sunday, March. 6. Follow here for the latest updates and news from Monday, March 7, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\nNATO countries supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion have a “green light” to send fighter jets as part of their military aid, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday.\n\nThe push for more air support comes as Russia battered a string of southern cities in Ukraine, throttling evacuation efforts and leading to rising numbers of civilian deaths and displacement. Ukraine’s military has used fighter jets, drones and anti-aircraft systems largely supplied by NATO to down the Russian aircraft bombing the area.\n\n“We're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians,” Blinken said during an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nBut Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's call for a no-fly zone over his country continues to draw no support. Zelenskyy said in a video address on Sunday that “the world is strong enough to close our skies.\" He also appealed for stronger sanctions on Russia.\n\nNATO countries have ruled out policing a no-fly zone, which would bar all unauthorized aircraft from flying over Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow would consider any third-party declaration of a no-fly zone over Ukraine as \"participation'' in the armed conflict.\n\nBlinken also said the U.S. and its allies are in talks to ban Russian oil imports, a move that would require successful efforts to provide an \"appropriate supply of oil on world markets.\" Russia supplies about 30% of Europe's oil and 40% of its natural gas.\n\nOver the weekend, the Russian military continued seeking to isolate Ukraine’s major cities, including Kyiv, a senior Defense Department official said Sunday. But forces attacking near Kyiv, Kharkiv and Chernihiv in northern and eastern Ukraine are facing strong resistance, the official said.\n\nThe airspace over Ukraine remained contested, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook\n\nLatest developments:\n\n►Netflix said Sunday it’s suspending service in Russia, joining the growing list of companies shunning the country. Earlier in the day, TikTok and American Express said they would suspend operations in the country. TikTok also said it will start labeling content from accounts used by state-controlled media.\n\n►The State Department is urging Americans to leave Russia immediately, citing the “unprovoked and unjustified attack” against Ukraine and the potential for harassment of U.S. citizens by Russian government security forces.\n\n►Gas in the U.S. has topped $4 a gallon for the first time in over a decade as the price continues to soar in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The national average of a regular gallon of gas is $4.009, according to AAA, up 8 cents from Saturday and up 40 cents from last week.\n\n►Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett returned from a surprise trip to Russia where he discussed the war with Putin. The trip was “in coordination and with the blessing” of the Biden administration, the latest attempt at diplomacy in the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Israel is one of few countries that has good working relations with both Russia and Ukraine.\n\nQuick links:\n\nGET UKRAINE UPDATES: We'll email you the latest news once a day\n\nVISUALS: Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nUKRAINE WAR DIARY:Illarion Pavliuk checks in with his family. He's ready to fight\n\nRussian military to hold fire, open corridors in several Ukrainian cities\n\nRussia's military will hold fire and open humanitarian corridors in several Ukrainian cities Monday. This comes a day after hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians attempting to flee to safety were forced to shelter from Russian shelling that pummeled cities in Ukraine's center, north and south.\n\nThe corridors will open at 10 a.m. Moscow time Monday, the 12th day of the war, for civilians from the capital Kyiv, the southern port city of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and Sumy. According to Reuters, the corridors are being set up at the personal request of French President Emmanuel Macron who spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday.\n\nThe announcement follows two failed attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, from which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated 200,000 people were trying to flee. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the failure.\n\nBut despite the announcement, Russia's armed forces continued to pummel Ukrainian cities, with multiple rocket launchers hitting residential buildings. Officials from both sides planned a third round of talks Monday.\n\n— Kelly Tyko\n\nNew Zealand will rush through new law to sanction Russia\n\nNew Zealand's government said Monday it plans to rush through a new law that will allow it to impose economic sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUnlike many countries that have already introduced sanctions, New Zealand's existing laws don't allow it to apply meaningful measures unless they're part of a broader United Nations effort. Because Russia has U.N. Security Council veto power, that has left New Zealand hamstrung.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the new legislation would allow it to target people, companies and assets connected to those in Russia associated with the invasion, including oligarchs. It would allow New Zealand to freeze assets and stop superyachts or planes from arriving.\n\nThe bill will be specific only to the Ukraine invasion but could allow New Zealand to impose sanctions on countries seen to be helping Russia, such as Belarus.\n\nUkraine evacuations stall as Russia shelling pummels cities\n\nHundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians attempting to flee to safety were forced to shelter from Russian shelling that pummeled cities in Ukraine's center, north and south, leaving corpses in the streets. Ukrainian officials said the shelling only worsened as darkness fell Sunday and described a \"catastrophic\" situation during failed evacuation efforts in Kyiv's suburbs.\n\nOfficials from both sides planned a third round of talks Monday.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to fight on, urging his people in a weekend television address to take to the streets to \"drive this evil out of our cities, from our land.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow's attacks could be halted \"only if Kyiv ceases hostilities.\" As he has often done, Putin blamed Ukraine for the war, telling Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday that Kyiv needed to stop all hostilities and fulfill \"the well-known demands of Russia.\"\n\nAustralian missiles 'on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAustralia’s prime minister has described Russia and China’s closer relationship as opportunistic rather than strategic.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday labeled the alliance an “Arc of Autocracy” and said Russia and China would prefer a new world order to the one that has been in place since World War II.\n\nMorrison has criticized Beijing’s failure to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s expansion of trade in Russian wheat while other countries are imposing sanctions.\n\nAustralia last week promised Ukraine $50 million in missiles, ammunition and other military hardware to fight Russian invaders.\n\nMorrison said on Monday: “Our missiles are on the ground now.”\n\nOil prices jump $10 a barrel\n\nThe price of oil jumped more than $10 a barrel late Sunday as the conflict in Ukraine deepened amid mounting calls for harsher sanctions against Russia.\n\nBrent crude oil briefly surged over $10 to nearly $130 a barrel late Sunday. Benchmark U.S. crude was up nearly $9 at more than $124 a barrel.\n\nThe surge followed a warning from Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukrainian statehood was imperiled as Russian forces battered strategic locations.\n\nA temporary cease-fire in two Ukrainian cities failed — and both sides blamed each other\n\nGAS PRICES ARE RISING:What can Biden do to lower costs at the pump amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine?\n\nOIL FROM RUSSIA:How much oil does the US buy from Russia? Not much, but gas prices are rising amid Ukraine invasion\n\nBiden administration to request $10B in aid to Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration has requested $10 billion in humanitarian, military, and economic support for Ukraine, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced in a news release Sunday evening.\n\nBiden has strongly affirmed that he will not send U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine, but the funds, which will be part of the federal government’s omnibus funding legislation, will likely provide military equipment and support U.S. allies who are supplying airplanes to Ukraine, Pelosi’s release said.\n\nShe also said the U.S. House of Representatives is exploring “strong legislation” that would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the U.S., repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step in denying Russia access to the World Trade Organization.\n\n— Celina Tebor\n\nZelenskyy appeals for stronger sanctions as Russians boost attack\n\nWith his requests for a no-fly zone over Ukraine falling on deaf ears, President Volodymyr Zelensky is appealing for stronger sanctions against Russia as the invaders boost their shelling.\n\nZelenskyy criticized Western leaders in a video statement Sunday for not responding to the Russian Defense Ministry’s announcement that it would strike Ukraine’s military-industrial complex. Zelenskyy also told employees of those defense plants not to go to work.\n\n“I didn’t hear even a single world leader react to this,” Zelenskyy said. “The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the West that the sanctions imposed on Russia are not sufficient.”\n\nWestern sanctions have damaged the Russian economy and cratered the ruble, but the country's attack on its neighbor has continued undeterred.\n\nCease-fire in Mariupol collapses as Russians keep up offensive\n\nA second attempt at a cease-fire meant to allow civilians and the wounded to be evacuated from besieged Mariupol in southern Ukraine came apart under shelling from Russian forces Sunday, leaving the port city in dire need of food, water, medicine and other supplies.\n\nUkrainian officials said Russian attacks quickly closed the humanitarian corridor that had been negotiated, dashing hopes that more people could escape the fighting.\n\n“There can be no ‘green corridors’ because only the sick brain of the Russians decides when to start shooting and at whom,“ Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.\n\nEfforts to evacuate civilians also fell through in Volnovakha in the east as well as the Kyiv suburbs of Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, where presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich described the situation as “catastrophic.”\n\nAlthough the Ukrainians were putting up stiff resistance and ruining Russian plans for a quick takeover, the conflict has taken a heavy toll as the invading forces have launched 600 missiles since the war started Feb. 24.\n\nRussian airstrikes damaged the Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline, likely leaving dozens of Ukrainian towns and villages in the area without gas or heat, officials in the Donetsk region said. A Russian missile strike hit a gas line in Irpin, 15 miles west of Kyiv, cutting off gas and heat to local residents, the government said.\n\nAlso, Ukraine notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that regular staff operates the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, but that plant management is now under orders from the commander of the Russian forces that took control of the site last week. Ukraine reports that any action of plant management – including measures related to the technical operation of the six reactor units – requires prior approval by the Russian commander.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi expressed \"grave concern\" about the reorganization, saying professional staff must have the \"capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure.\"\n\nUkraine defense minister: 'Myth' of Russian might destroyed\n\nUkraine Defense Minister Alexei Danilov said his country has survived the first wave of Russia's large-scale offensive but Russia is preparing a second wave. Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Odesa remain strategically important cities for Russia's war, he said. Russian troops want to encircle key cities, bleed the Ukrainian army and create a humanitarian catastrophe, Danilov said.\n\n\"The myth of Putin's most modern and powerful army in the world has been destroyed and burned on the roads of Kyiv and Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv,\" Danilov said. \"But the enemy is still dangerous.\"\n\nAmerican Express suspends operations in Russia\n\nAmerican Express said Sunday that it is suspending all operations in Russia \"in light of Russia’s ongoing, unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine.\" Globally issued American Express cards will no longer work at merchants or ATMs in Russia. Additionally, cards issued in the country by Russian banks will no longer work outside of Russia on the American Express global network. The company said it is also terminating all business operations in Belarus.\n\nOn Saturday, Visa and Mastercard said they will drop any cards issued by Russian banks off their networks and not allow their cards issued outside of Russia to work with Russian vendors or ATMs.\n\nCREDIT CARDS NOT ACCEPTED:'We don't take this decision lightly': Mastercard, Visa are suspending operations in Russia\n\nSALES SUSPENDED:Joining Apple and others, Microsoft stops sales in Russia amid invasion: 'We stand with Ukraine'\n\nMore than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine\n\nOver 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine into neighboring nations, the U.N. refugee agency said, making it the worst such crisis in Europe since World War II. The Polish prime minister's office said 922,400 people had crossed its border alone since fighting began 11 days ago. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in Moldova to discuss security and humanitarian assistance for the refugees, said officials have seen \"very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians\" that could constitute war crimes.\n\nBlinken said the U.S. is investigating and documenting the reported attacks to determine whether war crimes are being committed.\n\nHELP FOR UKRAINE:Support to Ukrainian refugees comes in different forms: Online groups, financial aid, housing\n\nDRIVING REFUGEES:He 'drove for 12 hours to save us': One man's efforts to transport Ukrainian refugees to safety\n\n'We have to stop Putin all together': Kyiv mayor says world must unify\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Sunday urged the world to rally around Ukraine as it fights to remain independent amid Russia’s invasion of the country.\n\n“We see our future as a democratic, modern European country, and we expect support from (the) whole world, because we are fighting not just for Ukraine, we are fighting for wellness,” he said on ABC’s \"This Week.'' “We are fighting for all (the) world. We have to stop Putin all together.”\n\nIn addition to global unity and the weapons Ukraine has requested from its global allies, Klitschko said the country needs more pressure and sanctions on Russia, and that despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threat made Saturday to eliminate Ukraine, the country has “great ambition” to remain independent from Russia.\n\n“Our country is not just buildings; people (are our) main power,” he said. “Ukraine was always a friendly nation, we (were) always a friendly country. We never (were) aggressive to anyone. But right now we have a huge motivation to defend our future and our country.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nRubio warns 'no-fly' zone over Ukraine means World War III\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Sunday warned that those calling for a \"no-fly\" zone over Ukraine may not fully understand the ramifications of the act.\n\n“That means flying AWACS 24 hours a day. That means the willingness to shoot down and engage Russian airplanes in the sky. That means, frankly, you can't put those planes up there unless you're willing to knock out the anti-aircraft systems that the Russians have deployed, and not just in Ukraine, but in Russia, and also in Belarus,'' Rubio said on ABC’s \"This Week.\"\n\n“Basically, a no fly zone – if people understand what it means – means starting World War III,” he continued.\n\nThe Florida senator also responded to online criticism he faced Saturday for sharing pictures of a Zoom call with Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy after the Ukrainian ambassador asked Congress to refrain from doing so for security reasons, saying the ambassador made that request late into the call and that he does not believe he put Zelenskyy at risk.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nENTERING UKRAINE:Thousands of people are fleeing the fighting in Ukraine. Here's who is trying to get in.\n\nUN ambassador: Offer to negotiate with Putin is ‘still on the table’\n\nU.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield on Sunday doubled down on the United States’ position that it will not be enacting a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\n\n“President Biden has been very, very clear that American troops will not be put on the ground or in the air to escalate this war and make this an American war against the Russians,” she said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “But we've also been very clear that we will support Ukraine in every other way possible.”\n\nThomas-Greenfield said the U.S. is in talks with Poland and NATO to provide jets to Ukraine or crack down on tougher sanctions for Russia but stopped short of confirming that help is guaranteed. She added that despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s continued aggression in Ukraine, negotiation is still on the table.\n\n“We have been working since the beginning of this to bring the Russians to the negotiating table, and that offer is still on the table – not just by us but also by our European colleagues,” Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nUK: Russian tactics mimic Syria, Chechnya\n\nDefense officials in the United Kingdom said they believe Russia is targeting populated areas in multiple locations, including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol in an effort to break Ukrainian morale, according to a statement released early Sunday.\n\n\"Russia has previously used similar tactics in Chechnya in 1999 and Syria in 2016, employing both air and ground-based munitions,\" the statement said. It also credited the scale and strength of the Ukrainian resistance for targeting Russian supply lines and slowing the advance of ground forces.\n\n\"There is a realistic possibility that Russia is now attempting to conceal fuel trucks as regular support trucks to minimise losses,\" the statement read.\n\nMoody's slashes Russia's credit rating\n\nMoody's on Sunday again slashed Russia's credit rating and listed its future outlook as \"negative.\" The financial services company downgraded Russia's rating based on expectations that the Central Bank will further restrict payments across borders, including debt service on government bonds.\n\nThe rating – Ca – is now closer to junk status, \"driven by severe concerns around Russia's willingness and ability to pay its debt obligations,\" Moody's said in a statement issued early Sunday.\n\n\"Concerns around the government's willingness to pay and the unpredictability of government actions could result in larger than historical average losses for investors,\" the statement said.\n\n– Katie Wadington\n\nRadio Free Europe suspends operations in Russia\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is suspending operations in Russia because of government pressures since the start of the war in Ukraine.\n\nRFE/RL, which describes itself as an editorially independent media company supported by a grant from Congress and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, issued a statement late Saturday saying it had stopped operating in Russia “after local tax authorities initiated bankruptcy proceedings against RFE/RL’s Russian entity on March 4 and police intensified pressure on its journalists.”\n\nThe media entity also referenced a law signed Friday by Russian President Vladimir Putin that could subject journalists to prison sentences if they deviate from Kremlin-approved descriptions of the war. It said RFE/RL journalists would “continue to tell the truth about Russia’s catastrophic invasion of its neighbor,” reporting on developments from outside Russia.\n\n“This is not a decision that RFE/RL has taken of its own accord, but one that has been forced upon us by the Putin regime’s assault on the truth,” President and CEO Jamie Fly said.\n\nRussia’s federal communications agency announced Friday that it would block the websites of RFE/RL, the BBC, Voice of America and other foreign outlets for spreading what it termed “fake” information.\n\nRFE/RL, which has maintained a physical presence in Russia since 1991, said nine of its Russian language websites have been blocked in the last week after it refused to comply with demands to delete information about the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n– Bill Keveney\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "Volodymyr Zelensky Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere’s some background information about the life of Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: January 25, 1978\n\nBirth place: Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine\n\nBirth name: Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky\n\nFather: Oleksandr Zelensky, computer science professor\n\nMother: Rimma Zelenska, engineer\n\nMarriage: Olena (Kiyashko) Zelenska (2003-present)\n\nChildren: Oleksandra and Kyrylo\n\nEducation: Kyiv National Economic University, law, 2000\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nOther Facts:\n\nFormer comedian, actor, writer and producer.\n\nHis best known role was in the television series “Servant of the People.” He played a destitute schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine after video of his anti-corruption rant goes viral.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Zelensky's unorthodox path to leading and inspiring Ukraine 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nTimeline:\n\n1990s - Forms a comedy troupe with college friends called Kvartal 95.

Click here to follow the latest updates and news from Monday, Feb. 28, as Russia's invasion continues.\n\n***\n\nWhile Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s nuclear weapons on high alert, more support poured in for Ukraine in its ongoing effort to fend off Russian forces, which on Sunday reached the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nThe European Union announced unprecedented new actions against Russia, outlining plans to close its airspace to Russian airlines, fund a weapons purchase to assist Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets, while the Associated Press reported the United States approved the delivery of anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine.\n\nWestern powers in support of Ukraine could soon be joined by Switzerland, an oftentimes neutral country that on Monday is set to review potential sanctions and asset freezes against Russia, said President Ignazio Cassis via Reuters. Cassis said it was “very probable” the country would follow suit, the outlet reported.\n\nThe office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday said a delegation would meet with Russian officials for talks near the Belarus border. The discussion was expected to happen Monday morning local time, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin via CNN.\n\nAlso Monday, both the 193-member U.N. General Assembly and the smaller, 15-member Security Council plan to hold emergency meetings on Russia’s invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin’s order to make his nuclear weapons more ready for launch – made Sunday in response to “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers and economic sanctions by the West – represents an unnecessary and dangerous move, according to the Pentagon.\n\nA senior Defense Department official said Russia is under no threat from the United States and its NATO allies. The Pentagon is confident it can protect the U.S. and its allies, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is heading towards a fifth day of fighting. According to the Associated Press, Russian troops entered Kharkiv on Sunday, where videos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across the city and a vehicle burning on the street. Residents were urged to stay inside.\n\nThe troops in Kharkiv arrived after Russia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting airfields and fuel facilities. Two large explosions rocked an area south of the capital just before 1 a.m. local time. Zelenskyy’s office said one of the blasts was near the Zhuliany airport and the other blast hit an oil depot about 25 miles south of the capital, according to the mayor of Vasylkiv via the AP.

It was unclear exactly what share of Russia’s estimated $640 billion hard currency coffers will be paralyzed by the move, but European officials said that at least half of it will be affected.\n\nThe move will dramatically raise pressure on the ruble by undermining the financial authorities’ ability to conduct hard currency interventions to prevent the ruble from sinking further and triggering high inflation. The ruble has sharply dived in early Monday trading.\n\nThe Central Bank also ordered a slew of measures to help the banks cope with the crisis by infusing more cash into the system and easing restrictions for banking operations. At the same time, it temporarily barred non-residents from selling the government obligations to help ease the pressure on ruble from panicky foreign investors eager to cash out.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:The enigma of Vladimir Putin: What do we really know about Russia's leader?\n\nDalai Lama pleas for peace in Ukraine\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Monday pleaded for peace and \"mutual understanding,\" and said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"War is outdated – non-violence is the only way.

It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops.

Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing. They also urge citizens to carry hard copies of important documents as the U.S. government will not be able to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nMore:Satellite images show damaged airport in Hostomel following strikes\n\nRussian ruble sinks in early trading\n\nThe ruble sank nearly 26% against the U.S. dollar early Monday after Western nations moved to block Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe ruble was trading at a record low 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, Japan joined the moves by the U.S. and other western nations to impose more sanctions against Russia.\n\nRestrictions on the Russian central bank target its access to more than $600 billion in reserves the Kremlin has at its disposal.

That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday. That was a day after Twitter said it was temporarily halting ads in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions can be circumvented inside Russia using VPN software, just as users do in mainland China.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCanada will investigate Russian flight violating airspace ban\n\nCanada said it will launch an investigation into a Russian-based Aeroflot flight that entered Canadian airspace on Sunday and violated a ban on all Russian flights due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,\" Transport Canada said in a series of tweets. \"We are launching a review of the conduct of Aeroflot and the independent air navigation service provider, NAVCAN, leading up to this violation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,\" the agency added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Omar Alghabra, Canada's transport minister, that the country's airspace was closed to all Russian aircraft operators.\n\n\"We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,” Alghabra tweeted.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nBiden to hold a call with U.S. allies to discuss Ukraine, Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with U.S. allies on Monday morning to discuss the latest situation in Ukraine and their coordinated response, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. ET. The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope for prospective peace talks.\n\n\"We'll look forward to what comes out of those discussions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n– Associated Press, Jay Cannon and David Jackson\n\nBorrell: EU countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine\n\nEuropean Union countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine at the Kyiv government’s request to help it counter the Russian air and land assault, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday, according to the AFP news service.\n\n\"We're going to provide even fighting jets. We're not talking about just ammunition. We are providing more important arms to go to a war,\" Borrell said at a news conference.\n\nThe military transfer appeared imminent, according to Alexandre Krauss, a senior advisor to the EU Parliament.\n\n“Flying in #Ukraine skies within the hour,” Krauss tweeted at 3:38 p.m. ET, citing Borrell’s announcement.\n\nAccording to Borrell, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had asked the EU for the planes.\n\nCiting a person familiar with the talks, the Wall Street Journal reported that “discussions are still ongoing” and that any planes would be supplied directly by EU member states and not funded through an arrangement announced earlier for the EU to finance weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, announced earlier in the day, that EU members were “stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.”\n\nThe announcement came as satellite imagery showed a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles – with some estimates of 3.25 miles long – moving toward Kyiv and about 40 miles away.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy in Kyiv: $54 million in humanitarian assistance on the way\n\nThe U.S. is giving nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the Russian invasion, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced Sunday.\n\nThe funding, which comes as thousands of Ukrainians flee Russian invaders, was announced with \"the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind,\" the embassy said in a statement. It includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries and U.N. officials believe up to 4 million people could leave if fighting continues.\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS to send anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine, AP reports\n\nThe U.S. for the first time has approved the direct delivery of Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe exact timing of delivery is not known, but officials say the U.S. is currently working on the logistics of the shipment. The officials agreed to discuss the development only if not quoted by name.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:There may be risk, but the US will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of Germany’s announcement that it will send 500 Stinger missiles and other weapons and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nThe high-speed Stingers are very accurate and are used to shoot down helicopters and other aircraft. Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday. The ministry said 1,684 people had been injured.\n\nThe United Nations had announced the civilian death toll had reached 240 by Saturday, but stressed that the actual figure was potentially \"considerably higher.”\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS urges Americans in Ukraine to find best exit routes\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a new advisory Sunday, telling Americans to choose departure routes very carefully if they are trying to flee.\n\n“Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations has been destroyed,” the embassy said in a notice. “Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some.”\n\nMost border crossings into Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova “are severely backed up,” with extremely long wait times – in some cases, more than 30 hours, the embassy said.\n\n“We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross,” the note says. “Note that conditions at each border can change very quickly and wait times can increase at any time without warning.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUPS, FedEx halt services in Russia\n\nShipping giants FedEx and UPS have suspended services to Russia amid the country’s military assault on Ukraine.\n\nUPS said it had halted all international shipments to addresses in Russia as of Feb. 25. FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nOn nuclear deterrence:What is DEFCON? What's nuclear deterrence?

Mark Warner: Putin’s invasion a major ‘miscalculation'\n\nSen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Putin “totally underestimated” the resolve of the Ukrainians and the support building worldwide for the Ukrainian people, describing the Russian invasion so far as a major “miscalculation.”\n\n“Remarkably what he's also been able to do his unify the vast majority of us in the Senate, Democrats, Republicans alike,” Warner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And he’s going to pay a high price.”\n\nWarner said Putin over the past few years became “more and more isolated.”\n\n“When you are an authoritarian leader, and you’re only hearing from people that want to say to the boss, hey, you're right. I think that leads to miscalculation. I think that is what has happened in the case of this invasion in Ukraine.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUS ambassador: No US 'boots on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAs she made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made clear that the U.S. response to the invasion of Ukraine will not include American troops or air personnel.\n\n\"The president has made clear that we're not going to put boots on the ground,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said that mandate includes no patrols of any \"no-fly zone\" in the region.\n\nThe U.S. will provide whatever assistance it can to Ukraine, working with NATO partners, she said, but: \"We're not going to put American troops in danger. So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them. We can isolate them in the United Nations. We can isolate them in U.N. specialized agencies. They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens. Many children have been killed, and one entire family was shot in their car, she said.\n\n“Nothing is off limits to them,” Markarova said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “What we see is a full-fledged war, with war crimes on the ground.”’\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is safe, Markarova offered no information on his whereabouts but added, “He is as safe as our country.”\n\nShe spoke shortly after Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials. Marakova said Ukraine is ready “for any peace talks that would stop the war and get them out from our country.” But the Ukrainians will not surrender, she said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nCotton: West must stop ‘pussyfooting around’ on sanctions\n\nSen.

Security Council will meet later Sunday.\n\n“I’m not surprised at this information because Putin has tried every means possible to actually put fear in the world in terms of his actions. It just means that we need to ramp up up our actions at the U.N.”\n\nWhen asked whether there’s a threat of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield responded: “Certainly nothing is off the table with this guy.”\n\n– Sean Rossman\n\nPutin orders nuclear deterrent forces on high alert\n\nRussia President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces Sunday to be on high alert, a dramatic escalation of tensions with the West that brought immediate condemnation from the U.S. as Russia continues its full-scale assault on Ukraine.\n\nPutin, announcing the move on Russian state television, called it a response to “aggressive statements” and tough financial sections from NATO countries. The extraordinary step raises the threat of nuclear warfare entering the conflict in Ukraine, a scenario the White House has previously said it has not assessed.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, condemned the action as “unacceptable\" in an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nPutin directed the Russian defense minister and the chief of the military’s General Staff to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty” during a meeting with top officials.\n\n“Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,” Putin said in televised comments.\n\nAt the onset of the conflict with Ukraine, Putin warned that any nation that would “hinder us” will face\" such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,” although he did not elaborate what he meant.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n-- Joey Garrison, Associated Press\n\nKyiv eerily quiet after explosions\n\nThe capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.\n\n“The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The images showed Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. In one image, Ukrainian troops were seen firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.\n\nThe images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy asks UN top court to halt Russian invasion, says Moscow 'manipulating the notion of genocide'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of manipulating the notion of genocide to justify invading its neighbor and urged the International Court of Justice to hold trials.\n\nLocated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICJ is the main judicial arm of the United Nations.\n\n\"Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe ICJ rules on disputes between states, including responsibility for breaches of international law.

Tellingly, the Russian government has not acknowledged casualties in the sinking of the ship, a marked contrast to the very public discussion about the Kursk submarine disaster, which claimed the lives of 118 sailors in 2000.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN visited the Moskva in 2015.

US officials believe Putin is angry over the failures of his troops in Ukraine. They believe Putin’s advisers have not been telling him the full truth and did not prepare him for potential setbacks.\n\nThe warship fiasco comes just weeks after top Russian military officials announced a shift in the focus of the invasion after their offensive appeared to have stalled around major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Kharkiv. Russia has also failed to achieve complete air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses of personnel since the start of the invasion.\n\nRussia was quick to strike back.\n\nUkraine’s Operational Command South said in a statement early Saturday that the situation in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions was “increasingly hostile.”\n\n“Desperately trying to gain a foothold and hold on to the positions of the southern front, the world’s most shameful army is pursuing civilians in Mykolayiv and Kherson regions. The work of snipers has been recorded in some areas.”\n\nThe statement said Russian forces were “enraged by the losses in the Black Sea” and had “intensified the missile threat” in the region.\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for the armed forces in southern Ukraine, said that the missile attacks since Thursday night were in retaliation for the Moskva sinking.\n\n“We all realize that we will not be forgiven,” she said, accusing Russia of using “cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.”\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has previously said it had received credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas in Ukraine.

It sent a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of “unpredictable consequences” should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document.\n\nSome Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, one official said. The official explained that they believe the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield.\n\nThe note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US administration was preparing to announce that it would be sending a new military aid package worth $800 million to the Ukrainians. The EU has also approved an additional 500 million euros for military equipment for Ukraine.\n\nFor the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with high-power capabilities that some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago.\n\nThese include Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzers and 300 more Switchblade drones. These types of weapons are designed for the type of fighting that’s likely to take place in the Donbas region — open terrain rather than urban and wooded areas.\n\nThe US is also shipping 40,000 artillery rounds, but that amount could be expended within several days if fighting in the east grows heavier. During previous battles, Ukrainian forces fired thousands of artillery rounds in a day, a US official said Saturday.\n\nThere are growing concerns about the need to get more ammunition, in particular artillery ammunition, to Ukrainian forces more rapidly, a US official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Retired general: This key town needs to be on everyone's mind right now 02:43 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Ukrainian military and regional officials have said Russian attacks have intensified in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east of the country as they prepare for a major ground offensive there.\n\nGoing forward, US officials believe the likely Russia strategy is to move weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine from their current positions just north and then encircle and cut off Ukraine forces that are there, the official said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley are conducting daily phone calls with counterparts in the region to encourage them to ship more weapons and supplies to Ukraine as soon as possible.\n\nSerhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk region military administration, has warned civilians who remain in Luhansk to leave the area. “It is extremely dangerous to stay in the cities now.

Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend.

Col. (ret’d) Alexander Vindman, the former director for Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Russia on the White House’s National Security Council during the Trump administration, told USA TODAY. “There are too many forces for anybody to kind of breathe a sigh of relief based on what might amount to, on one hand, either hollow rhetoric or on another hand a kind of denial and deception operation.”\n\n“At the same time, I'm right there at the head of the line looking for lifelines – and certainly noting a couple of tepid lifelines – with regards to some of the rhetoric coming out of Moscow,” said Vindman, who previously served as the Political-Military Affairs Officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as an attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.\n\nVindman said there are some welcome indications based on Putin's interaction with his Foreign Minister and Minister of Defense, as well as the pledge to withdraw some forces. But, he added, “There's a little bit of smoke and mirrors there, to tell you the truth.”\n\nVindman said he was especially apprehensive about remarks made by the military general leading Russia’s National Defense Control Center, the operations center for its Ministry of Defense, who said that some of the southern and western military district forces would be returning back to their garrisons.\n\n“The problem with that is that those are the ones that are right there anyway, so they don't have far to travel. Some of these units already just mere kilometers away,” Vindman said.\n\n“And this doesn't account for the central and eastern military districts, the dozens of battle groups that came out of those districts,” Vindman said. “When those start to go back, that's when we could start to breathe a sigh of relief.”\n\n-- Josh Meyer\n\nBlinken to Lavrov: U.S. needs to see 'verifiable, credible, meaningful de-escalation'\n\nThe United States needs to see “verifiable, credible, meaningful de-escalation” of Russian action toward Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in a call Tuesday.\n\nBlinken also said he is still waiting for Russia’s written response to last month’s proposal from the U.S. and NATO about “concrete areas for discussion,” according to State Department spokesman Ned Price.\n\nBlinken noted that Lavrov said a response “would be transmitted within the coming days,” according to Price.\n\nPrice also said Blinken emphasized that the U.S. is still looking for a diplomatic solution to “the crisis Moscow has precipitated” but remains concerned that Russia has the capacity to launch an invasion of Ukraine at any moment.\n\nBlinken told Lavrov that further Russian aggression against Ukraine will be met with a “swift, severe, and united transatlantic response,” according to Price.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore:Biden threatens devastating sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Here's what that might look like.\n\nUkraine defense website, banks experience cyberattack\n\nUkraine's information security center said Tuesday that the country’s ministry of defense and at least two banks had come under cyberattack, shutting down websites and access to information and accounts.\n\nThe Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security did not attribute the attacks in an online posting, but suggested that Russia was responsible.\n\n\"It is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of little dirty tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale,\" said the center, which is part of Ukraine’s culture ministry and works with U.S., British and NATO officials in Kyiv.\n\n“During the last few hours, Privatbank has been under a massive DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack. Privat24 users report problems with payments and the application in general. Some users do not manage to log in to Privat24 at all, others do not have displayed the balance and recent transactions,” according to the Ukrainian Center’s website.\n\nIt said Oschadbank also has failures, and internet banking is down, and that the websites of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine were also attacked.\n\nIn a statement, Privatbank said it had “managed to eliminate the consequences of the DDOS attack and restore the stable operation of systems.\"\n\nU.S. cybersecurity experts warned that a Russia cyberattack against Ukraine could take many forms, from full-scale takedowns to low-grade distributed denial-of-service attacks like those targeting the banks. DDoS attacks disrupt the normal flow of Internet traffic by overwhelming a target or its broader network.\n\nRussia has used such DDoS attacks prior to some form of military action for more than a decade, including against Georgia in 2008 and, later, against Ukraine. Often, they are done prior to more aggressive cyberattacks, or as a way to disrupt communications prior to an invasion.\n\nIn Georgia in 2008, cybersecurity experts say, the attacks on its Internet infrastructure began days or even weeks before Russia’s military incursion, with coordinated barrages of millions of DDoS requests that overloaded and essentially shut down Georgian servers. The website of then-Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, for instance, was knocked out of service for more than a day by multiple DDoS attacks.\n\n– Josh Meyer and Karina Zaiets\n\nBiden to address nation on Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden will briefly address the situation in Ukraine in afternoon remarks, the White House announced.\n\nBiden will not announce new policy, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

The fears of an invasion grew from the fact that Russia has massed more than 130,000 troops near Ukraine. Russia denies it has any invasions plans.\n\nBiden threatens devastating sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine.

US says Russia may use the tactic to justify Ukraine invasion\n\nContributing: Courtney Subramanian, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/united-nations-ukraine-russia/index.html", "title": "Why isn't the United Nations doing more to stop what's happening in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWatching the brutal images of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has many people around the world asking, why isn’t the United Nations doing more to stop the war? Among them, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself.\n\n“You need to act immediately,” Zelensky implored the UN Security Council during a live-streamed address April 6 to its members.\n\nHe begged them to do something to stop the war in his country, criticizing the Security Council’s inaction directly. And he called out the elephant in the room: Russia, one of the five permanent members of the Council, whose status gives it the ability to veto any action it disagrees with.\n\n“We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to die,” Zelensky said.\n\nIt was a blunt message urging the Council to reform, and if that won’t work, he said, “the next option would be to dissolve yourself altogether. And I know you can admit that if there is nothing you can do besides conversation.”\n\nMany people who have watched the UN for years agree that the UN Security Council looks impotent in this moment, with the world watching. The Security Council was designed in a different era, after World War II, with a membership and veto system that have ultimately restricted its effectiveness in dealing with this global conflict. Other parts of the UN have responded more effectively to the humanitarian and refugee crises the war has created.\n\nFormer US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, who served under Republican Presidents including George W. Bush and Donald Trump, agreed with Zelensky’s assessment. “I thought he was absolutely right,” Bolton told CNN’s chief political analyst Gloria Borger. “And I thought one more convert to understanding what’s wrong with the United Nations. Its political institutions are fundamentally broken.”\n\nBolton has never been a big fan of the UN. He’s famous for saying, back in 1994, that if the UN Secretariat building in New York “lost 10 stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.”\n\nThere have been many moments of deadlock before in the Security Council when the big powers disagree. But this moment has drawn outsized attention globally.\n\n“This is the single biggest crisis to hit the UN since the end of the Cold War,” said Richard Gowan, the UN Director for the International Crisis Group. “It is possible that this does mark the beginning of a sort of fundamental rupture amongst the great powers that will make UN diplomacy see vastly harder going forward.”\n\nThe system was designed this way: to prevent global conflict but also to reward the main winners of World War II, according to Gowan.\n\nKey veto power\n\nWhen the United Nations charter was signed in 1945, it established the Security Council with five permanent members and six nonpermanent members. The permanent members – the US, the UK, France, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China – were each given the power to veto any resolutions they opposed.\n\n“It was Franklin Roosevelt who wanted to set up an organization that would police the world after the defeat of Nazi Germany,” Gowan said. “But the only way he could get Russia and other powers to agree to that deal, was if they had the ability to block any actions against themselves.”\n\nThe late Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin himself insisted on that power as a way for his state to protect itself.\n\nToday, the Security Council has 15 members, but the five permanent members have remained the same, with Russia holding the former Soviet Union’s seat and China taking the seat of the Republic of China. And the veto hasn’t changed either.\n\n“What we’re seeing is, when there’s a fundamental disagreement among the permanent members, nothing happens,” Bolton said.\n\nThe UN charter also makes it impossible to do another thing Zelensky suggested: kick Russia off the Security Council, because the country can veto that too.\n\nOver the years, countries and diplomats have suggested to reform the council by adding more permanent members to make it better reflect the contemporary geopolitical reality, or even try to take away the veto power. But no country wants to dilute its power.\n\n“I’m being honest with you, I don’t think anyone’s going to want to give up their veto,” former US Ambassador to the UN Bill Richardson, who served under former Democratic President Bill Clinton, told Borger.\n\nRichardson points out that the United States has used the veto to protect its own interests – and may need to again.\n\n“It helped us in the Iraq War. It helped us in Bosnia. It helps us in conflicts in Africa,” he said. “So no country that is a permanent member wants to give up their veto. And I would be against the US giving up their veto right now, just so that we take action on another issue.”\n\nIn theory, the Security Council “could impose even more sweeping global economic sanctions on Moscow than we have already seen. It could technically authorize military action to push back Russian forces in Ukraine,” according to Gowan.\n\nBut with Russia and likely China set to veto any action taken against the war, the Security Council is deadlocked.\n\nA massive global organization\n\nThe UN is bigger than just the Security Council, and other areas of the body – which has six main organs – have been more active since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“The UN is for airing publicly the tragedies of the world. Like the refugee crisis in Ukraine, like the possible war crimes, like so many other human costs that are taking place,” Richardson said. “At the same time, the UN is providing food. The UN is providing refugee assistance.”\n\nThe UN General Assembly has condemned Russia twice over the war in Ukraine; those resolutions are nonbinding but carry symbolic weight. Russia was also suspended from the Human Rights Council, which requires a two-thirds vote.\n\nBut Bolton said the math behind that vote shows Russia has significant support around the world; the voting result was 93 in favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. A remaining 18 member states were not included in that result.\n\n“So here’s the real headline … A majority of the members of the United Nations, did not vote to expel Russia,” he told Borger.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin likely expected these kinds of condemnations, but what he really cares about is the status and power that being on the Security Council gives Russia.\n\n“After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow clung on to its seat in the Security Council essentially as proof that it was still a big power,” Gowan of the International Crisis Group said. “Now, in the real world … Russia is not that important. It’s China and the US that are the dominant players, but in the Security Council, the Russians stand as equal to the US. And they’re very, very proud of having that status.”\n\nAnd Richardson knows firsthand from his time at the UN in the 1990s, Russia knows how to play the system.\n\n“When I became UN ambassador for the US, Lavrov, Foreign Minister had been there 10 years already. So he was very skillful,” Richardson said. “He knew how to maneuver in the Security Council. He was very formidable. And so we have Russia right now, very knowledgeable about UN operations so that’s an advantage that they have.”\n\nAnd so the Security Council could only watch as Russia invaded Ukraine. And in a bizarre split-screen moment, Russia held the rotating presidency of the Security Council and even chaired the meeting as the invasion began and diplomacy failed.\n\nBolton doesn’t see any way to change the system.\n\n“Unless unicorns break free and sweetness and light prevails, where there are disagreements among the (permanent) five, there will be no action,” he said.", "authors": ["Ashley Semler"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}]}

Both President Donald Trump and Iranian officials have threatened further reprisals if either side attacks.\n\nTrump announced on Twitter he would make a statement on the attack Wednesday.\n\n\"All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq,\" Trump posted to Twitter late Tuesday night. \"Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\"\n\nThere was no initial indication of casualties, according to a U.S. official speaking to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity and not authorized to speak publicly. Still, the official described the attack as \"massive\" and cautioned that the assessment was made in the predawn hours in Iraq on Wednesday.\n\nIt appears a hangar was damaged at the Ain Assad base, one of two struck, the official said. Troops stationed at that base did have advance warning of incoming missiles so they were able to scramble for cover, the official said. They’ve been practicing drills for some time.\n\n“The early warning system worked,” the official said.\n\nWhite House officials said Trump was briefed on the strike and lawmakers on Capitol Hill expressed alarm at the developments, which have moved the U.S. closer to open conflict with a longtime foe in one of the world's most volatile regions.\n\n\"It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel,\" Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Tuesday.\n\n\"As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the region,\" Hoffman added.\n\nPentagon officials were reviewing reports from Iraq and weighing a response, a senior U.S. defense official speaking on the condition of anonymity told USA TODAY. The official called initial reports fragmentary but said some damage appeared likely.\n\nBoth Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were briefed on the attacks, the White House said.\n\n\"The president has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.\n\n'An act of war':Lawmakers react to Iran's missile strike on US military bases\n\nHow we got here:What you need to know about the conflict between the U.S. and Iran after Soleimani killing\n\nAin Assad air base is located in western Iraq and it was used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. It houses about 1,500 U.S. and coalition forces. Trump made a surprise visit there in late 2018 and delivered remarks about the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nThe Erbil base, which the Pentagon said was the site of another attack, is located in Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill said they were alarmed but said they are still gathering information about the extent of the attack.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was gathered with Democrats discussing the impeachment proceedings against Trump and the House agenda when a staff member brought in a note informing her of the strike.\n\nPelosi paused, told members what had happened and said \"we’ve got to pray,\" according to Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who was present for the meeting.\n\n\"She's a Catholic woman like me,\" Dingell said. \"We all care deeply about our military men and women that are serving this country.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal emerged Tuesday from a classified briefing from Department of Homeland Security officials on threats posed by Iran. The concerns raised in that briefing should be made public, he said.\n\n“I found it pretty sobering,” the Connecticut Democrat said.\n\nIranian state TV reported that Tehran claimed credit for the attack and said it was a response to the killing of Soleimani, which Trump ordered late last week. The strike, which occurred early Wednesday in Iraq, came hours after crowds of Iranians were seen publicly mourning Soleimani.\n\nAt a time when both Trump and Iranian officials have threatened reprisals, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warned the U.S. and its allies against retaliating over the missile attack. The Guard issued the warning via a statement carried by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency.\n\n\"We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted,\" the statement said.\n\nIran state media said little beyond confirming the operation and signaling that leaders there would de-escalate if there is no U.S. retaliation, and escalate if there is. It claimed 30 missiles were fired.\n\nOn social media, one Iranian official tweeted: “Get the hell out of our region.” Another posted a picture of the Islamic Republic’s flag with no caption, presumably a reference to Trump’s word-free tweet of the U.S. flag after the Soleimani operation.\n\nIranian foreign minister Javad Zarif framed the attack as a measure of “self-defense.”\n\n“We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,” Zarif tweeted late Tuesday.\n\nAin Assad air base is located in Iraq’s western Anbar province. It was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIranian state TV said the operation’s name was \"Martyr Soleimani.\" It said the Guard’s aerospace division that controls Iran’s missile program launched the attack.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper cited \"exquisite intelligence\" that Soleimani was coordinating imminent attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East. The attacks, Esper said, were likely a matter of days, not weeks, from being launched.\n\nConsidered a foe of the U.S. since the 1979 Iranian revolution, the relationship between the two countries deteriorated after Trump withdrew from a multi-national agreement last year intended to curb Iran's nuclear program. Trump argued the deal, negotiated in part by President Barack Obama, wasn't aggressive enough.\n\nIn recent months Washington has accused Iran of being behind a series of attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities in September and of sabotaging and detaining allied oil tankers in the region in May and June.\n\nTensions erupted last month when an American contractor was killed and several U.S. military service members were wounded in a rocket attack on a military base near Kirkuk, in northern Iraq. The attack was attributed to Kataeb Hezbollah, which the Pentagon said was related to Iran's Quds Force, an elite unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe U.S. responded with a series of airstrikes in Iraq that killed some two dozen members of the militia. Trump then approved an airstrike Thursday at the Baghdad International Airport that killed Soleimani, the head of the Quds force.\n\nThroughout the day on Tuesday, in the hours before the latest strike, leaders from around the world had called for lowering the temperature. French President Emmanuel Macron telephoned his Iranian counterpart earlier Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, to urge him to \"refrain from any measure likely to exacerbate the ongoing escalation of tensions.\"\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard in London, and Christal Hayes and David Jackson in Washington, D.C.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/01/08/us-officials-warned-missile-launch-iraq-bases-troops/2842200001/", "title": "US knew Iranian missiles were coming ahead of strike; Trump ...", "text": "The U.S. military had advance warning of Iran's missile assault on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces, attacks that prompted a vow of new economic sanctions Wednesday from President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, addressing the nation, said no deaths or injuries resulted from the attacks.

The missiles targeted al Assad air base in Iraq’s western Anbar province and another base in Erbil in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n\nThe extent of damage to the bases was not immediately clear, but early-warning defense systems gave U.S. forces advance knowledge that missiles had been launched, according to a U.S. official speaking to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAssassination or legitimate act? Legal debate rages as Iran retaliates\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, added that a hangar was damaged at al Assad, a sprawling complex 100 miles west of Baghdad that houses about 1,500 coalition forces.\n\nBut the warnings allowed troops and other personnel to scramble into hardened bunkers for safety. U.S. and coalition personnel in Iraq on the mission to combat ISIS have been practicing drills for missile attacks for some time, the official said.\n\n“The early-warning system worked,” the official said.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also credited the system for preventing casualties, telling reporters the missiles were sent with the intent of doing serious harm, not merely to create the illusion Iran was retaliating.\n\n“I believe based on what I saw and what I know that they were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel,” Milley said.\n\nMajid Takht Ravanchi, Iran's U.N. Ambassador, said in a letter to that body that his country simply exercised its right to self-defense by taking proportionate measures and “does not seek escalation or war.”\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi said in a statement Wednesday that Iran notified Iraq the attack “had begun or would begin shortly,” on unspecified U.S. military locations. The U.S. military reported the attack at the same time, he said.\n\nCNN, citing an Arab diplomatic source, reported that Iran notified Iraq in advance and that Iraqi officials then tipped U.S. troops before the attack began. A U.S. defense official also told CNN that Iraqis were told by Iran to stay away from certain bases.\n\nThe militaries of Finland and Lithuania, which had personnel at one of the targeted bases, said they also received information about an imminent attack and had time to take shelter or leave the base.\n\nIranian state TV aired video of what commentators described as the missiles being launched. Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif later said his country had \"concluded proportionate measures\" in response to a \"cowardly armed attack against our citizens.\"\n\nFahim Masoud, Middle East intelligence manager for the risk assessment firm WorldAware, warned that Zarif's statement does not mean Iran will stop using its proxies and cyberwarfare capabilities to attack U.S. troops, interests and assets.\n\n\"Soleimani's killing was the most consequential event in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq,\" he told USA TODAY in an email. \"Its consequences will reverberate through the region for several years.\"\n\nStill, conventional war with Iran is not likely due to its outdated weaponry and an economy that is on the verge of collapse, he said.\n\n\"The Iranian regime wants to survive,\" he said.\n\n'This was an act of war':Lawmakers react to Iran's missile strike on US military bases\n\nTrump said he would not let Iran become a nuclear power, blasting the previous nuclear deal with Iran from which the U.S. controversially withdrew. He said a better deal has to be arranged and the civilized world must send a message that \"your campaign of terrorism will not be tolerated anymore.\"\n\nJames Piazza, a Penn State professor specializing in Middle East issues, told USA TODAY that Trump failed to provide \"any reassuring information\" on how he would keep Iran from developing nuclear capability. Nor did Trump indicate how he might build international support for more Iran sanctions, Piazza said.\n\n\"The president has so thoroughly alienated traditional U.S. allies, I am not very optimistic that he will be able to put more pressure on Iran with allied help and support,\" Piazza said.\n\nWhat we know:'Black boxes' found in Ukrainian plane crash that killed 176\n\nTimeline:How tensions escalated with Iran\n\nIran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated his nation's position that the U.S. must exit Iraq – and the Middle East.\n\n\"They were slapped last night, but such military actions are not enough,\" he said. \"This region won’t accept the US presence.\"\n\nMeanwhile, NATO has temporarily suspended training of counter-ISIS forces in Iraq, a NATO official who was not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY.

The attack, the official said, was designed mainly for a domestic audience to show Iranians that the regime was responding to the killing last week of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.\n\nThe missile’s impact caused no caused casualties and limited damage, the source said. The potential for mass casualties from an attack was real: More than 1,500 troops are housed at the two bases in western and northern Iraq.\n\nIn September, precision drone and missile strikes by Iranian-backed forces severely damaged oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia, supporting the belief that Iran has the capability to strike targets with lethal force. That attack slashed Saudi oil production by destroying infrastructure. The weapons used were Iranian, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and constituted an act of war.\n\nTuesday's attack did not kill or wound any U.S. troops, President Donald Trump confirmed Wednesday in a live address to the nation. He described the damage done by the missiles as \"minimal.\"\n\nIran, Trump said, \"appears to be standing down.\"\n\nThe strike Tuesday could have functioned as a very loud warning shot and may be an indication that the regime wants to limit escalation, said Michael O'Hanlon, a military analyst at the Brookings Institution. The opening may be short-lived, he said.\n\nWhat we know about bases:Trump, Pence have visited bases attacked by missiles\n\n\"They missed on purpose and want to de-escalate,\" O'Hanlon said, \"for the moment.\"\n\nThe Iranians know how to hit a target when they want to destroy it, said a U.S. official with knowledge of Iranian capabilities who was not authorized to speak publicly. Such an attack would have caused \"grave damage,\" the official said. It is possible that more moderate elements in the Iranian government are pushing for restraint, the official said.\n\nAnother senior staff member on Capitol Hill said the Iranians deliberately chose their targets as a warning, not to inflict major damage.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday there may be an opening for negotiation between the United States and Iran.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to come back from the brink of war,\" Blumenthal said. \"Purposely or inadvertently, the strikes caused a lot less damage than might have been expected.\"\n\nWarning system works:US knew Iranian missiles were coming ahead of strike; Trump announces new sanctions\n\nRead his words:President Trump's remarks on Iran from the White House\n\nThe strikes involved more than a dozen guided missiles aimed at two bases in Iraq that house U.S.-led forces fighting Islamic State militants and helping to train Iraqi troops for combat. At the sprawling al Assad air base in western Iraq, there are about 1,500 U.S., Iraqi and allied forces. Erbil, the other base, is in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.\n\nThe Iranian attack follows a drone strike last week in Baghdad that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the second-most powerful official in Iran and leader of forces that have been branded a terrorist organization by the United States. Iran vowed revenge after that targeted killing, which the White House, State Department and Pentagon said was necessary to prevent imminent attacks on American forces in the region.\n\nU.S.-Iranian tensions, already simmering after Iran shot down an American drone last summer, spiked Dec. 27 after Iranian-backed militias fired rockets at the U.S. base near Erbil and killed an U.S. contractor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/01/29/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/72393274007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Mix-up may have led to drone attack", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Monday, Jan. 29.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said he couldn't confirm the report.\n\nTop U.S. and NATO officials dismissed Iran's claims that it had no role in the deadly assault, which threatened to fuel expansion of the Israeli-Hamas war.\n\n\"Let me start with my outrage and sorrow for the death of three brave U.S. troops in Jordan and for the other troops who were wounded,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at a Monday briefing with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. \"The president and I will not tolerate attacks on U.S. forces, and we will take all necessary actions to defend the U.S. and our troops.\"\n\nStoltenberg said Iran was behind the attack in Jordan and those by Yemen-based Houthi militants on ships in the region, adding that \"the U.S. is leading international efforts to end these attacks.\"\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of militias supported by Iran, claimed responsibility for the attack in Jordan. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said militant groups in the region do not take orders from Tehran and that Iran \"does not welcome the expansion of conflicts in the region.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also blamed Iran, pledging to \"hold all those responsible to account.\" Kanaani said U.S. strikes on militant groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen \"escalate the cycle of instability.\"\n\nMaps show drone strike against US forces in Jordan was latest in more than 150 attacks\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Rockets apparently fired from Gaza caused air raid sirens to wail in Tel Aviv for the first time since December despite the Israeli military's efforts to neutralize Hamas in Gaza.\n\n∎ Ten Palestinians were killed in a strike that hit a residential building in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, said Dr. Moataz Harara, a physician at Shifa Hospital.\n\n∎ A senior Jordanian security source told Reuters that Jordan had sought more advanced U.S. defense equipment and support amid worries Iran and its proxies could conduct a strike.\n\nWar and politics:Joe Biden faces campaign pressure over drone deaths and response to Iran\n\nTotal of injured troops from Jordan attack rises to 40\n\nIran was behind Sunday's attack in Jordan because it arms, trains and funds the militants who launched it, deputy Pentagon Press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday.\n\nThe number of U.S. troops wounded in the attack has risen to 40 and may increase as troops continue to report symptoms of traumatic brain injury, she said. Three of the wounded will soon be taken to the military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, for a higher level of care.\n\nThe Army identified the three soldiers killed as Sgt. William Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Ga.; Spc. Kennedy Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Ga.; and Spc. Breonna Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Ga. The one-way attack drone struck their housing units, according to the Army.\n\nThere have been 165 attacks on bases in the Middle East where U.S. troops are stationed, Singh said, including 98 in Syria, 66 in Iraq and the one in Jordan. They have wounded about 120 U.S. troops. Most of the injuries have been minor and the service members have returned to duty.\n\nCentral Command said about 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel were deployed to the base that was attacked Sunday.\n\nAttacks against US by Iranian proxies 'likely to continue'\n\nAs they weigh options for how to respond to Sunday’s attack in Jordan, Biden administration officials may find few of them other than direct confrontation would convince Iran to discourage assaults from groups hostile to the U.S. in the Middle East.\n\nDavid Silbey, an associate professor of history at Cornell University who specializes in military history and defense policy, said Iran has little incentive to deviate from its strategy of supporting those proxies.\n\n“There are plenty of Iranian-supported forces in Iraq and Syria that could be hit as a way of retaliating,’’ Silbey said. “One other possibility would be to hit Iranian oil-processing facilities in the Persian Gulf. That’s not quite as escalatory as, for example, bombing Tehran. The problem is that none of this would really deter the Iranians all that much.’’\n\nSilbey describes Iran as a revisionist power in the region trying to knock off the U.S. from its spot as the current power, so the Iranians benefit from militants like the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, among others, doing their dirty work against the U.S. and its allies.\n\n“They don’t want a full-scale war with the United States,’’ he said of the Iranians, “and so mounting an attack with clearly identifiable Iranian forces is probably off the table, but further proxy attacks are likely to continue.”\n\nPentagon seeks counter to 'emerging threat' of one-way drones\n\nRegardless of who's to blame for the assault on the U.S. base in Jordan, the facility − known as Tower 22 − has become a frequent target. This was the third time it got attacked in the last six months.\n\nAttacks using one-way drones such as the one that exploded Sunday near living quarters at the logistics base are highlighting a weakness in American defenses the Pentagon is trying to address.\n\nThese types of drones don't require an operator after launching, since they're programmed to hit a target. They have become an “emerging threat,” the Army has said, prompting the Pentagon to hold tests for weapons to destroy them during a July event in Arizona.\n\nNetanyahu denies reports of a hostage deal\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied reports in Israeli media that a cease-fire deal had been struck and that the widely reported proposal includes conditions that are not acceptable to Israel. Channel 12 in Israel was among outlets reporting Israel had agreed to a 45-day pause in fighting in exchange for 35 hostages in what would be a first phase. Up to 250 Palestinian security prisoners would be released for each Israeli sent home, according to the report.\n\nNBC News, citing a source familiar with the talks, reported that negotiators from Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have agreed on a \"framework\" for a deal but had no details.\n\nHamas falsely claims civilian deaths on Oct. 7 'happened accidentally'\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence its forces killed hundreds of people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attacks, Hamas said in a social media post that avoiding harm to civilians, especially children, women and elderly people, is a religious and moral commitment made by all the Al-Qassam Brigades’ fighters.\n\n\"In addition, if there was any case of targeting civilians, it happened accidentally,\" the statement from the Hamas military wing falsely claimed.\n\nIsrael says the surprise attacks that started the war killed 1,200 people. More than 240 were taken hostage, although a little over 100 of them were released during a weeklong November cease-fire.\n\nThe attack prompted an Israeli military invasion of Gaza, where authorities say more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed. Israel does not dispute the numbers but says it has killed more than 9,000 militants. Israel blames the civilian deaths on a Hamas practice of embedding it forces in civilian buildings and neighborhoods.\n\nDeadly attack on Jordan base reflects risk US troops face\n\nBiden's vow to swiftly respond to the weekend's drone attack that killed three U.S. troops highlights more than just the harsh reality that violence has spread across the Middle East amid the war in Gaza. It also spotlights the risks faced by the more than 40,000 U.S. troops deployed at multiple Middle East locations, as well as in many more parts of the world than Americans may know about.\n\nBiden accused \"radical Iran-backed militants\" in Iraq and Syria for Sunday's attack on Tower 22, a U.S. military outpost in Jordan near the border with Syria.\n\nBenjamin Friedman, policy director of the Washington, D.C.-based Defense Priorities think tank, says the soldiers who were killed and wounded should not have been there in the first place.\n\n\"The militia that killed U.S. forces should be held accountable. But we should ask why U.S. forces in the area were left in range of repeated drone, missile and rocket attacks,'' he said. \"What cause justified this predictable danger? The answer is none. The U.S. government put them in harm’s way in service of a murky and pointless mission.\" Read more here.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nIsrael cancels meetings with UN relief agency as controversy grows\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz canceled meetings between ministry officials and Philippe Lazzarini, embattled chief of the U.N. relief agency for Palestinians − UNRWA − as the controversy surrounding the organization continued to grow. Katz tweeted that Lazzarini \"should draw conclusions and resign. Supporters of terrorism are not welcome here.\"\n\nThe U.S. is among several nations that paused financial support for UNRWA in recent days after a dozen staffers were accused of participating in the Oct. 7 Hamas raid on Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed that the agency has thousands of staffers and that of the 12, nine have been fired, one is dead and two others had not been identified. UNRWA provides lifesaving support to Palestinians in Gaza, and Guterres urged leaders around the world to resume funding, citing the \"dire needs of the desperate populations\" served by the agency.\n\nIsrael has long been at odds with UNRWA, claiming almost 200 employees are members of militant groups. The Israeli government has accused Hamas and other militant groups of siphoning off aid and using U.N. facilities for military purposes.\n\nIran-backed militias prepare for retaliation\n\nIran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria are evacuating their posts in preparation for a retaliatory strike, a source from the Islamic Resistance in Iraq told Qatari-based al-Araby al-Jadeed. The militant group has evacuated its positions along the Iraq-Syria border, leaving only one or two guards to man each post, the official said. Biden has vowed to take retaliatory measures, but it was not clear when or where.\n\nGOP presidential hopefuls Trump, Haley blame Biden for attack on soldiers\n\nRepublicans, led by their presidential candidates, didn't waste much time Sunday putting campaign pressure on Biden over the Middle East drone attacks that killed three U.S. service members. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, challenger Nikki Haley and several prominent GOP lawmakers blamed Biden's policy for the attack, and demanded that he retaliate against Iran, the alleged sponsor of the incident.\n\n\"This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender,\" Trump said.\n\nHaley, a former United Nations ambassador, said militants \"would not be attacking our troops if Joe Biden weren't so weak in his treatment of Iran.\" Read more here.\n\n− David Jackson and Josh Meyer\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/04/13/israel-war-updates-iran-ship/73311944007/", "title": "Israel war updates: Iran launches drones at Israel in revenge strike", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Saturday, April 13.

The official was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Iranians had been observed preparing drones to attack Israel, according to a second U.S. official briefed on the intelligence but not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe attacks were retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy in Damascus, Syria last of Apr. 1. that killed seven Revolutionary Guards officers including two senior commanders. The move by Iran marks the most recent escalation in an inflamed Middle East that has been building for half a year − ever since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel detonated a retaliatory war against the militant group in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Our defensive systems are deployed; we are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address. \"The State of Israel is strong.\"\n\nIsrael's military said fighter jets and navy vessels are \"on a defense mission in Israeli airspace.\"\n\nThe attack is \"likely to unfold over a number of hours,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran,\" Watson said in a statement.\n\nAfter the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, the small Mideast country maintained relations with Iran − an outlier from other Muslim majority countries in the region. After Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, the two nations turned into fierce rivals.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Iran said it will not hesitate to take further \"defensive measures\" to protect its interests against any military aggression, the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday.\n\n∎ Israel's national emergency service reported a 10-year-old boy in the Arad region had been injured. No casualties have been reported as a result of the attack.\n\n∎ Biden returned to the White House to meet with national security advisers about events in the Mideast on Saturday afternoon, cutting short a weekend trip to Delaware, the White House said in a statement.\n\n∎ Iraq and Jordan temporarily closed their airspace as Iran launched drones toward Israel Saturday. Jordan has helped Israel respond to the attack by shooting down dozens of Iranian drones, Reuters reported.\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to U.N. calls for emergency meeting of Security Council\n\nIsrael’s top diplomat to the U.N. called for the Security Council to meet immediately to condemn Iran’s attacks and to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization.\n\nIn a letter released Saturday night, Israeli Ambassador Gilad Erdan wrote to U.N. Security Council President Vanessa Frazier said Iran’s drone and missile attacks at Israel was a “clear violation” of the U.N. Charter and international law, calling it a “severe and dangerous escalation.”\n\nHe pointed to Saturday’s attacks, as well as weapons transfers to Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, among other Iranian-backed proxies, as evidence of violations that he said threaten international peace. He also cited Revolutionary Guards seizing a Portuguese civilian cargo ship earlier on Saturday.\n\n“The time has come for the Security Council to take concrete action against the Iranian threat,” he said.\n\nThe 15-member Security Council includes the U.S. as a permanent member. Neither Israel nor Iran are current members.\n\nIDF: Most Iranian missiles intercepted outside Israel’s borders, IDF base hit with ‘minor damage’\n\nIsrael said most missile launches from Iran were intercepted before crossing into Israel. On social media, Israel Defense Forces said its Aerial Defense Array and its “strategic allies” intercepted most launches before they hit Israeli territory. Still, IDF did identify “a small number of hits,” including at an IDF base in southern Israel. The base had minor damage to infrastructure, IDF said.\n\n“Over the past few hours, many dozens of hostile aircraft, as well as dozens of cruise missiles, from Iran were identified approaching Israeli territory and intercepted,” IDF said. “Dozens of (Israeli Air Force) fighter jets are currently operating to intercept all aerial threats approaching Israeli territory.”\n\nWhat is Israel’s Iron Dome?\n\nThe Iron Dome is Israel’s mobile missile defense system that is designed to find and shoot down short-range rockets fired at Israel. An all-weather system, the Iron Dome can also take down artillery and drones, and it can detect and engage rockets up to 40 miles away.\n\nAfter becoming operational in 2011, it’s been upgraded over the years and has a high success rate. It’s part of Israel’s three-tiered air defense system that protects against short-range ballistic missiles, large-caliber rockets and cruise missiles, via David’s Sling, and also through Arrow-3, which provides defense against medium-range ballistic missiles.\n\nIran won’t hesitate to take more ‘defensive measures’ to protect ‘legitimate interests’\n\nIran’s foreign ministry said it would not hesitate to take further “defensive measures,” against any military aggression, Reuters reported.\n\n“Iran, if necessary, will not hesitate to take further defensive measures to safeguard its legitimate interests against any military aggressions and unlawful use of force,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, according to state TV.\n\nIran would do so, the statement reportedly said, while reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the U.N. Charter and international law.\n\nU.N. secretary-general ‘deeply alarmed’ by region-wide escalation\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he strongly condemned Iran’s “large-scale attack” on Israel. In a statement, he called for an immediate stop to the fighting.\n\n“I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation,” he said. “I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East. I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war.”\n\nTrump praises Israel, attacks Biden's leadership during Pennsylvania rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump paid tribute to Israel and blamed President Joe Biden for Iran's attack during a campaign rally Saturday night in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"God Bless the people of Israel,\" Trump said at the start of a rally at a fairground in Schnecksville, Pa., near Allentown.\n\nTrump, who attacked Biden in a series of Truth Social posts earlier in the day, did not cite the president by name when discussing Israel, but did blame what he called weak U.S. leadership for the attack by Iran.\n\nEchoing a Truth Social post earlier in the day, Trump said the attack \"would not have happened\" if \"we were in office.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nBiden says commitment to Israel’s security 'ironclad'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said that he met with his national security team for an update on Iran’s attacks against Israel.\n\n“Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,” he said on social media.\n\nSirens, booms across Israel as 10-year-old critically injured\n\nSirens sounded off across Israel amid Iranian drone attacks, according to Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe IDF issued a flurry of alerts on Telegram for sirens sounding from southern Israel to northern Israel. This also included Jerusalem, the Negev and Dead Sea regions, among others.\n\nMagen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service, said there were no casualties reported, but a 10-year-old boy in the Bedouin area in the Arad region is in critical condition. On social media, MDA said first responders were treating the boy.\n\nIt was unclear whether he was injured by missile fragments or an interceptor, Times of Israel reported.\n\nEarlier, MDA said sirens sounded across the country but there were no reports of casualties aside from calls of “stress symptoms” and people injured running for cover.\n\nTrump attacks Biden over Iran attack; claims it wouldn't have happened under him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump reacted to the attack by referring to himself.\n\n\"ISRAEL IS UNDER ATTACK! This should never have been allowed to happen - This would NEVER have happened if I were President!\" the presumptive Republican presidential candidate said in one of a string of Truth Social posts.\n\nIn other posts, Trump taunted Biden for not giving a live speech on the attack, and said the U.S. would always stand behind Israel.\n\nTrump may address the situation during a campaign rally near Allentown, Pa.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nJordan shoots down dozens of Iranian drones to help Israel\n\nJordan shot down dozens of Iranian drones above northern and central Jordan en route to Israel, Reuters reported citing two security sources.\n\nThe news outlet reported Iran said it had been watching if Jordan made any moves seen as supporting Israel, warning that Jordan could be the next target, Reuters reported.\n\nIranian drone attack makes Israel attack on embassy ‘concluded,’ Iran U.N. mission says\n\nIran’s mission to the UN. said its drone attack against Israel marks the end of its response to Israel suspected bombing Iran's embassy in Syria in early April.\n\n“The matter can be deemed concluded,” Iran’s mission said in a social media post Saturday evening. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”\n\nLawmakers respond to Iran attack on Israel\n\nReactions from lawmakers were largely divided among partisan lines, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, stating the \"Biden Administration's undermining of Israel and appeasement of Iran have contributed to these terrible developments,\" and GOP Rep. Mike Crenshaw, R-Texas, arguing that \"Biden signaled waning support for Israel. Now a potential war is erupting.\"\n\nOther GOP lawmakers such as Sen. Roger Wicker, the top-ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on the U.S. to stand with Israel.\n\n“Our shared enemies, including Iran and their proxies, need to know our commitment is unwavering. We must join with Israel to ensure that Iran’s aggression is met with resolute action and resounding strength,\" Wicker, R-Miss., said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada also said, \"The United States stands firmly with Israel and its right to defend itself against attacks from Iran and its terrorist proxies.\"\n\nThe senator said she would keep working to get legislation passed that provides additional military aid to Israel.\n\n\"What is happening now in the Middle East is why the house should have voted for the Senate passed security bill that supports Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan in their fight for sovereignty and democratic principles,\" Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said in a X post, calling the U.S. the \"backbone of the free world.\"\n\nDrones key to Iran and its militias against U.S., Israel, researchers say\n\nDrones have been key to Iran and militant groups it supports to attack U.S. forces and allies, according to the Iran Primer, a consortium of scholars who study the country.\n\nIran first developed rudimentary drones during its war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran Primer's article said Friday. Today, Iranian drones are used for combat as suicide drones that explode on impact, or by traveling long distances to launch munitions at targets. They are also used for surveillance to identify targets using photo and video.\n\nIran began sending drones to Hezbollah, the militant group it backs in Lebanon, in the 2000s. In 2006, Hezbollah used drones against Israel in its 34-day war. They’ve reportedly since been used against ISIS militants, as well as in attacks in Saudi oilfields and in Iraq against U.S. military and diplomatic targets. Since 2022, Iran has supplied Russia with drones starting to use against civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Iran’s use of drones has increased in Syria, Iraq and Jordan after the war began between Hamas and Israel. In January, an Iranian-made drone killed three American soldiers in Jordan, while Houthi militants, backed by Iran, used Iranian-designed drones to attack ships in the Red Sea.\n\nWhile some Iranian drones are small, carrying as little as 7 pounds of explosives, others can have payloads of up to 1,240 pounds. Many are modeled on captured American drones, Iran Primer said.\n\nPlans in place ahead of drones, defense not ‘hermetic,’ IDF says\n\nIsrael plans to cut GPS services in certain areas as part of its plan to counter Iran launching drones at the country, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Saturday evening.\n\n“The IDF and the Israeli Air Force are implementing the plan we prepared in advance,” Hagari said in remarks. “As part of the preparations, GPS services will not be available in certain areas - the disruption is deliberate and according to plan. If we detect additional threats with a shorter arrival time, we will update you immediately.”\n\nHagari reminded Israelis of Home Front Command, which helps prepare civilians for conflicts or disasters. With sirens activated, IDF said people must enter shelters and remain there for no less than 10 minutes, though he said it could be longer. He encouraged Israelis to act responsibly and calmly. The IDF remains cooperating with the U.S. and partners in the region to counter launches and intercept them, he added. Protection includes the Israeli Air Force and Navy personnel, as well as the Aerial Defense Array, which includes the Iron Dome Aerial Defense System.\n\nThe defense is not “hermetic,” he said, adding it’s crucial to follow the country's Home Front Command.\n\nU.S. promises to support Israel in face of Iran attack\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Saturday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and “made clear that Israel could count on full U.S. support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies,” according to a readout of their call provided by Pentagon press secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan also affirmed the U.S.' \"ironclad commitment to the security of Israel\" in a call with his counterpart in Israel, Tzachi Hanegbi, Sullivan said Saturday.\n\nNetanyahu said in an address he appreciates the U.S. and other allies' support.\n\nHow long until the Iranian drones reach Israel?\n\nThe dozens of drones that were launched could take hours to arrive, according to Israel's top-rated Channel 12 TV news. Retired general Amos Yadlin told the channel the drones were equipped with 20 kg of explosives. Israel's military said sirens will sound in any threatened areas. Iran has threatened to retaliate for an April 1 attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed seven of its military commanders. Iran blames Israel for the attack, but Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement.\n\nIran readies missiles for potential attack, US official says\n\nIran has been observed preparing cruise missiles for use in a potential attack on Israel, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, national security officials remained focused Saturday on Iran’s next steps, a second official said. Both officials were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBiden confirmed Friday that U.S. intelligence showed that an Iranian attack on Israel could happen soon. Iran has vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike. Iran blames Israel for the airstrike; Israel has not publicly acknowledged its role in the attack.\n\nIran’s anticipated retaliation comes as tensions have spiked in the Middle East as Israel’s war against Hamas continues. The Pentagon has bolstered defenses for the tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the region in advance of the prospect of an imminent attack on Israel and Western interests.\n\nMore:Israelis ask if world has forgotten their hostages six months after the trauma of Oct. 7\n\nMore:Pregnant women in Gaza Strip face starvation, no anesthesia after 6 months of war\n\nIranian forces seize ship with ties to Israel in Strait of Hormuz\n\nMembers of Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday.\n\nIranian state media reported that the MSC Aries ship, which carries a Portuguese flag, was taken into Iranian waters. The ship's operator, MSC, confirmed the seizure by Iran and said it was working with authorities to ensure its return and the safety of the crew.\n\nThe crew includes Indian, Filipino, Pakistani, Russian and Estonian, according to White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. Watson said the seizing of a \"civilian vessel without provocation is a blatant violation of international law\" and an act of piracy.\n\n\"We strongly condemn the Iranian seizure of the Portuguese flagged, British-owned MSC AIRES in international waters,\" Watson said on X.\n\nShip incident comes amid Houthi attacks in Red Sea\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen has been attacking ships in the Red Sea for months, saying it aims for Israel-linked ships.\n\nThe ship seized on Saturday is owned by Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime. Zodiac is partly owned by an Israeli businessman. Zodiac said in a statement that MSC leases the Aries and is responsible for its activities.\n\n\"Iran will bear consequences for choosing to escalate this situation any further,\" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nHasan Alhasan, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters that if the seizure of the ship is in retaliation for the April 1 attack, it may indicate Iran's desire to save face without causing a wider escalation of the regional conflict. \"Iran may be trying to play on fears that it could obstruct shipping through the strait, a passageway of greater significance to global oil and gas supplies than the Red Sea,\" Alhasan said.\n\nBody found of missing Israeli teen\n\nIsraeli officials said the body of a 14-year-old boy who went missing near the Malachei Shalom outpost on Friday morning was found Saturday in the West Bank.\n\nBinyamin Achimair's death was a \"terrorist attack,\" the Israeli military said, while Netanyahu vowed the perpetrators would be found.\n\nIsraeli forces were searching \"from the air and on the ground\" Friday, while groups of Israeli settlers stormed a nearby Palestinian village and set fire to houses and cars overnight. One person was killed and several injured in the conflict, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law by most of the world, which Israel contests.

The strikes were in response to a rocket attack earlier in February targeting U.S. troops and civilian personnel in northern Iraq without first seeking congressional approval. The U.S. has blamed the militia for numerous attacks targeting U.S. personnel and interests in Iraq in the past.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, a lead sponsor of the bill, said the reliance on the decades old authorizations for use of military force \"serve no operational purpose, keep us on permanent war footing, and undermine the sovereignty of Iraq.\"\n\n\"Last week's airstrikes in Syria show that the Executive Branch, regardless of party, will continue to stretch its war powers,\" said Kaine, a Virginia Democrat.\n\nMore:Biden-authorized bombings in Syria are about sending a message, say military experts\n\nAdministration officials defended the airstrikes as legal and appropriate, saying they took out facilities that housed valuable \"capabilities\" used by Iranian-backed militia groups to attack American and allied forces in Iraq.\n\nBut several leading members of Congress, including members in Biden's own party, denounced the strikes — the first military action he has authorized. Kaine and others argued offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe White House signaled support to replace the authorizations even as it warned the U.S. may consider military action following a rocket attack earlier this week that hit an air base in western Iraq where American and coalition troops are housed. A U.S. contractor died after at least 10 rockets slammed into the base early Wednesday.\n\n\"If we assess further response is warranted, we will take action again in a manner and time of our choosing,\" Psaki said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/12/iran-missile-attack-intent-iraq-attack-hints-tehrans-next-move/4423175002/", "title": "Iran missile attack: Intent of Iraq attack hints at Tehran's next move", "text": "WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump tweeted \"All is Well!\" Tuesday after Iran's missile attack on two U.S. air bases in Iraq, the danger of imminent war seemed to have passed.\n\nNo casualties. It was a warning shot, said a U.S. official after dawn broke Wednesday in the desert. Many outside national security experts agreed, saying they believed Iran took deliberate steps to avoid American casualties. And in a televised address, Trump spoke of \"minimal damage\" and \"Iran standing down\" in a relatively restrained retaliation for the U.S. drone strike that killed Iran's second-most powerful figure, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani.\n\nBut by dusk in Washington, the official assessment had darkened. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley became the first of several administration officials to assert Iran had indeed sought to kill U.S. soldiers and destroy vehicles and warplanes.\n\nDays later, Iran's intentions remain a subject of intense debate and some outside experts harbor doubts about Milley's assertion. Iran has been even less clear. Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard’s Aerospace Force, said Tehran was not trying to kill anyone \"although tens of US troops have likely been killed and wounded,\" according to Iran's Fars News Agency.\n\nThe question of whether Iran tried to kill U.S. soldiers or merely rattle Americans with a warning shot is significant because the answer hints at how far Tehran is willing to go to challenge the country it calls the \"Great Satan.\"\n\nPersian Gulf:Iran got its revenge for Qasem Soleimani's killing but the US Navy is still a target\n\n\"This is the first, not the final, shot from Iran,\" said Eric Brewer, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who focused on Iran issues at Trump's National Security Council. \"Whether or not Iran intended to kill Americans, I don't think we should expect that this is the only step that Iran is going to take on.\"\n\nIf Iran wanted to, it could have\n\nIn the chaos before dawn on Wednesday, officials scurried to assess damage from 16 short-range ballistic missiles that Iran had fired at two air bases U.S. and coalition troops occupy in Iraq: al-Assad in the western part of the country and Erbil in the north. Eleven missiles struck at al-Assad, and one fell near Erbil. The rest failed to reach their targets.\n\nBy midmorning Wednesday, those officials, privy to initial assessments, told USA TODAY that the lack of casualties and relatively minor damage to tents, a helicopter and a hangar probably were intended as a warning that worse could be in store. Part of that theory rests on Iran's capability, displayed in September, to target with precision and damage oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia. If Iran wanted to hit a target, a senior U.S. official said, it would have.\n\nThat view gained currency with Trump's address. Backed by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Vice President Mike Pence, Milley and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Trump signaled Wednesday that tit-for-tat steps toward war seemed to have stopped.\n\n\"Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,\" he said.\n\nTrump vs. Tehran:Iraqis stuck in the middle in battle for Middle East influence\n\nBy Friday, the message had changed. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters, \"There’s no doubt in my judgment, as I observed the Iranian activity in the region that night, they had the full intention of carrying – killing U.S. forces, whether that was our military folks or diplomatic folks who were in the region.\"\n\nNational security experts and many prominent lawmakers suggested that if Iran's aim was to kill U.S. troops, it would have launched more missiles and probably picked different targets, such as the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad or other parts of the Green Zone where there could have been hundreds of casualties, if not more.\n\nThe Iranians waged the bet, fraught with risk but deemed necessary, to launch a conventional attack on U.S. forces to avenge Soleimani's death.\n\nMark Quantock, a retired two-star Army general who served as director of intelligence for Central Command, said it appeared Iran sought to mitigate the risk by signaling the strike long enough in advance to allow U.S. forces to prepare.\n\nIn fact, the attack did not surprise U.S. forces.\n\nTroops had hours to prepare for the attack, dispersing personnel to bunkers well before the missiles crashed down, according to a U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly. The warning came from U.S. intelligence sources and was shared with American allies, the official said.\n\n“They were trying to kill equipment and housing,” Quantock said. “They signaled the attack and knew we were watching. Through technical means, we would know that they were fueling missiles and positioning them. They also knew the Iraqis would tell us.”\n\nSecond attack:Pentagon launched second attack on an Iranian militant the same day it killed Soleimani\n\nDeaths would have sparked retaliation\n\nBut if what Pompeo and other officials are now asserting is true – that Iran ordered a lethal strike – the U.S. was a lot closer to war this week than many people assumed.\n\nGiven time to shelter in bunkers, U.S. forces across Iraq withstood the attack by more than a dozen ballistic missiles. Iran’s goal was to destroy several aircraft and perhaps a munitions bunker that could generate a spectacular explosion, Quantock said.\n\nHad any Americans died, a strike on the Iranian bases that launched the missiles almost certainly would have been the Pentagon's next move, he said.\n\n“Now you’re hitting Iran proper,” he said. “That ups the ante substantially.”\n\nTrump's war powers:House votes to limit President Trump's war powers after Soleimani killing\n\nOn Friday, U.S. officials reported Iraq was quiet. And it may remain so for some time, Quantock said, but it's hardly over.\n\n“This is phase one of their response,” he said.\n\nThomas Warrick, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, pointed to Iran's \"peculiar sense of symmetry\" when it comes to its international views and taking action against the U.S.\n\n\"What we or our allies do to them, they do back to us, not exactly in the same way, but in a similar way,\" he said during a panel discussion Thursday. \"This in fact makes Iran much more predictable than I think many people opining on these issues tries to say.\"\n\nWhile experts agreed further military strikes from Tehran were unlikely, Warrick pointed to comments by President Hassan Rouhani and the Islamic Republic's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who have both said Iran's strategic objective is to drive U.S. forces from the region. How Iran plans to achieve that goal is less clear.\n\nTrump-Trudeau:Downing of Ukrainian airliner Iran could draw Trump and Trudeau together\n\n'Blood for blood'\n\nIran, as Trump noted, may be standing down. For now. Quantock said he expected two more waves of attacks in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe next threat comes from the Iranian-backed militias whose rocket attacks killed an American contractor on Dec. 27 near Erbil. They also laid siege to the U.S Embassy in Iraq. Soleimani had firm control over their actions, but his successor is expected to have less influence. They held Soleimani in high regard and will seek vengeance.\n\n“Blood for blood,” Quantock said. “Likely mortars or rocket attacks. Damage, explosions and casualties.”\n\nSuch proxy forces, long fostered by Soleimani, pose greater risks of renewed conflict with Iran because the Trump administration has been quicker than prior administrations to blame Tehran for attacks by regional militia groups, CSIS's Brewer said.\n\nIran sanctions:Trump administration hits Iran with new economic sanctions\n\nThe most recent spate of tensions between Washington and Tehran came after Pompeo blamed Iran for attacks on Saudi oil refineries in September that disrupted 5% of the world's global oil supply. Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the strikes, but Pompeo insisted Iran was behind the attacks. Trump responded by imposing harsher sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\nFinally, the Quds Force that Soleimani led has international reach, creating risks for U.S. embassies and personnel around the world.\n\nStill Warrick warned the gamble the Iranians took show they're relying too much on luck, noting it was \"by the grace of God no one was killed\" during the strikes on the two Iraqi air bases.\n\n\"It's a huge mistake to rely on luck to save your country from a major and devastating military response, which would have been the case if someone simply decided to go out and retrieve an item in their tent,\" he said.\n\n\"And that kind of action is as dangerous as anything else that I've heard criticized from any party in this dispute,\" Warrick said.\n\nIlhan Omar:Republicans mock Ilhan Omar for saying Iran war talk sparked PTSD", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/02/26/syria-bombing-biden-airstrikes-mark-test-us-role-worlds-police/6831034002/", "title": "Syria bombing: Biden airstrikes mark test of US role as world's police", "text": "Pentagon airstrikes against Iran-backed militias in Syria are not only the first military action taken by President Joe Biden. They are a test of his broad pledge to pursue a foreign policy that is more cooperative and mindful of international partners than his predecessor's but still eschews the U.S. role as the world's police to focus on making life better for Americans, some experts and lawmakers say.\n\nBiden on Thursday night ordered the airstrikes on multiple facilities at a Syrian-Iraqi border control point in southeastern Syria in retaliation for rocket attacks on U.S. targets in neighboring Iraq. The Pentagon identified the targets as a \"number of Iranian-backed militant groups including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada.\" It called the airstrikes \"proportionate\" and \"defensive\" and said the airstrikes were taken after consultation with coalition partners and unspecified \"diplomatic measures.\"\n\nThe military action comes as Washington and Tehran are locked in apparent stalemate over who should take the first step to revitalize a nuclear deal exited by the Trump administration; as Biden has vowed to recalibrate national security actions to favor the middle class; and as reporting from USA TODAY has revealed the voluminous scale of U.S. overseas military bases and counterterror operations two decades after 9/11.\n\n\"We are concerned that President Biden’s first instinct when it comes to regional security in the Middle East appears to be to reach for military options instead of diplomacy,\" said Ryan Costello, director of The National Iranian American Council, an organization that seeks improved relations between Washington and Tehran.\n\nAmerica has a vast overseas military empire:Does it still need it?\n\n\"Biden wanted to respond to the incident in Iraq,\" said Max Abrahms, a professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University, \"but he wanted to do it in a way that didn't seem too heavy-handed ... the more fundamental question that needs to be asked, and isn't, is what are Iranian militias doing in Iraq? The answer is they are there partly because the U.S. toppled (Iraq's former president) Saddam Hussein.\"\n\nFirst airstrikes under Biden:US bombs Syria facilities used by Iran-backed militia\n\nAbrahms said that the Biden administration is trying to balance the instincts of veteran national security officials and diplomats such as Secretary of State Antony Blinken – Obama administration-era officials who have long gravitated toward military interventions and regime change from Syria to Venezuela – with \"the zeitgeist of the American citizenry, which has moved over the course of the Trump administration.\"\n\nHe described this \"zeitgeist,\" which is backed up by polling, that shows many Americans are most concerned about economic and security threats closer to home, as \"a more limited role for the United States in the world, a greater delineation of where our vital interests lie and a skepticism of a democracy-promoting agenda.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters he was \"confident in the target we went after. We know what we hit.\"\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said the airstrikes killed at least 22 pro-Iranian fighters, wounded many more and destroyed several trucks carrying munitions. Some Iranian media reported a similar death toll, although they did not cite the source of their information.\n\nEarlier this month, a civilian contractor from the Philippines working with the U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq was killed in a rocket attack on U.S. targets. Several others were wounded in that assault, including a National Guard solider and four American civilian contractors. Iran denies any involvement or ties to the Feb. 15 assault near Erbil.\n\nA little-known Shiite militant group calling itself Saraya Awliya al-Dam, Arabic for Guardians of Blood Brigade, claimed responsibility.\n\nIranian-backed Shiite militia groups have been responsible for numerous rocket attacks that have targeted U.S. personnel or facilities in Iraq. The December 2019 killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack in Kirkuk sparked a tit-for-tat fight on Iraqi soil that brought the U.S. to the brink of a war with Iran. The Pentagon later assassinated senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani.\n\nThe U.S. has about 2,500 troops stationed in Iraq.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a statement that the \"American people deserve to hear the administration’s rationale for these strikes and its legal justification for acting without coming to Congress. Offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Defense Department briefed congressional leadership before the airstrikes and that there will be a full classified briefing next week. She called the action \"pursuant to [the president's] Article II authority to defend U.S. personnel.\"\n\n\"The targets were chosen to correspond to the recent attacks on facilities and to deter the risk of additional attacks over the coming weeks,\" she said Friday. \"As a matter of international law, the United States acted pursuant to a threat of self-defense as reflected in Article 51 of the UN Charter. The strikes were both necessary to address the threat and were proportionate to the prior attacks.\"\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN that Biden's airstrikes marked the fifth consecutive time a U.S. president has ordered such strikes against targets in the Middle East.\n\n\"There is absolutely no justification for a president to authorize a military strike that is not in self-defense against an imminent threat without congressional authorization. We need to extricate from the Middle East, not escalate,\" Khanna said, noting that it was action taken under the \"broad, outdated\" Authorization for Use of Military Force law (AUMF).\n\nAUMF is legislation that sprung from President George W. Bush's \"global war on terror\" and the invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11. That 2001 authorization has been stretched to target militant groups in Syria, Kenya, Pakistan, Philippines, Somalia and beyond, according to research by Stephanie Savell, a defense and security expert at the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute. USA TODAY reported this week, based on Savell's research, that from 2018 to 2020 the U.S. military was active in counterterrorism operations in 85 countries, either directly or via surrogates, training exercises, drone strikes or low-profile U.S. special operations forces missions.\n\nExclusive: US counterterrorism operations touched 85 countries in last 3 years alone\n\n\"I spoke against endless war with Trump, and I will speak out against it when we have a Democratic President,\" Khanna said in his comments to CNN.\n\nAdnan Tabatabai, the founder and CEO of CARPO, a German-based think tank that specializes in issues that affect the Middle East, said in a Twitter post that when \"policymakers in #Tehran (and elsewhere) argue that nothing really changes with a new (U.S. president), this is what they mean.\" Tabatabai was referring to the airstrikes by successive U.S. administrations that have targeted Iranian interests in Iraq.\n\nHowever, the action also received some bipartisan support.\n\n“Today’s airstrike demonstrates President Biden’s resolve to prevent Iran from targeting America’s personnel and allies with impunity,\" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.\n\nSen.

A three-day pause would allow time to verify the identities of all the hostages and deliver a list of names of the people Hamas is holding. Axios cited a U.S. official it did not name.\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday the warring sides came close to an agreement about two weeks ago for the release of up to 50 hostages in exchange for a pause in Israeli airstrikes. Israel delayed its ground offensive into Gaza hoping the talks would bear fruit, the Times said, but proceeded with the attack Oct. 27 when they stalled.\n\nIsraeli officials say about 240 hostages are being held by Hamas and other militant groups. Israel has repeatedly refused requests from the U.S. and other nations for a humanitarian cease-fire until all the hostages are freed. The war has raged since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants stormed across the border and killed more than 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians. Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 10,500 Palestinians, the Gaza Health Ministry says.\n\nAbout 500-600 Americans and relatives still aim to leave Gaza\n\nMore than 80 trucks carrying humanitarian aid went into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing in the last 24 hours, but there was a halt in the ability of U.S. citizens to leave Gaza, White House spokesman for national security John Kirby said Wednesday\n\n“There will be some days when we’re more successful than others,” Kirby said of the administration’s efforts in helping U.S. citizens get out of the war zone. He estimated 500 to 600 Americans and their family members who want to leave still remain.\n\nKirby said there are various obstacles to departures that have to be worked every day, “almost all over again.”\n\n− Maureen Groppe\n\nInternational organizations call for immediate ceasefire\n\nInternational organizations have called for an immediate ceasefire by Israeli forces in Gaza as the conflict passes the one-month mark.\n\nAmnesty International urged heads of state planning to attend an international humanitarian conference in France on Thursday to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a letter posted Wednesday, the agency’s secretary general Agnès Callamard said the situation will become “unimaginably worse” if action is not taken.\n\n“More than two million people in the Gaza Strip are struggling to survive amidst Israel’s relentless attacks that have caused an unprecedented number of civilian casualties and destruction and exacerbated this humanitarian crisis to catastrophic levels. Right now, people’s most basic needs are not being met,” Callamard said.\n\nFor the ceasefire to be successful, she said, it should extend across the entire Gaza Strip and last long enough to allow “substantive alleviation of suffering.” Hospitals need repairing, relief needs to be distributed, wounded need to be properly taken care of, and those who died must be recovered and buried, she added.\n\nIn an open letter, hundreds of US Agency for International Development staffers urged the Biden administration on Wednesday to call for a ceasefire, according to CNN. USAID oversees US foreign development and humanitarian aid.\n\n\"For USAID efforts to be effective and for lives to be saved, we need an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities,\" the letter states. \"We believe that further catastrophic loss of human life can only be avoided if the United States Government calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of Israeli hostages, and the restoration of water, food, fuel, and electricity to the people of Gaza by the State of Israel.\"\n\nIsrael says it has destroyed 130 Hamas tunnels\n\nThe Israeli military says it is “thwarting Hamas’ terrorist infrastructure” by expanding its ground war in Gaza and destroying tunnel shafts, command centers and weapons warehouses. Since the beginning of the fighting, 130 tunnel shafts have been destroyed, the military says. The battle to control and destroy the underground maze, estimated at more than 300 miles, will be a key strategy for the Israeli military, military analysts and experts say.\n\nHamas leaders say Israel has exaggerated the scope of its infiltration. But Israel says specialized units are searching the tunnels for rocket assembly lines, stores of small arms and mortars and even Hamas leaders and the 240 hostages held by Hamas and other militant groups. Israeli troops claim to have cornered Yahya Sinwar, the most senior Hamas leader in Gaza, in his bunker.\n\n“Combat engineers fighting in Gaza are destroying the enemy’s weapons and are locating, exposing and detonating tunnel shafts,” the military said in a statement. “This is how the IDF is destroying Hamas terrorist infrastructure.”\n\nThe Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza said at least 19 people were killed Wednesday in an airstrike on the Jabaliya refugee camp, Reuters reported. If confirmed, it would be third such attack in eight days on the camp just outside Gaza City, which Israel considers a Hamas stronghold.\n\nUS, G7 reject Israeli plan for post-war Gaza\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday rejected Israel's plan to maintain \"overall security responsibility\" for the Gaza Strip after the war, saying the Palestinian Authority must ultimately take charge of the battered Palestinian enclave. Blinken, speaking after a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Japan, said neither Israel nor Hamas can lead post-war Gaza. The \"voices and aspirations\" of Palestinian people must be at the center of governance, unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated Israel plans to maintain a tight grip and have “overall security responsibility” in Gaza when the war winds down.\n\nBlinken made the U.S. opposition to that notion clear: \"No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends,\" Blinken said. \"No attempt to blockade or besiege Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza.\"\n\nHouse censures Palestinian American congresswoman\n\nThe House voted Tuesday night to censure the only Palestinian American in Congress, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., over her remarks on the Israel-Hamas war. The move to censure Tlaib was approved by a vote of 234-188. All but four House Republicans voted in favor of the measure, which drew the support of almost two dozen House Democrats.\n\nAmong Tlaib’s comments that have caused the most controversy in Congress is her use of the phrase “from the river to the sea,” a slogan that implies creation of a Palestinian state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in much of what's currently Israeli land. Israel’s supporters say the phrase is antisemitic and a call to destroy the state of Israel. Tlaib defended the phrase as “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate.” Read more here.\n\nThe White House opposes the use of the controversial phrase, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. “It is divisive. It is hurtful. Many find it hurtful. Many find it antisemitic,” she said.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nDoctors Without Borders lab tech among dozens killed in bombing\n\nA lab technician working for Doctors Without Borders was killed in Gaza along with several family members, the agency announced Wednesday.

His building collapsed, reportedly killing dozens of people, the agency said.\n\n\"We reiterate our call for an immediate cease-fire to prevent more deaths and allow the entry of desperately needed humanitarian supplies,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The international community must take stronger action to stop the bloodshed in Gaza.\"\n\nContributing: Rick Jervis, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/15/israel-iran-allies-gaza/73326560007/", "title": "Israel's critics became allies over Iran attack. But they're still pushing ...", "text": "As the dust settled across the Middle East after a fraught weekend that saw Iran launch a swarm of more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, Jordan’s foreign minister hit the Arabic and English-language news shows to hammer home what he sees as the root cause of the dangerous violence roiling the region.\n\n“The issue here is the aggression in Gaza,” Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s top diplomat, told CNN. “The first step” to avoiding a wider war, he said, “is ending the aggression.”\n\nLike much of the world, Jordan has been fiercely critical of the war in Gaza, where more than 30,000 people have died in Israeli military action since Hamas rampaged across southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200.\n\nBut when Tehran launched its explosive swarm on Saturday, Jordan’s air force took to the sky, shooting down dozens of Iranian drones, joining the U.S., Israel, the United Kingdom and France in a defensive operation that knocked out nearly all the weaponry Tehran aimed at Israeli targets.\n\n\"This was the first time that such a coalition worked together against the threat of Iran and its proxies in the Middle East,\" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for Israel's military.\n\nIsrael remains deeply isolated over its war in Gaza, where even President Joe Biden has now demanded a cease-fire. But when faced with attack by Iran, America’s top Middle East ally gained a lot of friends.\n\nWho are Israel's allies against Iran?\n\nOnly a few countries remain that are willing to defend the six-month-old Gaza war, or to at least refrain from publicly criticizing it. On April 4, amid a backlash over the deaths of seven aid workers from chef Jose Andres’ World Central Kitchen, Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau that future U.S. aid would depend on strong steps to protect civilians and humanitarian staff in Gaza.\n\nAsked by USA TODAY why it had taken Biden so long to break with Netanyahu in Gaza, former U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk replied, “It goes against his beliefs and is risky when Israel is facing a manifest threat from Iran.”\n\nIn the face of that threat, regional strains over Gaza were briefly set aside.\n\nMore:Death of José Andrés' World Central Kitchen crew marks a new low in Gaza war, aid workers say\n\n“We know that the Jordanian air force shot down dozens of Iranian drones that violated its airspace and were headed to Israel,” Michael Wahid Hanna, an analyst at the International Crisis Group said Monday.\n\nStill, Jordan − where one in five residents is Palestinian − was quick to say it wasn't defending Israel. \"There was an assessment that there was a real danger of Iranian barrages and missiles falling on Jordan, and the armed forces dealt with this danger,\" Foreign Minister Safadi told Jordanian state TV. \"And if this danger came from Israel, Jordan would take the same action.\"\n\nSome threats are just bigger than others. \"The Arab states make a big show of being publicly furious about Israel’s war on Gaza, but many of these states still perceive Iran as a bigger threat than Israel,\" Mohamad Bazzi, director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at New York University, told USA TODAY.\n\nWill it spark a wider war?Israel's long-simmering conflict with Iran moves out of the shadows\n\nSaudi Arabia, a strong critic of the Gaza war, provided intelligence to Israel about the timing of the coming Iranian attack, Reuters reported, while France, which has called for an immediate Gaza cease-fire, also took part in the massive air defense operation on Saturday.\n\nNone have signed on to help Israel in a possible armed response to Saturday's attack.\n\n\"No regional state is likely to join Israel in attacking Iran,\" Mohammad Ali Shabani, the editor of London-based Amwaj Media, told USA TODAY. \"On the other hand, Iran can be expected to be joined in offensive military operations by its allies in places like Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.\"\n\nWho are Iran's allies against Israel?\n\nIran has carefully seeded the Middle East with proxy militias over that last 20 yearss, and gained the full support of one regional government, allowing it to project power through a so-called “Axis of Resistance.”\n\nThe axis includes Iran's longtime partner Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, which has turned Israel’s northern border into a potential second front amid exchanges of rocket fire that have led to the evacuation of Israeli border communities.\n\nSyria is a member of the axis as well. Iranian and Hezbollah fighters – joined by Russia – helped save the government after Islamist forces including al Qaeda threatened to topple the state amid a general uprising against of President Bashar al Assad's brutal rule.\n\nIn Iraq, Iran supports and directs a number of militias that have in the past attacked American bases in that country. One of them, Kataib Hezbollah, congratulated Iran for its failed attack in a statement on Sunday. “The Zionist-American enemy and his followers only understand the language of weapons to curb their tyranny,” the group said. \"We point out that shame will continue to haunt the rulers of Jordan throughout history.\"\n\nAnd in Yemen, the Iran-supported Houthi movement has fired rockets at Israel and paralyzed global shipping through its attacks on cargo vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nUS, Russia, Europe warn of a wider war\n\nIran launched its broad attack on Israel – its first-ever direct assault on the Islamic Republic's arch-enemy – after a suspected Israeli airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus, Syria, killed several people including a top official of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameni promised revenge.\n\nMore:Senior Iranian commander killed in Syria by apparent Israeli airstrike\n\nNow, with Iran’s 300-projectile gambit having caused only minor damage to an Israeli air base, world leaders are calling for calm. Biden has told Netanyahu the U.S. will not join any Israeli response to Saturday’s attack. And on Monday the European Union and Russia also urged restraint.\n\nSafadi, the Jordanian foreign minister, said that extending the conflict with Iran would help Netanyahu by drawing attention away from a war that has alienated Israel from much of the international community.\n\nProvoking Tehran will “dilute that pressure and take the focus away from Gaza,” Safadi told CNN. “Iran retaliated. It said it would do no more.”\n\n“The regional states remain quite concerned that the longer the open-ended conflict in Gaza goes on, the greater the possibility – through a direct decision or miscalculation – of a regional war,” Hanna said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}]}

Arizona's is also broad, in that it brings allegations against key Trump allies who orchestrated the plot. But unlike Georgia's case, Trump himself is not facing charges.\n\nHere’s what to know about those cases and when they began.\n\nMichigan\n\nCharging date: July 18, 2023\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, announced her office had charged 16 people with eight crimes each. The charges include conspiracy to commit forgery, publishing a false record “with intent to injure or defraud,” and other counts.\n\nNessel at first referred the investigation to prosecutors in Washington, D.C., but reopened her case in January 2023 after inaction from the federal government, according to The Detroit Free Press.\n\nIf convicted, penalties range from five to 14 years, according to Nessel’s office. Unlike in other states, the charges were brought by Nessel’s office and not a grand jury.\n\nThe individuals charged include a co-chair of the state’s Republican party, a GOP national committeewoman, a former elector and others active in local government and political leadership. They are Kathy Berden; William (Hank) Choate; Amy Facchinello; Clifford Frost; Stanley Grot; John Haggard; Mari-Ann Henry; Timothy King; Michele Lundgren; Meshawn Maddock; James Renner; Mayra Rodriguez; Rose Rook; Marian Sheridan; Ken Thompson; Kent Vanderwood.\n\nCase status: One defendant — Renner — reached a cooperation agreement to help prosecutors in exchange for his charges being dropped. A Michigan judge is considering preliminary testimony to decide whether there is enough evidence to continue the prosecution, a routine stage of a case required by state law there.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCharging date: Aug. 14, 2023\n\nA Georgia grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others in a sweeping case targeting election interference. Among the three states that had brought charges before Arizona, this has the broadest scope and alleges a coordinated criminal enterprise.\n\nThe 98-page indictment lays out 40 charges, though each defendant is not facing every charge. The charges include violating Georgia’s racketeering law, impersonating a public officer, making false statements and writings, and others.\n\nThree electors who claimed Trump won are named in the indictment. Other people charged include Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former lawyer and a former mayor of New York City, Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and other close aides to the former president.\n\nEight Trump electors agreed to help prosecutors with their case before the grand jury indictment, and multiple former Trump aides have accepted plea deals since being charged, according to reporting by USA TODAY.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat elected in 2020, launched the investigation in February 2021. Willis’ affair with a special prosecutor working the case drew controversy and a fresh legal battle, giving Trump and others ammunition to amplify claims the prosecution was corrupt. A judge in March allowed Willis to stay on the case if the special prosecutor resigned, which he did, USA TODAY reported.\n\nOthers charged include former Department of Justice lawyer Jeffrey Clark; Trump 2020 campaign official Mike Roman; Trump campaign attorney Ray Smith; Trump lawyers Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell; Georgia Republican Party chairman and elector David Shafer; and false electors Shawn Still and Cathy Latham.\n\nOthers were charged after they promoted false claims of election fraud or intimidated election workers: attorney Robert Cheeley; pastor Stephen Lee; Trevian Kutti, a publicist; bail bondsman Scott Hall; Coffee County elections supervisor Misty Hampton; and Black Voices for Trump leader Harrison Floyd.\n\nCase status: Trump has pleaded not guilty and recently lost a court argument that his claims about the 2020 election were protected political speech.

The distinct possibility that some of these secretaries will be people with a history of election denial is a major challenge for American democracy – especially because former President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to run again in 2024, continues to pressure state officials to discard the will of voters.\n\nThe Republican nominees for secretary of state in the November 2022 midterm elections include three swing-state candidates who have made efforts to overturn 2020 results in their states: Mark Finchem of Arizona, Kristina Karamo of Michigan and Jim Marchant of Nevada.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Alabama, Wes Allen, expressed support for a 2020 lawsuit that sought to get the Supreme Court to toss out Joe Biden’s victory. The Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Indiana, Diego Morales, has called the 2020 election a “scam,” the vote “tainted” and the outcome “questionable.” The Republican nominee in GOP-dominated South Dakota, Monae Johnson, has refused to acknowledge that Biden won legitimately. The Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Wyoming, Chuck Gray, has said that Biden’s victory was “illegitimate” and that he “absolutely” thinks Trump was the real winner.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Democratic-leaning but regularly competitive Minnesota, Kim Crockett, has described the 2020 election in her state as “lawless.” The Republican nominee in the Democratic-dominated Connecticut, Dominic Rapini, is the former chair of a group that has made baseless complaints of 2020 fraud.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Democratic-leaning but sometimes competitive New Mexico, Audrey Trujillo, has called the 2020 election stolen. So have the Republican candidates in Massachusetts and Vermont, both obscure figures who face long odds of winning their liberal states in November.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the intensity with which these 12 nominees have committed to election rejection. For example, Morales acknowledged in June that Biden “legitimately occupies” the presidency, while Finchem, a serial promoter of wild conspiracy theories about the election, has persisted this year in his impossible quest to reverse Biden’s victory in Arizona.\n\nTwenty-seven states are holding secretary of state elections in 2022. CNN will update this list if we find information showing that the 2020 results have been disputed by additional Republican nominees.\n\nAlabama: Wes Allen\n\nRep. Wes Allen speaks during debate on transgender bills during the legislative session in the house chamber at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Ala., on Thursday April 7, 2022. Mickey Welsh/AP\n\nState representative Wes Allen, who won Alabama’s Republican nomination in a June runoff election, endorsed the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s victories in four states – tweeting in December 2020 that Alabama’s attorney general should “stand firm” in support.\n\nAllen has vowed to withdraw Alabama from a 31-state consortium that helps member states keep their voter rolls up to date, baselessly alleging that the consortium, which is funded and run by member states, is a “leftist” entity. Alabama’s departing Republican incumbent secretary of state, John Merrill, has called Allen’s claims “patently false” and defended the consortium as an important election security tool.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Pamela Laffitte, a corrections sergeant for a county sheriff’s office.\n\nAllen’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nArizona: Mark Finchem\n\nArizona state representative Mark Finchem (R-AZ) speaks at a rally in Iowa State Fairgrounds, in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., October 9, 2021. Rachel Mummey/Reuters\n\nMark Finchem is a far-right Arizona state representative who has for years promoted absurd conspiracy theories and other misinformation. Finchem has been aggressively dishonest about the 2020 election – and he continues to push to “decertify” Biden’s 2020 win in Arizona, though this cannot be done.\n\nFinchem has repeatedly and falsely claimed that “Trump won” the election. He has falsely proclaimed that “the election was a fraud” and that it was “rigged.” He demanded in mid-2021 that liberal officials and the media prove the falsity of election conspiracy theories that had already been proven false, even selling shirts reading “#ProveIt.”\n\nFinchem, who was endorsed by Trump last year and won the Republican primary earlier this month, played a key early role in the election-denying “Stop the Steal” movement in Arizona. After he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, he was photographed outside the US Capitol during the insurrection that day. He also tweeted a sympathetic message about the rioters, blaming Congress for refusing to acknowledge the “rampant fraud” that, again, didn’t exist. (Finchem denies any involvement in the riot and has not been charged with anything.)\n\nOn the first anniversary of the insurrection, Finchem tweeted a false claim that “the real insurrection” was how Democratic officials in Arizona had rigged the election with “tens of thousands of fraudulent votes” in two big counties won by Biden. This is just fiction.\n\nIn July, Finchem baselessly called for the arrest of incumbent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now the Democratic nominee for governor, and Adrian Fontes, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state who oversaw the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where many Republicans have baselessly alleged mass fraud.\n\nFinchem’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nConnecticut: Dominic Rapini\n\nDominic Rapini is a candidate for secretary of state for Connecticut. From Dominic Rapini/Facebook\n\nDominic Rapini, who won Connecticut’s Republican primary on Tuesday, formerly served as board chair for a group called Fight Voter Fraud, Inc., which has had its baseless allegations about the 2020 election proven inaccurate by Connecticut’s elections enforcement commission. The Connecticut Post reported that the commission admonished Fight Voter Fraud in 2021; the commission said the group had wasted the commission’s limited resources and should “educate themselves” on the facts and the law before filing complaints.\n\nWhile chairing Fight Voter Fraud, Rapini at least indirectly promoted false claims that there was massive fraud in the 2020 election. He was listed as the author of a web post linking to a document that recommended various reports that falsely alleged the election had been stolen, falsely claimed that statistics cast doubt on Biden’s win, or falsely suggested something was amiss in 2020 with voting machines. (Rapini has said he left his role at Fight Voter Fraud, Inc. in August 2021.)\n\nRapini, who says he has spent more than two decades in sales at Apple, said in an appearance on Hartford station FOX61 in July that “Joe Biden is the duly elected president of the United States.” But in various other interviews over the past year, he refused to offer a direct answer when asked if he believed Biden’s victory was legitimate or whether Trump was the real winner. Dodging the question, he told The Connecticut Examiner in 2021: “I haven’t been researching what’s happened in Arizona and Wisconsin, I haven’t studied it. I will say that Joe Biden was certified in January and we have to move on.”\n\nHe told CT Insider this May: “Listen, Joe Biden, God bless him, was the duly elected president of the United States and beyond that, there’s so many details there I can’t really dive into them, I don’t know the particulars … I think there was definitely anomalies, and there’s things we need to understand, but I have no reason to believe there was widescale fraud in Connecticut, there’s nothing there that I can prove.”\n\nAsked for comment, Rapini said in an email: “I have stated on many occasions during my campaign that Joe Biden is the duly elected President of the United States.” CNN then sent him three examples of how he had sometimes avoided questions about the legitimacy of Biden’s victory and asked him to directly answer that question; we explained we were unclear if he was making some distinction between “duly” and “legitimately” elected. Rapini responded indirectly once more – saying he has been “very clear” in TV interviews that “Joe Biden is the duly elected president” and that reporters with “predisposed assumptions” sometimes leave out parts of his comments.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is state Rep. Stephanie Thomas.\n\nIndiana: Diego Morales\n\nDiego Morales, the GOP pick for Indiana's Secretary of State, does a press conference at the state GOP Convention, Indiana Farmer's Coliseum, Indianapolis, Saturday, June 18, 2022. Robert Scheer/IndyStar/USA Today Network\n\nIn March, when Diego Morales was running for the Republican nomination in Indiana, he published an article on the website Hoosier State Today in which he sharply disputed the legitimacy of the 2020 election – proclaiming that “we have valid reasons to doubt the official vote tallies in key states,” that the vote was “tainted,” that “the outcome is questionable,” and that the election was a “scam.”\n\nMorales, who served as an aide to Mike Pence when Pence was governor of Indiana, went on to argue that late changes to states’ election policies were illegitimate and – vaguely – that it was unconstitutional to subject mail-in voters and the Election Day voters to different levels of “scrutiny.”\n\nSome of Morales’ specific claims are subjective. Nonetheless, his broad initial claim that there are valid reasons to doubt key states’ vote totals is plain false.\n\nMorales has sometimes taken a softer line. After beating Republican incumbent Secretary of State Holli Sullivan for the party nomination at a party convention in June, he told Fox59 of Indianapolis that he had “already moved on” from 2020 to focus on future elections. Morales told journalist Brian Howey in June that Biden was elected in 2020 and “legitimately occupies that office today,” though he also maintained that “there were a number of irregularities in that election.”\n\nMorales campaign manager Kegan Prentice touted Morales’ biography in a statement to CNN and said, “His sole focus now is on visiting all 92 counties in Indiana to listen to and learn from voters so he can best serve them.”\n\nMorales was terminated from a job in the Indiana secretary of state’s office in 2009 for allegedly poor work performance, the Indianapolis Star reported in June. Morales faced more criticism of his work performance after returning to the office under a different secretary of state, the Star reported, and resigned in 2011 after refusing to sign on to an improvement plan.\n\nThe Star reported that Morales said: “Anybody can you write you up at any time, because their envy, selfish office rivalry, whatever you may want to call it. That’s exactly what happened.” Morales’ campaign manager also provided CNN with positive comments about him from Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who was secretary of state in 2009. Rokita wrote, “As far as I’m concerned, Diego left my office on good terms, and I consider him a long time friend.”\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Destiny Wells, an officer in the Army Reserve and a lawyer who was formerly a deputy state attorney general.\n\nMassachusetts: Rayla Campbell\n\nRayla Campbell, candidate for secretary of state in Massachusetts. From Rayla Campbell for Massachusetts/Facebook\n\nRayla Campbell, a radio host who is running unopposed in the Republican primary in Massachusetts, falsely declared in November 2020 – after media outlets had called the election for Biden – that Trump was the actual winner.\n\n“Our great president is the President elected for the next four years. We know it. They’re trying to steal an election because they can’t win or do anything right,” Campbell said on a November 2020 radio show during which she also promoted so-called “stop the steal” events.\n\nOn another November 2020 radio show, Campbell endorsed false conspiracy theories about election software and wrongly declared that “there’s no way, with all of the Trump rallies and the support that we had out there, that our candidates didn’t get more votes.” She also called for Republicans to adopt “dirty” tactics to combat the cheating she inaccurately claimed Democrats had done.\n\n“They did it again with the cheating of the counting of the ballots,” she said. “And they will always do stuff like that because they can’t win legally, and that’s why we’ve got to fight a lot harder. A lot harder, and a little dirty. Because they fight extremely dirty. It’s time to beat ‘em at their own game, and we can do that.”\n\nIn December 2020, after the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s victory, Campbell continued to support Trump’s efforts to overturn the outcome. And she repeated her false claim about a “stolen” election in a combative speech at the state Republican convention in May 2022.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in late July, Campbell did not back down from any of her previous claims. She called for audits of the 2020 election in all 50 states, and she repeatedly criticized the news media for supposed bias. She added, though, that she has “moved on from 2020 elections because we’re going into 2022.”\n\nDemocratic incumbent William Galvin and Democrat Tanisha Sullivan, a lawyer who is president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, are also running.\n\nMichigan: Kristina Karamo\n\nKristina Karamo, who is running for the Michigan Republican party's nomination for secretary of state, speaks at a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump on April 02, 2022 near Washington, Michigan. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nKristina Karamo, who was endorsed by Trump last year and Michigan’s Republican Party at its convention this year, falsely claimed in a social media video in December 2020 “Donald Trump won Michigan” – where Joe Biden actually beat Trump by more than 154,000 votes.\n\nKaramo, who has taught orientation and public speaking courses at a community college, rose to prominence in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when she claimed to have witnessed fraud while working as a Republican poll challenger monitoring the processing of absentee ballots in Detroit. (The Detroit Free Press found that her claims were based on misinterpretations of standard election processes; a Republican-led state Senate investigation into Michigan’s election found “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud.”) She subsequently filed an affidavit as part of a lawsuit that attempted to get the Supreme Court to discard Biden’s victories in Michigan and three other states.\n\nKaramo also promoted false claims about Dominion elections technology even after these claims had been thoroughly debunked, baselessly declaring in December 2020 that there were “over 200,000 votes” in Michigan that were “potentially compromised” by Dominion software. After winning the backing of the state party this April, Karamo said she was not going to say “whether or not I think the election was stolen,” Sinclair Broadcast Group reported, but she went on to complain of “so many illegal things that occurred.”\n\nKaramo has to be chosen once more at a Republican convention later in August to become the official party nominee, but that is widely expected to happen after her dominant performance at the April endorsement convention. The Democratic candidate is incumbent Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\nKaramo’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinnesota: Kim Crockett\n\nKim Crockett speaks during the first day of the Minnesota State Republican Convention, May 13, 2022, at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minn. Glen Stubbe/AP\n\nKim Crockett has said of the 2020 election in Minnesota: “I don’t think the word ‘lawless’ is too strong.” When an interviewer told her that he believes Minnesota’s election was “illegitimate,” she said she agreed.\n\nCrockett, a lawyer who won Minnesota’s Republican primary on Tuesday, has been particularly focused on state Democrats’ changes to election rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. But she has also promoted a right-wing film that makes dubious claims about supposed 2020 cheating. She baselessly called absentee voting “frankly insecure.” And she questioned whether mail workers – who carry millions of ballots every federal election with very few problems – can be trusted to carry ballots given that “the postal union is a partisan player” in politics.\n\n“Makes you kind of go: ‘Huh.’ After 2020, you start looking at everything,” Crockett said in a June interview.\n\nAt a state Republican convention in May, Crockett’s campaign played a video that depicted liberal billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, as a puppetmaster pulling the strings of incumbent Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and prominent Democratic elections lawyer Marc Elias, who are also Jewish. The chairman of the state party issued an apology – but also claimed Crockett had been unaware the video included antisemitic tropes.\n\nCrockett has previously worked or volunteered for conservative organizations, including a voter organization that has described the 2020 election as “rigged” and a think tank that suspended her in 2019 for comments about Somali immigrants for which she soon apologized. (However, she said this year that she was “taken out of context” by The New York Times and “would say everything today that I said in 2019.”)\n\nIn late July, CNN sent the Crockett campaign an email offering a chance to comment for this article. The email outlined many of the facts the article planned to mention and explained that Crockett would be included on a list of nominees who had denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nIn response, Crockett called and left a message saying she found the request “less than open to actually finding out more about me or my campaign” and that we should look into “who I really am as opposed to who other people have said I am.” She also said, however, that she only had time to send along written comments she had previously provided to another journalist.\n\nIn those previous comments, Crockett outlined her criticism of Simon’s policy decisions, recommended a right-wing commentator’s book about how the 2020 election was “rigged” and wrote: “The corporate media narrative is that 2020 was the most secure election in the history of voting. This is propaganda designed to stop the conversation. And they viciously attack anyone who dares to question that conclusion, calling us names like ‘election deniers’ instead of engaging us on election policy.”\n\nNevada: Jim Marchant\n\nJim Marchant, center, the GOP nominee for secretary of state in Nevada, speaks with people at a political event July 16, 2022, in Pahrump, Nev. John Locher/AP\n\nJim Marchant, a businessman and former Nevada state assemblyman, has promoted baseless conspiracy theories about not only the 2020 election but numerous past elections. Marchant has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Nevadans haven’t actually elected “anybody” for years – either “for decades” or particularly since 2006, when Republican future senator Dean Heller was serving as secretary of state.\n\n“And in Nevada and maybe other places all over the country – we haven’t in Nevada elected anybody since 2006. They have been installed by the deep state cabal,” Marchant falsely said in podcast comments that were reported in January by liberal organization Media Matters for America.\n\nMarchant has said he would not have certified Biden’s 33,596-vote victory in Nevada if he had been secretary of state in 2020, falsely claiming to NBC News that it is “almost statistically impossible that Joe Biden won.” Marchant attended the December 2020 event where other Nevada Republicans signed on to be phony Trump electors. And Marchant told The Guardian early this year that it was “very possible” he would be prepared to submit alternate electors in 2024.\n\nMarchant unsuccessfully tried to get a court to order a re-vote of his unsuccessful 2020 congressional race, which he lost by more than 16,000 votes. He has been so consistent in questioning Nevada’s elections system, which his campaign has wrongly described as “fraudulent,” that he even raised doubts about his own victory in the Republican secretary of state primary this June – telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he was “not really confident in the result” and that there “could have been anomalies.”\n\nMarchant’s Democratic opponent is Cisco Aguilar, a lawyer who was formerly a staffer for late US Senator Harry Reid. They are vying to replace term-limited Republican incumbent Barbara Cegavske.\n\nMarchant’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Mexico: Audrey Trujillo\n\nAudrey Trujillo, candidate for secretary of state in New Mexico. From Audrey Trujillo/Facebook\n\nAudrey Trujillo, a conservative activist whose campaign biography says she has operated a daycare, falsely claimed in a Facebook interview in March that the 2020 election was “a huge, huge, I would say coup, to really unseat a president.” On her own Facebook page, she falsely wrote in June that “Trump’s election was stolen.”\n\nTrujillo, who ran unopposed in New Mexico’s Republican primary, falsely claimed in the March interview that votes were fraudulently switched from Republicans to Democrats in 2020 races at “all levels,” including a New Mexico US Senate race that was, in reality, won handily and fairly by a Democrat. She also falsely claimed in the interview that the US is “no better than any other communist country like Venezuela or any of these other states where our elections are being manipulated.”\n\nWhen CNN asked Trujillo’s campaign in late July for comment on these claims, it responded by asking where we had gotten them from. When we provided links to the claims, the campaign did not respond again.\n\nTrujillo’s Democratic opponent is incumbent Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.\n\nSouth Dakota: Monae Johnson\n\nMonae Johnson, the Republican candidate for South Dakota secretary of state. Monae Johnson for Secretary of State\n\nMonae Johnson, a former employee of the South Dakota secretary of state’s office, repeatedly refused in an October 2022 interview with KELOLAND News to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately. “I don’t want to be an election denier, but I wasn’t behind the scenes, I wasn’t in the office at the time, so,” she said. The reporter said, “Okay. I wanted to give you an opportunity to acknowledge that, if you’d like – that he did win. Do you acknowledge that?” Johnson responded, “I’m not going to acknowledge that, so, thank you.”\n\nJohnson also said “I’ve never denied any election,” and she added, “I know President Trump won South Dakota as a Republican state. Joe Biden won the swing states; he’s our current president. But I want to move on to the next elections, and I want to inspire people that their vote is going to be tabulated exactly like they vote, ‘cause that’s going to just bring the trust to the citizens of South Dakota.”\n\nRunning on an “election integrity” platform, Johnson defeated incumbent South Dakota Secretary of State Steve Barnett at a state Republican convention in June. Her Democratic opponent is Tom Cool, the former executive director of the Council on College Admission in South Dakota.\n\nJohnson’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVermont: H. Brooke Paige\n\nH. Brooke Paige stands in front of the Vermont Statehouse on Thursday, Aug. 16, 2018, in Montpelier, Vt. Lisa Rathke/AP\n\nH. Brooke Paige, a conservative activist in Vermont, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination for secretary of state while also running unopposed for the party nominations for state attorney general, auditor and treasurer. He plans to turn down the latter three nominations and focus on his secretary of state campaign, the Vermont website VTDigger reported.\n\nThe day after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in 2021, Paige falsely claimed on his Facebook page that the left “stole” the election through a “subversive plan” involving “stuffing the ballot box and corrupting the tabulation of the election results.” He made other false election claims in subsequent posts.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in August, Paige acknowledged that Biden was the real winner in Vermont in 2020, but said the question of whether Biden legitimately won the presidency is “such a complex question,” hinging on how someone defines “legitimately,” that he could not offer a direct answer.\n\nPaige criticized state-level changes to voting rules in 2020, said he was disheartened by “anecdotal evidence” of suspicious behavior during the vote count – there is no indication of wrongdoing by any state’s vote-counters – and said his “biggest concern” was pro-Democratic media bias, which he argued had been a major contributor to Biden’s victory.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Jim Condos is retiring. The Democratic nominee is state Rep. Sarah Copeland Hanzas.\n\nWyoming: Chuck Gray\n\nWyoming state representative Chuck Gray in Augugust 2021. (Hannah Gaber-USA TODAY) Hannah Gaber/USA Today\n\nIn 2021, Wyoming state Rep. Chuck Gray falsely called Biden’s election “illegitimate,” falsely described the 2020 election as “the fraudulent election,” and told CNN that he “absolutely” believed that Trump won.\n\nIn December 2020, Gray urged Wyoming leaders to join the Texas-led lawsuit seeking to overturn Biden’s victories in four states. When Republican Gov. Mark Gordon decided against doing so, Gray wrote on Facebook that Gordon was “totally wrong.”\n\nGray won the Republican nomination for secretary of state in August 2022. In June and July, he wrote on Facebook that he had sponsored screenings of the right-wing film, also promoted by Crockett, that makes dubious claims about cheating in the 2020 election; Gray told Wyoming website Cowboy State Daily in June, baselessly, that the film demonstrates how the left “has stolen elections with ballot drop boxes.”\n\nGray did not respond to a request for comment in August.\n\nThis story has been updated to add Wyoming nominee Chuck Gray and South Dakota nominee Monae Johnson to the list and to include comment from Vermont nominee H.

One text message, according to the court document, shows Latham coordinating the arrival and whereabouts of a team “led by Paul Maggio” that traveled to Coffee County at the direction of Powell.\n\nThree days after the breach, Latham texted the Coffee County elections supervisor, “Did you all finish with the scanner?” According to court documents, Latham testified she did not know what Hall was doing in Coffee County. But when confronted with her texts about the scanner, she asserted her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nMaggio did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Instead, the data firm he works for, SullivanStrickler, which court documents show was hired by Powell, said in a statement to CNN that it was “directed by attorneys to contact county election officials to obtain access to certain data” in Georgia and also “directed by attorneys to distribute that data to certain individuals.”\n\nIn an August 29, 2022, email, an attorney for SullivanStrickler acknowledges that Latham was the “primary point of contact” in coordinating the team’s visit to Coffee County.\n\nThe firm said it had no reason to believe these attorneys would ask or direct it to “do anything either improper or illegal.”\n\nHall, an Atlanta bail bondsman and Fulton County Republican poll watcher, did not reply to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nConflicting answers\n\nThe newly obtained surveillance video and text messages in the civil lawsuit suggest the fake elector plot and the effort to breach voting machines in Georgia were part of a larger, coordinated plan to subvert the 2020 election. Some of the same Trump lawyers and allies who helped orchestrate the effort to seat fake electors in states Trump lost in 2020 were also involved in attempts to gain unauthorized access to voting machines in numerous counties in states around the country seen as friendly toward the former president.\n\n“The video reveals that Cathy Latham had a more significant role with the SullivanStrickler team’s work in Coffee County than she claimed,” said David Cross, an attorney representing election integrity groups suing Georgia over its voting systems and who has reviewed the video. “We can see her escort the team into the office that morning, for example. And she’s an important connection to the effort to create a slate of Georgia electors who would have wrongly voted for Trump for the 2020 election, which now looks to be the subject of a grand jury investigation in Fulton County.”\n\nAccording to court documents, Latham has provided conflicting answers during depositions when asked about her involvement in the breach and whether she was at the Coffee County elections office on the day it occurred. The video confirms she was there when it took place and literally held the door open for those who breached the voting systems. Previously, the Justice Department had warned elections officials not to allow outside access of this kind.\n\nLatham did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. A lawyer representing Latham did not dispute the facts of the story and said that Latham did not have the authority to “authorize anyone to do anything with the ballots.”\n\nThe lawyer said Latham did not “participate personally in anything that the elections board and/or its employee … may have decided to do under their own authority (or at least their perceived authority) with the ballots.”\n\n“So, regardless of whether she correctly remembers the details of what time she spent there on January 7, it doesn’t change the fact that she had no authority to do any of this and was not personally involved in whatever was done,” the lawyer added.\n\nA second lawyer representing Latham, Bob Cheeley, told CNN, “Cathy Latham has dedicated significant time and effort over many years protecting the integrity of elections in Coffee County, Georgia. She would not and has not knowingly been involved in any impropriety in any election.”\n\n“Latham did not authorize or participate in any ballot scanning efforts, computer imaging, or any similar activity in Coffee County in January 2021.”\n\nOperatives connected to Trump’s campaign and legal team worked with local GOP officials to gain access to voting systems in counties across several states following the 2020 election, including Coffee County. The goal was to produce evidence to back up Trump’s baseless claims and ultimately upend Joe Biden’s victory – even after it was certified on January 6.\n\nAmong them was Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan, who oversaw the partisan election audit in Maricopa County, Arizona, and was recently named by the Michigan attorney general as a target in the state-level criminal investigation into unauthorized voting machine breaches in that state.\n\nThe newly obtained surveillance video shows Logan also visited the Coffee County elections office more than once in January 2021, roughly two weeks after the breach took place. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Logan.\n\nSeparately, federal investigators have issued subpoenas seeking information about Latham’s communication with Rudy Giuliani and other members of Trump’s legal team as part of a DOJ probe, sources said.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, eight days before the January 7 voting machine breach, Latham testified along with Giuliani before Georgia state lawmakers about supposed voter machine irregularities in Coffee County.\n\nAt the time, Latham and the Giuliani legal team were represented by the same attorney, according to the minutes from that hearing. When asked during a recent deposition in the Georgia civil case whether she knew or ever had any communication with Giuliani, Latham asserted her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nLatham is a target of two criminal investigations into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, one by the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, and a parallel probe by the Justice Department, according to multiple sources and documents obtained by CNN. Both of those investigations are looking specifically at the fake electors plot. State investigators in Georgia are also examining the Coffee County voting machine breach.\n\nTrump allies target rural GOP stronghold in Georgia\n\nIn the weeks after the election, Coffee County quickly emerged as a central part of the Trump team’s push to overturn the election. The reliably Republican stronghold of about 43,000 residents was the only county in Georgia that refused to certify its results after the election, even though Trump won nearly 70% of the vote.\n\nTrump and his lawyers had an ally in Latham, who was open to helping push their claims of fraud and was a leading voice among those raising concerns about the Dominion voting systems used in Coffee County.\n\nIt was one of two counties referenced in draft executive orders that, if signed by Trump, would have ordered the military or Department of Homeland Security to seize voting machines across the country. They would have also installed a special counsel with the power to investigate voter fraud.\n\nWhile those documents were never signed, the draft orders were presented to Trump during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting on December 18, 2020, which was attended by election deniers, including Powell and Michael Flynn, according to previous CNN reporting and testimony before the House Select Committee investigating January 6.\n\nIn the weeks after that meeting, gaining access to voting machines became a top priority for Trump allies seeking to overturn the election, as those closest to the former President thought it was the only way to actually prove there was widespread fraud, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nTrump’s inner circle was warned by several Republican lawmakers that without evidence of fraud, their plan to subvert the Electoral College would almost certainly fail, text messages obtained by the House Select Committee investigating the US Capitol attack show.\n\nPowell was among those who took the lead in the hunt for evidence of voter fraud, turning her attention to Coffee County in the days before January 6, emails produced as part of the civil suit and obtained by CNN show. Like Latham, Powell was in direct contact with members of the team that travelled to Coffee County and Powell appears to have hired them for the task, the emails show.\n\nAccording to the civil lawsuit, members of the team included Hall, the Atlanta bail bondsman who is seen on the surveillance footage being escorted into the Coffee County elections office by Latham.\n\nIn an audio recording obtained by CNN, Hall claims that he “chartered the jet to go down to Coffee County to have them inspect all of those computers.”\n\n“I went down there, we scanned every freaking ballot,” Hall says in the recording. Hall also suggests that the same group of people who orchestrated the breach in Coffee County also gained access to voting machines in Antrim County, Michigan weeks before.\n\n“The same people that went up to Michigan, OK, and did all that forensic stuff on the computers. And they sent their team down to Coffee County, Georgia, and they scanned all the equipment, imaged all the hard drives, and scanned every single ballot,” Hall says in the recording.\n\nMaggio was among those who was involved in both efforts, according to previously reported documents related to the inspection of voting systems in Antrim County and his own testimony in a civil court case related to the Coffee County breach.\n\nHall also claims that he and the team of individuals who traveled to Coffee County had permission from local elections officials to access the voting systems.\n\nEvidence of a coordinated plot\n\nIt’s unclear if federal authorities are investigating whether attempts to gain access to voting machines after the 2020 election were part of a coordinated, multi-state effort carried out by Trump allies. But state investigators in Georgia are examining the possibility of a broader plot.\n\nAnd investigators in Colorado and Michigan are sharing evidence they have collected about unauthorized breaches in those states with the FBI, according to multiple sources familiar with those investigations.\n\nEarlier this year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson shared information with members of the House Select Committee, as well as Attorney General Merrick Garland, to assist in the investigation of whether pro-Trump operatives gained access to voting machines in Antrim County as part of a coordinated plot overseen by the former President’s legal team.\n\nSince then, evidence has emerged linking several people who gained access to voting systems in Antrim County to the breach in Coffee County – including Powell and Maggio.\n\nIn a recent court filing, Phil Waldron, a retired Army colonel who was deeply involved in efforts to overturn the election, claimed that a federal grand jury has been empaneled and that a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents are “conducting a sweeping criminal investigation into those, among others, who have ‘worked in the cybersecurity space on election- and voting-related issues.”’\n\nThe filing came as part of Waldron’s months-long court fight with the House Select Committee investigating January 6, which has subpoenaed Waldron’s phone records. Waldron has argued that if the House Committee gets his phone records, they could end up in the hands of federal prosecutors that he says are also investigating efforts to obtain election data by seizing and tampering with voting machines.\n\nCNN previously reported that Waldron was part of the team that reviewed election data obtained from Antrim County, helped craft the draft executive orders for seizing voting machines and coordinated efforts to access voting systems in several states to bolster Trump’s claims about widespread election fraud.\n\nHe also testified during a December 2020 hearing on election fraud held by state lawmakers in Georgia and was introduced by Giuliani.\n\nA source familiar with Trump’s legal defense strategy expressed concern about the prospect of federal prosecutors targeting cyber investigators like Waldron, because they may attempt to flip them in order to bolster their potential case against the former President.\n\nOn August 25, Waldron and Powell were ordered to testify as part of the Fulton County District Attorney’s probe.\n\nIn a court filling, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis specifically notes that Powell can likely provide information about the breach in Coffee County as well as similar efforts in Michigan and Nevada related to voting machines.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Jason Morris", "Zachary Cohen", "Jason Morris"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/06/politics/january-6-insurrection-legacy/index.html", "title": "Analysis: January 6, 2021, may be only a preview of a deeper ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf January 6, 2021, was just one infamous day in history, its stain on the American story would still reverberate through generations.\n\nBut the US Capitol insurrection was far from a self-contained day of rage. It was both the culmination of the rule of an aberrant, demagogic President and a catalyst for the most enduring onslaught on America’s system of elective governance in decades. It legitimized violence as a tool of political expression among millions of citizens and cast the haunting possibility that as horrific as that day was, it may be only a preview of a deeper democratic rupture to come.\n\nThe aftermath of hours of terror ignited by Donald Trump inciting a mob to “fight like hell” to deny the will of voters revealed that large chunks of the Republican Party had rejected the principle of an expansive, unified democracy for which its first President, Abraham Lincoln, had died. Far from destroying the mythology of Trumpism, Republicans clambered onto the metaphorical wreckage in the Capitol to launch a nationwide voter-suppression scheme that could make it easier to steal future elections without the need for a baying mob to storm the Capitol.\n\nA year on, the assault on Congress that interrupted nearly two-and-a-half centuries of peaceful transfers of power is one of those dates whose notoriety allows it to stand alone. If September 11, 2001, was the day that destroyed an age-old illusion underpinning US power – that the mainland was immune to outside attack – January 6 brought an epiphany that democracy may not actually be forever. It revealed that the authoritarian forces that preoccupied the founders, and that have simmered below American civil society ever since, are unleashed.\n\n“We came perilously close to losing our democracy,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat heading the House committee probing the insurrection, told CNN.\n\nA still-shocking turn of events\n\nSo much misinformation and propaganda have been spewed by Trump, his Republican henchmen and conservative media that it’s worth dwelling on what actually unfolded before the eyes of the world. The House panel, which offers the best chance of a historic record of that day, seems to be getting ever closer to uncovering what happened behind the scenes in the White House. But it began with a President whose explosive ego and scorn for constitutional guarantees made it impossible for him to admit defeat and who falsely claimed victory in the 2020 election.\n\nBut weeks of lies, evidence-free cases laughed out of court and attempts to coerce local leaders to cheat him to a second term failed. At the time, most people didn’t know about a crazed ploy to subvert the Electoral College that Trump hoped to use to convince then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw him the election in Congress.\n\nWhen all else had failed, Trump summoned supporters to a Washington rally he primed with extremist voter fraud fantasies, on the very day that Congress, under Pence’s jurisdiction, was due to certify Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory.\n\n“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he told a crowd whipped into a frenzy by his venom. “We’re going to try and give our Republicans … the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.”\n\nOf course, Trump did not put himself in harm’s way. He retreated to the safety of the White House to watch the mayhem unfold on television as his invaders swarmed the platform awaiting Biden’s inauguration later that month and smashed down doors and windows in one of the vilest scenes ever witnessed beneath the Capitol dome.\n\nFor three hours, according to new evidence from the January 6 committee, Trump refused to call off a violent crowd that beat police officers, demanded the hanging of Pence, sent lawmakers running for their lives and defiled the symbols of democratic government in the House and the Senate. If not for heroes of law enforcement, some of the country’s most senior elected leaders might have perished. As it was, the violence led to four deaths, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to invade the Speaker’s Lobby, after she had been drawn to Washington by her leader’s lies.\n\nEven a year on, it’s hard to believe that this all happened in the United States, for so long a democratic beacon for the world.\n\nFor any other American president, in any other time, such a dereliction of duty in failing to defend the US government from attack would have meant immediate political oblivion. The reality that Trump may be an even more powerful figure in the GOP now is the story of the year since January 6.\n\nThe GOP’s ambition and self-preservation\n\nWhen Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy rose in the House a few days later to say the then-President “bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters,” it seemed for a fleeting moment that the Republican Party would finally tear itself free from Trump’s thrall.\n\nYet three weeks after the riot, the California Republican turned up at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida retreat, grinning into a camera alongside the insurrectionist in chief. His visit rehabilitated the disgraced ex-President as a political force and effectively put his party’s hopes of winning back the House this November in his hands.\n\nMcCarthy wasn’t the only senior Republican to renounce his heresy on the road to the midterms. Trump’s golf buddy, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said of Trump’s election-stealing attempt: “Enough is enough” and “you can count me out.” But a year on, he’s Trump’s cheerleader again. And in the Senate, all but seven Republicans voted to acquit Trump over the riot in his second impeachment trial, when a conviction would have likely barred him from future federal office. Some argued that as an ex-President he could no longer do any damage – a position of great naivete or, more likely, political calculation.\n\nThe GOP’s continuing fealty to Trump despite the horror of January 6 is the act of a party driven by “an instinct for self-preservation and self-advancement (that) worked itself into a campaign to normalize and excuse the insurrection,” said John Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. Or as Graham put it about Trump, “If you try to drive him out of the Republican Party, half the people will leave.”\n\nEven stripped of his social media megaphone, Trump’s power over his supporters is almost supernatural and is sustained by an industry of lie-mongering conservative media that has rewritten the history of January 6 for its viewers. While the GOP’s shielding of Trump has kept his impunity intact, the foot soldiers of his coup bid at the Capitol are starting to get jail terms.\n\nOnly 27% of Republicans in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll said Trump bears a “great deal” or a “good amount” of blame for January 6. In the same poll, 69% of Trump voters said Biden was not legitimately elected in 2020 – the lie at the heart of the insurrection. Amplifying that falsehood is the price of entry for 2022 GOP candidates who want the former President’s support. And it may yet power a Trump 2024 presidential bid. Such misinformation ultimately threatens democracy itself, since many Trump supporters now believe that elections are inherently corrupt and any Democratic win is illegitimate.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and author of “Strongmen,” a book about heads of state who destroy or damage democracy, said the insurrection would have been impossible without Trump’s personality cult.\n\n“The whole big lie was extraordinary. It was an authoritarian leader operation to keep him in power,” Ben-Ghiat said. “But what is amazing is everybody is going along with it. Millions of people now believe this. And he’s made the party into a personal tool.”\n\nGiven Trump’s instincts and record, he’s unlikely to use that power for the national interest.\n\nAn electoral system under assault\n\nOne of the most widely shared sentiments outside Trump’s support base after the attack was quelled was that the system worked.\n\nLawmakers returned to the Capitol hours after it had been breached and, even with the majority of House Republicans voting to overturn the election, Congress certified Biden’s win. With Trump already sulking in Florida, a new President took office on January 20, declaring that “the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.”\n\nState Republicans who refused Trump’s entreaties to steal the election, like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, were lionized by liberals. The Republican members of the January 6 committee – Vice Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois – are in the process of sacrificing their careers to protect the truth and the Constitution. The most meaningful divide in American politics is no longer between left and right but between those who uphold democracy and those who desecrate it.\n\nBut in the aftermath of January 6, the GOP did not look inward and examine why Trump had lost, or how the unthinkable had happened. Trump supporters set about reverse-engineering the system that had saved democracy to make it more pliable to his autocracy in the future. Republican legislatures, including in key swing states, were soon passing bills that made it harder to vote, especially for Democrats and minorities.\n\nSome are mulling giving themselves the power to appoint Electoral College slates that defy the will of voters. Others are replacing nonpartisan election workers with political hacks. Trump is backing 2020 election deniers for key jobs running elections in states like Georgia and Michigan. Republicans in Arizona mounted a sham vote audit in a state critical to Biden’s victory, then misrepresented the result when it confirmed the original outcome. And in Michigan, Republicans are using a quirk in the state Constitution to employ a ballot initiative that needs just over 340,000 signatures to try to force through electoral law changes vetoed by a Democratic governor who won with more than 2.2 million votes in 2018.\n\n“There are extremists in Michigan. What we’re seeing here in this state is on a micro level exactly what is happening in the rest of the country,” said Nancy Wang, executive director of Voters not Politicians, a pro-democracy group.\n\nAll of this is under the false guise of “election integrity” rooted in Trump’s lies that one of the most secure elections in US history was irrevocably corrupt.\n\n“It’s the most bald-faced attempt at disenfranchisement since Jim Crow,” said Hansen, the University of Chicago professor.\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center for Justice, 19 states passed 34 laws restricting access to voting between January and December 7, 2021. At least 13 additional bills had been prefiled in state legislatures for 2022. And at least 88 restrictive voting bills in nine states will carry over from last year. In Georgia, one of the most closely fought states in 2020, a new law allows the state’s politicized election board to remove professional election officials and seize control of specific jurisdictions. Other states are shortening voting hours and reducing mail-in voting that broadens the franchise.\n\n“We’ve seen a multipronged attack on the foundations of our democracy and electoral system. And it includes the largest-scale legislative attack on voting rights in a century,” said Wendy Weiser, Brennan’s vice president for democracy.\n\nDemocrats in Congress charge that the voter suppression push is a scheme to cement minority power by a party that has won the popular vote in only one of the last eight presidential elections.\n\n“If we do not act to protect our elections, the horrors of January 6 will risk becoming not the exception but the norm,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said this week. The New York Democrat is seeking to use the symbolism of the January 6 anniversary to highlight the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would reverse many of the new state restrictions on voting. But he must first persuade two skeptical Democratic senators, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema, to ditch the filibuster in order to get them passed.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, is turning the argument on its head, saying the claim that Republican-led states are messing with the franchise is the real “big lie.” But his party seems dedicated to the principle of making sure fewer people vote in elections.\n\nIt’s not a given that Trump would need to steal another election in 2024, especially if Biden’s political fortunes don’t improve or voters sour on a President who ran as a moderate and who some think is now engaged in massive liberal overreach. Perhaps enough local officials might again stand up for democracy in the decisive moment. And a huge turnout from Americans determined to exercise their democratic right could thwart voter suppression.\n\nBut one year on, the lesson of January 6 is that what was once thought impossible can happen. And the threat to American democracy is greater now than it was when Trump turned his mob on the Constitution.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/politics/fake-electors-trump/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Why Rudy Giuliani's fake electors scheme was so ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCNN reported Thursday that Rudy Giuliani, former attorney for Donald Trump and New York City mayor, led an effort to recruit and install fake electors in seven swing states, a direct attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nI reached out to two of the authors of the piece – Marshall Cohen and Zachary Cohen (no relation) – to explain exactly what they found and why it matters so much.\n\nOur conversation – conducted via email and lightly edited for flow – is below.\n\nCillizza: Let’s start simple: What, exactly, did Rudy Giuliani (and his team) do? And what was their goal?\n\nCohen/Cohen: By December 2020, Trump had already lost the election but the electoral votes from each state still had to be certified. Giuliani and his team effectively tried to subvert that process in an effort to overturn Biden’s legitimate victory – a push that involved replacing real electors from seven states Trump lost with GOP electors.\n\nGiuliani and his team enlisted GOP allies from these states to sign certificates falsely claiming they were the duly-elected electors – even though they were not.\n\nAfter various election fraud lawsuits in these states failed, Giuliani and his team shifted their focus to January 6. The idea, as outlined in a memo written by conservative lawyer John Eastman, was for then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw out President Joe Biden’s electors and replace them with the GOP electors on January 6 when Congress counted the electoral votes.\n\nThis, in theory, would give Trump more electoral votes than Biden and allow him to maintain his grip on power.\n\nCillizza: How detailed was this plan? How far down the rabbit hole did they go?\n\nCohen/Cohen: This plan was very detailed, and our sources made clear Giuliani and Trump campaign officials were intimately involved. They tried to recruit GOP electors to fill the slots needed to put forward an “alternate slate,” secured meeting rooms in statehouses where the GOP electors could meet on December 14 and circulated drafts of these fake certificates that falsely declared Trump had won.\n\nTrump campaign officials and GOP electors from at least one state, Pennsylvania, even haggled over the language of these fake certificates in the immediate lead up to December 14.\n\nCillizza: What do we know about Trump’s involvement? Was he aware of what Rudy was doing?\n\nCohen/Cohen: Honestly, we don’t know if Trump was involved in the behind-the-scenes efforts. It would have been strange for the President of the United States to be involved with these nuts-and-bolts details of the operation – but we know that Trump campaign officials, on the national and state level, were involved.\n\nBut we do know that on a zoomed-out level, Trump publicly supported and encouraged the scheme. There are a few examples of Trump advocating for state legislatures in many of these battleground states to overturn their election results, by recognizing the legitimacy of the pro-Trump electors. Trump kept pressing the state legislatures to spring into action and appoint GOP electors, in states where Biden won. He mentioned this at a rally in Georgia for the Senate runoff races, and he mentioned it again at the infamous speech on the Ellipse before his supporters invaded the US Capitol on January 6.\n\nCillizza: Tell me about how these fake elector slates wound up at the National Archives – and why it’s significant.\n\nCohen/Cohen: Lots of people assume that the “election” ends after the networks project a winner. But obviously, that’s not the case. The transfer of power from one US president to the next is spelled out in the US Constitution and various federal laws. It all works through the “Electoral College.”\n\nThe people go to the polls in November. Then the state counts the votes and certifies the results. The state awards its electoral votes to the candidate who won. Then those electors meet in the statehouse at a designated date in December, where they sign certificates to finalize the process. It’s a formality. They sign the certificates and send copies to the National Archives in DC, and to several other government entities, like the chief judge of the federal district court where the electors met. The National Archives processes the official certificates and then the real certificates are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\nThe fake certificates are important because some legal experts, and some state attorneys general, are now saying that it might have been illegal for the GOP electors to send fake documents to the National Archives. (To be clear, the people who were involved in the plot, who have spoken publicly, deny any wrongdoing.)\n\nCillizza: Finish this sentence: “The threat to the 2020 election results from this scheme was __________. ” Now, explain.\n\nCohen/Cohen: “The threat to the 2020 election results from this scheme was that it was literally an attempt to nullify the will of the people of millions of voters in seven states – Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.”\n\nBiden won those states, but the Trump campaign tried to exploit the Electoral College process to undo Biden’s victory. More than 13 million Americans voted for Biden in those states. Trump got millions of votes too, but not enough to beat Biden. So Biden was entitled to the 84 electoral votes from these seven states. Remember, 84 electoral votes is a big deal. You only need 270 to win. So, 84 is about one-third of all the electoral votes needed to clinch the presidency. Team Trump attempted to usurp that Electoral College process and, quite literally, steal the election in those states.

The committee also says it has documentation showing that these delegations sent the bogus electors to Congress “as a justification to delay or block the certification of the election” and specifically for Pence to consider while in his role as President of the Senate when he certified the 2020 presidential election. The panel received all 700-plus pages from the National Archives last week that were previously tied up in litigation after the Supreme Court ruled that former President Donald Trump could not block the panel from receiving them.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed the following chairperson and secretary of each group of so-called alternate electors. Each state pair is listed as chairperson and secretary respectively:\n\nNancy Cottle and Loraine Pellegrino from Arizona. Cottle is listed on the Arizona Federation of Republican Women’s website as being the group’s vice president.\n\nDavid Shafer and Shawn Still from Georgia. Shafer is the chair of the Georgia GOP and was a plaintiff in some of Trump’s longshot lawsuits to overturn the election in Georgia. Still was the Georgia GOP’s finance chair and is now running for a Georgia Senate seat.\n\nKathy Berden and Mayra Rodriguez from Michigan. Berden was a national committeewoman at the Republican National Committee and served as a Trump delegate at the 2016 GOP convention. Rodriguez unsuccessfully ran for a Michigan House seat in 2020.\n\nJewll Powdrell and Deborah Maestas from New Mexico. Powdrell recently told the Albuquerque Journal that he signed the fake certificate at the behest of former Rep. Steve Pearce, the head of the New Mexico GOP.

McDonald is the Nevada GOP chairman and reportedly promoted false voter fraud claims in 2020. DeGraffenreid’s Facebook page says he is a national committeeman from Nevada for the RNC.\n\nThe committee subpoenaed Bill Bachenberg and Lisa Patton from Pennsylvania. Bachenberg is a board member of the National Rifle Association and spoke at a pro-Trump fundraiser in 2020.\n\nAndrew Hitt and Kelly Ruh from Wisconsin. Hitt is the former chairman of the Wisconsin GOP and a staffer for former Gov. Scott Walker.

US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told CNN this week that the Department of Justice is looking into the effort to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing after receiving requests from lawmakers and state officials to investigate.\n\nThe effort to file the fake electoral slates had direct ties to the Trump campaign. CNN has reported that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani coordinated the effort among the Republicans in the seven states to create the bogus certifications that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.\n\nOne source said there were multiple planning calls between Trump campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call.

None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,” the report states.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said on Monday that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is leading the Justice Department’s investigations related to Trump, including both his post-election actions and classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.\n\nTrump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the “highly partisan” report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report:\n\nTrump and his inner circle engaged in ‘at least 200’ attempts to pressure state officials\n\nIn an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials in “at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation,” between Election Day and the January 6 attack, according to the report.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages, aimed at state or local officials, as well as 125 social media posts by Trump or senior aides targeting state officials.\n\nTrump “spearheaded outreach aimed at numerous officials in States he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona,” the report says. (He lost all of those states.)\n\nFor example, during a January 2, 2021, call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the then-president went through a “litany of false election-fraud claims” and then asked Raffensperger to deliver him a second term by “finding” just enough votes to ensure victory, according to the report.\n\nTrump infamously said, “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.”\n\nCommittee identifies pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as architect of fake electors plot\n\nThe January 6 committee identifies a little known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro.\n\nConservative attorney John Eastman authored a now-infamous memo detailing step-for-step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could theoretically overturn the 2020 election results. But the committee points to Chesebro, a known associate of Eastman, as being responsible for creating the fake electors plot.\n\n“The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,” the report says.\n\nIt was previously known that Chesebro was involved in the fake electors scheme, but the committee’s conclusion about his leadership role is new.\n\nThe effort to put forward fake slates of pro-Trump electors is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020.\n\nThe committee wrote that Chesebro sent a memo to then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani after a request from Trump campaign official Boris Epshteyn about a “‘President of the Senate’ strategy,” which wrongly asserted that the vice president could pick which presidential electors to count during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“President Trump in the days immediately before January 6th, Chesebro – an attorney based in Boston and New York recruited to assist the Trump Campaign as a volunteer legal advisor – was central to the creation of the plan,” the report says. “Memos by Chesebro on November 18th, December 9th, and December 13th, as discussed below, laid the plan’s foundation.”\n\nCNN has previously asked Chesebro to comment about these topics and he has not responded.\n\nTrump WH called Eastman on the day he wrote his memo\n\nEastman reached out to speak to Trump on December 23, 2020, the same day that he drafted his initial memo on the Pence theory.\n\nEastman emailed Trump’s assistant, Molly Michael, at 1:32 p.m., according to the committee. “Is the President available for a very quick call today at some point? Just want to update him on our overall strategic thinking.”\n\nThe committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard, and the call lasted 23 minutes, according to Eastman’s phone records. Eastman’s two-page memo discussed various ways to ensure “President Trump is re-elected,” even though by then, he had been projected to lose the election, according to the committee.\n\nThese new details show how the committee used emails and phone records it obtained after it successfully fought in court to obtain the documents.\n\nThe committee obtained Eastman’s emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government.\n\nTrump latched onto Eastman’s theories that incorrectly claimed Pence could overturn the election, and launched a pressure campaign against Pence in the days leading up to January 6. Eastman was present at a January 4, 2021, meeting between Trump and Pence in the Oval Office where Trump tried to convince Pence he could intervene when Congress certified the Electoral College vote on January 6.\n\nJanuary 6 committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again\n\nBarring Trump from further public office is one of 11 recommendations the committee is making as a result of its investigation.\n\nThe panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution” can be disqualified from office. The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.\n\nIt calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a “formal mechanism” for evaluating whether those individuals violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.\n\nSays lawyers should be held responsible\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, the select committee is calling for lawyers involved in the efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.\n\n“Those courts and bar disciplinary bodies responsible for overseeing the legal profession in the states and the District of Columbia should continue to evaluate the conduct of attorneys described in this Report” the panel writes, adding that there are specific attorneys the report identifies as having “conflicts of interests” for the Department of Justice to evaluate.\n\nThe report even calls on Congress to amend statutes and consider the severity of penalties that deter individuals from efforts to obstruct, influence or impede the Joint Session of Congress that certifies election results. It calls for statutes of federal penalties for certain types of threats against election workers to be strengthened.\n\nAlthough the panel was successful in getting more than 1,000 witnesses to testify as part of its investigation, it still had difficulty gaining cooperation from everyone it wanted to speak to. Its report recommends congressional committees of jurisdiction “develop legislation” to create “a cause of action” for the House to enforce its subpoenas in federal court.\n\nElectoral Count Act reform\n\nOne recommendation may soon become reality.\n\nThe panel calls on Congress to pass an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election – the first legislative response to the insurrection and Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power.\n\nThe House and Senate have each passed their own version of the legislation.\n\nCommittee refers Trump to Justice Department\n\nA video of former President Donald Trump is shown on a screen on Capitol Hill on December 19, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary first released Monday says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe panel says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the report states.\n\nThe committee also revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” it adds, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nMillions of dollars were raised on false claims, but RNC showed caution to not go too far\n\nThe committee investigators describe how Trump campaign and Republican National Committee fundraising pitches containing false claims of a stolen election ultimately raised more than $250 million – but were met internally with some resistance.\n\nInvestigators describe three options that were considered for a post-election fundraising appeal by the campaign. One option, that the campaign opted against using because they knew it was false, said that Trump had won. A second unused option said the campaign was waiting on results. Ultimately, according to the committee, the Trump campaign approved a message that Democrats are going to “try to steal the election” that was written before election night.\n\nThe committee describes, based on interview with Trump campaign officials, that much of the material in the fundraising emails was based on messages said by Trump – but were not checked for accuracy before being used to ask for donations.\n\n“President Trump’s claims were treated as true and blasted to millions of people with little to no scrutiny by those tasked with ensuring accuracy,” the committee wrote.\n\nTrump campaign’s deputy director of communications and research Zach Parkinson told investigators that reviews for accuracy were limited to “questions concerning items such as time and location.”\n\nThe RNC did eventually tone down some messages, which the committee suggests shows “the RNC knew that President’s Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless” and made “changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure,” according to investigators.\n\nHouse investigators said that RNC lawyers directed copywriters not to use the term “rigged,” according to interviews conducted by the committee. The panel obtained several examples of fundraising appeals that were toned down to be accurate and less inflammatory.\n\nTrump privately called some of Sidney Powell’s election claims ‘crazy’\n\nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks told the January 6 committee that Donald Trump had laughed at one of his election lawyer’s claims about foreign powers interfering in the election, calling them “crazy,” according to the committee’s final report.\n\n“The day after the press conference, President Trump spoke by phone with Sidney Powell from the Oval Office. During the call, Powell repeated the same claims of foreign interference in the election she had made at the press conference,” the report said, referring to conspiratorial claims made by Powell, Trump’s onetime attorney, at an outlandish press conference after the 2020 election.\n\n“While she was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?’” the report says.\n\nDuring the press conference, Powell falsely claimed, among other things, that widely used voting machines from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems featured software created “at the direction” of deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to swing his own election results, and that the company has ties to the Clinton Foundation and George Soros.\n\n“A few days later, the Trump campaign issued a statement claiming Powell was not part of the Trump campaign’s legal team. But Powell’s outlandish claims were no different from those President Trump was making himself,” the committee writes.\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nPro-Trump supporters storm the US Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images/FILE\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states.\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nAide characterized Trump’s tone on January 6 as, ‘can you believe this sh*t?’\n\nTrump’s tone during his last known phone call on January 6 was like, “wow, can you believe this sh*t?” according to the White House aide who spoke with him that night.\n\nIn newly revealed testimony included in the January 6 committee’s final report, the aide, John McEntee, said Trump told him “[t]his is a crazy day.” The report added, “McEntee said his tone was one of “like, wow, can you believe this sh*t?”\n\nTrump did not express any sadness over the violence that had unfolded at the Capitol that day, McEntee told the panel.\n\n“I think he was shocked by, you know, it getting a little out of control, but I don’t remember sadness, specifically” McEntee said.\n\nHe wasn’t the only person with that impression about Trump’s mood.\n\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser at the time, told the select committee her father was “disappointed and surprised” by the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut when pressed by committee investigators, she could not provide any instances of the president discussing whether or not he did the right thing on January 6 or speaking about those who were injured or died that day.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed Devan Cole Geneva Sands Katelyn Polantz Hannah Rabinowitz", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed", "Devan Cole", "Geneva Sands", "Katelyn Polantz", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/politics/michigan-gop-poll-worker-training-invs/index.html", "title": "Michigan GOP leaders encourage rule breaking at poll worker ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe evening before Michigan’s state primary, Wayne County GOP leaders held a Zoom training session for poll workers and partisan observers – warning them about “bad stuff happening” during the election and encouraging them to ignore local election rules barring cell phones and pens from polling places and vote-counting centers.\n\n“None of the constraints that they’re putting on this are legal,” former state senator Patrick Colbeck told trainees on the August 1 call.\n\nAs far as cell phones, “I would say maybe just hide it or something, and maybe hide a small pad and a small pen or something like that because you need to take accurate notes,” Cheryl Costantino, the GOP county chairwoman and host of the call, told participants.\n\nSome participants raised concerns about being tossed out if they broke the rules. “That’s why you got to do it secretly,” Costantino replied.\n\nWayne County GOP chair Cheryl Costantino. From City of Harper Woods website\n\nWhile volunteer partisan observers have always been trained by political parties and non-profit groups in Michigan, the Wayne County GOP had also invited poll workers – people hired and paid by the local clerk’s office. They are in charge of running the election, and their responsibilities can include checking voter IDs, counting ballots, and even securing voting equipment at the end of the day. Poll workers are required to engage in non-partisan training overseen by the local clerk and are only identified as Republicans for the purposes of making sure there is equal representation of both major parties working the election, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.\n\nDuring the Wayne County training call, obtained by CNN, the presumption that Democrats cheat – thus justifying Republican rule-breaking – permeated the discussion. It offers a snapshot of one of the ways Trump-backing, MAGA-minded conspiracy theorists are intervening in the election process across the country, sometimes encouraging poll workers or volunteer observers to violate election rules in hopes of finding evidence that Democrats might be doing the same.\n\nIt’s an approach election experts fear could spur chaos and conflict in November’s mid-term elections and in 2024.\n\n“There is no exception to following the laws; there is no ‘two wrongs make a right,’” said Wendy Weiser, a vice president at The Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks potential insider threats to the election process. Weiser said the center is seeing a spread in efforts by election deniers to infiltrate and manipulate the voting and vote counting process.\n\n“If poll workers are not committed to following the law, to following the directions of election officials, to protecting the integrity of the election process, they can do serious harm,” Weiser said.\n\nConcerns mount over partisan election training\n\nLike its counterparts in fellow battleground states Arizona and Pennsylvania, Michigan’s Republican Party has conspiracy believers pushing for influence over the election process at all levels, from candidates for statewide office down to poll workers and observers. As CNN has previously reported, that’s partly due to a strategy by Trump allies of ceaselessly recruiting conspiracy-minded MAGA volunteers for rank-and-file party positions.\n\nEarlier this year, unsuccessful GOP gubernatorial candidate Ryan Kelley called on Michigan poll workers to unplug election equipment “if you see something you don’t like happening.” In June, Kelley was charged with trespassing and other crimes in connection with the January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nRyan Kelley speaks to a reporter after a March for Medical Freedom event in Lansing, Michigan, on June 15, 2022. Emily Elconin/Reuters\n\nThe Michigan GOP group Election Integrity Force, which Colbeck helped start, pushes baseless claims about the 2020 election that feed suspicions about the fairness of upcoming elections. In a July session, as first reported by Politico, members of the group coached poll workers and observers to call 911 and bring law enforcement into election-related complaints.\n\nThe mounting efforts to influence poll workers have prompted concerns over election disruptions, forcing the state to establish a code of conduct for those individuals, said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\nPoll workers who don’t adhere to the rules will be removed “by the local clerk, if they violate the law … or in any way interfere with the administration of fair and secure elections,” Benson told CNN.\n\nThe GOP has “made a concerted effort to put election deniers in positions where they can gum up the works, afterward, if they don’t win,” said Jeff Timmer, former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party.\n\nThe training sessions are providing a thinly veiled, read-between-the-lines instructions that essentially show “people how to break the law without expressly telling them to break the law, in most cases,” said Timmer, an advisor to the Lincoln Project, a political action committee founded in 2019 by Republicans and former Republicans opposed to Trump.\n\nBoth Costantino and Colbeck, the trainers on the Wayne County call, have actively promoted 2020 election conspiracies that amount to make-believe.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2020 election, Colbeck posted on Facebook that Democrats were conspiring to commit electoral fraud and “manipulating the vote tallies transmitted from county election boards to the state board of canvassers.”\n\nWhile serving as a poll challenger at a counting center in Detroit, Colbeck claimed he saw vote-tabulation machines connected to the internet. He submitted an affidavit to that effect for a lawsuit that Costantino filed a week after the election, seeking to stop the results from being certified and requesting an audit.\n\nCostantino’s lawsuit, backed by Trump, drew national attention to her claims of election fraud. But a state circuit court judge dismissed the suit, stating that “no evidence supports Mr. Colbeck’s position.” Noting Colbeck’s Facebook posts, Judge Timothy Kenny said that his “predilection to believe fraud was occurring undermines his credibility as a witness,” before concluding that Costantino’s interpretation of events was “incorrect and not credible.”\n\nCostantino filed an appeal, which was denied.\n\nColbeck’s continuing claims that machines hooked to the internet flipped votes in 2020 led Dominion Voting systems to demand a retraction from him last year, stating that his claims “are not just false but have been repeatedly debunked by bipartisan election officials, actual election security experts, judges, and numerous Trump administration officials and allies.”\n\nColbeck also has tried to get copies of election files and Dominion software, zeroing in on Canton Township – a part of his former state Senate district. Canton Township Clerk Mike Siegrist, a Democrat, wrote in an August memo to the town’s board of trustees that his office denied those parts of Colbeck’s public-records requests because releasing the files would “violate our contracts with Dominion and jeopardize future elections.”\n\nColbeck did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\n‘Keep our heads on a swivel’\n\nAt the Wayne County election training session last month, Costantino and Colbeck said they were tracking scores of Democrats who Colbeck said “were trying to masquerade as Republicans” while signing up to work elections.\n\nColbeck told participants, “We’re going to have to keep our heads on a swivel and just start documenting irregularities.”\n\nThe two also attacked some election officials by name, including Siegrist, the Canton Township clerk, whom Costantino called “the worst clerk I think I’ve ever dealt with.” She added, “what we have to do is knock him down as soon as possible, before he works his way up in the Democratic Party.”\n\n“He’ll get his due,” said Colbeck, claiming improprieties in how Siegrist handled his records requests.\n\nColbeck called on the trainees to try to prove his repeatedly debunked theory about vote machines and tabulators being connected to the internet by checking screens whenever possible for connectivity symbols.\n\nTowards the end of the Zoom call, Costantino told the trainees, “So you are all, really, undercover agents. Congratulations. That’s undercover training.”\n\nApproached by CNN at the Michigan Republican state convention, Costantino said comparing the poll workers to spies was just her way of reframing the training session and “make it more fun and interesting” – with Michigan’s open primary serving as a kind of dry run for the election cycle ahead.\n\n“I said just, you know, instead of causing a bunch of scenes and things like that, just write it down,” she said. “Just kind of be like spies and … let me know what’s going on.”\n\nShe also said she considered the regulations, outlined in clerk-led trainings that barred cell phones and pens, to be unconstitutional.\n\n“It should not be illegal,” she told CNN, adding, with respect to election fraud claims, “If they’re going to call us out and say, ‘prove it,’ we have to be able to prove it.”\n\nPoll workers are key to making ‘democracy function’\n\nWhile poll challengers are partisan observers “empowered by a political party to witness the election and to bring up legal concerns in real time as they witness them,” poll workers are supposed to be neutral election officials who assists voters and “make our democracy function,” Siegrist said.\n\nMost of the people who come to his office to apply to be poll workers are suspicious about elections, he said, but being a part of the process helps resolve their concerns. It’s why Siegrist remains optimistic that election workers will do the right thing.\n\n“Those same individuals who come in as almost critics of the process, become the process’s most staunch and ardent supporters,” he said.\n\nThe rules about phones and pen and paper aren’t uncommon, said Jennifer Morrell, a co-founder of The Elections Group, a nonpartisan consultancy led by former elections officials that focuses on protecting the election process.\n\n“Anytime we had anybody working around ballots, we’d ask them not to have a pen, to eliminate any perception that anybody might mark a ballot,” she said.\n\nTrainees on the call, some of whom went on as poll workers in Michigan’s primary, seemed in tune with the premise and advice from Costantino and Colbeck.\n\nOne participant, Martin Szelag, attended a rally last year outside the Michigan Capitol with a sign hanging around his neck that read, in part, that “This election was STOLEN!” and that “we will support Joe Biden as our President if you can convince us he won legally.” Szelag told CNN he worked in the primary feeding ballots into a tabulating machine, and that everything “did happen in an orderly fashion.” Szelag, who said he trusts and admires Colbeck, doesn’t believe Biden was the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nMartin Szelag stands outside the state Capitol in Lansing, Michigan, on January 17, 2021. Paul Sancya/AP\n\nLarry Ludtke was among the trainees who had concerns about bringing pens and paper on the Zoom call, though he told CNN he didn’t recall bringing that up. He said he wouldn’t say Democrats stole the 2020 election, but that “there is fraud in every election.” Ludtke, who was a poll worker in the Michigan primary, noted that “everything seemed to work out – I got no real complaints.”\n\nGerry Hermann – a supporter of Colbeck’s unsuccessful 2018 campaign for governor of Michigan – also took part in the session. Hermann serves as the co-chair of the Washtenaw County Republican Party’s Election Integrity Committee, which is responsible for “restoring credibility to Michigan’s badly broken election system.” When contacted by CNN, Hermann declined comment on the training session.\n\nAlso on the call was Mark Ashley Price, who told CNN he did not work in the primary because he’s a candidate. Price serves on the board of the Highland Park School District and is the Republican nominee for Wayne County Executive. Earlier this year, in a Facebook post, Price wrote that former president Donald Trump “was robbed of the 2020 election with cheating.” More recently, in a Facebook post, Price wrote he was “happily part of the MAGA movement.” If elected, under county ordinances, Price would have a broad range of powers where he can “supervise, direct, and control functions of all departments of the County except those headed by elected officials.”\n\nA broader strategy\n\nCleta Mitchell, an attorney and Trump ally, organized the Election Integrity Network. Gerard Albert III/Myrtle Beach Sun News/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nSimilar election-training efforts predicated on 2020 election conspiracies have been mounted by an array of national and state-level groups with innocuous names such as the Election Integrity Network, True the Vote, Clean Elections USA, and others, along with the Republican National Committee.\n\nTrue the Vote, which has trained poll observers in various states, was a primary source for the thoroughly debunked film “2000 Mules,” claiming that election fraud cost Trump the 2020 election. Clean Elections USA is organizing a multi-state effort to have observers watch drop-boxes this fall to deter supposed vote fraud.\n\nThe Election Integrity Network is a group organized by Cleta Mitchell, an attorney and Trump ally who has been among the most active promoters of election conspiracies. They have conducted events in Michigan and at least seven other states.\n\n“We’ll be able to make sure that there’s another set of eyes going on, watching the ballots, watching the voting, watching the process – knowing what’s going on in the election offices,” Mitchell told CNN.\n\nMorrell, of The Elections Group, said her organization sent a contractor to an election training in Pennsylvania led by the Election Integrity Network. The Wayne County training “sounds like the same sort of playbook,” she said.\n\n“We’re dealing with a unique and volatile situation with a group of people operating on their own, outside of the statutory requirements and procedures,” said Morrell. “It creates a recipe for, at best, tense situations, and at worst, escalating to violent confrontation. …They don’t need to see something that’s an actual problem; they could record or take notes of something they don’t think looks right. Whether it is or isn’t may not matter. Just having a loud enough megaphone to say X happened can create distrust.”\n\nAnd fueling distrust in the election process is the ultimate goal, said Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director.\n\n“Their plan is to be a wrench in the gears of democracy,” he said of the Republican-led effort. “That’s their motive. Whatever lipstick or qualifying words they put on this pig, that’s what they intend to do, to cause chaos as the 2022 election unfolds, as a dress rehearsal for the even bigger election in 2024.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the description of The Elections Group.

Before a planned meeting with Trump that evening at the White House, Justice Department officials arranged a conference call with top leaders who also agreed to resign if Clark was appointed.\n\nThe letter was never sent, as the threat of mass resignations prompted Trump to stand down.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump aides joked ‘dead voter’ claims exaggerated\n\nEven as then-President Donald Trump and his legal team continued to claim that more than 10,000 dead people had voted in the 2020 election in Georgia, top White House aides jokingly acknowledged the exaggeration.\n\nTrump chief of staff Mark Meadows and senior adviser Eric Herschmann, in an early December exchange of messages, privately debunked the assertions as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressed the case in Georgia.\n\nMeadows said that his son had found a scant “12 obituaries and 6 other possibles depending on the Voter roll acuracy [sic].”\n\nSaid Herschmann: “That sounds more like it. Maybe he can help Rudy find the other 10k ??\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\n'Scared' Kevin McCarthy called Jared Kushner – in the shower – for help in getting Trump to call off the rioters\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee disclosed that the Republican House leader tried repeatedly to reach former President Donald Trump, “and did at least once” while also asking multiple members of Trump’s family for help, including senior White House aides Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\n“Kushner characterized Leader McCarthy’s demeanor on the call as “scared,” according to Kushner’s testimony. “I could hear in his voice that he really was nervous, and so, obviously, I took that seriously” and wanted to help. “I turned the shower off, threw on a suit, and, you know, and rushed into the White House as quickly as I could.”\n\nAsked what McCarthy had asked Kushner for help with, he said, “I don't recall a specific ask, just anything you could do. Again, I got the sense that, you know, (lawmakers in the Capitol) were—they were—you know, they were scared.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nRNC staffer refused to say Trump won Pennsylvania, report says\n\nEthan Katz, a Republican National Committee staffer in 2020, was asked to write a fundraising email saying former President Donald Trump had won Pennsylvania before the state had been called for either candidate.\n\nKatz refused, and three weeks after the election he lost his job. His supervisor Hannah Allred, during an interview with the Jan. 6 committee, said she didn’t know why he was fired and the decision was not hers to make, according to the report.\n\nIn the days after the 2020 election, Katz had also challenged Trump campaign staffers about how copywriters were supposed to explain to voters the campaign wanted to keep counting votes in Arizona but stop counting votes in other battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan, according to the committee report.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\n'Entire White House senior staff' wanted Trump to issue a statement instructing the violent rioters to leave the Capitol, but Trump refused\n\nThe committee’s final report disclosed that “the entire White House senior staff was in favor of a Presidential statement” urging all rioters to leave the Capitol. It cited, among other things, previously undisclosed testimony by then-White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.\n\n“And when you talk about others on the staff thinking more should be done, or thinking that the President needed to tell people to go home, who would you put in that category?” committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney asked Cipollone during his testimony before the committee. Cipollone ticked off a long list of top staffers, including Pat Philbin, Eric Herschmann, chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s daughter Ivanka. In fact, Cipollone responded, “I can’t think of anybody on that day who didn’t want people to get out of the Capitol once the—particularly once the violence started.”\n\nAs the committee disclosed during its televised hearings, an eyewitness said Meadows told Cipollone as the rioters broke into the Capitol that Trump “doesn’t want to do anything.” Cipollone confirmed to Cheney the gist of that exchange. “I had a conversation I’m sure with Mark Meadows, I’m sure with other people, of what I thought should be done,” Cipollone testified. “Did Mark say that to me? I don’t have a recollection of him saying that to me, but he may have said something along the lines.”\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nTrump floated plan for 10,000 National Guard troops to protect him in march to Capitol\n\nTwo days before the Jan. 6 assault, then-President Donald Trump persisted in his desire to accompany demonstrators on a march to the Capitol, suggesting that 10,000 National Guard troops could provide protection for him and an entourage.\n\nAccording to the committee, White House Senior Advisor Max Miller “shot it down immediately” out of concern for Trump’s safety, indicating that there was no additional conversation about the National Guard protection plan.\n\n“Just glad we killed the national guard and a procession,” Miller later texted to Trump aide Katrina Pierson.\n\nThe episode stands out, as there is no evidence that Trump ever called on the National Guard to put down the eventual riot at the Capitol, contributing to the long-delayed military response to the violent assault.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nRNC fundraised on Trump’s false claims\n\nThe Republican National Committee received millions in donations during the days that followed the 2020 election, having its most successful period of the campaign cycle while giving credence to former President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that he won, according to the Jan. 6 committee’s final report.\n\nTrump and the RNC raised a combined $250 million after the 2020 election – mostly from small donors who believed they were giving money to help “stop the steal.”\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBut RNC knew Trump lost and changed language to protect from 'legal exposure,' report says\n\nBut interviews and internal documents show the RNC knew Trump had lost, and its legal team maneuvered behind the scenes to carefully choose its language, the report said. For example, the RNC’s legal team advised copywriters to change language from “steal the election” to “try to steal the election,” according to the report. Copywriters were also advised not to use the term “rigged” or say that Joe Biden lost or Trump won. Instead, they were encouraged to use phrases like “finish the fight” and Trump “got 71 million legal votes.”\n\n“Evidence obtained by the Select Committee shows that the RNC knew that President Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless and that additional donations would not help him secure an additional term in office,” the report said. “They walked as close to the line as they dared—making several changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure while still spreading and relying on President Trump’s known lies and misrepresentations.”\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nLongtime Trump adviser Roger Stone connective thread between extremist groups\n\nRoger Stone, a longtime political adviser to former President Donald Trump, had close ties to right-wing activists pushing incendiary rhetoric leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the extremist groups who led the charge that day.\n\nAt a November 2020 protest in Atlanta – led by InfoWars' Alex Jones, white supremacist Nick Fuentes and right-wing activist Ali Alexander, and secured by members of the extremist groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers – Stone gave a speech via phone advancing election fraud claims and urging “victory or death,” the report says.\n\nThe Trump adviser was also in a Signal group chat titled “Friends of Stone” that included Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and other members of extremist groups. Days after the election, Stone messaged in the chat: “We provide information several times a day. So please monitor the F.O.S. feed so you can act in a timely fashion.”\n\nStone was interviewed by the committee, though he invoked the Fifth Amendment in response to more than 70 questions about the Capitol attack and his communications with Trump, the panel said.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nThe Trump pressure campaign on state officials, by the numbers\n\nThe plan to overturn election results in the states by disregarding actual vote counts and appointing fake Trump electors was set in motion shortly after the 2020 presidential election, and by the time Biden’s victory was certified had included hundreds of instances of outreach by Trump loyalists, the report concludes.\n\nThe plan – which even top Trump aide Dan Scavino called “crazy,” according to the report, involved pressuring state legislators to effectively change the outcome of the election.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee did the math on what that entailed for Trump and his inner circle:\n\n68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages aimed at state or local officials\n\n18 instances of prominent public remarks targeting the officials\n\n125 social media posts, mostly from Trump\n\nThe campaign contacted or tried to contact 200 state legislators, the report says. Hundreds joined a private briefing with Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and lawyer John Eastman. Trump urged attendees to exercise “the real power” to select electors that would keep him in power.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTrump’s intent to go to the Capitol is what counts, report says\n\nThe final report says “it is difficult to fully reconcile” divergent accounts about Trump’s purported efforts to go to the Capitol after his Jan. 6, 2021, speech – including whether he tried to get physical with a member of his security detail.\n\nBut that’s not important, it’s Trump’s intent that counts, the report said.\n\n“The principal factual point here is clear and undisputed: President Trump specifically and repeatedly requested to be taken to the Capitol. He was insistent and angry, and continued to push to travel to the Capitol even after returning to the White House,” the report said. Noting that the presidential motorcade did not disband, as usual, upon reaching the White House, the report said a Secret Service document shows that Trump planned “on holding at the White House for the next approximate two hours, then moving to the Capitol.”\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nHigh-profile Jan. 6 cases surface in report\n\nCapitol rioters embroiled in some of the Justice Department’s most high-profile prosecutions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack made cameos in the House committee’s final report.\n\nThe report’s section on the conspiracy movement QAnon is opened with a description of Doug Jensen, an Iowa construction worker who chased U.S. Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman through the Capitol while wearing a “Q” shirt. Jensen was found guilty of seven criminal charges tied to the Capitol attack and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nJacob Chansley, better known as the “QAnon Shaman,” was pointed out by the committee as evidence of rioters’ susceptibility to former President Donald Trump’s directives. After the former president released a message urging the rioters to “go home,” Chansley told a crowd: “I’m here delivering the President’s message. Donald Trump has asked everybody to go home.” Another responded to Chansley: “That’s our order,” the report says. Chansley pleaded guilty in his Capitol riot case and was sentenced to 41 months in prison.\n\nDetails from the trial of five Oath Keepers – plus allegations against members of the Proud Boys, who await trial – bolstered the committee’s argument that the Capitol assault was planned by some in advance.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nDozens of witnesses impeded the Jan. 6 committee investigation by invoking the Fifth Amendment or refusing to testify, panel says\n\nThe committee revealed that it believed its investigation was impeded in serious ways by the fact that more than 30 witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, while others invoked executive privilege “or categorically refused to appear,” including Trump confidante and former advisor Steve Bannon, who was later convicted of contempt of Congress.\n\nMany Trump lawyers and supporters, including Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Phil Waldron, and former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, all took the fifth when asked by the committee “what supposed proof they uncovered that the election was stolen.” Others who were central to understanding whether Trump conspired with others to engage in seditious conspiracy also took the fifth, the committee said, including Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows. Meadows, who refused to testify and was held in contempt of Congress, “could have specific evidence relevant to such charges, as may (other) witnesses who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination before this Committee.”\n\nThe committee said it was “particularly troubling” that certain witnesses took the fifth, including Flynn, for refusing to comment on such basic questions as whether he believed the violence on Jan. 6 was justified and whether he believed “in the peaceful transition of power” in the U.S. The House panel also suggested “that the Department of Justice further examine possible efforts to obstruct our investigation,” including why so many witnesses took the Fifth and what they might have been trying to hide.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\n'Potus likes the crazies’: Trump aide concerned about Ellipse rally\n\nWhile planning the Jan. 6, 2021, rally near the White House, an aide to then-President Donald Trump expressed deep concern about including election fraud promoters Roger Stone and Alex Jones.\n\nIn testimony before the House committee, Trump aide Katrina Pierson referred to Jones’ involvement in a volatile November 2020 demonstration as the “kind of thing” that gave her pause. But Pierson also acknowledged in a text message to an associate of the pressure Trump was exerting to pump up the crowd, saying “POTUS . . . likes the crazies.”\n\n“Pierson said that she believed this was the case because President Trump ‘loved people who viciously defended him in public.’ But their 'vicious' defenses of the President clearly troubled Pierson.”\n\nThe lineup of controversial speakers was described as the “original psycho list,” and Pierson was so troubled that she reached out to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows for help. “Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction,” Pierson wrote.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nExtremist groups, QAnon adherents led charge into the Capitol, committee finds\n\nMembers of right-wing extremist groups and adherents to the conspiracy movement QAnon led the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the House committee investigating the attack said in its final report.\n\nThe report found that members of the Proud Boys, who allegedly planned to storm the Capitol ahead of the riot, “led the attack at key breach points.” Members of the Oath Keepers formed military-style “stacks” to gain entry to the building. And extremists like the militia group Three Percenters, white nationalist Groypers and QAnon believers egged the mob on at the “frontlines,” the panel found.\n\n“The January 6th attack has often been described as a riot — and that is partly true. Some of those who trespassed on the Capitol’s grounds or entered the building did not plan to do so beforehand,” the committee wrote. “But it is also true that extremists, conspiracy theorists and others were prepared to fight. That is an insurrection.”\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nLiz Cheney: ‘The most shameful findings’\n\nGOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, laid out in the beginning of the report what the committee found “among the most shameful findings” from the hearings: “President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”\n\nThe committee, like a previous USA TODAY report, said for hours Trump did not issue a public statement urging his supporters to leave the Capitol “despite urgent pleas from his White House staff and dozens of others to do so.”\n\nDuring those 187 minutes when Trump was publicly silent, “law enforcement agents were attacked and seriously injured, the Capitol was invaded, the electoral count was halted and the lives of those in the Capitol were put at risk,” Cheney said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhat Trump did during the attack:A breakdown of the 187 minutes Trump was out of view on Jan. 6 as aides urged him to act\n\nTrump called claims of Dominion voting systems fraud 'crazy' before pushing that narrative himself\n\nTop Trump advisor Hope Hicks told the Jan. 6 committee that Trump laughed at his campaign lawyer Sidney Powell's claims of how three foreign countries had helped Joe Biden win by manipulating Dominion voting systems – before going public with how Dominion lost him the election through widespread fraud.\n\nTrump’s comments on Nov. 20, 2020 came a day after Powell and two other Trump campaign lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, held a press conference at Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, where Powell claimed there was a “massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States.” She singled out Dominion’s election software and did the same in the follow-up call to Trump.\n\n“While (Powell) was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?'” But while the Trump campaign soon distanced itself from Powell, Trump began pushing the same narrative through tweets and other comments, the committee said.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nHope Hicks' Jan. 6 testimony:Will Trump loyalist Hope Hicks' Jan. 6 testimony incriminate the former president?\n\nDetails emerge of parking garage meeting between Oath Keepers, Proud Boys leaders\n\nLeaders of the right-wing extremist groups Oath Keepers and Proud Boys discussed standing as a united front on Jan. 6, 2021, during a parking garage meeting that took place the day prior, according to the final report by the House committee investigating the Capitol attack.\n\nDuring the meeting, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio acknowledged that he and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes “don’t get along,” but needed to “unite regardless of our differences” in a “situation like this.” Tarrio had just been released from custody and ordered to leave Washington, D.C. after burning a church’s Black Lives Matter banner.\n\nParts of the meeting were captured on video by documentary filmmaker Nick Quested, though the committee conceded that much of the discussion between the two extremist group leaders is unknown because Quested was asked to stop filming. But the committee determined that the Oath Keepers' quick reaction forces, stockpiled with firearms in Virginia, were discussed at the meeting, according to the report.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nOath Keepers lawyer: 'Storming the Capitol' discussed, but 'normal'\n\nAlso present at the meeting were Latinos for Trump leader Bianca Gracia and Oath Keepers lawyer Kelley SoRelle.\n\nSoRelle told the panel that right-wing political activists – including Gracia, Rhodes, Vets for Trump leader Joshua Macias and Virginia State Sen. Amanda Chase – discussed “storming the Capitol” at a get-together ahead of the parking garage meeting, though she claimed talk like that was “normal” and not indicative of violence.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\n‘No evidence’ delayed National Guard response was intentional\n\nThe House committee described the National Guard’s delayed response to the Capitol violence as “unnecessary and unacceptable,” but the panel concluded that there was “no evidence” officials intended to deny assistance.\n\nInvestigators said the poor response was the “byproduct of military processes and institutional caution.”\n\n“We have no evidence that the delay was intentional,” the committee concluded. “Likewise, it appears that none of the individuals involved understood what President Trump planned for January 6th, and how he would behave during the violence.”\n\nThe panel noted then-President Donald Trump’s unexpected “active encouragement” of the rioters, as prompting the “full-blown” assault that ultimately outpaced the response.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nTrump tried to speak with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger 18 times\n\nMuch has been reported about the phone call on Jan. 2, 2021, when Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” votes to overturn Joe Biden’s election in the state.\n\nBut the final Jan. 6 committee report reveals just how vociferously the former president was chasing any basis to stay in power. Before the call, the report notes, Trump “had tried to speak by phone with Raffensperger at least 18 times.”\n\n“Raffensperger, for his part, had avoided talking to the President because of ongoing litigation with the President’s Campaign,” the report says.\n\nWhen they did speak, with lawyers on the line, Trump made the infamous ask of Georgia’s top election official to “find 11,780 votes” to tip the state his way. Not to do so, Trump threatened, would be a criminal offense.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nRNC staffers were assigned to help with fake electors scheme\n\nThe final report from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack further revealed details surrounding the Trump campaign’s effort to send an alternate slate of electors to Congress in the former president’s effort to stay in power.\n\nRepublican National Committee Ronna McDaniel testified that former President Donald Trump and his attorney John Eastman in a phone call asked for the RNC’s help in gathering a slate of fake electors ahead of Dec. 14, 2020 in case the Trump campaign won any of its legal challenges.\n\nThe Jan. 6 report shows McDaniel called back Trump soon after that call ended, “letting him know that she agreed to his request and that some RNC staffers were already assisting.”\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nEx-Overstock.com CEO paid for Proud Boys leader’s flight to DC protest, committee says\n\nBusinessman Patrick Byrne, former Overstock CEO, paid for Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio’s travel by private jet to a November 2020 protest in Washington where he met with other extremists, according to the Jan. 6 committee’s final report.\n\nTarrio met with Ali Alexander, the “Stop the Steal” organizer, and described the Nov. 14 Million MAGA March protest as a “historic” meeting of Trump supporters, the report says.\n\nByrne confirmed that he paid for the flight on Friday, suggesting in a tweet he was told that “a bunch of patriotic Latinos” wanted to attend the rally before agreeing to front the cost for their travel.\n\nA month after the protest, on Dec. 18, Byrne argued to Trump in a White House meeting that he had the authority to seize voting machines under a 2018 executive order, the report says. The suggestion was “forcefully condemned” by other administration officials at the meeting, according to the report.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nRisk to Capitol was ‘foreseeable’\n\nAlthough the House committee heaped primary blame on former President Donald Trump for the deadly Capitol assault, the report also offered a damning account of law enforcement’s response to troubling intelligence gathered in the weeks before the attack.\n\n“Federal and local law enforcement authorities were in possession of multiple streams of intelligence predicting violence directed at the Capitol prior to January 6th,” the committee concluded. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.”\n\nThe panel said the failure to share and act on the warnings “jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”\n\n“While the danger to the Capitol posed by an armed and angry crowd was foreseeable, the fact that the President of the United States would be the catalyst of their fury and facilitate the attack was unprecedented in American history.”\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nBan Trump from government office?\n\nThose who swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and then engaged in insurrection during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot should be barred from government office of any kind, the committee’s final report recommends. The report based the proposal on the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which includes a disqualification clause originally intended to keep Confederates from taking part in the government after the Civil War.\n\nThe report said disqualification also should apply to former President Donald Trump.\n\n“The Select Committee has referred Donald Trump and others for possible prosecution … including for assisting and providing aid and comfort to an insurrection,” the report said. “The Committee also notes that Donald J. Trump was impeached by a majority of the House of Representatives for Incitement of an Insurrection, and there were 57 votes in the Senate for his conviction.”\n\n– Kevin McCoy\n\nTrump speechwriter during Jan. 6 riot: ‘Potus im sure is loving this’\n\nAs rioters stormed the Capitol and the chilling images played out on television across the nation, Trump wanted to talk about upending the counting of electoral votes that would validate Biden’s victory.\n\n“I said, ‘Mr. President, they’ve taken the Vice President out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go,’” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., recalled telling him.\n\nTrump then rang Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The Republican leader said he urged the president to go on TV and Twitter and “call these people off.”\n\nBut the president was non-plussed, falsely asserting they weren’t his people and then telling McCarthy, “Kevin, maybe these people are just more angry about this than you are.”\n\nAs the violence at the Capitol escalated, Trump’s speechwriter, Gabriel Robert texted someone, “Potus im sure is loving this.”\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTrump reacts to Jan. 6 committee report\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday condemned the final report of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, decrying it as a “witch hunt” again.\n\nRather than respond to the report’s specific findings, Trump criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's over security issues. The post: \"The highly partisan Unselect Committee Report purposely fails to mention the failure of Pelosi to heed my recommendation for troops to be used in D.C., show the 'Peacefully and Patrioticly' words I used, or study the reason for the protest, Election Fraud. WITCH HUNT!\"\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nRead the full PDF of the Jan. 6 committee report here\n\nThe committee’s final report made 17 findings about the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, including that Trump plotted to overturn the 2020 results despite knowing he’d lost, sent an angry and armed mob to the Capitol and failed to respond to the violence as it unfolded on television.\n\nCommittee recommended Trump be prosecuted at final hearing\n\nThe committee voted Monday 9-0 to refer four criminal referrals against Trump to the Justice Department: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement, and \"incite,\" \"assist\" or \"aid and comfort\" an insurrection.\n\nThere could be enough evidence for criminal charges against other Trump allies, like attorneys John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro, the panel said.\n\nThe committee also is recommending the House Ethics Committee investigate four Republican lawmakers – including Kevin McCarthy, the potential next House speaker – for defying the committee's subpoenas.\n\nJan. 6 hearing recap:House committee recommends DOJ prosecute Trump over Capitol attack\n\nNext steps:Jan. 6 committee to recommend DOJ pursue criminal charges, but hasn't yet decided on names\n\nJan. 6 committee final report: How we got here\n\nThroughout nine public hearings, the committee made the case that Trump oversaw a \"sprawling, multistep conspiracy\" to overturn the election and prevent the transfer of presidential power to Joe Biden.\n\nIn October, the House panel took the extraordinary step of formally subpoenaing Trump, kicking off a legal battle with the former president who has denounced the committee's investigation as political.\n\nThough the committee's work has been widely lauded by the left, it has drawn ire from Republicans, who dismissed the panel's work as partisan writ large. With the GOP set to retake the House in January after winning a majority, the committee's end is imminent.\n\nDig deeper on the Jan. 6 committee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/politics/doj-investigation-jan-6-insurrection/index.html", "title": "Inside the DOJ investigation of the Jan. 6 insurrection | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nA year after the January 6 insurrection, the Justice Department continues to press forward on the biggest investigation in FBI history, with 700 people already arrested and hundreds more offenders still at large and several more years of prosecutions ahead.\n\nBut the expansive investigation has yet to shed light on how vigorously the former President and political allies could be investigated for inciting rioters by spreading a lie that the election was stolen and asking them to march to the Capitol.\n\nAfter opening aggressively, with prosecutors raising the prospect of using a rarely used seditious conspiracy law to charge some Capitol attackers, the Justice Department since Attorney General Merrick Garland took office in March 2021 has settled into a less headline-grabbing approach that Justice officials say is intended to keep the probe away from the political maelstrom.\n\nGarland, a former appeals court judge, has made restoring institutional norms a top focus of his tenure, after a Trump era that regularly injected politics at the department. That includes a reminder to prosecutors that they should only speak in indictments and other court proceedings.\n\n“The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law – whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Garland said in a speech Wednesday. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.”\n\nHis quiet approach has not satisfied Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans who openly discuss their interest in identifying crimes they believe the Justice Department should prosecute. It’s also opened Garland to criticism that he hasn’t been as publicly dynamic or aggressive as the nation needs to counter a threat to democracy.\n\n“I think Merrick Garland has been extremely weak and I think there should be a lot more of the organizers of January 6 that should be arrested by now,” Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said on CNN this week.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Anthony Coley defended the agency’s efforts. “We are proud of the men and women of the Justice Department, who are undertaking the largest investigation in the department’s history,” Coley said in a statement. “They are following the facts and the law and the Constitution while working at impressive speed and scale to hold accountable all those responsible for the attack on the Capitol, and will continue to do so.”\n\nFor the FBI, which came under criticism for failing to do more to prevent the attack, the January 6 anniversary is also a moment to urge the public to help with more tips to solve notable unsolved crimes, including the police assaults and the pipe bombs found that day near the offices of the Democratic and Republican parties just steps from the Capitol.\n\nSteven D’Antuono, assistant director for the FBI’s Washington field office, said those inquiries are priorities as part of the broader complex investigation.\n\n“In this area where the bombs were placed, if they did go off they could have caused some serious harm or death,” D’Antuono said in an interview with CNN.\n\n“On that day, over 100 police officers were assaulted that day multiple times,” D’Antuono said. “And we’re not just talking about one assault, multiple assaults and by multiple people. We’re still looking for about 250 people individuals that assaulted police officers that day.”\n\nThe Justice Department hired a contractor to help it process hundreds of thousands of hours of video in order to do the painstaking work to identify assailants, CNN previously reported. “We’re going to be at this as long as it takes,” he said.\n\nAccountability beyond the rioters\n\nThe January 6 attack reframed the face of a domestic terrorism threat that the FBI, Homeland Security Department and other agencies say has grown rapidly. And the January 6 investigation has led to several arrests of what appear to be political extremists on the far right, and extensive investigations into militarized organizations that affiliated themselves with Trump and had members participating in the Capitol violence.\n\nBut in many ways, the role of the former President, whose rhetoric fueled the mob and continues to animate supporters, is the elephant in the room that Justice Department officials try to not talk about.\n\nIn one of the first moves under Garland, the Justice Department turned over thousands of pages of internal documents to congressional committees investigating the Capitol attack.\n\nThe move, which departed from precedent, was aimed at providing lawmakers with information that they could use more quickly to expose the conduct among people in the former administration who inspired the attack. That includes former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who according to testimony by former Trump officials, sought to engineer a coup of department leadership before January 6 and wanted to use the department to support Trump’s false election fraud claims.\n\nThe tacit acknowledgment in the move, however, was an indication that it was unlikely that the former president and top officials would face criminal prosecution for actions that incited the attack.\n\nSome Justice officials say that providing the documents to Congress will help provide Americans answers that the Justice Department perhaps may never expose, since the department can only provide a narrative of events when it brings charges.\n\nJustice officials note that prosecutors generally have five years of statute of limitations for most crimes that occurred January 6 and they haven’t foreclosed on the possibility of targeting higher-level figures.\n\nIf the release of troves of records to Congress was intended to relieve pressure on the department, in some ways it has done the opposite. Members of the House select committee investigating the attack, have highlighted information they’ve uncovered so far to build a steady drumbeat of pressure for the department to make sure there’s accountability beyond the hundreds of people who illegally entered the Capitol.\n\nFast start to the largest investigation in FBI history\n\nThe investigation began with a burst of activity, with 70 people being charged in the first week and a hundred case files opened, prosecutors said in a briefing. The swiftness was motivated in part because of concerns that a repeat of violence could disrupt the inauguration of President Joe Biden just weeks later.\n\n“No US attorney’s office has charged that many cases, executed this many subpoenas and search warrants in such a short period of time,” Michael Sherwin, the former acting District of Columbia US attorney who helped oversee the investigation, said in an interview. “Speed was critical. We had the Inauguration coming up. We had to instill in the public a sense of order and the rule of law, to mitigate the damage that happened that day.”\n\nBut those early news conferences from Sherwin and D’Antuono, who together presented a tough New York-style voice to the law enforcement work, quickly gave way as Garland ushered in a lower-profile style. Sherwin left the Justice Department after he was reprimanded for not getting permission to do an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes, in which he said, among other things, that he believed the Department could charge seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe crime scene at the Capitol was unusual and unprecedented in size, in many ways because of how surveillance and police cameras captured dozens of angles of the attack of the Capitol, and because the bragging online posts from the riot’s participants gave prosecutors multiple terabytes of evidence.\n\nEarly on, the FBI opened its tip lines and published photos of high profile attackers, immediately ushering a flood of tips from average citizens turning in family, friends and strangers. A loose group of online sleuths, nicknamed Sedition Hunters, organized themselves to cull through publicly released images to help identify dozens of suspected rioters. Their work, which sometimes has been faster than the FBI’s, has been hailed by prosecutors who credited their work in criminal charging documents.\n\nPlodding pace of riot court\n\nGarland’s approach to the January 6 probe appears to mimic the plodding pace of court – what may seem sensible to the long-time federal judge but what largely keeps the wider public from witnessing much of the investigative action outside of court proceedings and documents. So far, more than 160 federal defendants have pleaded guilty, with all but 20 so far pleading guilty to lower-level misdemeanor charges – leaving the bulk of the felony cases to move forward in court in 2022.\n\nAbout 70 defendants have been sentenced, to either probation or stints in home confinement or jail. Many of the felony defendants are looking at potentially years in prison if found guilty.\n\nThe first January 6 criminal trials are set to begin in February. In those days-long proceedings, prosecutors will have to give more of a window into the breadth of communications data, video and other evidence they’ve collected in what has become the largest federal investigation in American history.\n\nAt times, the pursuits in court have already connected January 6 investigators to the phone logs of members of Congress and a vast web of MAGA celebrities, such as Roger Stone and Sidney Powell, in touch with people around Trump’s White House leading up to January 6.\n\nBut the Justice Department turning the screws on Trump’s closest contacts may be a long way off, if pursued at all. Prosecutors won’t take to trial for months major conspiracy indictments against alleged leaders of the right-wing Proud Boys that broke into the Capitol through a window, and participants in a group of Oath Keepers. In the latter case, with 17 defendants heading to trial, some are accused of stationing guns outside the city on January 6, others say they were acting as security for VIPs, and other defendants zoomed a golf cart to Capitol Hill while coordinating their group during the attack, prosecutors say.\n\nSo far, four Oath Keepers defendants have pleaded guilty and appear to be cooperating with prosecutors. And while the Proud Boys’ lawyers have murmured about cooperating witnesses for months and how prosecutors pressured some of them to cooperate, the first known Proud Boys member to be charged with conspiracy flipped only in the last weeks of 2021.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Katelyn Polantz", "Evan Perez", "Katelyn Polantz"], "publish_date": "2022/01/05"}]}

That, in turn, harms the ability of other retailers to compete.\n\nRail strike looms:Amtrak cancels all long-distance trains ahead of potential freight rail shutdown\n\nThe suit maintains merchants that do not comply with the policy could have their products stripped from prominent listings on Amazon and face other sanctions such as suspensions or terminations of their accounts. It alleges Amazon’s policy essentially forces merchants to list higher prices on other sites, helping the retail giant maintain its e-commerce dominance.\n\nAmong other things, the California lawsuit seeks to stop Amazon from entering into contracts with sellers that harm price competition. It also seeks a court order to compel Amazon to pay damages to the state for increased prices. State officials did not say how much money they are seeking.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon controls roughly 38% of online sales in the U.S., more than that of Walmart, eBay, Apple, Best Buy and Target combined, according to the research firm Insider Intelligence. About two million sellers list their products on Amazon’s third-party marketplace, accounting for 58% of the company’s retail sales.\n\nDuring a news conference on Wednesday, Bonta said some vendors have expressed they would offer lower prices on other sites with lower seller fees, but don’t do so to avoid punishment from Amazon.\n\n“Amazon has stifled its competition for years, not by successfully competing, but by blocking competition on price,” Bonta said. “As a result, California families paid more, and now Amazon must pay the price.”\n\nHe said the lawsuit is also a message to other companies who “illegally bend the market at the expense of California consumers, small business owners and the economy.”\n\nThe tech industry’s allies quickly slammed the lawsuit. Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the industry trade group Chamber of Progress, which receives funding from Amazon and other tech companies, said the case would force Amazon to raise prices.\n\n“That makes no sense while consumers shop for bargains to counter inflation, and it’s based on a legally unsound theory already rejected by federal courts,” Kovacevich said.\n\n'I don't need cute trinkets':Nearly 1,300 New York Times staffers refuse to return to office\n\nAmazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The company has said in the past that sellers set their own prices on the platform. It has also said it has the right to avoid highlighting products that are not priced competitively.\n\nDespite that defense, Amazon’s market power has been a subject of scrutiny from lawmakers and advocacy groups calling for stricter antitrust regulations. Earlier this year, congressional lawmakers urged the Justice Department to investigate if the company collects data on sellers to develop competing products and offer them more prominently on its site. Critics have also lambasted the increasing fees imposed on sellers, which makes it more difficult for merchants to enter the market.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have been pushing bipartisan legislation aiming to limit Amazon and other Big Tech companies, including Apple, Meta and Google, from favoring their own products and services over rivals. The bill has cleared key committees but has languished in Congress for months amid intense pushback from the companies.\n\nMeanwhile, regulators have also been looking into Amazon’s business practices and deals. In July, the company offered concessions to settle two antitrust investigations in the European Union, including a promise to apply equal treatment to all sellers when ranking product offers on the site’s “buy box,” a coveted spot that makes items more visible to shoppers.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Amazon’s $3.9 billion acquisition of the primary health organization One Medical as well as the sign-up and cancellation practices of Amazon Prime, the company’s paid subscription service that offers deals and faster shipping.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/politics/texas-far-right-politics-invs/index.html", "title": "Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks: How two Texas megadonors have ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGun owners allowed to carry handguns without permits or training.

Women forced to drive hours out-of-state to access abortion.\n\nThis is Texas now: While the Lone Star State has long been a bastion of Republican politics, new laws and policies have taken Texas further to the right in recent years than it has been in decades.\n\nElected officials and political observers in the state say a major factor in the transformation can be traced back to West Texas. Two billionaire oil and fracking magnates from the region, Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks, have quietly bankrolled some of Texas’ most far-right political candidates – helping reshape the state’s Republican Party in their worldview.\n\nOver the last decade, Dunn and his wife, Terri, have contributed more than $18 million to state candidates and political action committees, while Wilks and his wife, Jo Ann, have given more than $11 million, putting them among the top donors in the state.\n\nTim Dunn is seen during a National Network for Safe Communities conference in 2015.

Dunn and Wilks also hold sway over the state’s legislative agenda through a network of non-profits and advocacy groups that push conservative policy issues.\n\nCritics, and even some former associates, say that Dunn and Wilks demand loyalty from the candidates they back, punishing even deeply conservative legislators who cross them by bankrolling primary challengers. Kel Seliger, a longtime Republican state senator from Amarillo who has clashed with the billionaires, said their influence has made Austin feel a little like Moscow.\n\n“It is a Russian-style oligarchy, pure and simple,” Seliger said. “Really, really wealthy people who are willing to spend a lot of money to get policy made the way they want it – and they get it.”\n\nIn this Dec. 29, 2015, file photo, Farris Wilks watches U.S. Senator and then-presidential candidate Ted Cruz deliver remarks in Cisco, Texas.

In past interviews and opinion pieces, Dunn has argued that his political spending is focused on making Texas’ state government more accountable to its voters, while Wilks has described his donations as aimed at electing principled conservative leaders.\n\nFormer associates of Dunn and Wilks who spoke to CNN said the billionaires are both especially focused on education issues, and their ultimate goal is to replace public education with private, Christian schooling. Wilks is a pastor at the church his father founded, and Dunn preaches at the church his family attends. In their sermons, they paint a picture of a nation under siege from liberal ideas.\n\n“The cornerstones of our government are crumbling and starting to come apart,” Wilks declared in a 2014 sermon at his insular church, the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day. “And it’s because of the lack of morality, the lack of belief in our heavenly Father.”\n\nTexas’ far-right shift has national implications: The candidates Dunn and Wilks have supported have turned the state legislature into a laboratory for far-right policy that’s starting to gain traction across the US.\n\nThe Texas State Capitol is seen on the first day of the 87th Legislature's third special session on September 20, 2021 in Austin, Texas. Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images\n\nDunn and Wilks have been less successful in the 2022 primary elections than in past years: Almost all of the GOP legislative incumbents opposed by Defend Texas Liberty, a political action committee primarily funded by the duo, won their primaries this spring, and the group spent millions of dollars supporting a far-right opponent to Gov. Greg Abbott who lost by a wide margin.\n\nBut experts say the billionaires’ recent struggles are in part a symptom of their past success: Many of the candidates they’re challenging from the right, from Abbott down, have embraced more and more conservative positions, on issues from transgender rights to guns to voting.\n\n“They dragged all the moderate candidates to the hard right in order to keep from losing,” said Bud Kennedy, a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper who’s covered 18 sessions of the Texas legislature.\n\n“I don’t think regular Texans are as conservative as their elected officials,” Kennedy said. “The reason that Texas has moved to the right is because the money’s there.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Donors with influence on Texas politics 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPolitical investments paying off\n\nOver the last decade, many of the most conservative bills in the Texas legislature, on topics from LGBT rights to guns to private school vouchers, were killed by the moderate Republicans who held sway in the state House. That changed last year, thanks to people like Valoree Swanson.\n\nSwanson was a Sunday school teacher and political activist when she challenged a 14-year incumbent Republican, Debbie Riddle, in 2016 in a district covering Houston’s Republican-dominated northern suburbs.\n\nSwanson, who ran to Riddle’s right, shocked political observers by outraising the incumbent – an unusual feat for a first-time candidate. Her largest donor: Empower Texans, a political action committee created by Dunn and largely funded by him and Wilks. She defeated Riddle in the Republican primary by more than 10 percentage points and went on to easily win the general election.\n\nLast year, Swanson won a major legislative victory: She authored the transgender sports bill, which blocks trans students from playing on K-12 school sports teams that aren’t aligned with their genders at birth. While other bills about transgender issues had failed in previous years, the sports bill was approved by a legislature now firmly controlled by the GOP’s right flank after the moderate former House speaker retired. Observers saw it as a validation of the billionaires’ early investments in Swanson’s first campaign, paying off years later.\n\n“They’re effectively investing their money and they’re moving the needle on policy in Austin,” said Scott Braddock, the editor of Quorum Report, a publication that’s been covering the legislature for decades, referring to Dunn and Wilks. “These are extreme people investing a lot of money in our politics to reshape Texas, such that it matches up with their vision.”\n\nDemonstrators gather on the steps to the State Capitol to speak against transgender-related legislation being considered in the Texas Senate and Texas House, May 20, 2021, in Austin, Texas. Eric Gay/AP\n\nSwanson is hardly an outlier: All 18 of the current Republican members of the Texas Senate, and almost half of the Republican members of the Texas House, have taken at least some money from Dunn, Wilks or organizations that they fund. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton have also been major beneficiaries of the billionaires’ spending.\n\nTexas is one of just 10 states that allow individuals to make unlimited contributions to state political candidates, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures – letting Dunn and Wilks have more influence than they might elsewhere in the country.\n\nWhile Dunn and Wilks focus on state politics, they’ve also gotten involved in national races. Wilks, his brother Dan and their wives were among the largest donors to super PACs supporting GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016, contributing a total of $15 million. And Dunn has given millions of dollars to super PACs supporting former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in recent years.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Cruz called the Wilks brothers “the epitome of the American dream” and “fearless champions of conservative causes, much to the consternation of the corrupt corporate media.”\n\nSo far in 2022, Dunn’s and Wilks’ political investments haven’t been as successful as in past years. Defend Texas Liberty, the group they fund, gave more than $3 million to Don Huffines, a former state senator who challenged Abbott in his Republican primary and won just 12% of the vote. Despite his loss, experts pointed out, over the course of the campaign Abbott embraced some of the positions Huffines had staked out, including strong opposition to transgender rights and support for deploying National Guard members to the US-Mexican border.\n\nDefend Texas Liberty’s second-largest beneficiary this year has been Shelley Luther, an unsuccessful far-right legislative candidate who attracted national attention after she was arrested for refusing to shut down her Dallas hair salon to comply with coronavirus restrictions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Luther – who proposed banning Chinese students from Texas universities and declared she is “not comfortable with the transgenders” – said that Dunn and Wilks had been integral to her campaign.\n\n“Without them, I couldn’t have even run,” Luther said. But she added that the spending wouldn’t have given the billionaires influence over her votes or decisions: “He wants me to do what I say that I represent,” she said of Dunn.\n\nEnforcing the ‘law of the jungle’\n\nThe Texas Highway Patrol stands in front of pro-life demonstrators as pro-choice supporters leave the Capitol in Austin, Texas, on Saturday May 14, 2022. Jessica Koscielniak/USA Today Network\n\nDunn and Wilks don’t just use campaign donations to play a role in state politics. They also fund a network of organizations that have been influential at boosting conservative causes.\n\nTexans for Fiscal Responsibility, a non-profit chaired by Dunn, has released a “Fiscal Responsibility Index” each legislative session grading state lawmakers based on their stances on conservative bills. The scorecard, which is often cited in election ads that show up in voters’ mailboxes, is known in Texas political circles for its ability to make and break Republican primary campaigns.\n\n“If you don’t show up well on the scorecard, you’re going to have a lot of money spent against you,” Seliger said.\n\nTexas Republicans say that even a deeply conservative record doesn’t protect someone from a primary challenge funded by Dunn, Wilks and groups they bankroll.\n\nState Sen. Bob Deuell had won elections for years in his northeast Texas district and racked up a conservative record – including co-authoring a 2013 abortion bill that was considered among the strictest in the country at the time, and was struck down by the US Supreme Court.\n\nBut in 2013, Deuell, a doctor, supported a bill that overhauled Texas’ end-of-life procedures. Texas Right to Life, a group whose largest donor over its history is Wilks, falsely claimed the bill would “strengthen Texas’ death panels.” The following year, Deuell was challenged by Bob Hall, a tea party activist.\n\nBob Deuell speaks to CNN's Ed Lavandera in Greenville, Texas on February 23, 2022. CNN\n\nTexas Right to Life spent more than $150,000 on mailers, voter guides and political consultants for Hall and other candidates in 2014, airing a barrage of ads claiming Deuell had “turned his back on life and on disabled patients.” Hall won the Republican primary in a runoff by 300 votes. Since that first campaign, Hall has received more than $900,000 from Dunn, Wilks, and groups that they are major funders of – about a third of his total donations.\n\n“All this West Texas money is what made him into a viable candidate,” Deuell said of Hall, who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nSeliger, Deuell’s former colleague in the Senate, has also staked out conservative positions on many issues, and Dunn gave his campaign $1,000 during his first year in office in 2004.\n\nBut after Seliger decided he couldn’t support efforts to divert funding from public schools to private school vouchers, Dunn turned on him, he said. In the decade since, he’s found himself repeatedly running against a challenger backed by groups funded by Dunn and Wilks.\n\n“That’s the law of the jungle now in Texas,” Seliger said. “The majority of Republican Senate members just dance to whatever tune Tim Dunn wants to play.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Conservatism vs. control within the Texas Republican Party 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDunn has defended his spending and his group’s campaign tactics.\n\n“Empower Texans remains outside the swamp, and the group informs voters who want their representatives to do in Austin what they promised during election season,” he wrote in a 2018 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, responding to criticism of the group’s tactics. “If all of us outsiders stick together, we can drain the Austin Swamp.”\n\nZachary Maxwell has had an inside view of the billionaires’ influence. He worked for Empower Texans, Dunn’s PAC, and served as campaign manager and chief of staff for then-state Rep. Mike Lang, who received more than 60% of his campaign donations from Wilks and PACs he and Dunn were major funders of.\n\nMaxwell told CNN in an interview that there was “no way” Lang could have gotten elected without Wilks’ money. At one campaign fundraiser, he said, Jo Ann Wilks handed Maxwell a check for more than $100,000.\n\n“I was like, ‘Can you even write a check that big?’ ” Maxwell remembered. “I about had a heart attack.”\n\nHuge sums like that helped buy Wilks influence once Lang took office, Maxwell said. “Whenever (Farris Wilks) called, he answered,” Maxwell said of Lang. “There was a lot of control.”\n\nLang did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nWest Texas upbringings\n\nTexas has a long tradition of oil and gas magnates using their fortunes to shape politics. Hugh Roy Cullen, one of Houston’s wealthiest philanthropists, supported the pro-segregation Dixiecrat movement in the 1940s, and H.L. Hunt, who owned a vast swath of the East Texas Oil Field, funded a conservative radio program that aired across the US in the ’50s and ‘60s.\n\nWhat sets Dunn and Wilks apart, political observers say, is how they’ve spent so much money pushing not just business-friendly policies that boost their bottom line but also socially conservative bills that seem designed to reshape Texas in the image of their far-right Christian values.\n\nBoth are products of humble West Texas upbringings who earned huge fortunes in Texas’ energy industry.\n\nDunn, 66, lives in Midland, the childhood home of George W. Bush and a center of the state’s oil industry. He grew up in nearby Big Spring, the son of a farm and factory worker, and studied chemical engineering at Texas Tech before working for Exxon and other oil and banking companies.\n\nHe started his own oil company, now named CrownQuest Operating, in 1996. The firm operates oil wells around West Texas’ Permian Oil Basin and beyond, and pumped 31 million barrels of oil in Texas in 2021, making it the state’s 12th largest oil producer, according to government records.\n\nDunn became more involved in Texas politics in 2006, when he opposed a tax measure that included a new tax on business partnerships – including some that fund oil wells, Texas Monthly reported. He started an organization to oppose the measure, Empower Texans, which continued to fund conservative causes even after the tax legislation passed. The group’s PAC shut down in 2020, and the billionaires more recently pivoted to funding Defend Texas Liberty.\n\nWilks, 70, grew up in a converted goat shed in Cisco, Texas, a town of 3,700 where sleepy streets are dotted with more than a dozen churches. He and his younger brother Dan were the sons of a bricklayer and started their careers as apprentice masons.\n\nAfter several other business ventures, in 2002 they founded Frac Tech Services, a company that provided trucking services for fracking operators. It was perfect timing: Fracking was about to take off in Texas and elsewhere in the US amid a boom in shale gas.\n\nLess than a decade later, in 2011, the Wilkses sold their majority share of the company for more than $3 billion to a group that included international investors. Since then, they’ve been buying up land in Texas and around the Western US, joining the ranks of America’s largest landowners – and getting involved in politics.\n\nFarris Wilks is the pastor of the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day Church, which operates a sprawling compound outside of Cisco and was founded by his father. In sermons, he has denounced homosexuality and abortion rights in vitriolic terms.\n\n“A male on male or a female on female is against nature,” Wilks declared in a 2013 recording of one sermon posted on his church’s website, which is no longer publicly available. “This lifestyle is the predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children. … They want your children.”\n\nDunn also preaches at his church, the Midland Bible Church, where he serves as a member of the congregation’s “pulpit team.”\n\n“No matter what rules you grew up with, none of them are enforceable in God’s kingdom,” he declared in one 2018 sermon.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Times of London, Dunn told a reporter he believed that, as the newspaper put it, “his oil has existed for only 4,000 years, the time decreed by Genesis, not 200 million years as his geologists know.”\n\nThat religious fervor has influenced Dunn’s and Wilks’ political moves. In a meeting with former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, who is Jewish, Dunn declared that only Christians should hold leadership positions in the chamber, Texas Monthly reported. Straus declined an interview request with CNN.\n\nAnd both Wilks brothers have donated millions of dollars through their personal foundations to conservative Christian groups, including crisis pregnancy centers, according to IRS records, which work to dissuade women from abortion and in some cases share misleading medical information.\n\n‘The goal is to tear up, tear down’\n\nPeople who’ve worked with Wilks and Dunn say they share an ultimate goal: replacing much of public education in Texas with private Christian schools. Now, educators and students are feeling the impact of that conservative ideology on the state’s school system.\n\nDorothy Burton, a former GOP activist and religious scholar, joined Farris Wilks on a 2015 Christian speaking tour organized by his brother-in-law and said she spoke at events he attended. She described the fracking magnate as “very quiet” but approachable: “You would look at him and you would never think that he was a billionaire,” she said.\n\nBut Burton said that after a year of hearing Wilks’ ideology on the speaking circuit, she became disillusioned by the single-mindedness of his conservatism.\n\n“The goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,” she said of Wilks. “And rebuild it the way God intended education to be.”\n\nIn sermons, Dunn and Wilks have advocated for religious influence in schooling. “When the Bible plainly teaches one thing and our culture teaches another, what do our children need to know what to do?” Wilks asks in one sermon from 2013.\n\nDunn, Wilks and the groups and politicians they both fund have been raising alarms about liberal ideas in the classroom, targeting teachers and school administrators they see as too progressive. The billionaires have especially focused on critical race theory, in what critics see as an attempt to use it as a scapegoat to break voters’ trust in public schooling.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, James Whitfield, the first Black principal of the mostly White Colleyville Heritage High School in the Dallas suburbs, penned a heartfelt, early-morning email in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, encouraging his school to “not grow weary in the battle against systemic racism.”\n\nJames Whitfield looks at photos at his home in Bedford, Texas on January 13, 2022. CNN\n\nThe backlash came months later. Stetson Clark, a former school board candidate whose campaign had been backed by a group that received its largest donations from Dunn and organizations he funded, accused Whitfield during a school board meeting last year of “encouraging all members of our community to become revolutionaries” and “encouraging the destruction and disruption of our district.” The board placed Whitfield on leave, and later voted not to renew his contract. He agreed to resign after coming to a settlement with the district. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitfield said he saw the rhetoric pushed by Dunn and Wilks as a major cause of his being pushed out.\n\n“They want to disrupt and destroy public schools, because they would much rather have schools that are faith-based,” Whitfield said. “We know what has happened over the course of history in our country, and if we can’t teach that, then what do you want me to do?”\n\nMeanwhile, the legislature has also been taking on the discussion of race in classrooms, passing a bill last year that bans schools from making teachers “discuss a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” The legislation was designed to keep critical race theory out of the classroom, according to Abbott, who signed the bill into law.\n\nSome of the co-authors and sponsors of the bill and previous versions of the legislation received significant funding from Dunn and Wilks.\n\nThe billionaires “want to destroy the public school system as we know it and, in its place, see more home-schooling and more private Christian schools,” said Deuell, the former senator.\n\nThe Texans feeling the impact include Libby Gonzales, an 11-year-old transgender girl living in the Dallas suburbs. She and her family say they feel like targets after the new law restricting trans students’ participation in school sports went into effect last year – passed by Swanson and other legislators bankrolled by Dunn and Wilks. Now, Libby won’t be able to play for the girls’ soccer team that she’d like to join.\n\nLibby Gonzales plays outside her home in a suburb of Dallas on January 19, 2022. CNN\n\n“We don’t have issues in our neighborhood, among our friends,” said her mother, Rachel Gonzales. “It’s when our legislators meet and decide that they’re going to leverage their political power against some of the most marginalized kids in our state.”\n\nGonzales has started volunteering for political campaigns in an attempt to turn the tide on anti-trans policies. Libby said she’s been following the news about Texas’ conservative turn – and worrying what’s coming next.\n\nLast month, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank that Dunn serves on the board of, called on the legislature to ban the prescription of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors.\n\n“I’m under attack,” Libby said. “I have no idea why people don’t understand that I’m just a girl: an 11-year-old girl living in Texas – with amazing hair.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Matthew Reynard Will Simon Ed Lavandera", "Casey Tolan", "Matthew Reynard", "Will Simon", "Ed Lavandera"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/politics/fbi-investigation-huawei-china-defense-department-communications-nuclear/index.html", "title": "CNN Exclusive: FBI investigation determined Chinese-made ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nOn paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\n\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\n\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\n\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\n\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\n\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, a strategic missile base, is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, an area near a host of cell towers using Huawei equipment. From F.E. Warren Air Force Base/Facebook\n\nIt’s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it’s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\n\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\n\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there’s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America’s nuclear arsenal.\n\n“This gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,” said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. “It would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. “That goes into the ‘BFD’ category.”\n\n“If it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,” this person added.\n\nTurning doves into hawks\n\nFormer officials described the probe’s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren’t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. “The existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,” said one former US official.\n\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\n\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment—but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\n\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\n\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\n\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\n\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\n\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\n\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\n“We cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Inside Huawei's connection to rural America 02:55 - Source: CNN\n\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. “That’s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,” said Wray. “And that’s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans’ personal and corporate data than every nation combined.”\n\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, “We’re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn’t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.”\n\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\n“And I think that’s probably about all I can say on the topic,” said Wray.\n\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\n\nDespite its tough talk, the US government’s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\n“All of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,” Huawei said in its statement to CNN. “Our equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.”\n\n“For more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,” the statement said.\n\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net — in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing “there was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.”\n\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\n\nThe federal government’s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\n“It really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor — because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there’s some plot behind every tree,” said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “However, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.”\n\nChinese tech in the American heartland\n\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\n\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\n\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\n\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei — but which placed its equipment near military assets.\n\nFederal investigators initially began “examining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,” explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that “made no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,” Lenkart said.\n\n“A lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on” those searches, Lenkart said.\n\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications — even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\n“It’s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,” said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. “Technically, it’s feasible.”\n\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device “to the semi-conductor level” and “reverse engineer the design.” But, he said, it can be done.\n\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\n\nWeather camera worries\n\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird’s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\n\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing — or anyone for that matter — the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\n\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing’s intelligence service to “task” the cameras — hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\n\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\n“There’s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,” DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, “I was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.”\n\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles — not the FBI — and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\n\nDiRico doesn’t question the government’s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China’s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\n“We monitor our network pretty good,” DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. “We feel we’ve got a pretty good idea if there’s anything going on that’s inappropriate.”\n\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\n\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a “sister city” arrangement.\n\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\n\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\n\nUS Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue announcing indictments against China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, several of its subsidiaries and its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on January 28, 2019. Joshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage — in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\n“What we’ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],” Evanina said. “What we’ve seen recently — it’s been what’s underneath the land.”\n\n“The hard part is, that’s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it’s just sitting there doing nothing?” he added.\n\nA complicated problem\n\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas — companies like Viaero — must “rip and replace” their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\n\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, “rip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.”\n\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of “rip and replace” is astronomical and that he doesn’t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\n“It’s difficult and it’s a lot of money,” DiRico said.\n\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn’t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies — or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\n“This government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it’s not a Chinese people issue,” Evanina said. “And I’ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party’s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.”\n\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\n“Sometimes I feel like we’re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don’t want our help,” said the current FBI official.

Both transactions were hit by national security concerns, and had involved acquisitions by Chinese-owned companies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Nexperia, a Dutch subsidiary of Shanghai-listed semiconductor maker Wingtech, was told by the government to sell at least 86% of its stake in Newport Wafer Fab, more than a year after taking control of the factory. Staffers have since been protesting the decision, saying it puts nearly 600 jobs at risk.\n\nIn Germany, the economic ministry barred Elmos Semiconductor, an automotive chipmaker, from selling its factory in the city of Dortmund to Silex, a Swedish subsidiary of China’s Sai Microelectronics.\n\nChipmaking was already emerging as a new front in US-China tensions. Now the two troubled deals illustrate how the pressure is also rising in Europe, particularly as Western officials face calls for key sectors to be kept out of Chinese control.\n\n“These decisions mark a shift towards tougher stances regarding Chinese investment in critical industries in Europe,” said Xiaomeng Lu, director of geo‑technology at Eurasia Group.\n\n“US pressure definitely contributed to these decisions. [A] growing sense of technology sovereignty also likely prompted these moves — governments around the world are increasingly [viewing the] semiconductors industry as a strategic resource and seek to protect them from foreign takeovers.”\n\nTwo new flashpoints\n\nLegal experts said the two decisions were notable because each deal was initially thought to have been cleared.\n\nThe Newport Wafer case is “the first completed acquisition” that needs to be unwound under a UK national security and investment (NSI) act, which took full effect in January, according to Ian Giles, head of antitrust and competition for Europe, the Middle East and Asia for Norton Rose.\n\nNexperia said last week that it was “shocked” by the decision, and that “the UK government chose not to enter into a meaningful dialogue with Nexperia or even visit the Newport site.”\n\nThe company added that it had offered to avoid “activities of potential concern, and to provide the UK government with direct control and participation in the management of Newport,” a 28-acre site in south Wales.\n\nA worker in a clean room for silicon semiconductor wafer manufacturing at the Newport Wafer Fab, owned by Nexperia, in Newport, Wales on Aug. 18. Hollie Adams/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe factory makes silicon wafers, the basis for making computer chips. Many of its products eventually power cars and medical equipment. Nexperia has indicated that workers at the facility now face an uncertain future.\n\nIn an open letter to the UK government last Thursday, the Nexperia Newport Staff Association said that it was “in disbelief” that employees’ livelihoods had been “put in jeopardy in the run-up to Christmas.”\n\n“This is clearly a deeply political decision,” the group wrote, rejecting the idea that the deal would undermine British security. “You must see sense and protect our jobs by allowing Nexperia to keep their Newport factory.”\n\nFor Elmos, German authorities had initially indicated that they would issue a conditional approval, and even shared a draft approval after an intense review process lasting about 10 months, the company said in a statement following the injunction.\n\nTim Schaper, head of antitrust and competition for Germany at Norton Rose, said government intervention was also significant given that “Elmos’ technology is said to be quite old, state of the art in the 1990s, and allegedly not of great industrial importance.”\n\n“The transaction became the plaything of a public debate about Chinese investors’ acquiring stakes in key German technologies,” he said.\n\nA company sign of Elmos Semiconductor, seen on Nov. 9 in the German city of Dortmund. Bernd Thissen/DPA/Picture Alliance/Getty Images\n\nIt’s possible that regulators were concerned about an outflow of technical know how, according to Alexander Rinne, the Munich-based head of international law firm Milbank’s European antitrust practice.\n\n“Elmos is known for making chips for the automotive sector, which is Germany’s core industry and the pride of the country,” he said in an interview.\n\nElmos and Nexperia both declined interview requests. A Nexperia spokesperson told CNN Business on Tuesday that it was “considering its options regarding the UK government’s decision.”\n\nA growing debate\n\nChips are a growing source of tension between the United States and China. Washington has declared a shortage of the materials a national security issue, and highlighted the importance of remaining competitive in advanced technology capabilities.\n\nThis year, the United States ramped up its own restrictions and pressed allies to enact their own, according to Lu. In August, the US government ordered two top chipmakers, Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), to halt exports of certain high-performance chips to China.\n\nTwo months later, the Biden administration unveiled sweeping export controls that banned Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license. The rules also restricted the ability of American citizens or US green card holders to provide support for the development or production of chips at certain manufacturing facilities in China.\n\nThe pressure is mounting. On Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged the West to “be careful not to create new dependencies” on China. Speaking at a NATO parliamentary assembly in Madrid, Stoltenberg said he was seeing “growing Chinese efforts” to control Western critical infrastructure, supply chains, and key industrial sectors.\n\n“We cannot give authoritarian regimes any chance to exploit our vulnerabilities and undermine us,” he said.\n\nChina has pushed back on the handling of the two European semiconductor cases.\n\n“We firmly oppose the UK’s move, and call on the UK to respect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and provide a fair, just, and (a) non-discriminatory business environment,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning told a press briefing last Friday when asked about the Newport Wafer order. “The UK has overstretched the concept of national security and abused state power.”\n\nZhao Lijian, another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, called on Germany and other countries to “refrain from politicizing normal economic and trade cooperation” at a press conference earlier this month, without addressing Elmos specifically.\n\nGermany has shown greater scrutiny of Chinese buyers this year. Last month, a bid by Chinese state shipping giant Cosco for a stake in a Hamburg port terminal operator sparked similar controversy. Under pressure from some members of the government, the size of the investment was later limited.\n\nThe next battleground\n\nAttorneys say if the chipmakers appeal, they could face an uncertain battle that may drag on for years.\n\nIn each case, they would need to file a challenge in court within roughly a month of regulators’ decisions, barring exceptional circumstances, according to Norton Rose.\n\nBoth Britain and Germany have recently added rules that expand government oversight over such decisions, making outcomes harder to predict. In Germany, a change to foreign direct investment rules in 2020 meant the government can intervene in prospective deals “if there is a ‘probable impairment of public order and security,’” said Schaper.\n\nPreviously, by contrast, it could only impose restrictions “if there was an ‘actual, sufficiently serious threat to public order and security,’” he told CNN Business.\n\nIn the UK, the ability of the government to retroactively review deals under the NSI Act “was really something that was considered surprising and far-reaching,” said Andrea Hamilton, a London-based partner at Milbank.\n\n“If challenged, as Nexperia apparently intends, it will also become a test case as to [the] extent of the NSI Act’s limits,” she said.\n\nElsewhere, attention is shifting to the Netherlands. The Dutch government is currently facing pressure from the United States to limit exports to China, particularly from ASML (ASML), a semiconductor equipment maker that holds a dominant position in the lithography machine market, according to Lu at Eurasia Group.\n\n“It will become the next case study,” she told CNN Business.\n\nThe Netherlands has made clear it will form its own position.\n\nAsked about the issue this month, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade Liesje Schreinemacher said the country would “not copy the US export restrictions for China one-to-one.”\n\n“We make our own assessment,” she said in an interview with Dutch newspaper NRC.\n\n— CNN’s Zahid Mahmood, Rose Roobeek-Coppack and Laura He contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/dr-pepper-history/index.html", "title": "The soda market is flat, but not for Dr Pepper | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIn the pantheon of sodas, Dr Pepper is the odd one out: It doesn’t have the popularity or sales of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, you can’t use it in a standard cocktail, and it doesn’t fall neatly into a category like cola or root beer.\n\nFor decades, the peppery soda has marketed its blend of 23 flavors as a unique choice for discerning soda drinkers. Over the years Dr Pepper has found success as a quirky alternative to Coke and Pepsi.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is hardly a scrappy underdog — it’s the hero brand in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) which, along with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP), make up the three largest soda companies in the $37 billion US market, as measured by NielsenIQ in retail and convenience stores.\n\nAnd recently, Dr Pepper has been gaining ground on its competitors, even as the overall soda market goes flat.\n\nKeurig Dr Pepper is the third-largest soda maker in the country. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper soda grew its dollar share by 9% from 2003 to 2021, compared to a 26% drop in the carbonated soft drinks category overall, according to Keurig Dr Pepper, citing IRI and the Beverage Digest factbook. Today, Dr Pepper is the fourth most popular soda in the country after Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, carbonated soft drinks have been declining in volume,” said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. “One of the bright spots … has been Dr Pepper.”\n\nFounded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper was the first in a wave of 19th-century upstart soda companies. (It dropped the period in the 1950s for design reasons.) The little brand rose to prominence in the latter half of the 20th century and helped shape the soda industry, all while cultivating its reputation as an outsider.\n\nThe early days of Dr Pepper\n\nThe drink was invented by Charles Alderton, a pharmacist at a drug store owned by Wade Morrison, who is credited with patenting the drink and naming it.\n\nLegend has it that Morrison named the beverage after one Charles Pepper, the father of a woman he loved, hoping that the gesture would facilitate a match. That’s the tale on the Dr Pepper website. But Joy Summar-Smith, associate director of the Dr Pepper Museum in Waco, said there are several origin stories, and this one doesn’t hold up.\n\n“By the time [Morrison] came across Dr. Pepper he was married and he had a son,” said Summar-Smith.\n\nCoca-Cola was created in 1886. Pepsi was invented in the 1890s, but got its name in 1898.\n\n“The soft drink industry itself, as a whole, was still really trying to figure itself out in the late 1800s, early 1900s,” Summar-Smith said. “Each town had their own soft drink manufacturing facility.”\n\nCoca-Cola established itself most quickly, aided by its invention of the coupon, which offered free samples of its new beverage. Pepsi positioned itself as a less expensive competitor to Coke.\n\nAds for Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola on a store in North Carolina, in April 1938. John Vachon/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nWhile Coke and Pepsi were making waves, Dr Pepper “just didn’t push it that hard,” said Tristan Donovan, author of “Fizz: How Soda Shook Up the World.”\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Dr Pepper encouraged customers to drink a Dr Pepper three times a day, at around 10 a.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., to keep their energy up. While successful, the campaign never focused on the product’s unique, non-cola flavor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Dr Pepper branded itself “the friendly Pepper-Upper,” once again focusing on the rush of energy you could get from any can of soda.\n\nThen, everything changed.\n\nNot a cola\n\nIn the early 20th century, national bottlers that worked with with Coke or Pepsi shied away from Dr Pepper, fearing they would run afoul of agreements that barred them from partnering with a competitor. As a result, Dr Pepper had little national distribution, focusing primarily on Texas and nearby states.\n\nIn the 1960s, PepsiCo sued Dr Pepper for trademark infringement. Dr Pepper countered, accusing Pepsi of denying the beverage entry to its distribution platform. In 1963, a judge ruled for the bottler, opening the door to the product’s national expansion.​​\n\nDr Pepper “pulled off a legal coup that gave it the necessary leg up: It argued effectively in a US District Court that Dr Pepper was not a cola,” a 1984 article in D Magazine explained. Or as the Federal Trade Commission put it, “the suit opened up PepsiCo and Coca-Cola bottlers to Dr Pepper and its sales rose immediately.”\n\nWith new-found access to the whole country, the brand “started promoting [itself] much more heavily,” said Donovan, the author of “Fizz.”\n\nThrough the 1970s, Dr Pepper marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor, a shift that D Magazine said “fleshed out an identity for Dr Pepper that may be its most formidable asset.” In 1977, the company launched its “Be a Pepper” campaign, encouraging people to identify as Dr Pepper drinkers.\n\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" campaign ran from 1977 to 1983. Courtesy Keurig Dr Pepper\n\nToday, Dr Pepper advertises itself as a treat, using a pint-sized mascot called Lil’ Sweet in its commercials. Another campaign, Fanville, is set in a fictionalized world where people are obsessed with college football and also Dr Pepper, positioning the beverage as a cult favorite.\n\nAfter Dr Pepper established itself as an alternative to mainstream colas, it launched on a path that ultimately made it part of the country’s third-largest soft drink maker, Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nDr Pepper hits the scene\n\nDuring the wave of mega-mergers in the 1980s, Coca-Cola tried to scoop up Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 1986, soon after PepsiCo announced its intention to purchase 7Up, Coca-Cola said it had agreed to acquire Dr Pepper. The plans would have made Coke and Pepsi the most formidable players in the market by far, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time.\n\nBut both Coke’s and Pepsi’s deals were blocked, as the FTC decided the beverages were similar enough to pose a possible antitrust threat.\n\nA whirlwind series of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs ensued. Dr Pepper and 7Up merged in the late 1980s. Over the years, Cadbury Schweppes took stakes in the combined company and, eventually, full ownership of the brands. In 2008 Cadbury spun off its North American beverage division to create the Dr Pepper Snapple Group. A decade later, Keurig Green Mountain merged with that company, creating Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\nBottles of Dr. Pepper move down a production line at the Swire Coca-Cola bottling plant in Utah. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDr Pepper, soda giant\n\nToday, KDP still trails behind Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but it’s narrowing the gap.\n\nBy volume, Coca-Cola controlled about 40% of the US retail market in the first nine months of 2022, followed by PepsiCo with about 29% and Keurig Dr Pepper with roughly 25%, according to Beverage Digest’s data.\n\nCompared to the year before, PepsiCo’s share fell by 1%, while Keurig Dr Pepper’s ticked up. And over the years, the Dr Pepper brand has been gaining momentum while some of its competitors struggle. That might be because of consumers’ increasing interest in flavored soft drinks, said Stanford, the publication’s editor.\n\nThere are other advantages to existing outside of the cola dichotomy. Food-service providers typically have an agreement with either Coke or Pepsi for its soda fountains, and one fountain won’t feature products made by the other. But the fountains often offer Dr Pepper, making it a widely available choice.\n\n“Dr Pepper is the number one most differentiated trademark in beverage — not just soft drinks, but in beverage,” said Derek Dabrowski, general manager of juices, mixers and sauces at KDP. People reach for Dr Pepper when they want a treat, he added.

There wasn’t some magic burst of consolidation in the last month or the last quarter. That’s not what’s going on.”\n\nClark, the first woman to lead America’s largest business lobbying group, instead blames the 40-year high in inflation on a series of other forces unrelated to corporate concentration.\n\n“We know what’s happening. We know there’s a worker shortage driving wages up. We know there’s an energy shortage. There’s a housing shortage,” Clark said.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce CEO argued there are meaningful steps that could be taken to help ease the pressure on prices, including lifting tariffs, boosting legal immigration and focusing on domestic energy production.\n\n“There’s real work we could do, or we could keep politicizing it,” Clark said.\n\nOf course, the Chamber of Commerce represents some major businesses that have benefited from the same corporate power issues that Warren has flagged.\n\nElizabeth Warren responds\n\nWarren, a Massachusetts Democrat, has repeatedly warned that concentrated corporate power has helped create conditions for price gouging.\n\nWarren responded to the Chamber of Commerce CEO’s comments by pointing out that more than 75% of US industries, from agriculture to healthcare, have less competition than 20 years ago.\n\n“Giant corporations are taking advantage of supply chain challenges to jack up prices and pad their profits,” Warren told CNN through a spokesperson.\n\nThe Democrat cited a study from progressive think tank Economic Policy Institute that found fatter corporate profit margins have driven more than half of price increases since 2020.\n\n“The American people know that big businesses and Washington lobbyists are putting profits above families,” Warren said, “and I’m fighting every day to lower costs for working people by cracking down on price gouging and breaking up corporate monopolies.”\n\nA White House official told CNN that corporate concentration is a “decades-old issue” and no one in the administration is saying it is the central driver of today’s inflation. The official said President Joe Biden plans to say in a speech on Tuesday the two central causes of inflation are the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\n“But that doesn’t mean that large corporations should be let off the hook for anti-competitive practices that have driven prices up over a long period of time,” the White House official said, pointing specifically to prescription drugs, hearing aids, internet bills and shipping costs. “At the very least, corporations earning record profits while raising prices should pay their fair share in taxes.”\n\nPricey childcare and the worker shortage\n\nMeanwhile, the shortage of workers continues to be a major concern for both business leaders and politicians.\n\nThe Labor Department said last week that the number of job openings in the United States rose to 11.5 million in March, the highest level since tracking began in December 2000.\n\n“This is the key issue that every CEO in America is talking about,” Clark said, adding that the worker shortage is at the heart of inflation and the supply chain mess.\n\nThe worker shortage is being driven by a confluence of factors, including Covid-related problems, early retirements and high childcare costs.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce has called for states to use American Rescue Plan funds to help parents with childcare costs.\n\n“It’s a really complicated issue that is keeping moms and dads out of the market. And too often, that burden falls to the women,” Clark said. “We have got to do everything we can to get people off the sidelines and working again.”\n\nBuild Back Better and Roe v. Wade\n\nThe Biden administration’s stalled Build Back Better Plan calls for the largest investment in childcare in US history. The plan’s framework proposed ensuring that middle-class families pay no more than 7% of their income on childcare.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce helped lead the fight against passage of Build Back Better, warning tax hikes would hurt the economy.\n\nAsked if the Chamber would support Build Back Better’s childcare proposals on a standalone basis, Clark was noncommittal.\n\n“We would look at it,” she said. “We don’t like the big reconciliation tax-and-spending spree, everything in the Christmas tree, packages. But no doubt there are some proposals in there that are worthy of real debate and real discussion.”\n\nBeyond childcare, Clark called for the United States to ramp up legal immigration to provide an influx of workers that companies need right now.\n\n“We can secure our borders, like every great nation does, and increase legal immigration,” she said. “The loud voices that are pretending in this debate that these are binary choices are just not right.”\n\nHowever, Clark declined to weigh in on another issue facing the workforce: a potential abortion ban if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\n\n“It’s not something we’ve ever taken a position on,” Clark said, adding that she does not have a personal view on the controversial issue.\n\nAsked about pledges from Amazon, Salesforce, Uber and other companies to cover employees’ travel costs to seek abortion care, Clark simply said, “Every company’s got to make their own decisions.”\n\nBiden’s ‘mixed’ economic track record\n\nThe economy continues to drag down President Joe Biden’s poll numbers.\n\nJust 34% of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, according to a CNN poll released last week.\n\nClark declined to give Biden a letter grade on the economy, instead describing his impact as a “mixed bag.”\n\nOn the positive side, Clark praised the Biden’s efforts to enact bipartisan infrastructure legislation, an achievement former President Donald Trump tried and failed to attain. And she spoke highly of the open dialogue between the US Chamber and the White House.\n\n“We have a respectful relationship. They call us, we call them. We meet with them a great deal,” Clark said. “When we disagree, we don’t surprise each other. We’re pretty upfront about what’s working and what isn’t.”\n\nClark singled out Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and National Economic Council director Brian Deese as Biden officials who have been very open to conversations, even when they don’t agree.\n\n‘That’s scary’\n\nHowever, Clark expressed concern about what she described as the Biden administration’s “overregulation.” She specifically flagged comments from Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, who in September said her agency’s job is to “shape the distribution of power and opportunity across our economy.”\n\n“That’s scary. We believe in the free market, not government-driven solutions,” Clark said.\n\nAnd Clark urged the Biden administration to pursue a “bolder” trade agenda.\n\n“The fact that we can’t get a US-UK trade deal done seems silly,” she said. “It just puts our families and our communities at a disadvantage and it doesn’t help our allies.”\n\nDespite his attacks on big business, January 6th insurrection and the US-China trade war, Clark said Trump was “largely” pro-business.\n\n“There’s a lot of credit to be given on deregulation and the tax agenda. Those are always very high on job creators’ minds,” Clark said.\n\nLawsuits to block Biden?\n\nLooking ahead, the Chamber of Commerce CEO signaled the group is preparing for further battles with the White House in case the midterm election brings gridlock back to Washington.\n\nClark suggested that if Republicans retake one or both chambers of Congress, the Biden administration may be tempted to lean more into executive orders.\n\n“Business has to be ready to use litigation and other means to reign them in,” Clark said, “to make sure they’re not exceeding their constitutional authority.”", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/tech/microsoft-activision-blizzard-ftc-antitrust/index.html", "title": "Microsoft's blockbuster Activision Blizzard deal could raise ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIt has been about two decades since Microsoft and the US government went head-to-head in one of the country’s biggest-ever antitrust battles. In the years since, Microsoft has managed to mostly stay off the radars of lawmakers and antitrust regulators, even as scrutiny of other tech giants has ramped up.\n\nBut with its plan to acquire popular video game developer Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for nearly $70 billion, Microsoft (MSFT) may be thrust firmly back into the antitrust spotlight. The blockbuster deal would secure Microsoft (MSFT)’s spot among the most dominant global players in gaming alongside Sony and Tencent, and it would expand the tech company’s first-party content library to include some of the most popular titles in gaming, including “World of Warcraft” and “Call of Duty.”\n\nIndustry watchers say it’s a risky time for Microsoft to try to push through what would be the largest acquisition in its history. The head of the nation’s antitrust enforcement agency, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, has pledged to crack down on companies consolidating power and reducing competition in a range of industries, especially technology. Activision Blizzard’s stock is currently trading nearly 15% below the acquisition share price, a possible sign of investor skepticism about the deal going through.\n\nStill, Microsoft isn’t the only one who faces a risk if the FTC does decide to challenge the deal. It could also present some uncomfortable challenges for Khan and the agency by highlighting limitations in their ability to tackle a new era of potential antitrust issues raised by the tech industry.\n\nIn her first six months leading the FTC, Khan laid out an ambitious agenda that involves pushing sweeping reforms to the practice of antitrust law and being more proactive about blocking potentially anticompetitive mergers before they’re completed. Her plans have been bolstered by support from the White House and bipartisan agreement among lawmakers about the need to rein in massive tech firms.\n\nChallenging the Microsoft-Activision deal could be a chance for Khan to prove she’s serious about taking action. However, there remain serious legal hurdles to the FTC actually winning such a lawsuit (should it decide to bring one) — namely that the law itself is slow to change, and the existing rules and practice may not be enough to block even such a large acquisition.\n\nBoth antitrust experts and the FTC itself have also noted that the agency is short on resources, especially compared to large tech companies. And it’s unclear whether Khan will want to spend those limited resources on Microsoft and the gaming industry — or, for that matter, to make it one of her first new antitrust fights against Big Tech — rather than focus on some of the other ways tech companies have potentially consolidated markets. For example, Khan’s FTC is moving forward with a Trump-era suit to unwind Facebook’s years-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and it is also reportedly engaged in an extended review of Amazon’s acquisition of movie studio MGM.\n\nIt’s still early in the process. Microsoft filed formal paperwork with the FTC to kickstart the merger review process and delivered an initial briefing to FTC staff earlier this month. The agency’s review process could take months. But antitrust experts say Microsoft’s nearly $70 billion bid for Activision will be hard for the FTC to ignore.\n\nA deal of this size “is almost a challenge to Lina Khan to kind of bring it on,” Hal Singer, managing director at economics research firm Econ One and a professor at Georgetown Business School, told CNN Business. “She’s trying to push back and slow down the train, and this is basically the tech sector just saying, ‘You can’t stop us.’”\n\nThe FTC typically does not discuss deals under review and did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Microsoft pointed CNN Business to comments from President Brad Smith — who was the company’s general counsel during its last antitrust battle — in a recent briefing with reporters, where he said it “is so early in the process that we’re not yet at a point where we’re getting any real feedback [from the FTC]. We wouldn’t expect to yet.”\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella also commented on the deal during the briefing, saying: “We want to compete … I want us to approach this in a principled way where we are building our platforms, our technology, such that we are on the right side of history.”\n\nWith its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft will add some of the most popular titles in gaming, including \"Call of Duty,\" to its first-party content portfolio. Activision Blizzard\n\nEvaluating the Microsoft deal\n\nAt the heart of regulators’ evaluation of any merger is the question of how much the deal could reduce competition, and therefore threaten to raise prices for consumers or cause other harms.\n\nThere are a few ways to approach this: Because Microsoft, like Activision Blizzard, designs some of its own games, it’s possible that the deal could be considered a “horizontal merger,” the term for when one company is acquired by a direct competitor, effectively consolidating the market. But because there’s significant competition in the game development space, regulators are less likely to be concerned about this aspect of the deal, antitrust experts say.\n\nIf the FTC does decide to challenge the deal, it will likely instead be on the grounds that it is an anticompetitive “vertical merger.” A vertical merger is one in which one company (think, Microsoft, which creates gaming platforms and consoles) acquires another company in the same industry but a different part of the supply chain (like Activision Blizzard, which makes the games to play on those platforms).\n\nThat’s where things could start to get tricky for the FTC. It can be harder to prove potential harms from a vertical merger than from a horizontal merger because the economics are more complex, according to Daniel Crane, a law professor and antitrust expert at the University of Michigan. In a horizontal merger, two competitors become one competitor, making it more apparent how overall competition in the market is reduced. But in a vertical merger, the end result is less straightforward. (There have also been fewer challenges to vertical mergers over the past few decades, which would mean less legal precedent to rely on in court.)\n\nIn a vertical merger case against Microsoft, regulators would look at whether the deal could result in the denial of a crucial product to competitors that would impede their ability to compete effectively. In this case, that would likely mean looking at whether Microsoft could make existing or future games developed by Activision Blizzard exclusive to its platform, to the detriment of rivals like Sony.\n\nIn theory, that proposition is part of what makes the deal attractive. Microsoft has been trying to drive a growing slate of content into its Game Pass subscription offering to attract new users and keep existing ones paying for the membership, said Forrester analyst Will McKeon-Wright. (Microsoft has suggested it won’t make Activision content exclusive to its own platforms, although the company could still profit from licensing deals with competitors’ platforms.)\n\nMuch of the antitrust argument could come down to how you define the market. Regulators would likely want to focus on a smaller market — game consoles, for example — where it could contend that Microsoft is a dominating force. The company, meanwhile, would likely argue that it competes for consumers’ attention with a broader collection of companies, such as Netflix and TikTok.\n\n“There might be something in the Activision portfolio, that by denying it to a rival gaming platform, Microsoft could cripple that rival platform,” Singer said. If there is, regulators may reasonably be able to make the case that consumers could expect higher prices from the deal.\n\nStill, “the chances for the government, under the current state of the law, are very low for stopping a vertical merger,” Singer said. The failed challenge to the AT&T-Time Warner merger in 2018 is one of the only recent examples of litigation over a vertical merger. (Time Warner, which later rebranded as WarnerMedia, is CNN’s parent company.)\n\n“If I’m Microsoft and I’m looking at this kind of a deal, I think I’m expecting pushback from the FTC and possibly litigation,” Crane said. “But I’m also feeling pretty good about my chances.”\n\nChallenging the Microsoft-Activision deal could be a chance for FTC Chair Lina Khan to prove she's serious about her ambitious agenda. But such a challenge wouldn't be a surefire success. Graeme Jennings/Pool/AP\n\nThe challenge for the FTC\n\nThat’s where Khan’s plans to overhaul the country’s approach to antitrust come into play. For the past several decades, antitrust regulators have focused chiefly on the potential for mergers to raise prices for consumers. Now, Khan, who has been concerned about vertical mergers since before starting at the FTC, is proposing a broader framework for how to think about the possible harms from mergers and corporate consolidation, such as the impact on workers in the affected industry.\n\nTo that end, the FTC in September withdrew guidelines for evaluating vertical mergers that the agency released during the Trump administration, and is now working with the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to review whether to release updated guidelines that reflect technological and economic changes in recent years. That update could include giving regulators more leeway to consider whether a merger might “tend to create a monopoly,” even in its early stages, the agencies said.\n\nThe review is being made, at least in part, with an eye toward better regulating the tech companies, who have defended mergers and their growing power by pointing to the many free products and services they provide to consumers.\n\nWhile the guidelines are not legally binding, the fact that there currently are none for a court to refer to may mean that the FTC is not yet ready to come out swinging with a challenge to the Microsoft-Activision deal. “You want that thing in your hand when you go in to challenge this deal, you really don’t want to go in without it,” Singer said of the FTC.\n\nBut it’s unlikely that those revised guidelines, the public comment period for which began last month, will be ready in time for a potential case against the Microsoft deal. Even if the new guidelines were released during litigation, “you know what Microsoft’s going to say, they’re going to say, ‘they wrote these guidelines with us in mind,’” Crane said. (The FTC could wait to take action, as it has shown that it’s willing to revisit mergers even years after the fact with its lawsuit seeking to break up Facebook, but Khan has indicated a desire to challenge potentially anticompetitive deals before they go through.)\n\nIn the end, the acquisition could end up closing with a consent decree, a settlement where the acquiring company agrees to make some concessions to complete the deal, as many other vertical mergers have in recent decades. Microsoft has already hinted at its willingness to negotiate and play nice with competitors to help ensure the deal goes through. Shortly after the deal was announced, Microsoft’s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, tweeted that he had spoken with leaders at Sony.\n\n“I confirmed our intent to honor all existing agreements upon acquisition of Activision Blizzard and our desire to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation,” Spencer said. “Sony is an important part of our industry, and we value our relationship.”\n\nAnd last week, the company made a more detailed appeal to regulators to bless the deal. It promised to ensure that the popular franchises it acquires from Activision Blizzard will remain available on PlayStation under Activision’s existing deal with Sony. The company also said it has offered to extend the deal on a “multiyear basis.” Activision’s existing deal with Sony runs until 2024.\n\n“I would be very surprised if Microsoft wasn’t willing to make a number of concessions to get this deal done. The question is whether that would be acceptable,” Crane said. “[The FTC] want to be seen as active and doing things and really changing the status quo in antitrust.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/politics/abortion-laws-red-states-republicans/index.html", "title": "Why the Republican offensive on abortion is escalating | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen three red states finalized severe restrictions on abortion over consecutive days last week, they highlighted the GOP’s rising militancy on the issue – and the political and legal calculations underpinning it.\n\nSeparate actions last week in Oklahoma, Florida and Kentucky made clear the red state drive to retrench, or eliminate, access to abortion is escalating as the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority nears a decision, expected in late June, in which it is widely anticipated to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.\n\nThe abortion restrictions these states approved last week all denied exceptions for victims of rape or incest – a provision that was once a common feature of conservative anti-abortion proposals but has been jettisoned almost completely in the wave of new restrictions approved since 2021. The Oklahoma legislation banned nearly all abortions from the moment of conception and imposed severe penalties on doctors who perform them, including up to 10 years in jail. The Kentucky bill, continuing an offensive already underway in several other red states, prohibited state residents from obtaining medication abortion through the mail, as the federal Food and Drug Administration authorized late last year.\n\nTaken together, the sweeping bills finalized last week show how the sympathetic signals from the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority are changing the strategy of red states. In earlier legislative sessions, Republican-controlled states generally had either passed abortion restrictions designed to provide a test case the Supreme Court could use to overturn Roe or had approved bills crafted narrowly enough that they hoped they could survive legal challenges while Roe remained the law, says Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor who studies the history of abortion law.\n\nWe are seeing this pattern because the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has signaled that it is ready to reverse Roe. Now, we are getting a sense of what red states really want to do when Roe is gone. That is why we are seeing bans from fertilization – as in Oklahoma – and laws that focus on abortion pills, which will be crucial in determining whether bans will be effective. Mary Ziegler, Florida State University law professor\n\nBut after former President Donald Trump’s appointments of Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett established a clear conservative majority on the court – and particularly since that majority signaled during last year’s hearing on a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban that it is inclined to retrench or entirely scrap Roe – the red states are removing the veils to more clearly indicate where they will take the law if the court allows them.\n\n“We are seeing this pattern because the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has signaled that it is ready to reverse Roe,” Ziegler told me in an email. “Now, we are getting a sense of what red states really want to do when Roe is gone. That is why we are seeing bans from fertilization – as in Oklahoma – and laws that focus on abortion pills, which will be crucial in determining whether bans will be effective.”\n\nAll of this is coming even as a January CNN survey conducted by SSRS found that more than two-thirds of Americans oppose the court overturning Roe v. Wade. Abortion restrictions routinely draw broader support in red states, but even in them, a 2018 state-level analysis by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute shared with CNN found that in most cases, a majority of residents do not want to completely ban abortion – despite the fact that several states have passed “trigger” bans to do so if the Supreme Court allows it.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the severe abortion restrictions rapidly proliferating in red states represent a bet from the Republicans controlling them that they can satisfy the demands of their most ardent base supporters without facing any consequences among more centrist voters in their coalition who are uneasy, or outright opposed, to the new limits. Across the red states, Republicans are placing a similar wager on the broad wave of other bills they have approved in rapid-fire succession since 2020 to limit transgender rights, censor classroom discussion of race, gender and sexual orientation and ban certain books.\n\nIf that bet pays off, and red state Republicans suffer no midterm defections over this surge of socially conservative legislation – an outcome that may be the most likely possibility amid the extensive public discontent over President Joe Biden’s performance – pressure inside the party to lurch policy further to the right will only intensify, not only on abortion, but also on the broad range of cultural issues energizing conservative activists.\n\nA rising tide of legislation\n\nEven amid the increasing red-state focus on the issue since 2021, last week’s activity constituted a kind of crescendo. On Tuesday, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed one of the nation’s most sweeping bans, which bars almost all abortions, denies exceptions for rape and incest and imposes felony penalties, including up to 10 years in prison, on doctors who perform or attempt to perform the procedure. On Wednesday, the Republican-controlled Kentucky state legislature overrode a veto from the state’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, to approve legislation that bans abortion after 15 weeks also without exceptions for rape and incest, prohibits the distribution of abortion pills through the mail and imposes so many restrictions on abortion clinics that neither of Kentucky’s two facilities is expected to continue operating in the state. Then on Thursday, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law that state’s 15-week abortion ban, which also contains no exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nThese hardline bills continue the clear pattern of the past two years. Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank supporting reproductive rights, says that since 2021, 12 Republican-controlled states have passed laws restricting or banning abortion. Of those, she says, only the new limits approved in Idaho, South Carolina and Wyoming preserve some exemptions for victims of rape and incest.\n\nThe removal of exceptions for rape and incest in the new state laws represents only one of the ways in which red states are escalating their campaign against abortion. Since 2021, seven Republican-controlled states have banned distribution of medication abortion through the mail, despite the FDA ruling. Texas, in another case that’s reached the Supreme Court, last year created a “vigilante” lawsuit system that authorizes private litigation against anyone who assists or provides an abortion (although not the woman herself) after cardiac activity can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Idaho has incorporated a similar approach into its “heartbeat” abortion ban as well.\n\nIt is critical that Democrats take this radicalization we are witnessing and make it into a kitchen table issue. That has to be part of the discourse with the American people this year in order to make this into a competitive election, because it is the single most important thing happening in our politics. Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN\n\nMore states may follow before this legislative season ends. Republican-controlled legislatures in Ohio and Louisiana may advance new abortion bans, with further action under discussion but less likely in Alabama, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, Nash says. Separately, Missouri, Tennessee and Ohio may bar residents from obtaining medication abortion solely through the mail. Oklahoma could also supplement the ban Stitt signed last week with several additional measures, including a bill authorizing Texas-style private lawsuits (which are also under discussion, if less imminently, in Ohio and Louisiana).\n\nRed states are also discussing ways to extend the reach of their restrictions beyond their borders. A Republican state legislator in Missouri has proposed to authorize lawsuits against people in other states who help a state resident obtain an abortion. After Citibank indicated it would pay expenses for Texas employees who traveled out of state to obtain abortions, a Republican Texas state legislator last month threatened to introduce legislation barring companies that did so from local government contracts.\n\nThis increasingly confrontational posture toward abortion in red states tracks with the GOP’s trajectory on other social issues. Republican-controlled states have also moved toward more militant positions on LGBTQ issues, not only banning transgender women and girls from school sports, but also initiating child abuse investigations against parents (Texas) and criminal penalties against medical professionals (Alabama) who provide gender-affirming treatment for transgender minors. A broad red-state push to limit how race and gender are discussed in public school classrooms has spilled over to new measures to restrict how teachers talk about sexual identity and orientation (such as the Florida legislation critics call the “don’t say gay” bill, which DeSantis recently signed into law), and proposals to make it easier to ban books they don’t approve of not only in school libraries, but also in public ones.\n\nDemocrats struggling to respond\n\nOn every front, ideas that once might have been considered on the fringe inside the GOP have moved rapidly into law – and, in most instances, inspired copy-cat proposals in other states. Democrats have struggled to respond to this offensive, both at the state and national level. In Washington, the House of Representatives has passed legislation that would codify a national right to abortion and undo many states’ moves against transgender youth, but Republican-led filibusters have blocked those proposals in the Senate (along with the House-passed bill that would override the voting restrictions many of these same red states have approved). And though state Democrats have voted almost en masse against these policies, as well as the voting restrictions, the party has been divided over how much to stress its opposition to them in the midterm elections – frustrating some party strategists in the process.\n\n“It is critical that Democrats take this radicalization we are witnessing and make it into a kitchen table issue,” says Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a Democratic research and advocacy group. “That has to be part of the discourse with the American people this year in order to make this into a competitive election, because it is the single most important thing happening in our politics.”\n\nOf all the socially conservative causes Republicans are advancing in the red states, abortion is probably the issue Democrats feel most comfortable contesting. As CNN recently reported, with the Supreme Court decision approaching, a wide array of Democratic candidates are stressing their commitment to preserving abortion rights.\n\n“I do think they are overplaying their hand electorally, because November could be the first election we’ve had in decades when Roe is not the law of the land, and I think the backlash will be very swift and severe,” says Christina Polizzi, press secretary for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nPolls have consistently found that a solid majority of Americans oppose overturning Roe – with that resistance extending well into the Republican coalition. In the January CNN survey, not only did 69% of all adults oppose ending the constitutional right to abortion, so did 43% of Republican men and a striking 47% of Republican women, according to detailed results provided by the CNN polling team. In a follow-up question, nearly three-fifths of all adults said that if the Supreme Court did overturn Roe, they wanted their states to make their abortion laws more permissive, while only 40% wanted them more restrictive. About one-third of both Republican men and women joined the majority who preferred that state laws become more permissive.\n\nSupport for abortion restrictions, not surprisingly, is greater in red-leaning states, whose populations typically include more of the White evangelical Christians who compose the core of the social conservative movement. When the Public Religion Research Institute tabulated state-by-state abortion attitudes in a massive 2018 poll, it found that majorities in Mississippi, Idaho and Arkansas – states that have imposed some of the latest restrictions – said it should be illegal in all or most cases, according to results provided by the institute’s research director, Natalie Jackson. But clear majorities said it should be legal in all or most cases in Florida and Arizona, where Republicans have passed new restrictions, and slight pluralities echoed that position in Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma – three other states where Republican officials have voted to limit access.\n\nMore recent surveys have also found unease with the restrictions. Nearly 3 in 5 Florida voters opposed the state’s 15-week abortion ban in a University of North Florida poll earlier this year. (Half of those polled were told that the bill offered no exceptions for rape and incest – and only 51% of even Republican voters who were given that information backed the ban.)\n\nIn Texas, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey has found state residents split almost exactly in half over the fetal heartbeat abortion ban but a clear majority opposed to the separate “trigger” bill the legislature approved to ban all abortions if the Supreme Court allows it. Other UT polls have found that fewer than about 1 in 8 Texas residents want to ban abortion without those exceptions for rape, incest and the woman’s health, and a solid majority oppose the legislation authorizing private lawsuits against those involved in providing abortions. That opposition encompassed a significant portion of Republicans: two-fifths of Republican women and about one-third of Republican men said they opposed the absolute “trigger” ban and about one-third of Republicans opposed the private lawsuit bill.\n\nVoters’ reactions may be crucial\n\nThe future of the anti-abortion drive in red states – and the broader movement to roll back civil rights and liberties there – will likely pivot on how the Republican voters uneasy with these proposals respond to them. These polls show that in theory the sharp right turn on abortion and other social issues from red-state Republicans could fracture the electoral coalition that now allows them to dominate these states.\n\nBut in practice, many observers believe, Democrats face significant obstacles to peeling away many Republican-leaning voters unhappy over these issues, in the near term at least.\n\n“That 40% of Republican women may oppose banning abortion,” says James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, “but in a campaign situation” Republicans can overcome that hesitance by shifting those voters’ focus toward other issues where they disagree with Democrats.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, he says, the GOP’s odds of holding those voters are magnified by a midterm environment in which ordinarily Republican-leaning voters have so many objections to the performance of Biden and other Democrats, from inflation to immigration. “The environment shapes what you can get leverage on and what people will respond to, and it’s a very noisy environment right now,” Henson says.\n\nRed state Republicans broadly share that confidence. As Matt Mackowiak, an Austin-based GOP strategist, told me earlier this year, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s priorities.” Rather than losing suburban support over the right’s turn on abortion and other social issues, he predicted the Republican vote share will rise “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.” Republican Govs. Greg Abbott in Texas and DeSantis in Florida, who have pushed some of the most aggressive social conservative agendas, are considered strong favorites for reelection in November, and Tennessee GOP Gov. Bill Lee, who has matched them step for step, does not even have a serious Democratic opponent.\n\nTresa Undem, a Democratic pollster who focuses on issues relating to gender equality and politics, agrees that few Republican women who support abortion rights are likely to defect from the party coalition if the court overturns Roe. Her extensive surveys have found that the vast majority of them still share the broader unease with cultural change in American society that has energized the GOP coalition in the Trump era. “Republican women don’t vote on” abortion, she says.\n\nBut Undem thinks the situation could be very different among women who identify as independents. That’s especially likely, she thinks, if the Supreme Court’s ruling so unambiguously rescinds Roe that it generates sustained media coverage.\n\n“I think if it’s outright overturned, and this breaks through, people learn about, it will definitely affect independent women,” she says. “I keep going back in my mind to Texas. I was stunned; we did a focus group of independent women and they said things I have never heard. At least half the women said something like this: ‘I have never even really cared who the governor was of Texas, but my skin crawls thinking about the issue of (the private lawsuits Texas authorized against abortion providers).’ It’s the signal of all that other power and control that they think politicians have over their lives.”\n\nThe January CNN survey underscores that possibility: Fully three-fourths of women who identified as independents said they opposed overturning Roe. Yet with so many other challenges at this tumultuous moment in American life shaping voters’ attitudes, it’s far from clear that those concerns will translate into votes against the Republicans advancing those laws. Even many voters opposed to the abortion restrictions, Undem acknowledges, may calculate, “I don’t think I am going to need an abortion, but I am filling up my (gas) tank right now.”\n\nDani Thayer, left, and Marina Lanae, both of Tulsa, Oklahoma, protest at the state Capitol, Wednesday, April 13, 2022, in Oklahoma City. Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\nThe safest prediction may be that if Republican governors and state legislatures run well this November in the states moving so sharply to the right on abortion and other cultural issues, they will be emboldened to continue pushing the frontier of such legislation.\n\nThere are no signs the current round of targets represents the outer boundary of ambition for the social conservative movement or the red-state Republican officials responding to it. During the recent confirmation hearings for incoming Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, three Republican senators suggested the court had erred in previous decisions that prevented states from barring the sale of contraceptives or blocking interracial and same-sex marriages. The total abortion bans, prohibition on mail distribution of medication abortion, discussion of extending private lawsuits across state lines and punishment of companies that help employees obtain abortions outside states that are prohibiting them signal where red states may move next on that front.\n\nAll of which suggests that if voters don’t send a cautionary signal in November, the red-state drive may be just beginning to roll back the “rights revolution” of the past six decades – and return the US to a pre-1960s world in which people’s basic civil rights and liberties varied much more depending on where they lived.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/04/20/net-neutrality-repeal-prompts-calif-other-states-pursue-their-own-laws/529337002/", "title": "Net-neutrality is over.

Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, who sponsored the bill, in a statement.\n\nOregon has already passed its own. On April 10, Gov. Kate Brown signed into law a measure requiring state agencies only to do business with ISPs that do not block or slow traffic or accept payment to prioritize some data.\n\nAttorneys general in 23 states and the District of Columbia have filed a suit seeking to prevent the rules change, calling it \"arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.\"\n\nAll of this activity suggests Net neutrality could likely be an issue in the mid-term elections and perhaps even in the 2020 campaign cycle.\n\nIf so, that could be good news for politicians hoping to draft on the issue. Most citizens (86%) support Net neutrality, as defined by the 2015 rules, according to a new survey, released Wednesday by the non-partisan group Voice of the People, and conducted by the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland. It surveyed 997 registered voters in March.\n\nSupport for Net neutrality crosses party lines among voters with 90% of Democrats in favor and 82% of Republicans, the survey found. Support from Republicans has risen from 75% when a similar survey was conducted in December 2017.\n\nThat means a growing populace wants \"the Internet to work the way it's always worked,\" said Phillip Berenbroick, senior policy counsel for Public Knowledge, a non-profit group that has filed suit challenging the Federal Communication Commission's December overturning of the 2015 rules. \"And you have got a minority of folks here in Washington that currently have access to levers of power that are in disagreement with more than 80% of the American public. ... It’s baffling.\"\n\nTelecom giants, which lobbied for the Obama-era rules' repeal, can also get legislators' attention. Since 1989, the telecom industry, led by AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, has donated more than $100 million to sitting members of Congress and their leadership PACs, 55% of that to Republicans, according to a report in The Verge.\n\nMore:Washington state sticks it to the FCC, passes its own Net-neutrality rules\n\nMore:Burger King on net neutrality: Have it your way\n\nMore:Net neutrality rules are dead. Will my Internet bills go up?\n\nStill, in Congress some Net neutrality-supporting lawmakers hold out hope for an immediate resolution: a Congressional Review Act measure to reinstate the 2015 rules. There's enough support already in the U.S. Senate for a vote, and it must be done by June 20.\n\nThe likelihood of the Congress Review Act measure's success is slim, however. In the U.S. House, 160 Democrats are already on board for a vote that needs 218 signatures. But a CRA measure must also be approved by President Trump, an unlikely event since he appointed Ajit Pai, chairman of the FCC, and called the Obama-era rules a \"power grab.\"\n\nPaihas been shepherding through the repeal of the old rules and their replacement with the Restoring Internet Freedom order, a set of lighter-touch regulations. It was expected to officially take effect Monday but won't kick in for at least a few more weeks as it undergoes additional vetting by the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nIn reality, the FCC has already shifted its stance. Within a month of being appointed by Trump, Pai ended several Net neutrality-related investigations started by his predecessor, including the investigation of whether free data plans offered by wireless providers such as AT&T and Verizon violated the agency's regulations.\n\nThis has left the issue of Net neutrality in the hands of states and courts. The legal action by the state attorneys general — along with suits filed by groups such as Free Press and National Hispanic Media Coalition, and companies including Mozilla, Etsy and Vimeo — will begin going through the judicial process in the coming months.\n\nAlso happening in the states: several governors have passed executive orders requiring ISPs doing business with the state follow Net-neutrality conduct.\n\nCourt fight coming\n\nThese state initiatives could yield more court challenges, too. USTelecom, a trade group made of ISPs including AT&T and Verizon, has promised to sue to block Net-neutrality measures adopted by states such as Washington, the first to do so, \"to avoid a piecemeal, patchwork approach to the future of our internet,\" the group's CEO and president Jonathan Spalter said on the group's blog.\n\nA potential \"maze of competing rules\" could make broadband prices go up, confuse customers \"and diminish investment in the expansion of high-speed broadband infrastructure — which would disproportionally hurt rural and other traditionally underserved communities across the country,\" said Rob Tappan, spokesman for Broadband for America, an organization with members that include AT&T, CenturyLink, Charter, Comcast and Cox.\n\nBipartisan legislation is a better alternative, he says.\n\nBut legislation requires compromise and that has been elusive. Net-neutrality supporters want rules that prevent ISPs from block and slowing content, and from charging for fast lanes. ISPs have publicly agreed not to do any of that, but they oppose heavy-handed regulations.\n\n\"Nobody really wants to have broadband providers to have unfettered control, but when it’s spun as governmental overreach all of a sudden people start viewing it differently,\" said Marc Martin, an attorney in the communications practice at Washington, D.C.-based law firm Perkins Coie, and a former FCC staffer.\n\nAdmittedly, Net-neutrality laws legislated state-by-state \"would be extremely complex,\" said Jaime Fink, co-founder and chief technology officer at Mimosa Networks, a wireless broadband provider in Santa Clara, Calif. But the state initiatives could help generate support for a nationwide solution. \"There are still strong advocates for Net neutrality in Congress continuing to push for action at a federal level,\" he said.\n\nFast lanes may lose their stigma\n\nAmid those efforts, there's the possibility that fast lanes, or \"paid prioritization\" of content may eventually become fair game. \"Prioritization is not a dirty word,\" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., during a House subcommittee hearing on the issue this week. \"We need a better understanding of what specific harmful conduct we are trying to address, and a better understanding of how to leave the door open for the beneficial prioritization that’s necessary to keep the Internet as we know it working, and to bring even more benefits to consumers.\"\n\nA possible solution: within the federal legislation, create an independent tribunal to weigh Internet issues including competition and privacy involving ISPs and dominant tech platforms such as Facebook and Google.\n\nSuch a tribunal beyond the FCC or Federal Trade Commission would solve concerns about each agencies' enforcement powers, says economist Hal Singer at Adjunct Professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business, who has proposed the idea.\n\nAnd holding ISPs and big Internet players to similar standards would create a more equitable playing field, he says. \"What we want to do is de-politicize this process,\" Singer said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/20"}]}

Vance of Ohio.\n\nWhen it comes to the most common strategy, the balancing strategy, Harris could pick someone older and more liberal, such as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cassino said. Warren, a Rutgers Law School graduate, was for a brief spell the front-running candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nDNC 2024:When is the Democratic National Convention? Info on when and where\n\nIf the party wants to double down on Harris with a younger and more moderate Democrat, Cassino mentioned a few relatively well-known personalities. Julián Castro, the secretary of housing and urban development under former President Barack Obama fits the bill. Also in that category is Cory Booker, the U.S. senator from New Jersey. Another would be Pete Buttigieg, the current U.S. transportation secretary and former naval officer who rose to prominence during his campaign for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nStory continues below photo gallery.\n\nPossible 'swing states' VP candidates for Kamala Harris\n\nFinally, there are options from swing states.\n\n\"There's a perception, but not much data to support it, that a vice presidential candidate could help you win in a swing state,\" Cassino said.\n\nMore:What would happen if Biden or Trump drop out of presidential race? Who would run?\n\nIn that realm, Harris finds several more potential running mates, including the front-runner in Cassino's opinion: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. North Carolina's former attorney general, Cooper was elected governor in 2016 and reelected in 2020. Due to state term limits, he is unable to run this year and would be free to take on another role in 2025.\n\nCassino also mentioned U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, a former astronaut born in Orange, Stacey Abrams, a former candidate for Georgia governor, and the \"very well-liked governor of Pennsylvania,\" Josh Shapiro. Shapiro beat a Trump-backed candidate in Doug Mastriano in 2022, has bipartisan support and, like Cooper, has executive experience. However, Shapiro recently took office and party bosses may be loathe to remove him, Cassino said.\n\nNotable outliers for Dem VP candidate role\n\nSome other names being mentioned seem to have very slim odds, according to Cassino. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been positioning himself as an \"emergency candidate\" to replace Biden, Cassino said. He debated former candidate for the Republican presidential nomination Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier his year. However, due to the vagaries of Electoral College rules, either he or Harris would likely have to move out of California and establish residency in another state to be paired on the same ticket.\n\nOther names that may be eyeing a presidential run and would probably keep themselves out of the running for Harris' potential vice-president are Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Cassino said.\n\nRecent polls for Kamala Harris VP candidates\n\nA SurveyUSA/FairVote ranked choice poll in early July found initial first-choice votes for Harris' potential running mate were closely divided among likely Democrats and independent voters in six swing states. Of the 2,050 likely voters polled in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, 20% picked Buttigieg, 19% selected Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and 14% opted for Shapiro.\n\nWhitmer, who has been discussed as a potential presidential candidate for the Democrats, is another potential option for the swing state strategy, with Michigan expected to be crucial in the path to the presidency. Biden won the state in 2020 but has been trailing Trump in recent polls. The Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-women ticket in history.\n\nOther contenders are Senator Amy Klobuchar, Congressman Jamie Raskin and Pritzker, who each received 5% of the first-choice vote to be paired on the ballot with Harris. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Cooper both garnered 3%, while 4% of voters preferred Harris to run with someone else and 19% were unsure.\n\nFlashback:Kamala Harris' inauguration stirred joy, tears for these NJ women. Can she win again?\n\nIn a ranked choice poll for a Harris running mate, Buttigieg narrowly beat Whitmer 52% to 48%.\n\nThe poll also found Harris was the clear favorite to replace Joe Biden among likely Democrats and independent voters in those same six swing states. Results showed 37% ranked Harris their first choice to replace Biden and 56% ranked her in their top three.\n\nA separate poll conducted this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found adults have a more favorable opinion of Harris (43%) than both Biden (38%) and Trump (37%).\n\nCenter officials said 70% of the 1,253 adults polled said Biden should drop out of the race and allow his party to select a different candidate, while 57% said Trump should withdraw. Among Republicans, 26% said Trump should withdraw. Meanwhile, 65% of Democrats polled said Biden should drop out.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/01/kamala-harris-vice-president-running-mate-interviews/74613486007/", "title": "Harris interviewing VP finalists, decision coming in days", "text": "WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris and her vetting team are interviewing running-mate finalists as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee nears a decision for her pick of vice president by early next week, according to a source familiar with the process and multiple media reports.\n\nHarris' vetting team has already met in private with Pennsylvania Gov.

The list includes:\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper;\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer;\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro;\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona;\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz;\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker;\n\nand Cedric Richmond, a former congressman from Louisiana.\n\nWhile they have been vetted, Cooper and Whitmer have both said publicly they are not interested in the position.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\nShapiro, 51, is serving his first term as Pennsylvania governor after being elected in 2022, with his main accomplishment so far being his oversight of the reconstruction of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia.\n\nBefore becoming governor, Shapiro released a grand jury report outlining the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests, drafted critiques on the oil industry in the state and joined other states in reaching a multi-billion-dollar settlement with opioid companies while serving as Pennsylvania's attorney general.\n\nBefore that, the University of Rochester graduate served as a member of the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly of Arizona\n\nKelly has served in the U.S. Senate since winning a special election in 2020 after defeating Republican Martha McSally, who was appointed to the seat following the death of Sen. John McCain. He won reelection in 2022.\n\nBefore entering politics, the astronaut became a NASA Space Shuttle pilot in 1996 while logging a total of 54 days in space. Prior to his work with NASA, Kelly flew combat missions during the Gulf War as a naval aviator.\n\nHe founded the nonprofit Americans for Responsible Solutions after his wife, then-Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was shot and nearly killed in a deadly mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg, 42, has served as the country's transportation secretary under the Biden Administration since 2020.\n\nBefore his time in Washington, \"Mayor Pete\" served as South Bend, Indiana, mayor from 2012 to 2020 before making a run at the White House. His national profile increased in 2017 when he ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017 before dropping out.\n\nPrior to his political career, the Harvard graduate and University of Oxford Rhodes Scholar served as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve while being deployed to Afghanistan for seven months in 2014.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\nBeshear, 46, is among the youngest to be floated as a possible vice presidential pick for Harris. A governor in his second term, he served as Kentucky’s attorney general between 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe Democrat has remained a vocal supporter of Biden and told The Courier-Journal that he would only consider putting his name on a presidential ticket if he “could help the commonwealth even more through some other opportunity.”\n\nSince January, Beshear has traveled to out-of-state Democratic fundraisers at least five times, launching a PAC to support Democrats in red and purple states.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz\n\nA member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Walz was elected governor in 2018 and won re-election in 2022. His pre-political background includes military service and a career in education. Walz joined the Army National Guard after graduating high school and went on to teach and coach high school football. After he retired from the military in 2005, Walz represented Minnesota’s First Congressional District from 2006 to 2019.\n\nHe serves as the co-chair of the Democratic National Convention’s rules committee, which means he could play a key part in the nomination process ahead of the convention in August.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker\n\nA billionaire whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain is known for raking in millions for the Democratic party over the years, Pritzker has been the Illinois governor since 2019.\n\nPritzker, 59, was widely reported to have personally appealed to Biden on Chicago’s behalf to win the bid to host the DNC.\n\nWhere will Harris and her VP campaign?\n\nReuters first reported on next week's travel plans with Harris and her running-mate and said an announcement could come as early as Monday.\n\nHarris and her running-mate will make stops in Philadelphia, western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, Ga., Phoenix and Los Vegas, the campaign said.\n\nThe first stop on the four-day blitz will be Tuesday in Philadelphia, which could suggest Pennsylvania Gov.

Prepare for one of the most invasive reviews of your personal life in American politics.\n\nBefore they can be selected as a running mate, vice presidential contenders undergo a vetting process that seeks to unearth their darkest secrets − and even those of their family, friends and business partners.\n\n“It’s very intense,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was vetted as a potential running mate to former President Barack Obama in 2008 and again in 2016, when he was chosen to be the vice presidential candidate to Hillary Clinton.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., one of the eight Republicans vetted by former President Donald Trump this year, described it as a “pretty interesting” process that took “a deep dive into every decision in your life.”\n\nSeveral Democrats are going through that process right now, as Vice President Kamala Harris − after becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee last week − chooses a prospective vice president of her own.\n\nThe review can involve turning over financial and real estate records, dating histories, and even the passwords to social media accounts.\n\n\"It's not very pleasant. The truth is, none of us is a saint,\" said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato. \"We forget, they're human beings. And in fact, they're very, very human.\"\n\nGiven his experience with vetting, Kaine said colleagues who are about to undergo the process come to him for advice. It can be surprisingly thorough even to senators and governors, he said, who have already faced scrutiny in statewide races.\n\n“Everything about your life will be known,\" Kaine said.\n\nA short schedule and a short list\n\nFor Harris, the vetting process has been accelerated. While most campaigns have months to narrow down their options, she has had a little under two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and threw his support behind his vice president. A decision is expected by early next week.\n\nAt least seven Democrats have popped up on Harris' short list, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. However, Cooper pulled himself out of the running, citing concerns that his Republican Lieutenant Governor would challenge his authority while he is campaigning out of state, and Whitmer has said she plans to remain governor of Michigan until the end of her term in 2026.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s campaign requested vetting materials from vice presidential candidates at least six weeks before the Republican National Convention earlier this month when he announced his pick of Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.\n\nThose who have previously been through vetting told USA TODAY that the Harris campaign's process will likely have the same rigor, albeit focused on a smaller group of prospective candidates.\n\n“They assign a team of people to look at everything in your life – financial records, medical records, interview people you’ve worked with, interview friends and family and you multiple times,” Kaine said.\n\nPritzker, who has a net worth of around $3.5 billion as heir to the Hyatt family fortune, previously told USA TODAY that his assets wouldn't be a problem as he is vetted, despite lingering questions about potential conflicts of interests related to his independently-managed trusts.\n\n\"I've been fully vetted, because I've run for office now twice statewide in the fifth largest state in the country and done that successfully,\" he said. \"Everything's been transparent.\"\n\nWhy campaigns vet running mates\n\nThe goal of vetting is to avoid any last-minute surprises that can tank a campaign by unearthing any potential liabilities early on.\n\nHistory is full of cautionary tales, from vice presidents to Cabinet nominees.\n\nIn 1972, Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, George McGovern's running mate, dropped out of the race after media reports revealed he had been hospitalized and undergone electroshock therapy for depression. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, Zoë Baird, had to withdraw her nomination over a controversy that she had hired undocumented immigrants for childcare and did not pay taxes for their labor. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination in 2009 to lead the Department of Health and Human Services when it became clear he failed to report tens of thousands of dollars in charitable donations and consulting income on his taxes.\n\nThis time around, former Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the Harris campaign's vetting process along with former Biden White House General Counsel Dana Remus. Remus was part of the team that helped Biden pick Harris in 2020 and also led the vetting of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson when she went through Senate confirmation hearings in 2022.\n\nContacted by USA TODAY, the Harris campaign declined to comment on the extent of its vetting process. A spokesperson for the campaign confirmed the team is vetting potential candidates and said: “We do not expect to have additional updates until the Vice President announces who will be serving as her running mate.”\n\nSimultaneous tryouts\n\nVetting also includes an audition for the role of sidekick. “The other part of it is you just get out there and work. Whether it’s being a surrogate, whether that’s TV or rallies or at events, doing what you can to help the campaign financially raise money, all that stuff,” Donalds said.\n\nHe joked that pundits often compared Trump’s process for choosing a running mate to “The Apprentice,” the long-running reality TV show that made Trump a household name.\n\n“But in some aspects, it was like ‘The Apprentice,’” he said. “You kind of gotta do your thing and see what happens at the end.”\n\nSeveral of Harris’ potential running mates have appeared on the campaign trail in recent days.\n\nShapiro and Whitmer held a joint rally for Harris near Philadelphia Monday. Walz and Pritzker advocated for Harris on marquee Sunday news programs and have been a regular feature of the cable news circuit since Biden dropped out. Beshear spoke at the opening of a Harris campaign office in Georgia on Sunday.\n\nIn terms of boosting their chances, being a successful surrogate is one of the best things those potential candidates can do, said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a finalist to be Trump’s vice president in the 2016 election.\n\nGingrich’s advice for those being vetted now? “Go campaign, go on TV, and then you see what the polls say.”\n\nWant daily politics news in your inbox? Subscribe to USA TODAY's OnPolitics newsletter as we lead up to the presidential election.\n\n'Personal chemistry'\n\nNot every prospective vice presidential candidate finds vetting to be remarkably intense.\n\nGingrich said his vetting experience “wasn’t that big a deal” – especially considering his role as speaker and his own presidential run in 2012.\n\n“We’d been through all the various security clearances over the years, so we were used to producing material,\" Gingrich said.\n\nHe filled out reams of paperwork and sat through around two hours worth of questioning from the Trump campaign. Then he flew out to campaign in Cincinnati for a day with Trump, who he had already known for years.\n\nRegardless of what turns up in the vetting process, it usually comes down to how well the candidate and their potential running mate get along.\n\nWhile Harris’ team is likely to look at polling to see who might boost her chances in key states, said Kaine, “at the end of the day, it really is a personal chemistry call.”\n\nContributing: Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/08/02/kamala-harris-vp-offshore-betting-odds/74634307007/", "title": "Kamala Harris' VP pick becomes hot topic for offshore bettors", "text": "Most offshore bettors think Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will pick Josh Shapiro as her vice presidential running mate in the coming days.\n\nThe odds on Polymarket, a crypto-trading platform, swung squarely in favor of the 51-year-old Pennsylvania governor on Tuesday.

Read about all of Harris' potential running mates here.\n\nPros:\n\n◾ Shapiro has the highest gubernatorial rating of any Pennsylvania governor in decades, and he could prove to be important in delivering an electoral victory for Democrats in the must-win swing state.\n\n◾ The 51-year-old has gained national name recognition for his quick response to the 2023 Interstate 95 overpass collapse and, more recently, his leadership after the attempted assassination of Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n◾ His experience as the governor of a Rust Belt state and calls for unity after the Trump rally shooting may help Democrats counter Republican messaging that the party is divisive.\n\nHarris' VP options:From Josh Shapiro to Mark Kelly, sizing up the slate's pros and cons\n\nCons:\n\n◾ Shapiro has led Pennsylvania for two years and is politically inexperienced on the national stage.\n\n◾ Democrats risk the chance that a Republican could take control of the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion if he is picked and goes on to win the White House.\n\n◾ Shapiro isn’t likely to excite the party’s progressive base, especially given his moderate stance on the Israel-Hamas war. Shapiro has not called for a cease-fire but has expressed support for a two-state solution.\n\nContributing: Ramon Padilla, Karissa Waddick, Joey Garrison, James Powel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/08/04/harris-vice-president-pick-kelly-shapiro-walz-democrats/74637119007/", "title": "When will Harris pick her VP? Her choice needs to be a progressive", "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris is having a good month. She's leading former President Donald Trump in the polls after setting fundraising records, making appearances on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and taking over social media.\n\nShe's also close to making her decision on who will win the veepstakes. It's a decision that could continue her presidential campaign's momentum. Harris is supposed to announce her running mate before a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. There’s no official short list, but a handful of candidates across the country are in the process of being vetted.\n\nWhoever Harris picks will determine whether the campaign leans into her more progressive stances or tries to appeal to moderates in the party. As someone who wants to see the Dems move toward the future, I hope her eventual pick is someone with whom she can champion bold, progressive ideas.\n\nDemocrats are at an inflection point. If they really intend to move the party forward − and win over young, disaffected voters in the process − they can set themselves up for success in November. Given the enthusiasm she's earned over the past few weeks, I think it's time for the Democratic Party to embrace change and, for once, try something other than appealing to the middle.\n\nWe'll know soon enough what Harris wants.\n\nProgressives want Kamala Harris to pick Tim Walz\n\nFor progressive voters, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is someone to be excited about. It even seems that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is a fan.\n\nLast year, with a Democratic majority in both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature, Walz codified the right to abortion into law, signed off on universal free school meals, legalized recreational marijuana and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nNot to mention, he’s the one who started the recent phenomenon of calling Republicans “weird.”\n\nWho will Harris pick for VP?Republicans, pay attention to who Harris picks for VP. One of them should scare us.\n\nChoosing Walz would be an inspired choice that would solidify Harris’ standing with progressives, and his Midwestern sensibilities would be perfect for taking on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nHe’s also the strongest choice when it comes to abortion rights, an issue that the Harris campaign is putting at the forefront. If Harris picks Walz, it will signal to the rest of the party that the younger faction is determined to be more progressive than the current iteration of the party.\n\nAndy Beshear is a middle-of-the-road choice\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is another option that could take on Vance and mobilize a part of the country Democrats traditionally struggle with. Beshear has done what he could as a Democratic governor in a red state and won reelection by focusing on the abortion rights battle. Like Walz, he reinstated voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nWhile Beshear isn't where progressives want him to be on abortion − he often chooses to emphasize the most extreme reasons for needing one, and his lieutenant governor pick has described herself as pro-life − he proved that reproductive freedom is a winning issue for Democrats no matter the state.\n\nMark Kelly would complement Harris, but he isn't progressive enough\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is, according to multiple polls, the most well-known of Harris’ short list. The former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who suffered a head injury in a 2011 mass shooting, is a vocal supporter of commonsense gun laws. He’s also taken Trump to task over the failed bipartisan immigration reform bill from earlier this year.\n\nOn the other hand, Kelly failed to co-sponsor a crucial piece of legislation that would have made it easier for workers to unionize – that is, until he was added to the VP short list.\n\nOf all the candidates, Kelly is the one I’m most on the fence about. His strength on the border complements Harris’ shortfalls, but his failure to support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act is definitely disappointing. He’d be a fine choice, but not someone I’d be ecstatic over.\n\nTrump does love racism:Trump's lazy racism against Harris won't earn him votes. He already has racists in the bag.\n\nChoosing Josh Shapiro signals an attempt to compromise\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has been criticized for his response to the pro-Palestinian protests earlier this year.\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, has said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a “terrible leader” but has also compared some pro-Palestinian protesters to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nUnfortunately, those aren’t the only issues with the Pennsylvania governor. He’s also a supporter of school choice voucher programs – a traditionally conservative idea. He’s also been accused by some in his home state of staying silent on a sexual harassment investigation last year of a former aide.\n\nOn the other hand, Shapiro could help Democrats win Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states this election cycle. Picking him would be a sign that the party is still trying to appeal to centrists instead of being bold. As someone invested in this country's future, I would find that disappointing.\n\nThen there is the VP candidate who will never be ☹\n\nApropos of political leanings, I am still a little sad that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper withdrew his name from the veepstakes. Cooper may not be particularly progressive, but he has a moderate liberal record that I think would do well with the majority of Americans.\n\nSadly, it means that the rest of the country will lose out on seeing the Andy Griffith costume Cooper wears on Halloween – but it probably means he’s eyeing a 2026 Senate run.\n\nHarris doesn't need to ruin the momentum she has built in the early days of her presidential campaign. She's already garnering enough support to pull ahead of the polls and make up for lost time. Democrats should pick someone who is thinking about the future of the party and the future of the country.\n\nHarris needs to keep rallying her base and energizing young voters. The wrong choice could haunt her on Election Day.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter, @sara__pequeno", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/04/harris-to-meet-with-kelly-shapiro-walz-as-final-vp-decision-nears/74664949007/", "title": "Kamala Harris to meet Sunday with Kelly, Shapiro, Walz as final VP ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with at least three finalists Sunday to serve as her running-mate as she nears the end of a rapid process to choose her vice president before an announcement comes imminently, according to multiple reports.\n\nHarris, the Democratic nominee for president, will meet with Pennsylvania Gov.

Who's down? Harris' VP options in limbo ahead of imminent decision\n\nThe Harris campaign plans to notify supporters by text message − the same way President Joe Biden informed the public about his pick of Harris as his running-mate four years ago.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is picking her running mate any day now! This moment is historic, and as one of our campaign’s most faithful supporters, we want you to play a special part in it,\" the campaign said in a sign-up sheet to get on the text-message list. \"Add your name to be among the first to learn about Kamala’s VP pick when we break the news.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/10/kamala-harris-donald-trump-vice-president/74044434007/", "title": "Kamala Harris hits Donald Trump's potential vice presidential picks", "text": "WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris alleged in a new interview that former President Donald Trump wants an “enabler” for his vice president, commenting on the former president's running mate selection process as she seeks a second term alongside President Joe Biden.\n\n“(Trump) doesn’t want a governing partner. He doesn’t want another Mike Pence, and I think that is clear,” Harris told Politico Playbook over the weekend. “The litmus test is, are they going to be absolutely loyal to Trump over country or their oath of office, or, frankly, the American people?”\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Trump's campaign for comment.\n\nHarris' remarks come as Trump’s campaign sent vetting documents to potential vice presidential picks, including North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.\n\nWhile Harris didn't address most of Trump's potential VP picks by name, she did criticize many of their stances on abortion restrictions.\n\n“Everyone on that list has supported a Trump abortion ban in their state or has called for a national ban,” Harris said. “In fact, many voted... in the Senate against the right to contraception. That’s how far down the road they are.”\n\nThe Right to Contraception Act, introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., sought to codify people's right to use and protect health care providers' right to distribute contraceptives. The vote required 60 votes but failed last week by a count of 51-39, with Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joining Democrats in voting yes.\n\nTrump has said he supports individual states passing their own abortion restrictions, not necessarily a national ban on the procedure.\n\nHarris did weigh in on one potential Trump VP pick: Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who claimed Black families were “together” during the Jim Crow era during a Trump campaign event in Philadelphia last week.\n\n“It’s sadly yet another example of somebody out of Florida trying to erase or rewrite our true history,” she said. “I went to Florida last July to call out what they were trying to do to replace our history with lies. And apparently there’s a never ending flow of that coming out of that state.”\n\nFlorida last year released new curriculum for students in the state that advised instruction on \"how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit,\" Harris at the time went to Florida and decried \"extremist so-called leaders\" who \"dare to push propaganda to our children,\" sparking a back-and-forth with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nSteven Cheung, communications director for the Trump campaign, responded to Harris' remarks in a statement to USA TODAY, calling her the \"most inept and ineffective vice president in American history,\" criticizing the Biden administration's handling of the southern border, economy and other issues.\n\nContributing: Savannah Kuchar, Rachel Barber and Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/22/harris-vp-running-mate-contenders/74492370007/", "title": "Kamala Harris' VP pick: Who's up and who's down on her running ...", "text": "Kamala Harris is moving swiftly to lock up the Democratic nomination for president and appeared to have enough delegate support to do so by Monday evening.\n\nHer next major task: selecting a running mate.\n\nRather than moving to challenge Harris for the mantle, in the first 24 hours of her candidacy, the potential vice presidential picks began jockeying to be on her shortlist.\n\nThe top contenders parsed questions from reporters eager to hear if they’d be interested in a job that could put them a heartbeat away from the presidency. They went on social media to joke about their newfound interest. Some even hit the major TV shows typically watched by White House officials, such as “Morning Joe,” to confirm that calls with Harris had taken place.\n\n\"I think if somebody calls you on that, then what you do is at least listen,\" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who confirmed Harris reached out, said on the MSNBC program Monday morning.\n\nFor their part, Harris’ campaign team has been tight-lipped about the process and who might be under serious consideration. One item that did surface: former Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, will conduct the vetting of Harris' potential partner on the campaign trail, Reuters reported on Monday.\n\nPotential running mates include a deep bench of younger Democrats who have been widely seen as White House contenders in their own right once President Joe Biden got out of the picture. They range from swing state governors to a former astronaut now serving in the U.S. Senate and one popular Cabinet official who ran for president against Biden and Harris in 2020.\n\nAll of them bring their own bases – and liabilities – while auditioning to join the brand new Harris ticket.\n\n\"The primary consideration should be someone who will have the same effect on the electorate that she does, because then it will be a one two punch,\" Halie Soifer, a former national security adviser to Harris in the Senate, told USA TODAY.\n\nSoifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said she anticipates the pick will share Harris’ urgency to defend democratic norms, protecting reproductive rights and rejecting isolationist foreign policy views while serving as a direct contrast to the Republican ticket.\n\nMoore, Whitmer pass on joining ticket\n\nTwo governors who may have fit that bill took themselves out of the running on Monday, Michigan’s Gretchen Whimer and Maryland’s Wes Moore.\n\n“I’m not leaving Michigan,” Whitmer, a staunch abortion rights proponent whose state borders Canada, told a local TV station on Monday.\n\nMoore, a combat veteran, said Monday during a conference in Washington, D.C. that being VP isn’t something you can’t be “recruited or drafted” to do. “I am absolutely in love with my state,” he said.\n\nThe 59-year-old vice president, who's already broken barriers, is poised to be the first Black woman and Asian-American Democratic nominee for president. A former California attorney general and prosecutor, allies contend her judicial background will be a perfect contrast for voters to asses against Republican nominee Donald Trump, the first former president to ever to be both indicted and convicted of a crime.\n\nBut GOP critics and other skeptics are quick to spotlight how she fumbled early assignments in the Biden administration. There are other electoral weaknesses Harris has that a well chosen running mate could help balance out, political observers say.\n\nHarris is expected to have a compressed period of time to make a decision, with the Democratic National Convention set to begin in less than four weeks. Recent history suggests a Democratic VP announcement comes a few days, or up to a week, before the national convention, though there have been exceptions this century too.\n\nVice presidential candidates run separately in the Democratic Party’s process, and whoever Harris picks will receive a separate vote on the convention floor.\n\nQuentin James, a DNC delegate from Ohio, said choosing a running mate should be about helping Harris pave a smoother pathway to victory.\n\n“I definitely think it needs to be someone of the opposite gender, who can help win some important swing states and with a military background,” he said.\n\nJames, founder and president of Collective PAC, which is aimed at increasing Black political participation, didn’t want to specify if his group has a certain person in mind.\n\nBut he urged his group’s members in a conference call Sunday to petition delegates and other party leaders about who they think should be on the ticket.\n\n“It has to be someone who both strengthens her resume and adds to some of the gaps she may face,” James said.\n\nHere is a rundown of the rumored running mates Harris is considering:\n\nJosh Shapiro\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's name has risen to the top of the list of potential VP contenders.\n\nA former state attorney general like Harris, the 51-year-old Democrat is the Keystone State's most popular governor in decades and could help deliver Democrats an electoral victory in the critical areas. His moderate stances and blue collar appeal may also prove to be an asset for Harris in other must-win Rust Belt states, including Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nThat could prove especially important with Ohio Sen. JD Vance on the Republican ticket alongside Trump.\n\nMichael Traugott, an emeritus research professor of political studies at the University of Michigan, said governors of battleground states are bound to be at the top of Harris' list \"because they want somebody with executive experience\" who can benefit the vice president in the Electoral College hunt.\n\n\"It's a little hard to figure precisely because we're short the polling of assessing the actual democratic team against Trump and Vance,\" he said.\n\nShapiro gained national recognition for his quick response to a 2023 I-95 overpass collapse, and, more recently, his leadership after the attempted assassination Trump in Butler, Pa. The latter earned him bipartisan praise, including from Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick.\n\nOne downside? Shapiro has led Pennsylvania as governor for only two years and is relatively inexperienced compared to several of the other VP contenders. He’s also unlikely to excite the party’s progressive base, given his position on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, has yet to call for a cease fire.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is perhaps the most well-known of the potential VP picks who could want the job. He achieved national fame in 2020 after launching a longshot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination and has maintained his status as a rising star while serving in the Biden administration.\n\nDuring his failed 2020 White House campaign, Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., pitched himself as a plainspoken Democrat who could speak to Republicans and understood the problems of blue collar workers in midwestern battleground states. He notched a surprise victory in Iowa and did well with white, working class Democrats.\n\nBut in a general election, Buttigieg’s identity as an openly gay man makes some Democrats nervous about the ticket's ability to bring conservative-leaning independent voters into a big tent, anti-Trump coalition.\n\nHarris will already be judged more harshly because of her likely status as the first Black and Asian American woman to lead a major party ticket, those naysayers often say.\n\nAndy Beshear\n\nA two-term Democratic governor of a deeply conservative state, Kentucky's Andy Beshear has demonstrated he can bring a broad group of voters into the Democratic fold, including Trump-Republicans and independents.\n\nIn a national election that is being increasingly framed around unity after the assassination attempt against Trump, Beshear’s bipartisan sensibilities could help Democrats temper accusations from Republicans of using inflammatory campaign rhetoric.\n\nThe 46-year-old governor may also be an effective messenger against Vance, who became famous for authoring the book Hillbilly Elegy about his Appalachian roots. Beshear, who represents portions of Appalachia in eastern Kentucky, has forcefully criticized Vance’s portrait of the region.\n\nDuring Monday's appearance on \"Morning Joe,\" for instance, the Bluegrass State governor laid into Trump's running mate, saying: \"I want the American people to know what a Kentuckian is and what they look like, cause JD Vance ain't from here.\"\n\nSome Democrats, however, see the little-known Beshear as too safe a choice and one who doesn't benefit Harris on the electoral map given Kentucky is a solidly red state. He’s relatively unvetted on the national stage compared to some of the other VP contenders.\n\nJB Pritzker\n\nAs governor of Illinois, billionaire JB Pritzker has garnered a more progressive reputation than some of the other Democrats being considered for the VP post.\n\nChoosing him as a running mate might help Harris shore-up support among the Democratic Party’s left flank.\n\nPritzker, heir to the Hyatt Hotel chain, has a net worth estimated at more than $3 billion - money that could come in handy during a contentious election year. He’s also part way through his second term as governor, which means he’s not currently campaigning for another office.\n\nOne point in the against-column for Pritzker: Illinois isn’t a battleground state, meaning he won’t help Harris carry any electoral votes. Illinois is also the host of the party’s 2024 convention, a role that the governor acknowledged on Monday puts him in a complicated position.\n\nRoy Cooper\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has won six statewide elections in the 2024 battleground state, including two gubernatorial races.\n\nSome Democrats believe that as VP, he could be a secret weapon for flipping the southern swing state from red to blue down the ballot this year.\n\nLike Pritzker, Cooper is closing out his time in the governor's mansion this year. And, he’s friendly with Harris. They both served as their state’s respective attorney general from 2011 to 2017, and she described him as a “dear friend” during a recent campaign rally.\n\nCooper’s age could work both ways for him. The North Carolina governor is 67, making him the oldest, and the most experienced, of the current VP contenders.\n\nMark Kelly\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly won two elections in the pivotal swing state in the last few years: a special election in 2020 to finish out the term of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, and a full term in 2022.\n\nTraditional vice presidential selection criteria suggests that choosing Kelly as a running mate could help boost Democrats chances of winning the Sun Belt swing state.\n\nShannon O’Brien, a professor of American politics at the University of Texas at Austin, suggested that Kelly’s military experience as a former naval aviator and U.S. astronaut could help neutralize patriotic messaging from the Trump campaign, adding an air of masculinity to the Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly’s wife is a wildcard too. He’s married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, a Democrat who can share the powerful story of surviving a gunshot to the head during a 2011 mass casualty event in Tuscon. That could prove to be an advantage in an election year when gun violence has again taken center stage, this time after Trump’s rally shooting.\n\n“You can't attack him on patriotism,” O’Brien said of Kelly. “The moment Trump starts going after him over an assassination attempt, he probably should shoot back, ‘Yeah you got grazed with a bullet. My wife took a bullet to the skull.’”\n\nKelly's experience in Washington also sets him apart from the governors on the list.\n\nEvery vice president since Walter Mondale in 1977 previously served in the House or Senate first. For Kelly, those relationships with sitting lawmakers could help a future Harris administration in getting legislation passed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/22"}]}

For the latest news on the storm, view our story for Friday, Aug. 9.\n\nThough no longer a tropical storm, now-Tropical Depression Debby was still dropping copious amounts of rain on eastern states Thursday evening as the Northeast braces for the system's arrival.\n\nDebby, still a tropical storm at the time, made its second U.S. landfall around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, just northeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. In a matter of hours, over half a foot of rain had fallen in parts of central North Carolina, causing \"life-threatening flash flooding\" as waterways crested, turning roads into rivers.\n\nDebby is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain − some areas could get up to 15 inches − across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday, bringing \"considerable to locally catastrophic flash flooding impacts,\" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. All told, rain totals in some parts of South Carolina could exceed 2 feet.\n\nDebby's sustained winds were down to 30 mph by 11 p.m. ET. In the days ahead, the storm is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves north, bringing up to 6 inches of rain from Maryland to Vermont. Flood watches throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions were set to activate Thursday evening and last through Friday night.\n\nAcross Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, Debby drenched communities in over a foot of rain, breaking several decades-old records. Flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads, and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least seven people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nDebby tracker map:Where is Tropical Storm Debby? Maps track path, flooding, rain, where it already hit\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Millions of people from southeast Georgia up through the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia were under tornado watches.\n\n∎ Virginia's Department of Emergency Management warned residents to stay aware of possible tornadoes Thursday and Friday. \"Tropical Storm Debby has the potential to create tornadoes, with the threat potentially lasting through the overnight hours,\" the post said.\n\n∎ Cleanup crews have cleared over 245 miles of road and eight acres of debris across Florida, according to the state's Division of Emergency Management. Emergency responders in high-water vehicles and on foot rescued at least 120 people trapped by floodwaters.\n\nDeath toll rises to at least 7 after tornado kills man in North Carolina\n\nA man in Wilson County, North Carolina, was found dead in his home after a tornado touched down in the area, bringing Debby's death toll to at least seven.\n\nStephen Mann, director of communication for Wilson County, told USA TODAY on Thursday that a twister tore through the outskirts of Lucama, a town 35 miles southeast of Raleigh, sometime before 3 a.m. A middle school, a church and four homes sustained structural damage. Inside one of the homes, a search and rescue team discovered the body of an adult male, Mann said.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper met with local officials at Springfield Middle School to assess the damage and posted photos to social media Thursday. They showed piles of debris outside a heavily damaged building, with about half of the roof missing as insulation foam spilled out, and a collapsed wall that exposed what appeared to be the remnants of a classroom.\n\nOfficials have tied Debby to at least six other deaths, five in Florida and one in Georgia. In the southern Georgia city of Moultrie, a tree fell onto a home, killing a 19-year-old, Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday. In Florida, two adults and a child were killed in fatal vehicle accidents; also, a 13-year-old boy died after a fallen tree landed on a mobile home; and officials on Tuesday found the body of a boater who had been missing near the city of Gulfport.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, officials confirmed a tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. A suspected tornado was also reported in Pender County. Across South Carolina and Florida, Debby spawned eight tornadoes earlier this week.\n\nAt historic North Carolina inn, 'it's literally raining inside'\n\nThursday quickly became a tough day at work for hotel manager Elise Tyler, when the ceiling of the Colonial Inn in Hillsborough, North Carolina, began to leak rainwater and drain systems couldn’t keep up with the heavy downpour.\n\n“We are on the verge of flooded,” said Tyler, 37. “Several areas of the inn are dripping and it’s literally raining inside.”\n\nThe 200-year-old building had not lost power, but the lights were flickering, Tyler said. Nearby roads were closed because of flooding and some staff who lost power at their homes took advantage of empty hotel rooms to shower and charge their phones, she said.\n\nThe Colonial is located in a historic block of Hillsborough, close to the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and the building was pillaged by Union troops, according to the hotel's website.\n\nKnown for its restaurant’s weekend brunch, the inn got a lot of customers Wednesday, Tyler said, likely because people were anticipating hunkering down Thursday – when only “one brave soul” came in for lunch.\n\nForecasters eye another system in the Atlantic\n\nJust as Debby continues to pound the East Coast, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are also keeping an eye on a developing system near the Caribbean islands.\n\n\"An area of low pressure could form in the central or western tropical Atlantic Ocean early next week,\" the center said in an online forecast released Thursday morning. \"Some development of this system is possible while it approaches the Lesser Antilles during the early to middle part of next week and moves generally west-northwestward toward the Greater Antilles thereafter.\"\n\nThe system has a 30% chance of becoming a tropical depression or named storm within the next week. The next name on the 2024 storm list is Ernesto. It's far too soon to determine whether the system will impact any land areas, including the U.S.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nDebby's latest rainfall totals\n\nRainfall reports show more than a dozen locations in the Southeast where Debby has dropped at least a foot of rain since Saturday, causing widespread flooding from Florida to North Carolina. Below are some preliminary selected rain totals from the National Weather Service.\n\nFlorida:\n\nLake City: 19.67 inches\n\nParrish: 18.86 inches\n\nLakewood Ranch: 18.34 inches\n\nSarasota: 17.78 inches\n\nEllenton: 14.60 inches\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nSummerville: 18.25 inches\n\nMount Pleasant: 17.70 inches\n\nGreen Pond: 17.43 inches\n\nLoris: 15.89 inches\n\nCharleston Airport: 10.35 inches\n\nGeorgia:\n\nOliver: 14.82 inches\n\nRincon: 13.87 inches\n\nBelville: 13.59 inches\n\nRocky Ford: 11.63 inches\n\nSavannah Airport: 10.10 inches\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nKings Grant: 15.25 inches\n\nShallotte: 13.05 inches\n\nElizabethtown: 10.71 inches\n\nHolden Beach: 10.28 inches\n\nWilmington Airport: 8.57 inches\n\nPower outages in NC down to 60,000\n\nMore than 25,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina were without power Thursday night, a major improvement from 60,000 customers just a few hours earlier as crews repaired some of the damage caused by Debby. Duke Energy, the state's largest power provider, said Wednesday it had 7,500 linemen and other employees staged across the Carolinas to respond to outages.\n\nBlackouts also diminished in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia, which were all under 2,500 outages by 10 p.m. E.T.\n\nBut as the storm headed north, other states such as Virginia − with 20,000 outages − were feeling its effects. In addition, more than 232,000 homes and businesses were out of power in Ohio, the result of Tuesday's storms impacted by Debby.\n\nWhere is Debby?\n\nDebby gained speed but lost intensity as it moved farther inland Thursday, hours after making its second U.S. landfall, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAccording to an 11 p.m. update, the storm was moving north-northeast at 26 mph. Debby was located 80 miles north-northeast of Charlotte, North Carolina, and 90 miles west-northwest of Raleigh, North Carolina, with sustained winds of 30 mph, according to the center.\n\nNorth Carolina resident prepared campground for Debby\n\nIn Raeford, North Carolina, Michelle Morville said her property got a few inches of rain overnight but hasn’t flooded or lost power. “It poured and is still raining here with more to come,” Morville said Thursday morning.\n\nHer campground, Idlewild Farm Stays, is terraced to allow for erosion control so there’s no standing water, Morville said. Rain flows properly down a main driveway during storms, and after the current downpour passes, Morville said she will use a land plane on the road to clear any remaining moisture.\n\nMany people who come to the farm are visiting family members serving in the military on nearby Fort Liberty, formerly Fort Bragg, Morville said. This week, she is offering discounted rates to anyone needing to move their camper or RV out of a flood zone.\n\n“Most flooding issues I believe come from a lack of regard for Mother Nature and not planning accordingly to work with her,” Morville said.\n\nReopening begins after flooding cuts off North Carolina town\n\nAuthorities in Bladenboro, North Carolina, began reopening several main roads after the town was completely cut off by floodwaters overnight.\n\n\"Water has receded in some areas. Crews will begin reopening up roads here shortly,\" said a statement on the county's Facebook page. Much of the downtown was still closed as standing water remained several inches deep in some areas.\n\nJust before midnight, as Debby approached the South Carolina coast, a statement on Bladenboro's Facebook page announced, \"Downtown is underwater. We have several street closures out. Please stay off the roads!\" Within an hour, the local fire department said, \"Due to flooded roadways all roads into Bladenboro are closed.\"\n\nAs the heavy rains and tornado threat shifted away from the area toward more northern parts of North Carolina and Virginia, the town has begun to assess the damage and reopen main roads. \"Many secondary roads have not been checked, use caution,\" the fire department warned early Thursday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/01/hurricane-beryl-landfall-live-news-updates/74261881007/", "title": "Hurricane Beryl becomes earliest Category 5 storm in history", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects news on Hurricane Beryl from Monday, July 1. For the latest news on Hurricane Beryl, which is now a Category 5 storm, please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Tuesday, July 2.\n\nHurricane Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record Monday night when its winds increased to 160 mph as it barreled through the southeastern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl shatters the old record by more than two weeks — Hurricane Emily became a Category 5 on July 17, 2005. Forecasters fear that the historically busy hurricane season in 2005 could be repeated this year.\n\nHurricane hunter reconnaissance flights into the storm Monday found continued strengthening. As of 11 p.m. Monday, Beryl's winds had climbed from 155 mph to 160 mph — becoming a \"potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane,\" according to the hurricane center.\n\nBeryl's central barometric pressure had dropped to 938 millibars but the hurricane center expects its Category 5 status to be brief, forecasting a steady decline in windspeed with the winds steadily declining.\n\nThe hurricane was about 510 miles east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic and traveling west-northwest at 22 mph, the hurricane center said. Its center was on track to move across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea into Tuesday and is expected to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nBeryl is forecast to weaken after reaching Jamaica, according to the hurricane center, but it's expected to remain a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean.\n\nBeryl tore through the Windward Islands on Monday after making landfall on Grenada’s Carriacou Island as a Category 4 storm at 11:10 a.m., according to the hurricane center. The hurricane had 150 mph winds when its eye made landfall on Carriacou.\n\nPower was out throughout Grenada and residents were advised to shelter in place as Beryl brought down power lines and tore away roofs. The last major hurricane to reach the country's shores was Ivan, which caused widespread devastation with winds of more than 135 mph in 2004.\n\nThe government of Jamaica has issued a hurricane warning for the island, according to the hurricane center.\n\nFrom the island of St. Lucia south to Grenada, streets were littered with parts of trees and personal effects, the Associated Press reported. The lack of electricity and communications outages in the region made it difficult to get accurate reports on injuries and property damage.\n\nThe historic Beryl reached tropical storm status Friday before becoming a major hurricane Sunday as it raced toward the Caribbean with winds of 130 mph − a gain of 95 mph in just 42½ hours. Record-warm ocean temperatures led to rapid intensification, a phenomenon that occurs when a storm strengthens by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.\n\nThe storm became the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record and the first June major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles. Beryl hit Category 4 status Sunday, but its winds decreased slightly overnight, making it a Category 3 storm Monday. It strengthened again early Monday.\n\nHurricane Beryl storm tracker:See latest details, projected path of Category 3 storm\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ At least one death was reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said late Monday, adding that there may be more fatalities. Gonsalves noted the widespread devastation in the area with hundreds of homes and buildings damaged or destroyed.\n\n∎ In a statement on Facebook, St. Lucia's Prime Minister Philip Pierre said that the island experienced \"strong winds and torrential rains that resulted in flooding, land slippage and property destruction.\" He added that Beryl \"could have been even more severe on our country but we were spared this time from possible disaster.\"\n\n∎ Storm surge in the Windward Islands could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels and bring \"large, destructive waves\" to the coast, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n∎ Rainfall could cause flooding and is expected to dump 3 to 6 inches in Barbados and the Windward Islands. Up to 10 inches are possible in isolated locations, especially in the Grenadines.\n\n∎ After Beryl's center moves across the Windward Islands on Monday, the storm will cross the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea late Monday through Wednesday.\n\nHow Beryl grew:Hurricane Beryl, super-charged by warm seas, stuns experts\n\nHurricane Beryl's quick emergence a 'massive warning sign'\n\nAn explosive increase in wind speeds, a record for the strongest hurricane this early in the season. Those are ominous signs of what weather experts see as danger ahead in what is expected to be a hyperactive season for major storms.\n\nHurricane Beryl's stunning transformation from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in less than 42 hours has meteorologists reaching out for superlatives and issuing warnings. This is only the seventh time such a quick rise in category has occurred with an Atlantic storm, and never before had it happened before Sept. 1, the heart of the hurricane season.\n\n\"Buckle up. It could be a challenging few months ahead,\" said chief science officer Steve Bowen of Gallagher Re, a reinsurance firm. \"This is a massive warning sign for the rest of the season.\"\n\nCould Hurricane Beryl hit the US coast?\n\nAfter watching Beryl spin up from a tropical depression to a hurricane in a little more than 40 hours, and then slam into the Windward Islands, the big question on the minds of millions of U.S. residents is where the storm could be next weekend and whether it will still be a hurricane.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s no clear answer yet, and may not be for a couple of days.\n\nOn Monday evening, the National Hurricane Center’s forecast track showed Beryl as a tropical storm near the Mexican coast on Saturday afternoon.\n\n“There’s a lot of variables that could occur that can change the direction of a tropical storm, especially when it’s several days out,” said Tawnya Evans, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service field office in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nWindy conditions over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico could prevent Beryl from maintaining its hurricane status.\n\nA high-pressure ridge sitting over the Gulf could be the deciding factor. If it holds strong, Beryl would continue a more westward track. If the ridge shifts eastward, Beryl could move more northward and potentially threaten the Gulf Coast.\n\nRegardless of its strength or location in the Gulf next weekend, Beryl could bring an increased risk of showers and thunderstorms, along with swells and rip currents to the Texas coast, Corpus Christi’s forecast stated on Monday.\n\nPuerto Rico forecast to see large swells\n\nThe hurricane center expects Beryl to remain a hurricane as it reaches Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday.\n\n\"The most likely scenario is for the storm to move westward into Mexico,\" DaSilva said. \"However, it is very important to note that if the high pressure across the Southeast weakens, that can allow the storm to move farther north and potentially directly impact the Gulf Coast.\"\n\nThe storm is likely to have some impact on Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory that is home to more than 3 million American citizens. The hurricane center said the island can expect large swells that cause \"life-threatening surf and rip current conditions'' in the next day.\n\n'Full panic mode' in Barbados\n\nAbe and Kristin Homan woke up Monday to the crash of waves on barrier islands just a short walk from their hotel on the southwestern coast of Barbados. From their window, they watched as fierce winds uprooted trees and sent debris flying.\n\n“It’s pretty intense,” Abe Homan, 46, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Homans arrived on the island Tuesday. What started “as a beautiful vacation,” made a dramatic turn over the weekend when the couple realized the severity of the storm, and people “went into full panic mode,” Homan said. They searched for a way back to South Carolina on Sunday, but it was too late. The planes were fully booked and the airport was soon shut down. Back at the Sandals resort, stranded vacationers and some of the staff were distraught.\n\n“They were just so confused, and almost crying,” said Abe Homan, who runs a technology company based in his home state.\n\nLater Monday, the Barbados government discontinued the hurricane warning. Now, the Homans are hoping to return to their four children in South Carolina by the Fourth of July.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nBeryl on the move:Hurricane Beryl an 'extremely dangerous' Cat 4 storm as it roars toward Caribbean\n\nGrenada authorities warn residents to stay indoors\n\nDr. Terence Walters, the national disaster coordinator for Grenada, urged residents to gather documents and put them and other necessities in plastic bags. Walters, speaking at a briefing early Monday, warned residents not to go outside but said Beryl could damage or destroy some homes. Even if a house suffers damage, residents might be safer hiding in a bathroom rather than making a run for a government shelter, Walters said. About 3,000 people were in shelters awaiting the storm, he said.\n\n\"If your house is damaged or destroyed, you have to use good judgment before you make a decision to get to safety,\" he said.\n\nBarbados weather worsens: 'Do not go anywhere'\n\nIn Barbados, about 160 miles northeast of Carriacou, Home Affairs and Information Minister Wilfred Abrahams told residents “do not go anywhere until the all clear is given.\" Abrahams said some power lines were down and some of the island's 280,000 people were in the dark. More than 35,000 homes and businesses − about a quarter of Barbados Light & Power customers − were without power, the company said.\n\nThe worst of the storm has passed, but more damage was expected, Abrahams said. A \"drone team\" was ready to survey the island and help determine where work crews will be sent, he said.\n\nAbrahams said the sun was coming out and he could see from comments on social media that many people were anxious about what happened.\n\n“I know in the day of social media, everybody wants to be first to get something out,\" he told Barbados Today. \"You want to be the first to have a video. You want to be the first to show something, you want to be first to show house damage. Don’t do that in a way that might cost you your life.\"\n\nRiding out Hurricane Beryl in St. Lucia: 'We'll just kind of wing it'\n\nAmong those hunkering down for the storm was Linda Dancer, a travel agent from Charlotte, North Carolina, who arrived in St. Lucia on Saturday for an award ceremony. Over the last two days, she's watched as staff at the Sandals Grande St. Lucian resort installed plywood over windows, laid out sandbags and removed chandeliers. Dancer, 63, planned on staying in her room as the hurricane lashed the island.\n\n“It was really sunny this morning, but we have outer bands coming in so it’s getting gray and darker out now,” she told USA TODAY. “I’m not taking my eyes off the weather app.”\n\nWhile stocking her fridge at a Sandals resort on the west side of the island, Dancer has also been coordinating with clients whose vacations and honeymoons have been interrupted by the hurricane.\n\n“Some of them … they're scared but you can’t leave at this point,” she said. “Some are like, ‘It's not that big a deal, we'll just kind of wing it.’”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?\n\nRapid intensification is a process in which a storm undergoes accelerated growth. The phenomenon is typically defined to be a tropical cyclone (whether a tropical storm or hurricane) intensifying by at least 35 mph in a 24-hour period.\n\n\"Rapid intensification occurs when a tropical storm or hurricane encounters an extremely conducive environment,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. \"Typically, this environment consists of very warm water, low vertical wind shear and high levels of midlevel moisture.\"\n\nWhat are the Windward Islands?\n\nThe Windward Islands are the group of Caribbean islands in the eastern part of the Caribbean Sea. They include Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada. Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago are sometimes included in the group.\n\nThey are called \"windward\" − which means upward from a given point − because they are more windward to arriving ships than the Leeward Islands.\n\nDowngraded Tropical Storm Chris still a threat in Mexico\n\nTropical Storm Chris, the third named storm of the season, eased to tropical depression status after crashing across the Mexican coastline near Veracruz overnight. The storm was forecast to produce rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches across parts of eastern Mexico earlier Monday, with maximum rainfall totals around 12 inches in higher terrain of the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi.\n\n\"This rainfall will result in areas of flooding, with mudslides possible in areas of higher terrain,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nWhat is the 2024 hurricane season forecast?\n\nFederal forecasters have predicted a hurricane season unlike any other, with as many as 25 named storms possible.\n\nIt is the most storms the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has ever predicted in a preseason outlook. \"All the ingredients are in place for an active season,\" National Weather Service director Ken Graham said in May.\n\nNOAA director Rick Spinrad said the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be \"extraordinary\" − an 85% chance for an above-average year. \"The forecast … is the highest NOAA has ever issued for the May outlook,\" he said.\n\nHurricane Beryl Spaghetti models\n\nHurricane Beryl Trajectory\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice and Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/01/10/winter-storm-snow-floods-power-outages-live-updates/72170001007/", "title": "Winter storm updates: Power outages, flooding across Northeast", "text": "A massive winter storm dumped rain across the Northeast on Wednesday, flooding roads, closing schools and knocking out power the day after barreling through the south, leaving at least five dead in its wake.\n\nThe storm was on its way north into Canada later Wednesday after battering the region with wind gusts up to 95 mph, but more windy weather was expected through the evening. And more is yet to come later this week as another powerful storm will rev up by Friday, bringing more frigid air and snow to the East Coast, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe combination of up to 3 inches of rain over highly saturated and snow-covered ground elevated the risk of flooding, especially along low-lying and coastal areas throughout the mid-Atlantic and New England, forecasters said.\n\nOver 189,000 utility customers across New York State, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were without power Wednesday afternoon. Many school districts delayed the start of classes or canceled them because of the storm.\n\nOn Tuesday, the storm brought blizzard conditions, heavy rain and powerful winds to over 30 states and more than 2 million square miles. At least five deaths and several injuries were reported across the Midwest and Southeast. At least three tornadoes were confirmed across the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday with wind gusts as high as 106 mph.\n\nMeanwhile, dangerous blizzard conditions that peaked on Tuesday persist in the Pacific Northwest, where heavy snow fall has made for treacherous travel conditions along mountain roads in the Cascades and Olympics.\n\nThe coldest air of the season will move into the central U.S. through the weekend as a cold front shifts south and high pressure builds to the north, according to the weather service. High temperatures in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains are forecast to reach 10 to 20 degrees below zero on Friday and Saturday, and wind chills could exacerbate hypothermia and frostbite risks.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 15,000 flights were delayed across the nation Wednesday, and about 1,300 were canceled as the storm continued to move across the Northeast, according to FlightAware. Airports in Denver, Chicago and Miami accounted for the most travel delays and cancellations.\n\n∎ Over 150 rivers throughout the Atlantic Coast were at their flood stage, according to the weather service.\n\n∎ Amtrak canceled dozens of trains across the mid-Atlantic region and up through Maine on Wednesday, citing impacts of the immense winter storm that passed across the Northeast. Several of the canceled trains were in major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nGet a grip on winter driving:How to prepare for snow and ice on the roads.\n\nEvacuation order lifted after partial dam break in Connecticut\n\nA mandatory evacuation order prompted by a partially damaged dam was lifted Wednesday after hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes, the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said.\n\nOfficials would be monitoring the dam through the night, the agency added.\n\nThe evacuation zone stretched for several miles along the Yantic River from the town of Bozrah to Uncas Falls in downtown Norwich, a city about 45 miles northeast of New Haven.\n\n“The City Manager has determined that the Yantic River Flood Zone must be evacuated to protect the life and safety of residents in the area,” said a statement from Norwich Public Utilities.\n\nAn emergency shelter was opened at Kelly Middle School in Norwich, where the Red Cross was stationed to help the hundreds of people who had to leave their homes.\n\nAround 7 a.m., Norwich Public Utilities announced the dam had partially collapsed. The company said Wednesday afternoon power was restored after cutting it off for about 5,000 customers to avoid “potentially catastrophic” infrastructure damage.\n\nNorwich Public Utilities said the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection would oversee stabilizing the damaged infrastructure, and a coffer dam would be installed to hold back water and “allow for further investigation and repair.”\n\nAt 12:15 p.m., the Yantic River was measured at 12.8 feet, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The river’s flood stage is 9 feet.\n\nWeather service confirms rare EF-3 tornado hit Florida\n\nFour tornadoes, including a rare and powerful EF-3, slammed Florida on Tuesday, the National Weather Service confirmed after a preliminary damage survey Wednesday.\n\nAn EF-1 tornado slammed southwest Jackson County around 6 a.m. local time Tuesday, the weather service said, uprooting several trees and damaging some sheds in its seven-minute span. Minutes later, an EF-2 tornado in central Jackson County injured seven people, flipped over mobile homes and tore off roofs, according to a preliminary assessment.\n\nThe weather service also confirmed an EF-3 tornado and EF-2 tornado hit Bay County, both spawning from the same parent storm.\n\nDon Van Dyke, a meteorologist at the weather service in Tallahassee, Florida, told USA TODAY the tornadoes were fueled by an unusually strong cold front, lots of wind shear and a moist and unstable airmass from the Gulf of Mexico. He noted EF-3 tornadoes were rare for the area, while lower-scale twisters were more common.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records show Florida only had 41 EF-3 tornadoes between 1954 and 2022.\n\nTornadoes are classified on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which ranges from zero to five. It takes into account estimated wind speeds, observed damage, and damage verified in weather service surveys after tornadoes.\n\nAn EF-3 tornado has wind gusts ranging from 136 to 165 mph. Its winds can destroy entire stories of well-constructed houses, severely damage large buildings such as shopping malls, overturn trains, rip off bark from trees, blow away structures with weak foundations, and lift heavy cars off the ground.\n\nStorm kills at least 5 people, authorities say\n\nAuthorities said the large storm caused at least five deaths in Wisconsin, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday.\n\nOne person was killed and four people were injured in Claremont, North Carolina, when a tornado hit Catawba County, damaging multiple homes in a mobile home park, county spokesperson Amy McCauley told USA TODAY. About 30 people were displaced by the storm, she said, and the American Red Cross was assisting with shelter efforts. The weather service preliminarily determined the storm was categorized as an EF-1 tornado, meaning it had 3-second wind gusts of 86 to 110 mph.\n\nPolice in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, say a man died during heavy rain when a tree fell on his car on a state highway in Jonesboro.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman died in Cottonwood, Alabama, after an apparent tornado touched down around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Houston County Coroner Robert Byrd confirmed to USA TODAY. Charlotte Paschal's mobile home was picked up by the storm and \"rolled\" three to four times, Byrd said.\n\nA second person in Alabama died Tuesday when a tree fell on the 68-year-old man’s car as he was driving down Crestwood Boulevard, Birmingham Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Clay Hendon told USA TODAY. The storm had mostly passed by the time the man was on the road, but soaked grounds from earlier rainfall and high winds likely pushed the tree to collapse, Hendon said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, treacherous road conditions amid intense snowfall led to a car wreck in Jefferson County that left one person dead.\n\nRescue response:Avalanche at Palisades Tahoe ski resort forces closures in area as crews conduct search\n\nSnowfall broke Des Moines record on Tuesday\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, saw a record 8.3 inches of snow on Tuesday, breaking previous records for Jan. 9 snowfall, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe previous record for Jan. 9 was 7.3 inches, set in 1957. Tuesday was the second day the storm dumped snow on Des Moines, which saw a total of 11.2 inches Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIowa may have its coldest Caucus Day ever on Jan. 15 with \"arctic cold\" en route to the state. By 6 p.m. on Monday, when people will be lining up to check-in before caucusing for Republican presidential primary candidates, temperatures are expected to be minus 1 to minus 5 degrees depending on which part of the state you're in. Wind chills in the evening could dip to nearly minus 20 degrees, meteorologist Brad Small said.\n\n− The Des Moines Register\n\nMaine flooding covers roads, submerges cars\n\nLarge swaths of Maine’s Atlantic Coast flooded early Wednesday as heavy rain poured across New England, melting snow banks and quickly raising the level of rivers and streams.\n\nStephen Oliver, a building contractor who lives and works in Hancock, a seaside town at the head of Frenchman Bay, said the storm surge had swelled over entire roadways and submerged cars.\n\n“There's a lot of flooding everywhere,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nOliver, 47, spent Tuesday afternoon covering building materials in tarps and installing extra braces on a house he’s working on near the coast. Multiple building sites lost power overnight, he said.\n\nCoastal communities may be inundated with up to 3 feet of water before the rain subsides, the weather service said. From Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, 1 to 4 inches of snow fell along Maine’s coastal towns and neighborhoods, while inland areas received snow totals in the double digits.\n\nThe York County emergency management department reported coastal flooding Wednesday morning, with water inundation of up to one foot in buildings in the village center of Kennebunkport and part of a road washed away in Biddeford, the weather service in Gray, Maine said.\n\nTwo previous storms also caused flooding and damaging winds in December, Oliver said. Weather this winter season has been “very unusual,” he said.\n\n“This is like the third instance where there’s been heavy wind and rain in the last few months,” he said, adding that he can’t remember a time when extreme weather struck the region with a similar frequency.\n\nSevere weather to continue: Bomb cyclone, arctic blast, East Coast snowstorm\n\nThe parade of snowstorms is just a teaser for what's to come. By Friday, cold air equivalent to true artic air will reach the central U.S., and many places will be unable to reach temperatures above zero degrees Fahrenheit by Sunday, according to AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter.\n\nA possible \"bomb cyclone\" blizzard − a winter hurricane − could cause an arctic blast courtesy of the polar vortex in the Midwest next week as well as the first real East Coast snowstorm in years.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the storm carrying the arctic air will continue to bring heavy snow, blizzard conditions and snow squalls throughout parts of the Pacific Northwest through Thursday before the system makes its way to the Midwest later this week.\n\nA polar vortex is just the beginning:January's weather forecast is chaotic and dangerous\n\nMigrants in NYC sheltered at a school during storm\n\nNearly 2,000 migrants were brought to a high school in Brooklyn, New York, on Tuesday ahead of the storm's intense wind and rain.\n\nThe 500 families had been sheltering in tents at Floyd Bennett Field, an airfield in southeast Brooklyn, only a few miles from James Madison High School, when they were picked up in buses Tuesday evening and dropped off at the school.\n\nThe school's students studied from home Wednesday.\n\n“This relocation is a proactive measure being taken out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals working and living at the center,” the New York City Emergency Management said in a statement. “The relocation will continue until any weather conditions that may arise have stabilized and the facility is once again fit for re-occupancy.”\n\nZachary Iscol, the commissioner of the city’s emergency management department, said at a news conference the migrants were relocated primarily “because of the high winds.”\n\nAround 5 a.m. Wednesday, when the storm had largely passed over the city and the strong winds had subsided, authorities began taking families back to the airfield.\n\nMigrants arriving to NYC:City adds restrictions to 'rogue' buses of migrants sent by Texas gov.\n\nPower outages surge across country\n\nWhile heavy rain moved out of the area early Wednesday, more than 140,000 are without power in New York State after gusts of up to 60 mph knocked over power lines and downed trees.\n\nMore than 100,000 utility customers in Pennsylvania and 80,000 in North Carolina were without power at about 6 a.m., according to a USA TODAY tracker.\n\nAreas throughout the Midwest, where snowfall has lessened since blizzard conditions swept over the region earlier this week, remained without power Wednesday morning. In Michigan, more than 44,000 utility customers had no power amid freezing temperatures.\n\nBy afternoon, things had improved somewhat. In New York, about 113,000 customers were still without power; 20,000 in North Carolina; and 28,000 in Michigan.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2023/08/18/palm-springs-area-under-tropical-storm-watch-as-hurricane-hilary-nears/70620451007/", "title": "Hurricane Hilary live updates: Palm Springs PD announces road ...", "text": "Staff reports\n\nPalm Springs Desert Sun\n\nLooking for the latest updates? The Desert Sun is tracking the storm as it makes landfall on Sunday.\n\nAs Hurricane Hilary comes closer to making landfall, the National Weather Service placed the Coachella Valley under a tropical storm warning, emphasizing the potential for high winds and extreme flooding rain that “may prompt numerous evacuations and rescues.”\n\n'A potentially catastrophic situation'\n\nIn the National Weather Service-San Diego's 4 p.m. update, meteorolgist Elizabeth Adams said Hurricane Hilary is currently off the coast of Baja California, some 600 miles south of San Diego. The NWS expects the storm to make landfall sometime Sunday, when heavy rainfall is expected.\n\n\"We have a very serious situation here, folks,\" said Adams, describing the increasing chances and rate of rain that will hit the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California's mountain and desert region.\n\nShe said rain in the valley, like in Palm Springs, had been delayed compared to what they were expecting Saturday afternoon. But the chances are certainly increasing into the evening, estimating a likely 3/4 inch of rain for the area Saturday night.\n\nSunday is when conditions are expected to worsen considerably. Sunrise to lunch time, is when \"precipitation starts to get really heavy,\" she added. The chance of rain increases to 90-100% during this period, and around that time, she said we can expect an inch to an inch and a half of rain in a six-hour period.\n\nDuring Sunday afternoon, Adams said the rate of rain could increase to two inches an hour, resulting in possible \"widespread, very life-threatening flash flooding\"\n\n\"This will become a potentially catastrophic situation developing in the deserts and eastern mountains tomorrow afternoon,” said Adams.\n\nBetween Saturday evening and Monday night, Adams said people can expect \"over five inches of rain in the mountains, and potentially over seven inches of rain on the eastern slopes.\"\n\nShe urged people to pay close attention Sunday for if officials announce potential evacuations.\n\nResidents offer mixed reactions to the impending storm\n\nAs Anna Holt of Palm Springs put three sandbags into the back of her SUV Saturday, the Florida native — who is used to preparing for hurricanes — said having some sandbags is better than having none. She’s most concerned about the potential for flooding as Hurricane Hilary heads toward Baja California and the Southwestern U.S., but added she's doing the best she can to prepare.“It’s strange to think I left Florida to get away from the hurricanes and all that weather,\" Holt said. \"I moved to the desert and was like ‘Surely, that will never be a problem.’ But here we are. It’s definitely weird.\"\n\nAlthough most of the desert's nine city governments urged their residents to prepare for the storm by filling city-provided sandbags and stocking up on food — enough to get through several days stranded at home if flooding causes major road closures — several residents didn't feel the need to buy extra bottled water or non-perishable food Saturday.\n\nOne resident waved off a reporter outside the Desert Hot Springs Stater Bros. asking her about her bottled water purchase, saying she's \"not worried\" about the storm and was just doing a typical grocery run. The sentiment was echoed by several desert residents outside the Palm Springs Home Depot who said they were just there to get items for home and business improvement projects and didn't want to comment on the storm.\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Brian Blueskye\n\nPalm Springs Police Department announces pre-emptive road closures to start at midnight\n\nStarting at midnight tonight, Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino Street at the washes will be closed until further notice in preparation of potential flooding due to Hurricane Hilary, Palm Springs Police Department announced late Saturday.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nEmergency alert sign-ups recommended\n\nWith heavy rainfall expected early Sunday, officials urged Riverside County and Coachella Valley residents to subscribe to emergency alerts to ensure they receive information quickly.\n\nNo evacuations have been issued for the area as of 7 p.m. Saturday night. But if they are needed, the Riverside County Emergency Management Department said residents can be notified through the county's emergency notification system. People can sign up for the notifications with an email address or a phone number at https://rivcoready.org/alert-rivco\n\n—Chris Damien\n\nNewsom declares State of Emergency\n\nIn advance of the storm, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday evening to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to begin Saturday and last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities\n\nSand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nSome businesses choose to close, others open as usual\n\nFor most Palm Springs businesses on Saturday, it was business as usual. Most retail stores and restaurants were open and said they had no plans to close.\n\nMichael Weems, owner of the Michael Weems Collection and Autoerotica on North Indian Canyon Drive, said he isn't concerned.\n\n“I’ll put the sandbags in front of my door when I leave this evening, and that’s the extent of it. I don’t think it’s going to be a horrendous storm,” Weems said.\n\nBut others were taking precautions.\n\nGayMart on Arenas Road had a sign on its door stating it would be closed on Sunday. Employees behind the counter said it was the decision of the owner for the safety of the store’s staff members.\n\nThe Best Bookstore in Palm Springs owner Paul Carr also made the decision to close his East Tahquitz Canyon Way store at 2 p.m. for the safety of this employees. He spoke to The Desert Sun by phone while helping local residents prepare sandbags at Palm Springs City Hall and said “This is not how we expected to be spending our summer.”\n\n“The most important thing is climate change is real, and we have lots of books at the store on the subject,” Carr said. “As a local business, we look at the weather the best we can, make sure everyone is safe and get our books a little higher off the ground (in case of flooding).”\n\nCarr described the storm as “once in a generation” but added it's also brought out the generosity of the community.\n\n“I’m amazed by how prepared the city was for something there was no reason to be prepared for, a tropical storm in Palm Springs? When I see the chief of police and his wife shoveling sandbags down at city hall, I feel like we’re doing OK.”\n\nPalm Springs city councilmember Jeffrey Bernstein, who also owns Destination PSP on North Indian Canyon Drive, said he plans to close on Saturday when the rain starts and “most likely” on Sunday.\n\n“We want to make sure there’s no property damage, which is less important than people getting hurt. Thats why we’re going to stay on the store until the rain starts, make sure we’re sandbagged and everything is protected,” Bernstein said.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nStorm knocks down 45 power poles\n\nA thunderstorm Friday evening downed about 45 power poles in Thermal, cutting power for hundreds as Coachella Valley residents prepared for what will likely be much fiercer rain and wind as the remnants of Hurricane Hilary approach on Sunday.\n\nImperial Irrigation District, the power provider for the area, posted Saturday on its Facebook page photos of the power poles snapped and scattered on a paved road, high voltage lines still mostly attached. Robert Schettler, the department’s spokesperson, said that the poles were on Harrison Street between Avenues 58 and 63, a stretch of about 2 1/2 miles of roadway.\n\nInitially, he said, about 680 customers were without power around 7:30 p.m. Friday, but by 11 a.m. Saturday, power had been rerouted to all but 65 customers. Those customers, he said, will likely be without power for “several days.” Area residents can go to Desert Mirage High School on 66th Ave in Thermal, where a storm shelter has been set up for anyone without power or who otherwise feels unsafe.\n\n“If anyone sees a downed power line, do not approach it,” Schettler said by phone Saturday. “Please give us a call to report it as soon as you can.”\n\nTo report downed power poles or lines to IID, call 1-800-303-7756.\n\n—Chris Damien\n\nPalm Springs International Airport activates its comprehensive storm event plan\n\nDeputy Director of Aviation, Marketing & Air Service Daniel Meier said in a press release Saturday and confirmed seperately to The Desert Sun that Palm Springs International Airport has activated its comprehensive storm event plan to ensure the safety of passengers, staff and operations. The plan includes measures such as bringing in additional staff, activating tested backup systems and establishing plans to guarantee safety in case of power outages or other storm-related incidents.\n\nAdditionally, all backup power generators have been tested and are ready to go if needed. To mitigate potential flooding concerns, thorough inspections and clearing of storm drains around the airfield, airport roadways and terminal were conducted. Sandbags were also strategically placed around the property.\n\nIt's impossible to predict how many flights will be delayed or canceled, Meier said, but the Palm Springs International Aiport team does expect several flights to be canceled or delayed over the next couple of days. PSP requests that all passengers check with their respective airlines for the most up-to-date information concerning their flight status before heading to the airport.\n\n\"Our dedicated airport staff is fully prepared to meet the challenges of the impending tropical storm,\" Harry Barrett, executive director of Aviation at PSP, said in a statement. \"Our team's efforts underscore our determination to ensure the safety and well-being of all passengers, staff, and operations throughout this storm.\"\n\n—Niki Kottmann and Brian Blueskye\n\nSeveral flights canceled due to the storm\n\nSouthwest Airlines has already canceled afternoon flights on Saturday into Palm Springs from Sacramento, Denver, Las Vegas and Oakland as well as its full schedule into Palm Springs on Sunday, including its one daily flight from Denver as well as flights from Las Vegas and San Jose.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is the only airline so far to cancel Saturday or Sunday flights at Palm Springs International Airport.\n\nA quick check of the American Airlines website showed all three flights from Phoenix to Palm Springs and both flights from Dallas to Palm Springs for Sunday were still on time.\n\nUnited Airlines' website indicated that both daily flights from Denver and three flights from San Francisco were still on time for Sunday arrival into Palm Springs.\n\nAnyone flying should check ahead with their airline for schedule changes.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Storm weakens as rain starts in Coachella Valley\n\nSouthern California is bracing for significant heavy rainfall and extensive flooding as Hurricane Hilary reaches the region, forecasters say.\n\nHurricane Hilary headed for Mexico’s Baja California on Saturday as a downgraded Category 2 storm that the U.S. National Hurricane Center predicted will bring “catastrophic” flooding for the peninsula and for the southwestern United States, where it was forecast to cross the border as a tropical storm on Sunday.\n\nMeteorologists expect the storm also to churn up “life-threatening” surf conditions and rip currents — including waves up to 40 feet high — along Mexico’s Pacific coast.\n\nWhile it’s still likely to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, Hilary weakened from a Major Category 3 hurricane down to a Category 2 storm at midday Saturday and is expected to weaken further as it treks northward.\n\nThe forecasted strength of Hilary when it reaches Southern California has remained unchanged for two days now.\n\nLocated about 235 miles west of the southern tip of Baja California on Saturday morning, Hilary was considered \"large and powerful\" by the National Hurricane Center with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Adam Roser said on Saturday that a large area of showers and thunderstorms are coming in from the east of Palm Springs. The area could see a quarter of an inch of rainfall during the afternoon and early evening. But the heaviest rainfall is likely to occur on Sunday during the day.\n\n\"We could see a few inches of rain (on Sunday), so it'll increase tonight and a lot tomorrow, then taper off on Monday morning,\" Roser said. \"If we get some thunderstorms in the area, it will be heavy downpours, but it's going to be off and on for two days.\"\n\nRoser said as Hilary moves through the Southern California area on Sunday, winds will increase during the late morning into the afternoon with the potential of gusts up to 60 mph.\n\nForecasters said the storm could bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States, dumping 3 to 6 inches in places, with isolated amounts of up to 10 inches, in portions of southern California and southern Nevada.\n\n—Brian Blueskye and USA TODAY\n\nRare Tropical Storm Warning issued for Coachella Valley\n\nThe Coachella Valley has been upgraded to a Tropical Storm Warning as tropical storm-force winds from current Hurricane Hilary are expected to move into Southern California within the next 36 hours.\n\nThe entire valley is under the warning from Palm Springs and Desert Hot Springs in the west to Palm Desert and La Quinta in mid-valley and to Indio and Coachella in the east valley.\n\nThis is the first tropical storm warning ever issued for the Coachella Valley.\n\nThe National Weather Service warns that significant impacts from strong winds, heavy rains and possible tornadoes could impact the area.\n\nLatest forecasts are for tropical storm force winds of 45-55 miles per hour with gusts to 75 mph are possible in the Coachella Valley from Sunday afternoon until Monday morning.\n\nThe weather service advises the strong winds could cause damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects could be blown about and many large tree limbs broken off.\n\nIn addition to the wind, flooding rain of 3-6 inches with locally higher amounts are possible in the Coachella Valley.\n\nThe weather services warns emergency plans should include the potential for extreme flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues are likely.\n\nIn addition the threat for tornadoes remains possible across all of the Coachella Valley.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nUnincorporated communities especially at risk\n\nThousand Palms, Thermal, Mecca, and other unincorporated communities north of the I-10 and surrounding the Salton Sea are especially at risk because they “are not fully protected from regional flooding and residents in those areas should take extra precautions when it rains,” the Coachella Valley Water District warned on Friday afternoon.\n\nCVWD’s 16 stormwater protection channels span about 135 miles, and run along dry creekbeds that flow from the surrounding mountains into the Whitewater River/Coachella Valley Stormwater Channel, which serves as the backbone of the valley’s stormwater protection and stretches 50 miles from the Whitewater area to the Salton Sea.\n\nBut this stormwater protection is funded primarily by local property taxes, which is why unincorporated areas have lagged behind when it comes to storm protection and other important infrastructure.\n\nThe Thousand Palms area and rural areas in the eastern Coachella Valley, such as Oasis and Salton City, do not currently have flood protection, although efforts are underway to change this. Flood control projects in North Indio and the Thermal/Mecca areas are currently under construction, and CVWD is in the land acquisition phase for flood control projects in Thousand Palms and North Cathedral City.\n\nCVWD also warned drivers across the valley to take additional precautions this weekend, with a reminder that a number of roads cross stormwater channels or washes and that as little as two feet of water can cause a car or truck to lose traction and float downstream.\n\nDuring heavy storms in the Coachella Valley, streets can quickly transform into “well-functioning but rapid flood channels” and low-lying neighborhood lots into retention basins, according to CVWD.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nHow first responders are getting ready\n\nFirst responders will, of course, do their jobs during the storm. But a top Palm Springs public safety official said response times could be delayed, depending on the severity of the storm and any major issues that arise.\n\nDaniel DeSelms, the city's emergency management coordinator, added that if past storms are a guide, residents can count on wash arteries such as Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Trail to be closed. However, he said it is difficult to anticipate the extent of the storm's impacts or how long closures could last.\n\n“We're in a desert, so water is going to hit the ground, it's going to get saturated very quickly, and it's just going to run following gravity,\" he said. \"And we won't have a good picture of what that's going to look like until it actually starts raining and water starts moving.”\n\nHowever, he noted the city was mostly operational within a couple of days of the 2019 Valentine’s Day flood, even if cleanup continued for days afterward.\n\nThe city fire department has prepared for the storm by getting rafts and other rescue equipment ready to go, Capt. Nathan Gunkel said. He said he was hopeful residents would heed signs telling them not to go around barriers on flooded roadways, which he said is the department’s biggest challenge during flooding. Doing so, he said, puts at risk not only that person but the firefighters who have to rescue them.\n\nWhile this storm could be bigger than most, Gunkel said the department is no stranger to flooding events. One concern, however, is that departments often rely on aid from neighboring cities in major emergency events.\n\n“The problem with this one is it's going to affect a lot of Southern California so you might not be able to ask for assistance,” he said. “Everyone might be overwhelmed as well, which is where it is a little concerning.”\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPolice warn homeless people to leave washes for higher ground\n\nThe Palm Springs Police Department is warning people living along the Dinah Shore flood channel, the Gene Autry wash, and in the open desert at Gateway Drive west of Highway 111 to evacuate for higher ground before the storm rolls in.\n\nWith help from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, police are making announcements every 90 minutes via helicopter, drones with speakers, officers on foot and in patrol cars. The Coachella Valley Rescue Mission and Martha’s Village are also “working to get people sheltered with any available beds,” police said.\n\nPalm Springs currently has one summer overnight homeless shelter through Sept. 30 on El Cielo Road, which is operated by Martha’s Village and has 20 beds. This year’s homeless count identified 239 unsheltered people living in Palm Springs.\n\nAcross Southern California, unhoused people often set up camp along washes and flood channels as a way to stay away from public areas and businesses. But this strategy has proven deadly in past storms. Last year, three homeless people were found dead in a wash in Ontario following a Nov. 8 storm.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nDoubleheaders Saturday for Angels, Dodgers, Padres\n\nDue to the impending storm, the Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels and San Diego Padres — who by a bad stroke of luck all have home series this weekend — have canceled their Sunday games will all play doubleheaders on Saturday instead.\n\nThe Saturday schedule now looks like this: The Dodgers host the Miami Marlins at noon and 6:10 p.m. The Angels host the Tampa Bay Rays at 1:07 p.m. and 6:07 p.m. The Padres host the Arizona Diamondbacks at 12:10 p.m. and 5:40 p.m.\n\n—Shad Powers\n\nPicking up sandbags at firehouse? Be patient\n\nSome residents in Palm Springs complained online that no one was around when they went to firehouses to pick up sandbags the city is offering.\n\n“It's not that they're not trying to be helpful, it's they're out potentially saving a life,” said the city's emergency management coordinator, Daniel DeSelms. “They will be there unless they are on an emergency call trying to help.”\n\nThe city asked residents to be patient and either wait at the station for firefighters to return or try another station. They also reminded people not to block emergency vehicles with their cars as it hinders their ability to respond to emergencies.\n\nWhen asked why the sandbags could not be kept outside for residents to take, DeSelms said the city was concerned that a few people would take all of the bags. He compared it to Halloween, when people put out a bucket of candy with a sign saying “take one.”\n\n“Sure, some people might take one, but there are a lot of people who say, 'That whole bucket is mine,'” he said.\n\nDeSelms said the city is limiting each household to 10 bags because of the high demand. He said the city started with 6,000 bags, but ran out when it had simply let people take what they wanted. On Friday, he said, the city was able to get 15,000 more sandbags.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPlunge pool party canceled for Saturday\n\nThe Palm Springs Leather Order of the Desert announced Friday that its Plunge pool party has been canceled due to the impending storm.\n\nThe Plunge event, a pool party with live music, was scheduled for Saturday afternoon and evening at CCBC Resort Hotel, an LGBTQ+ destination. Organizers said in an email they had been “looking forward to a great event,” but that possible rainfall on Saturday would have affected the celebration “just as we were planning to start the party.”\n\nThose who purchased advanced tickets will receive a refund via the website Eventbrite, according to the organization.\n\n— Ema Sasic\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nJoshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve closing\n\nJoshua Tree National Park and the Mojave National Preserve both announced Friday they'll be fully closed to visitors in response to Hurricane Hilary.\n\nA Flash Flood Watch is in place for Joshua Tree National Park from Saturday at 11 a.m. through Monday at 5 p.m. Park staff said Friday they would spend the next 36 hours initiating the closure ahead of when the storm's worst impacts are expected.\n\n\"Park staff will continue to monitor the park and assess conditions as needed. Visitors are encouraged to seek shelter and have a safety plan. ... Reconsider outdoor activities for this weekend, be prepared to turn around if you experience moving water on roadways and be alert for lightning,\" stated a news release from park officials.\n\nMojave National Preserve will also be closed to visitors starting Friday at 2 p.m., with officials particularly concerned about potential debris flow from the recent York Fire.\n\n“Travel in the preserve and the surrounding region is definitely not advised during these tropical storm landfall events,” said Acting Superintendent Debra Hughson in a statement. “Debris-laden water can rise rapidly on area roads and can quickly become lethal.”\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nWhere Imperial Valley residents can get sandbags\n\nFarmers are postponing crop plantings in advance of the expected storm, and residents are encouraged to bring in or tie down all loose yard furniture, trash cans or anything that can blow away or cause damage.\n\nImperial County Fire Department and the Office of Emergency Services are also offering free sandbags and sand to residents who live in the unincorporated areas of the county and whose properties are prone to flooding.\n\nPeople will need to bring their own shovels.\n\nThe agencies have an interactive map showing which county fire stations and cities are distributing sandbags and sand. See below for addresses of the station locations:\n\nImperial (City): Imperial County Fire Station #1 & #4, Imperial, 2514 La Brucherie RoadHeber: Imperial County Fire Station #2, Heber, 1078 S. Dogwood RoadSeeley: Imperial County Fire Station #3, Seeley, 1828 Park StreetPalo Verde: Imperial County Fire Station #5, Palo Verde, 112 California 78Ocotillo: Imperial County Fire Station #6, Ocotillo, 1157 Imperial HighwayNiland: Imperial County Fire Station #7, Niland, 8071 Luxor AvenueWinterhaven: Imperial County Fire Station #8, Winterhaven, 496 3rd AvenueSalton City: Imperial County Fire Station #9, Salton City, 2256 W. Cleveland Ave.\n\nSandbags can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., but people can call their nearest station and check to see if bags can be picked up outside those hours. The limit is 10 bags per household.\n\nOfficials said the supply of sand and bags is limited and asked residents to consider their own situation first, so the sandbags can go to people whose properties are especially at risk.\n\n—Janet Wilson\n\nLatest forecast: 5 to 7 inches of rain in desert\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Samantha Connelly said Friday morning that the anticipated track of the hurricane had changed very little in the past 24 hours. She added that it was not yet clear if the hurricane will make landfall in Baja California or southern California. But regardless, she said, a substantial amount of rain should be expected in the region, especially in the Coachella Valley and surrounding desert.\n\nThe forecast called for five to seven inches of rain to fall in the desert between Saturday morning and Monday evening, which will bring a significant threat of flash floods as well as heavy winds.\n\nConnelly said rainfall and flooding are assured at this point, but their intensity will depend on how much the storm weakens before arriving in the valley.\n\n“It’s a pretty strong hurricane right now, but as it comes north into the colder waters it will be weakening,” she said. “It could arrive here as a tropical storm or it could be post-tropical.”\n\nA tropical storm must have winds of between 39 and 73 mph, while a hurricane has winds of 74 mph or more.\n\nRainfall amounts could vary substantially depending on how the storm and the bands within it that carry the heaviest moisture move across the region.\n\n“We are not looking at a steady kind of rain here,” she said. “It’s going to be coming in bursts.”\n\nIn the weather service’s morning discussion, they advised the heaviest rainfall will occur along the desert (east-facing) slopes Sunday evening into Monday morning, where rain rates could reach 3 inches per hour. Elsewhere, rain rates, even in short bursts, could top one to two-inches per hour in any rain band.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nSplash House says it'll carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of the Palm Springs music festival and pool party Splash House announced Friday the event will go on as scheduled.\n\nSplash House returns this weekend at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels. After Hours programming at the Palm Springs Air Museum starts Friday, featuring performances by Franklyn Watts, Lubelski and Chris Lake.\n\nIn a statement posted on Instagram, organizers advised attendees to download the Splash House app for \"real-time updates\" through the weekend.\n\nSome rejoiced in the comment section, but not all agreed with the organizers' move. One user replied with the comment \"Hurricane House\" and another said \"This is a damn hurricane and y'all are encouraging us to make it out — your greed is showing.\"\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nAs preparations continued, several valley cities announced that they were opening sites where residents could get and fill free sandbags. Here's the most up-to-date list of sites:\n\nPalm Springs\n\nEmpty sandbags can be picked up at all five city fire stations from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Here are their locations:\n\nFire Station 1: 277 N. Indian Avenue\n\nFire Station 2: 300 N. El Cielo\n\nFire Station 3: 590 E. Racquet Club Drive\n\nFire Station 4: 1300 La Verne Way\n\nFire Station 5: 5800 Bolero Road\n\nResidents can pick up sand to fill the bags with at Palm Springs City Hall, which is located at 3200 East Tahquitz Canyon Way.\n\nCathedral City\n\nThe city announced that empty sandbags will be available from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. at Fire Station 412, which is located off of Ramon Road at 32100 Desert Vista. Shovels are also being provided on site to make it easier for residents to scoop sand to fill the bags with.\n\nRancho Mirage\n\nSandbags, shovels and sand will be available starting at noon on Friday at two locations:\n\nThe Rancho Mirage Library and Observatory at 71100 Highway 111 in a dirt lot on the west side of the parking lot\n\nFire Station 69 at 71751 Gerald Ford Drive\n\nOther cities\n\nThe Riverside County Fire Department said limited quantities of unfilled sandbags are available at its stations. There are over 20 stations in the Coachella Valley and surrounding cities, including stations in Palm Desert, La Quinta, Rancho Mirage, Desert Hot Springs, Indio, Coachella, Indian Wells, Mecca, Banning and Idyllwild.\n\nThe department has created an online tool for residents to find the closest station to their home. It can be accessed here.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nWhat to expect with a tropical storm watch\n\nThe service said a storm watch, which was issued at around 8:30 a.m. Friday, means that tropical storm-force winds — sustained speeds of 39 to 73 mph — are possible within the next 48 hours.\n\nThe current forecast calls for peak winds of around 40 to 55 mph, with the highest winds expected between Sunday afternoon and early Monday morning.\n\nThe service says the winds could cause some weaker trees to snap or be uprooted and be enough to blow away objects such as awnings, sheds and even unanchored mobile homes. It also warned that roads could become impassable from debris.\n\nHowever, the biggest threat from the storm is expected to be the rain and potential flooding, which could make it necessary to evacuate people from flooded areas and rescue those who become stranded.\n\nThe weather service cautioned that “in mountain areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed.” The storm will also have the potential to flood and even wash away structures while escape routes could also be covered by water.\n\nThe storm even brings a limited risk of tornados and warned that people should be prepared to shelter quickly in the event of one.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/environment/960113/the-worlds-most-extreme-weather-events-in-2023", "title": "The world's most extreme weather events in 2023 | The Week UK", "text": "Wildfires, floods and heatwaves have continued to make headlines as communities across the world have had their homes and lives threatened by deadly weather conditions.\n\nThis year already \"seems destined to be remembered as the year that extreme weather events left the Northern Hemisphere reeling\", said National Geographic.

It's still too early to determine where the storm might hit.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that residents could feel the effects of the storm into early next week. He encouraged everyone to prepare now by having at least seven days of disaster supplies.\n\nThe weather system, which should soon be Tropical Storm Isaias, was dumping heavy rain across the Leeward Islands of the eastern Caribbean on Wednesday, potentially unleashing \"life-threatening\" flash flooding and mudslides. This includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.\n\nAfter moving near Puerto Rico on Wednesday night, the system will affect the Dominican Republic and Cuba before making its way to the U.S. mainland, possibly Florida, by the weekend.\n\nPresident Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration request from Puerto Rico’s governor, who also activated the National Guard.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said the system, dubbed Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, is expected to strengthen before it makes landfall in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, although the center cautioned it’s still unclear what the storm would do in upcoming days.\n\n“The details of the long-range track and intensity forecasts remain more uncertain than usual since the system does not have a well-defined center and it is expected to move near or over portions of the Greater Antilles later this week and move near or over Florida this weekend,” the center said.\n\n\"While this system could bring some rainfall and wind impacts to portions of Cuba, the central and northwest Bahamas, and Florida later this week and this weekend, it is too\n\nsoon to determine the location or magnitude of those impacts,\" the center said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were issued for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nHurricane names:From Arthur to Wilfred, here's the list of hurricane names for the 2020 season\n\nOfficials in Puerto Rico expressed concern about the potential for landslides and flooding and noted the U.S. territory is struggling with a spike in coronavirus cases while also still recovering from 2017’s devastating Hurricane Maria and a string of earthquakes earlier this year that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes in the island’s south.\n\nAt a news conference, Gov.

For the latest news on Beryl, please follow USA TODAY's live updates on the storm for Tuesday, July 9.Tropical Storm Beryl unleashed a barrage of severe weather to southeast Texas on Monday, killing at least four people, flooding highways, closing oil ports, canceling more than 1,300 flights and knocking out power to more than 2.7 million homes and businesses.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Beryl, the season's earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, weakened from a hurricane after pounding the coastal Texas town of Matagorda, a coastal community between Corpus Christi and Galveston. It had sustained winds of more than 80 mph as it made landfall at 4 a.m. CT.\n\nThe agency said current conditions could spawn tornadoes in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. By 7 p.m. CT, the weather service office in Shreveport, Louisiana, reported it had issued over 50 tornado warnings. The office had also stacked up a list of a half-dozen possible tornadoes.\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire said most of the city was experiencing flood waters of more than 10 inches. \"We're literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions,\" he said Monday.\n\nIn a suburban part of Harris County, just northeast of Houston, a man was killed when a tree fell on his home and trapped him under debris, according to Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. In northern Harris County, a tree fell onto a house and killed a 74-year-old woman, Gonzalez said on social media.\n\nAt least two more people died: A Houston Police Department civilian employee got caught in flood waters driving to work; in southeast Houston, a man was killed in a fire believed to have been started by lightning, Whitmire said at a news conference Monday evening.\n\nLast week, Beryl carved a path of destruction across the Caribbean — leaving at least 11 people dead and destroying or severely damaging infrastructure on several islands. Beryl, which at one point strengthened into the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, last made landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Friday morning.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Officials in Fort Bend County outside of Houston evacuated the residents of an apartment building badly hit by the storm to local fairgrounds, the county’s Emergency Management Agency announced Monday evening.\n\n∎ Beryl’s maximum sustained winds fell to around 35 mph by 7 p.m. local time. The tropical depression is expected to weaken into a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday, according to a National Weather Service advisory. It is expected to move through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the Ohio Valley on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n∎ More than 2.7 million homes and businesses in Texas lost power, according to Patrick and PowerOutage.us. Several counties in southeastern Texas — including Houston, where many U.S. energy companies are headquartered — are under a flash-flood warning as thunderstorms unleashed up to nearly 12 inches of rain in some areas.\n\n∎ Closures of major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston, and Houston ahead of the storm could disrupt crude oil exports and shipments of crude to refineries and motor fuel from the plants. The Corpus Christi Ship Channel has re-opened, while the Port of Houston was projected to resume operations on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n∎ At least two locations on the west side of Houston experienced major flooding Monday, according to the National Water Prediction Service. They included the White Oak Bayou, where the water rose more than 25 feet, and the Buffalo Bayou, where the water rose 24 feet, both within about 9 hours.\n\n∎ Across eastern Texas, heavy rain and flooding triggered water rescues as people became trapped in their homes and vehicles.\n\nMore flooding expected in Houston\n\nAs Beryl drenched the region north of Houston, officials urged residents to stay off the roads.\n\n“Don’t let the clear skies fool you,” Whitmire said. “We still have dangerous circumstances, we still have high water.”\n\nRussell Richardson, a Houston Police Department information security officer, died after getting caught in floodwaters on his way to work Monday morning, the police shared on social media. He was 54.\n\nBrent Taylor, chief communications officer for the city’s Office of Emergency Management, said rain falling north of the city went through Houston’s bayou system, a network of creeks that can easily overflow.\n\n“The flooding isn’t over,” he said. “We anticipate the cresting will happen later as the water moves down to the Gulf of Mexico.”\n\nAdditional flooding plus the impact of the power outage on city traffic lights will continue to make driving dangerous, he said.\n\nBeryl produces tornadoes\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center documented nearly a dozen tornado reports produced by Beryl as it moved north from Texas into Louisiana and Arkansas. Local National Weather Service officials issued over 60 tornado warnings.\n\nA condo building in Jasper County, Texas, took a direct hit from a tornado Monday morning, local emergency management officials told the National Weather Service; a twister in Timpson, Texas, 25 miles from the Lousiana border, tore the roof off of City Hall.\n\nMost of the tornadoes were reported in Texas and Louisiana, with an additional report in Arkansas. Nearly all of Southern Arkansas and Western Louisiana were under tornadoe watch, according to the weather service.\n\nHurricane Beryl's strength caught people off guard\n\nHal Needham, an extreme weather scientist widely known to other locals in Galveston, Texas, as \"Hurricane Hal\", was up just after 4 a.m. Monday to monitor the storm and livestream updates.\n\n\"We've had some pretty big squalls today with widespread power outages,\" he said. \"I think the storm was a lot stronger than a lot of people expected.\"\n\nNeedham also was concerned that continuing power outages would leave residents vulnerable to high-80s heat and high humidity. \"This is the hottest time of the year,\" he said. \"If people still don't have power, there could really be some issues with heat exhaustion, with heat-related illnesses, especially for elderly people with health conditions.\"\n\nAlthough people from the area are hurricane-savvy, this storm hit earlier than most, catching them off guard, Needham said. \"Only 3% of major hurricanes usually happen in June or July,\" he said. \"Typically, Texas does not get a lot of July and June hurricane landfalls.\"\n\n\"I think people were really surprised by how hard and how quickly this hit,\" he added.\n\nHigh heat index, no A/C will make for harsh early recovery\n\nThe early part of the recovery from Beryl's ravages will be an arduous, sweaty task made a lot more uncomfortable by the power outages affecting millions of Texans amid the summer heat.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Houston issued a heat advisory for Tuesday in southeast Texas, where a heat index of 105 Fahrenheit is expected.\n\n\"While this would normally be below criteria (for the advisory), the widespread loss of power and A/C will make for dangerous conditions,'' the Houston office said. \"Those working outside may not have a chance to properly cool off!''\n\nThe heat index combines air temperature with relative humidity to provide a measure of what the temperature actually feels like to people. The thermometer is expected to rise to 93 degrees in Houston on Tuesday and Wednesday, and which along with relative humidity of close to 80 may send the heat index past the 110 mark.\n\nThe Houston office warned about the possibility of heat-related illnesses and advised residents to limit outdoor activities, drink lots of water, wear light clothing, and try to work during cooler times of the day.\n\nWhat now?Where are Beryl's remnants headed next? Flooding rain; tornadoes possible\n\nGalveston resident says first hurricane will be her last\n\nAlanna Carter endured her first hurricane Monday night when Beryl passed over her home in Galveston. \"I don't want to go through that ever again,\" the 44-year-old bartender said hours after the storm passed through the area.\n\n\"If that was only a Cat 1, I can only imagine what Ike was like and that was a Cat 4,\" she said of Hurricane Ike, which struck Texas in 2008, before Carter's arrival.\n\nCarter said Beryl lashed her house with fierce wind and rain. \"It literally shook the entire house,\" she said, adding the neighborhood was dark after losing power. She doesn't expect it back for days.\n\nThough her house wasn't severely damaged, Carter said a neighbor lost a window and the area was covered with debris left behind by Beryl, including fallen trees, shingles, plastic and trash. The next time a hurricane heads for Galveston, Carter doesn't plan to stick around.\n\n\"This is not my jam,'' she said. \"I mean, I was nauseous because my anxiety was so high.\"\n\nBeryl knocks out power for over 2 million people in Texas\n\nMore than 2.1 million customers were out of power in eastern Texas, according to the power company CenterPoint Energy. It’s unclear how many of those customers were in Houston. On its website, CenterPoint Energy said the service was disrupted by 5,993 active outages.\n\nAccording to PowerOutage.us, an outage tracker, more than 2.7 million homes and businesses across Texas were without power.\n\nStorm does heavy damage in last 30 minutes\n\nRichard Reyes thought the worst of the storm had passed him and his family by. Then their house in northeast Houston started flooding with up to a foot of water, the power went out and a huge tree toppled in front of their place.\n\n“All of this happened in the last 30 minutes of the storm,'' said Reyes, 73, a retired actor and arts advocate who as his Santa-like alter ego, “Pancho Claus,” distributes thousands of toys annually to mostly Latino kids in the Houston area.\n\nReyes, who saw similar damage during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 when he lived elsewhere in Houston, said the floodwaters moved in even after the rain stopped. He said his son didn't trust the tall tree would stay upright and moved the family cars just before it fell into the street where the vehicles had been, somehow avoiding pulling multiple power lines down along the way.\n\nReyes said his son and neighbors were out Monday morning cutting through the tree to clear the way so vehicles could pass. In the meantime, they’re hoping FEMA will cover some of the damage.\n\n“Luckily, everyone is safe,” he said.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nLiving next to a seawall, 'our whole building was shaking'\n\nTom Sheppard, 59, was jolted awake at 3:30 Monday morning by the storm raging through Galveston. \"It was a lot worse than we thought,\" he said, pointing out he lives next to the seawall. \"Our whole building was shaking.\"\n\nThe winds ripped down the wrought iron fence around his gated community, bringing down gutters and part of a wall.\n\nVenturing out after the storm passed, Sheppard saw the destruction was widespread. \"All the palm trees are snapped in half,\" he said. \"All the power poles are down. It's flooded. It got pretty bad.\"\n\nIn Galveston, a fish swimming on a flooded street\n\nJacob Jonathan, 21, awoke Monday to harsh winds banging on the window of his Galveston home, which he found \"a little stressful.''\n\nJonathan said his street was flooded with nearly a foot of water. At one point, he looked out his window to see a fish jump. Debris littered the neighborhood, and a fence was knocked down by the wind, he said.\n\nBy midday, Jonathan was still out of power, and said some friends in Galveston also were without water. \"We're mainly worried about our food going bad in the fridge,\" he said.\n\nJonathan spent the morning at home after the auto repair shop where he works delayed opening until the afternoon because of the storm, and he was waiting to see when conditions improved.\n\n\"Our house is lifted and we don't have any leaking,\" he added. \"The only nuisance right now is we had to pick up after our animals because they can't really walk in the water.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl 'has been rough'\n\nDonna Radin said she was startled awake by the “very strong howl” of wind rattling her home as rain came down in sheets early Monday morning.\n\nThe 58-year-old travel agent lives in Deer Park, a small city east of Houston. Around 5 a.m., as the conditions worsened, she heard a generator blow just down the block, and soon her home lost power.\n\nHuddled inside with her daughter, two granddaughters and five dogs, Radin said she's avoided the windows but can see lots of downed trees and the remnants of a fence that was ripped out of the ground and hurled several yards away.\n\n\"It's the most intense Cat 1 I've ever been through,\" said Radin, who has lived on the Texas Gulf Coast all her life. \"I told my husband, 'Our next investment will be remote-controlled hurricane shutters,' because this has been rough.\"\n\nMore:Hurricane Beryl tracker: Storm makes landfall in Texas, see spaghetti models, path\n\nBeryl causes over 1,000 flight cancellations in Houston\n\nMore than 1,000 flights across airports in Houston were canceled Monday as Beryl bore down on the city.\n\nAt George Bush Intercontinental Airport, over 1,000 arriving and departing flights were canceled, according to FightAware. The smaller William P. Hobby Airport had over 300 cancellations, FlightAware said.\n\nHouston is a major hub for United Airlines, which is enduring the worst of the operational impacts from the storm. About 14% of United’s flights, around 400 departures, have been canceled Monday.\n\nTexas power outage map\n\nBeryl brings flooding, prompting water rescues\n\nAcross eastern Texas, officials in multiple counties said first responders were rescuing people trapped in their cars and homes amid Hurricane Beryl's deluge.\n\nGonzalez, the Harris County sheriff, asked drivers to \"please stay off the roadways\" as heavy rain drenched Houston and its surrounding areas.\n\nThe police department in Rosenberg, just southwest of Houston, said it was conducting water rescues and warned residents about falling trees and ongoing flooding.\n\n'We need help':Honeymoon now a 'prison nightmare,' after Hurricane Beryl strands couple in Jamaica\n\n\"Street flooding, downed trees, power outages and water rescues. All of that is happening right now in Rosenberg. Please stay off of the roads,'' the Rosenberg Police Department said on X. \"A downed tree even fell (on) one of our high water rescue vehicles coming back from a rescue.\"\n\nIn Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston, officials in a statement on X asked residents to, \"Please stay home until the storm passes.\" The statement from the county said, \"trees and debris are all over the roads, several roads flooded and most signals are out.\" It added that deputies were responding to \"stranded/flooded motorists.\"\n\nIt's hurricane season.See which previous storms passed near your neighborhood\n\nHurricane Beryl hits records amid projected busy hurricane season\n\nOn July 1, Beryl made landfall in Grenada's Carriacou Island as a Category 4 hurricane and tore through the southern Caribbean Islands, flattening hundreds of buildings.\n\nLater that night, Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. Driven by record-high ocean temperatures, Beryl's rapid strengthening stunned experts. Beryl was also the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record and is the first June major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles on record.\n\nFederal forecasters have predicted a hurricane season unlike any other, with as many as 25 named storms possible.

Hilary was toppling trees and causing mudslides in the San Diego area.\n\nHilary was the first tropical storm to cross into California from Mexico since Nora in 1997, the weather service office in San Diego said Sunday night. If Hilary had come in off the ocean in a landfall in California, it would have been the first tropical storm to do so since 1939.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream, The Associated Press reported. Rescue workers saved four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nMud and boulders spilled onto highways, water overwhelmed drainage systems and tree branches fell in neighborhoods from San Diego to Los Angeles. Dozens of cars were trapped in floodwaters in Palm Springs and surrounding desert communities across the Coachella Valley. Crews pumped floodwaters out of the emergency room at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who is traveling to Hawaii on Monday to survey damage from devastating wildfires in Maui, urged \"everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance of state and local officials.\"\n\nTropical Storm Hilary tracker:Follow the storm’s path as it heads toward Southern California\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ Thousands of Southern California residents were without power on Sunday as storm conditions took down power lines. Over 7,000 Imperial Irrigation District customers in the eastern Coachella Valley and Imperial County service area were without power while over 31,000 Southern California Edison customers lost power areas in or near Los Angeles county.\n\n◾ The National Weather Service extended its flash flood warning for the Los Angeles area until 3:00 a.m. local time. The agency warned some parts of the area would experience life-threatening flooding as the fire department conducted water rescues for cars stuck in flooded roads.\n\n◾ The Los Angeles school district, the second largest in the nation, said all its schools will be closed Monday. The San Diego school district, which planned to begin its fall term Monday, said it will delay the start of classes to Tuesday.\n\n◾ The city of Palm Springs declared an emergency, \"due to unprecedented rainfall in flooding of local roadways and at least one swift water rescue.\" The declaration, according to spokesperson Amy Blaisdell, opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\n◾ In Southern California, at least two debris flows have been reported over roadways in San Bernardino, and rocks have been reported on roads in three locations in Kern, the National Weather Service said. Two semi-trucks were reported flipped along Interstate 8 in Imperial, the weather service added.\n\n◾ Hilary’s rainfall is an extreme, record-breaking event, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There’s a very clear link between increases in extreme precipitation and global warming,” Swain said. In a warmer world, “the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water vapor increases exponentially.”\n\n◾ California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency, and authorities issued an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, 23 miles off the coast.\n\n◾ As the storm rolls north, portions of Oregon and Idaho could see as much as 3 to 5 inches of rain, producing some \"significant\" flash flooding, the National Weather Service said.\n\n'Walls were moving quite a bit'\n\nLouis Brown, a security guard at Ralph’s grocery store in Marina del Rey, California, surveyed the customers at about 8 p.m. Sunday night. “Last night it was chaos, havoc,’’ Brown told USA TODAY. “It was packed until 1 o’clock, and I could see the fear in their eyes and their soul.’’\n\nHe was referring to the customers stocking up on food before the storm arrived. And less than 24 hours later? “Nothing,’’ he said, looking around the store. “No chaos.’’\n\nWith the initial hurricane having weakened to a tropical storm, Brown presumed those panicked shoppers survived Hilary as did he -- without incident.\n\nRain fell for most of the day, but 17-year-old Michael Gatto said he still rode his skateboard to work at Local Pizza a block from Venice Beach.\n\n“I did it on purpose so I could tell people that,’’ he said.\n\nHe said business was slow but picked up toward the end of the day. One of his last customers of the night was Andrea Iucci, who said he was in town from Amsterdam and visiting with his wife and two children. Originally, Iucci said, they planned to vacation in Maui. But the deadly fires in Hawaii prompted them to head to Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, their third day in Los Angeles, they experienced not only the storm but also the earthquake. He said they were on the top floor of a nearby hotel when the earthquake with a 5.1 magnitude hit.\n\n“The walls were moving quite a bit,’’ he said. “But it’s OK. As long as everyone’s safe.\"\n\nSenior community impacted by flooding in Coachella Valley\n\nAbout 60 homes at the Canyon Mobile Home Community in Cathedral City have been impacted by flooding, according to Cathedral City Councilmember Nancy Ross, who also lives in the 55 and older community of 350 homes.\n\n“On the (most impacted streets), there was in several locations at least three feet of rushing water that was like a river and had a current of its own, it’s frightening,” Ross said. “And that rushing water by nature just wanted to follow a straight path up into people’s driveways and into their garages, and so many people flooded.”\n\nRoss says damage to the roughly 60 impacted homes includes water flooded into garages or homes, and water under the mobile homes. Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris.\n\nThe Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park Sunday afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n— Erin Rode, Desert Sun\n\nMudslides and debris flow through mountain and desert areas\n\nBy Sunday evening, Hilary had moved over San Diego and was headed north into inland desert areas.\n\nResidents of the Coachella Valley had previously expressed anxiety and fear over the storm as many spent the past few days preparing by filling up sandbags as a precaution. And as Hilary closed in on the area Sunday night, the heavy rain turned roadways into rivers and filled up the local wash.\n\nCities within the desert region are at risk of dangerous flooding due to their location and environment. Surrounded by several mountain ranges, waterways in the area can be overwhelmed by the heavy rain and can cause waters to quickly rise.\n\n“This entire valley is basically a giant river bottom,” Palm Springs resident Carley Pinkney told the New York Times.\n\nIn an area where residents are accustomed to intense heat and the blaring sun during this time of year, Hilary is bringing record rain. Palm Springs set a daily record for rainfall on Sunday, recording more than two inches as of 5 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“Usually, when the weatherman says rain, they’re wrong because we get rain like one and a half days a year,” resident Michael Matera told the Times.\n\n“When it rains, it just sits there, like it’s in a bowl,\" he added.\n\nIn the San Bernardino Mountains, AccuWeather storm chaser Aaron Rigsby said a large mudslide moved boulders and trees onto the roadway in Forest Falls. Images and videos of the mud slide showed debris flowing in muddy waters, completely covering roads.\n\nSan Bernardino County declared a local emergency Sunday afternoon and the sheriff's department issued evacuation orders for several communities, including Forest Falls.\n\nSouthern California cities see impacts of Hilary\n\nThe full strength of the tropical storm had yet to reach the city of Diamond Bar in Los Angeles County Sunday evening, but the environment is already seeing some effects.A large tree broke off onto one of the city’s major streets on Sunday afternoon. A police car blocked off the route as it covered one whole side of the street that was near a business center.After spurts of rain were scattered throughout the day, the rain began to pick up in the afternoon, as some streets began to see some flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Diego County, strong winds and moderate rain toppled trees, moved boulders, and flooded roadways. San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria declared a state of emergency on Sunday as the storm's center closed in on the region.\n\nThe weather service in San Diego issued several flash flood and tornado warnings Sunday afternoon for the eastern part of the county. During a live broadcast, the agency said it was watching \"one of the remnant eyewall bands moving through the county,\" bringing the heaviest rain.\n\n\"This is the type of rain that can cause urban flooding, mud debris, even sometimes flash flooding,\" the agency said. \"... Never before has there been a tropical storm level system intact moving through San Diego County.\"\n\nSeveral roadways were closed or blocked off due to rock slides and rising waters. Crews from the California Department of Transportation were working on Interstate 8 near In-Ko-Pah near the U.S.-Mexico border after boulders had moved into the road.\n\nEarthquake shakes Southern California amid Hilary threat\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 jolted parts of Southern California Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, as residents in the region braced for Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nThe earthquake was centered about four miles southeast of Ojai, California, about 80 miles northwest of Los Angeles. It struck shortly after 2:40 p.m. local time at a depth of approximately 9 miles, the USGS said.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, several aftershocks with magnitudes up to nearly 4 were recorded in the area, according to the USGS. The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunamis were expected.\n\nTo the best understanding of geoscientists, the earthquake is coincidental, and not related to heavy rainfall in the Los Angeles area, Daniel L. Swain, a climate scientist at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles, told USA TODAY on Sunday.\n\nCanceled flights, closed amusement parks, rescheduled MLB games\n\nCanceled and delayed flights, closed amusement parks, and rescheduled baseball games are among the early impacts of Hilary's approach to the U.S.\n\nSouthwest has canceled more than 700 flights scheduled for Sunday and nearly 190 flights set for Monday, according to FlightAware, which tracks flight status in real-time. Other major carriers like United, American, Delta, and JetBlue were impacted as well.\n\n\"As California’s largest carrier, we’ve made proactive adjustments to our flight schedule throughout the weekend and have communicated with affected customers,'' Southwest told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nAmusement parks like LEGOLAND California and Knotts Berry Farm closed their doors Sunday, as did the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld in the same city. Disneyland in Anaheim is shutting down early, at 9 p.m. PT.\n\nMajor League Baseball moved up three games scheduled Sunday in Southern California ballparks. Each of the games – Arizona at San Diego, Tampa Bay at the Los Angeles Angels, and Miami at the Los Angeles Dodgers — were turned into split doubleheaders Saturday to avoid issues with the storm.\n\n'Glassy' waves draw surfers to Venice Beach\n\nMore than a dozen surfers and one pelican braved the extraordinary weather conditions at Los Angeles’ famed Venice Beach with distinctly differently goals Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor the surfers, this was the perfect storm to ride out the waves, and they were not going to be deterred by a sign saying swimming was prohibited. After all, they were technically not breaking any rules.\n\nDamien Rho, an 18-year-old lifeguard from Santa Monica, arrived with his surfboard and a good bit of knowledge about the last time a storm like Hilary hit these shores.\n\n“It’s not every day you get a hurricane out here. You gotta get out here. When is the last time, 1939?” Rho said, getting the year exactly right even if Hilary has actually been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nRho said the increasingly large waves were “glassy,’’ a surfer term for smooth water.\n\nTwo other surfers said these were the best conditions they’d seen at Venice in weeks, brushing off safety concerns by saying it was more dangerous to drive the highway to the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe pelican seemed unimpressed and eventually flew away. Apparently, the fishing wasn’t nearly as good as the surfing.\n\nDisaster relief funding running low, FEMA head warns\n\nAhead of Tropical Storm Hilary and other weather disasters, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, warned that her agency is running low on cash to respond to the deadly events in the future.\n\n“We do still anticipate that we will have a shortage of funding at our current spending levels by mid-September,” Criswell said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” If needed, Criswell said, FEMA will push back recovery projects into the next fiscal year to ensure there is enough funding for any “immediate lifesaving needs.”\n\nFEMA’s disaster relief funding shortfall is against the backdrop of numerous weather disasters that have resulted in hundreds of lives lost and billions of dollars in damage, including deadly wildfires in the Hawaiian island of Maui that have claimed over 100 lives alone.\n\nHomeless vulnerable as Hilary advances\n\nVolunteers have been driving the streets of Los Angeles passing out tarps and plastic bags to people without homes so they can try and keep themselves and their belongings dry. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department warned those without a place to stay to move away from riverbeds and other likely flooding locations.\n\nIn Venice Beach, west of downtown Los Angeles, Bobby Geivet arrived at about 6:30 a.m. with a cooler, weathered guitar, a tarp and a plan. Geivet, 45, said he’s homeless but not defenseless against the storm. He tied his tarp between two palm trees and anchored it by using a stone to pound makeshift stakes into the ground. He said he planned to set up a hammock underneath the tarp.\n\n“I like to be high and dry,\" he said. “It’s going to be wet, but I want to be as dry as I can.\"\n\nJoshua Tree National Park closed because of flooding concerns\n\nCoachella Valley could see year's worth of rain over a few days\n\nTropical Storm Emily takes shape but may not last long\n\nWhat began as a large area of low pressure off the Cabo Verde Islands has become well-defined enough to earn a name and designation.\n\nTropical Storm Emily, with maximum sustained winds of almost 50 mph, was heading west-northwest in the Atlantic Ocean at nearly 10 mph Sunday.

For the latest news, follow our live updates on the weather forecast for Wednesday, Jan. 10.\n\nA blockbuster storm with heavy rain and powerful winds sparked tornadoes across the South on Tuesday − ripping roofs off buildings, toppling trees and blowing over RVs − after the system roared across the Midwest with blizzard conditions en route to the Northeast.\n\nAt least four people were killed in areas of the South hit hard by rain, wind and suspected tornadoes, and several people were reported injured in Florida.\n\nAcross the central U.S., the storm shut down major highways as it pummeled the region with whiteout conditions and packed roadways with snow. On Monday and through early Tuesday, Kansas Highway Patrol responded to over 100 vehicle crashes, 19 of which resulted in injuries. In Boise City, Oklahoma, the emergency management department said it responded to calls reporting several stranded motorists and said all roads were closed.\n\nMany schools and government buildings were closed in Florida. Some schools in parts of Virginia and Maryland also planned early dismissals. Airports across the Midwest and Southeast reported a surge of delays and cancellations Tuesday morning.\n\nIn the Southeast, the National Weather Service confirmed at least three tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, where wind gusts as high as 106 mph were reported. A thunderstorm over southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia had winds recorded at speeds of 70 mph and hail the size of baseballs, according to the weather service.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 49 of the state's 67 counties.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northeast was preparing for heavy rainfall just days after the region was hammered over the weekend by a significant snowstorm that dropped up to 22 inches of snow in New England. As the storm moves toward the Northeast later Tuesday and rain begins to fall over snow-covered areas, the potential for flooding will be widespread, especially along low-lying areas, swollen creeks and streams.\n\nThe weather service forecasts 1 to 3 inches of rain for New England by nightfall Tuesday. Much of the coast is under wind and flood advisories as gusts of 50 mph are anticipated.\n\nA flood warning for the nation’s capital was in effect Tuesday evening as river gauges indicated some spots, especially urban areas, were already flooding. Parts of Washington D.C., central Maryland, and northern Virginia could flood Tuesday night, the weather service warned, as up to 2.5 inches of rain had already fallen with another 1.5 inches possible.\n\nThe intensifying storm around the D.C. area stranded multiple vehicles in rising water Tuesday night as Prince George’s County Fire and EMS Department in Maryland said seven people were rescued from their vehicles. No injuries were reported.\n\nNew York City was under a flood watch through Wednesday morning as the weather service warned of “widespread urban and poor drainage flooding.\" Parts of southeast New York, including Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx could get 2 to 3 inches of rain, an advisory said, with potential for flash flooding and localized higher rainfall.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Federal Aviation Administration announced ground stops at the Orlando International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Tuesday afternoon due to the hazardous weather. Over 21,000 flights across the country were delayed Tuesday and about 2,000 were canceled, according to FlightAware.\n\n∎ More than 810,000 utility customers across the nation were without power Tuesday evening, including about 175,000 in North Carolina, 126,000 in Pennsylvania and nearly 80,000 in New York.\n\n∎ The National Weather Service office in Tallahassee, Florida, is planning to send out three tornado survey teams on Wednesday — to examine suspected tornado damage in Walton, Bay. and Jackson counties — and two more on Thursday — to look at Houston County, Alabama, and Calhoun County, Georgia.\n\nRead:2023 was Earth's hottest year, experts say.\n\n4 killed as storms rage across the South\n\nAuthorities said the storm system caused at least four deaths in Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina on Tuesday.\n\nOne person was killed and four people were injured in Claremont, North Carolina when a storm went through Catawba County, damaging multiple homes in a mobile home park, Catawba County spokesperson Amy McCauley told USA TODAY. About 30 people were displaced by the storm, she said, and the American Red Cross was assisting with shelter efforts.\n\nMcCauley said the National Weather Service is evaluating whether the storm was a tornado.\n\nPolice in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, say a man died during heavy rain when a tree fell on his car on a state highway in Jonesboro.\n\nOne person in Birmingham, Alabama, died when a tree fell on a vehicle, Birmingham Fire and Rescue Capt. Orlando Reynolds said Tuesday, CNN reported.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman died in Cottonwood, Alabama, after an apparent tornado touched down around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Houston County Coroner Robert Byrd confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nCharlotte Paschal's mobile home was picked up by the storm and \"rolled\" three to four times, Byrd said.\n\nWDHN reported the city was on lockdown after the storm inflicted extensive damage, including to the town hall. Residents were trapped in their homes and had to be rescued earlier Tuesday, the outlet reported.\n\n\"The town of Cottonwood is basically destroyed,” Cottonwood Director of Public Safety Jim Smith told WDHN.\n\nMore wild weather is on the horizon\n\nThe deadly storm raking the entire eastern U.S. Tuesday is the opening act for what's to come over the next week: A potential \"bomb cyclone\" blizzard for the Midwest, an arctic blast courtesy of the Polar Vortex, and possibly the first real East Coast snowstorm in years.\n\n\"The atmosphere is making up for lost time in terms of wintry conditions and snow following a relatively mild and snowless start to the season,\" said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.\n\nSnow is likely to pile up in several big Midwestern cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and Kansas City. As much as one to two feet of snow is possible in some areas, AccuWeather said. And just like Tuesday's storm, more severe thunderstorms are forecast to rumble across the South and Southeast, the Storm Prediction Center warned.\n\n\"Strong thunderstorm development is possible Thursday night across parts of central and eastern Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley, where storms may increasingly pose a risk for severe hail, wind and tornadoes prior to daybreak Friday,\" the prediction center said.\n\nA polar vortex is just the beginning:January's weather forecast is chaotic and dangerous\n\nIowa roads and towns are blanketed in snow\n\nTrisch Hoelting shoveled out her driveway and the sidewalks surrounding her home in Bettendorf, Iowa, three times as heavy snow fell Tuesday morning and intensified into the afternoon hours.\n\nAt about 1 p.m., local time, the wind began picking up and Hoelting, a 62-year-old saleswoman for an HVAC contracting company, said the snow started to fall sideways. Hoelting said drivers were told to stay home and off the roads, which by 10 a.m. were blanketed by snow.\n\nForecasters expect areas throughout Iowa and the Midwest to receive snow totals well into the double digits by day’s end. Davenport, the city just west of Bettendorf, had 8.2 inches of snow by noon, according to the weather service.\n\nRoads across the Midwest from Des Moines, to eastern Nebraska, northern Kansas City and northwestern Illinois were completely covered in snow Tuesday. Iowa's Department of Transportation sent about 700 snowplows out to try and clear the roads.\n\nHoelting’s daughter, a local school teacher, stayed home as the public school district canceled classes for the day.\n\n“This is the worst storm this season – by far,” she said.\n\n'God spared me': Tornado rips through Marianna, Florida\n\nDoris Leona Peacock was awakened Tuesday morning by what sounded like shingles being ripped off her house.\n\nAs she rushed out of bed, she saw her power was out. She corralled her two dogs – Marley and Blue – in the hallway, where she sat with them after closing all the doors inside her home.\n\n“We just had the walls between us,” Peacock, 75, told USA TODAY. “I could still hear that wind.”\n\nWhat Peacock didn’t know was that a tornado had ripped through Marianna, a city of about 6,200 hundred people between Panama City and Tallahassee, leaving widespread damage it its wake. It was one of at least three tornadoes that formed throughout the Florida Panhandle early Tuesday.\n\nWhile she was huddled with her dogs, Peacock’s son, who lives about 10 miles away, called her and said a tree had crashed through his living room window, and that, luckily, no one in the house was hurt. Two of his campers were destroyed; one had been tossed into his neighbor's yard.\n\nAround 9 a.m., Peacock ventured outside. Some of the facade was torn off her home and her chain-link fence was bent. A tree had fallen over a nearby power line and debris was littered across the street.\n\nHer street was largely spared. But just a short walk away is Arrowhead Campsites, where entire RVs and campers were flattened. AccuWeather posted aerial footage on social media of extensive damage to buildings and vehicles in Marianna.\n\nRamsey Romero, a spokesperson for the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, said no deaths have been reported and seven people with minor injuries were taken to nearby hospitals as of the early afternoon hours. Deputies were continuing to search through the wreckage of various RV parks and residential areas that were demolished by the storm.\n\n“I'm more than blessed … God spared me,” said Peacock, a retired nurse.\n\nAt least three tornadoes hit northern Florida\n\nSeveral tornadoes were reported throughout Florida’s Panhandle on Tuesday morning as a powerful squall line capable of producing of 70-80 mph wind gusts made its way over the area, knocking out power across the region, including in Tallahassee, the state capital.\n\nThe weather service first reported a tornado 11 miles southeast of De Funiak Springs, between Pensacola and Tallahassee, moving northeast at 55 mph. The storm was accompanied by quarter-size hail.\n\nJust before 7 a.m. a \"large and extremely dangerous tornado\" was located near Panama City, according to the weather service. It was moving northeast at 55 mph. Photos circulating on social media showed damage to multiple homes throughout the small beachfront community.\n\nA half hour later, the National Weather Service in Tallahassee reported a tornado had crossed over the multi-state-spanning Interstate 10, southeast of Marianna.\n\nA storm chaser later shared a video on X of an overturned semi-trailer on the interstate. A different storm chaser's drone video showed an aerial view of the I-10 corridor in Marianna with multiple campers flipped and widespread structural damage.\n\nDeSantis speaks at Florida Capitol while city hunkers down\n\nTallahassee residents sheltered in place Tuesday as rain and wind howled through the city, while Gov. Ron DeSantis made his State of the State speech at the state Capitol ahead of the start of the legislative session.\n\nDeSantis began his speech by noting that every other government building in Tallahassee is closed except for the Capitol. He suggested it was a symbol of the state's resilience and said that he had declared a state of emergency to ensure impacted residents could get assistance.\n\n\"We will handle whatever fallout there is from these dangerous tornadoes,\" he said.\n\nAbout the same time DeSantis was scheduled to speak, a dangerous squall line reached Tallahassee that was predicted to bring with it destructive winds that could down trees, damage homes and continue knocking out power.\n\n− The Tallahassee Democrat\n\nPacific Northwest struck by persistent, heavy snowfall\n\nBlizzard warnings were issued across the Pacific Northwest and Idaho on Tuesday as the first of multiple winter storms brings heavy snow to the region.\n\n“Dangerous blizzard conditions expected,” read an advisory from the weather service in central Washington. “Heavy snow and strong winds will lead to white-out conditions at times.”\n\nThe first storm is expected to make its way inland on Tuesday, blanketing much of the Northwest with heavy rain and snow, likely slowing traffic along the Interstate 5 corridor, including Seattle, Portland and Eugene, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"Some of the highest snowfall totals so far this season are expected this week with the possibility for widespread totals between 24-48 inches at pass level across the Oregon and Washington Cascades,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Andrew Kienzle said.\n\nHawaii sees a tornado warning and a 'chill in the air'\n\nSevere weather is even being reported in Hawaii this week. An unusual tornado warning was issued on Maui on Monday as the state endures a stretch of inclement weather.\n\nAccording to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, this is only the fifth time the National Weather Service has issued a tornado warning in Hawaii since 2005, KHON-TV reported. The last warning came in March 2020.\n\nThere is a threat for ongoing thunderstorms and flooding across the state for much of the week, the weather service said, adding that gusty winds and dropping temperatures \"will add a chill to the air\" in parts of the nation's warmest state.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nFact check:Climate data reliable and collected from many sources, not ruined by airports\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Tallahassee Democrat; Dinah Voyles Pulver, Doyle Rice; USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/04/10/storm-heavy-rain-possible-tornadoes-southeaster-united-states/73268061007/", "title": "New Orleans streets swamped by floods as powerful storms roll ...", "text": "A powerful and deadly storm system swept over the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, slamming the region with intense rain and flash flooding while spawning tornadoes over southern Louisiana, where at least three tornadoes were confirmed.\n\nThe torrential rains were part of a system that unleashed severe weather across the Gulf Coast throughout the day, knocking out power, disrupting travel, damaging buildings and shuttering schools. More than 118,000 homes and businesses were without power Wednesday night from east Texas to Georgia, according to a USA TODAY database.\n\nBetween five and eight inches of rainfall were recorded in some New Orleans rain gauges, Nola.com reported, noting that the amount neared that during some of the city's recent serious flood events.\n\nAt least one person in Mississippi died as a result of the storms, the state's emergency management agency said. Weather.com reported she was a 64-year-old woman in Scott County whose oxygen machine stopped working when the power went out.\n\nThroughout the morning and into the afternoon, the National Weather Service reported multiple possible tornadoes across southern Louisiana, where a powerful squall line with 80-mph winds moved east over the state.\n\nTwo confirmed tornadoes were in Slidell, a town 30 miles northeast of New Orleans, and in the southwestern city of Lake Charles. That twister had top wind speeds of 115 mph but hit the ground for only a mile, the NWS said.\n\nAnother tornado was confirmed in Saint Francisville, a town about 31 miles northwest of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, according to weather service survey crews. The weather service in New Orleans said damage in Saint Francisville and Slidell were consistent with at least an EF-1 tornado.\n\n'Worst-case scenario': Tornado in Slidell\n\nA tornado hit the town of Slidell on Wednesday afternoon, injuring several people and damaging homes and property.\n\nSlidell police officer Rodney West, a military veteran, said the aftermath of the apparent tornado reminded him of what he saw in Iraq, Weather.com reported. “Looks like Baghdad in ‘04,” West said in a social media post.\n\n“Buildings with the windows busted out, cars on their side, other vehicles wrecked, power lines down. Worst-case scenario that you could imagine,” he said.\n\nA tornado warning, then 'everything was shaking'\n\nMonica Hernandez Melancon and her husband got a tornado warning on their phones around 6:30 a.m., just as the rain and wind picked up in Sunset, Louisiana, about 70 miles west of Baton Rouge. Melancon, 60, gathered their two Yorkies – Ceci and Lily – as their trailer began to tremble. Curled up in a corner, she began to pray.\n\n\"It was so scary,\" she told USA TODAY. \"You can hardly see anything because the rain was so dense and everything was shaking.\"\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, she and her husband emerged from the trailer to find several trees knocked down across their 40-acre property, where they have hundreds of chickens, pigs, hens and lambs. Their farm was not damaged and none of the animals were hurt. Melancon said in her decades living in different parts of Louisiana, she's never experienced such a ferocious storm.\n\nSeveral school districts in Louisiana and Mississippi held classes virtually or canceled sessions altogether. The Louisiana Division of Administration shuttered state office buildings on Wednesday, and officials asked \"all drivers to limit driving on the roads between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.,\" according to a statement from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.\n\nAirline delays and cancellations were reported Wednesday afternoon across the region, including at Dallas-Fort Worth and New Orleans airports.\n\nMeteorologists anticipated that as the day continued, damaging hail, wind and possible tornadoes would slam Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Weather Service. Thunderstorms could dump around 2 to 4 inches of rain over much of the same area and up through southwestern Georgia.\n\n\"Ensure you know where you would take shelter no matter where your day takes you,\" the weather service warned.\n\nLouisiana weather map\n\nStorm heads to Midwest, East Coast\n\nThe low-pressure system battering the South is forecast to intensify, expand and track toward the Northeast throughout the rest of the week, and moderate to heavy rainfall will engulf much of the eastern U.S., including the mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, Midwest and Ohio Valley regions by Thursday.\n\nThe Carolinas, northern Florida and the mid-Atlantic region will see the greatest threat of damaging wind gusts, the weather service said. Heavy rain and potential scattered flash flooding may occur from the southern Appalachians to the northern mid-Atlantic.\n\nMeteorologists say thunderstorms should exit the Southeast by Friday morning as a potent cold front is forecast to sweep across the country from the West Coast.\n\nStorm damages homes in Texas, Arkansas\n\nThe severe weather began on Monday and led Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to deploy emergency response resources to badly impacted areas of the state. On Tuesday, the governor said he had deployed additional resources throughout the state.\n\nHail the size of quarters and ping pong balls was reported in eastern Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Powerful wind gusts reportedly toppled power lines and uprooted trees. In Pulaski County, Arkansas, 80-90 mph wind gusts damaged several homes. In Houston, a house and a barn had their roofs blown off by strong winds.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/10"}]}

But in the end, it was more of a clinic, a showcase – a dominant show of twisting and acrobatic force.\n\nLed by the incomparable Simone Biles, the Americans coasted to yet another Olympic gold medal Tuesday night at Bercy Arena, finishing atop the podium for the third time in the four most recent trips to the Summer Games. They finished nearly six points ahead of the silver medal winners Italy, with Brazil grabbing bronze. It was never really close.\n\n\"It was super exciting. We had fun. We enjoyed each other's time out there, and we just did our gymnastics,\" Biles said.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nLess than 48 hours after overcoming calf pain in qualifying, Biles competed – and excelled – in all four events, starting the night with a soaring Cheng vault and ending it with her signature floor routine, set in part to the music of Taylor Swift.\n\n\"I think it speaks volumes of her strength,\" said Chellsie Memmel, technical director for the U.S. women. \"What she was able to come back from with the whole world watching — and a world watching with a magnifying glass again, just waiting to see what she was going to do.\n\n\"We all knew she could do it like. That wasn't ever a question in my mind that she could do it, and it continues to just solidify her place as the greatest gymnast of all the time.\"\n\nBiles' teammates also more than did their parts. Suni Lee, the reigning Olympic all-around champ, was masterful on balance beam and strong on uneven bars. Jordan Chiles, like Biles, competed in all four events and finished with just one notable mistake, on balance beam. And Jade Carey, who has been nursing an illness, hit a terrific vault in her only event of the night. (Hezly Rivera, who competed in qualifying, did not participate in the three-up, three-count format.)\n\nMore from Paris:Simone Biles' redemption and Paris Olympic gold medal was for herself, U.S. teammates\n\n“Having this opportunity definitely felt really good,” Chiles said. “And being able to be a part of winning this gold medal and everything that I've just gone through, it's just been an amazing experience. So, I'm really just proud of each and every one of us that are up here. This smile is always gonna be smiling because it's just been an amazing experience.”\n\nAfter the Fierce Five and the Final Five, this group – led by Biles – had talked about wanting to redeem itself after taking home silver at the 2021 Tokyo Games. \"The four of them called it their redemption tour — that they certainly did,\" Memmel said.\n\nIt was at those same Olympics, and in this team final, where Biles withdrew from competition abruptly with what she later revealed was a case of the \"twisties,\" which left her feeling disoriented and unsafe while twisting through the air. Perhaps it was fitting then that, in her first event of the final, she was back on vault – and back twisting with confidence in her Cheng vault, which is one of the most difficult in the world.\n\n\"As soon as I landed vault, I was like, 'Oh yeah we’re gonna do this,'\" Biles said.\n\nIt was clear, from the start, that tonight would be different. All four gymnasts who competed for Team USA were also on the team in Tokyo, where restrictive COVID-19 measures had left the arena mostly and eerily empty. So after the U.S. won gold on Tuesday night, one of Biles' coaches, Cecile Landi, was asked what it too to get here over the last three years — for Biles and the team.\n\n\"A lot. That's all I have to say. A lot. It's been a roller coaster over the past three years, with a lot of good times and very difficult times,\" Landi said. \"So today's just amazing.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Biles' parents and husband, Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens, were able to watch and cheer for the Americans from the bleachers. The crowd also featured big-name celebrities and sports figures, including Michael Phelps, Serena Williams, Natalie Portman and Nicole Kidman. Chants of \"U-S-A\" rang out sporadically after almost every rotation, and American flags waved throughout the stands.\n\nThey had plenty to cheer for, of course, thanks to Biles and company. With Tuesday's gold, the 27-year-old passed Shannon Miller for the most Olympic medals won by an American gymnast. She now has eight – and perhaps a few more on the way over the next week, with the all-around and apparatus finals still to come.\n\n\"We know if they do their normal gymnastics, it should be good enough and that's what we really focused on,\" Landi said.\n\nSimone Biles, US gymnastics teammates leaned on each other to win this Olympic gold medal\n\nSimone Biles and this U.S. women's gymnastics team have talked about powering through obstacles they faced, in part, by relying on each another.\n\nEven while they were competing against one another in individual competitions over the course of the year, there were always signs of the genuine relationships that had grown between the returning members of this team. At the national championships earlier this summer, Biles noticed that Lee was struggling and walked across the gym during the competition to talk with her about it. In between rotations, it was normal to see Biles and Carey chatting, with Biles bursting out into laughter.\n\n\"Even (Monday) night, we were all having a little powwow − (Chiles, Lee and I) in the room, just talking about our age, what we're going through, how hard the Olympics is and all that stuff,\" Biles said. \"... I think it translates out of the gym, as well. And once we're good and close and tight knit outside, then you see what you saw tonight. It was pretty good. It was fun. And we supported each other.\" Read Tom Schad's full story on the bond the U.S. women's gymnastics team has.\n\nSimone Biles has more Olympic medals than any other American gymnast\n\nSimone Biles and the U.S. women's gymnastics team winning gold in the team final gives Biles more Olympic medals than any other American gymnast. She has eight Olympics medals in three Games, breaking the tie she had with Shannon Miller. It also gives her 38 combined Olympic and world championships medals, which is more than all other teams combined.\n\n\"Honestly, I would’ve had to Google that, I’m not really sure, I don’t keep count, I don’t keep stats,\" Biles said Tuesday night. \"I just go out here and do what I love. It’s amazing now that I hear it, but I don’t think I’ll truly understand the depth of it until I walk away from the sport.\"\n\nJordan Chiles showed out in a big way to help US win gold\n\nThe Olympic gold medal around Jordan Chiles’ neck more than makes up for the disappointment of missing out on the women's gymnastics all-around final. She will forever be an Olympic champion, and she knows that the U.S. women wouldn't have won this title without her contributions. She competed on all four events Tuesday night, leading the Americans off on three of them.\n\n“Having this opportunity definitely felt really good,” Chiles said. “Being able to be a part of winning this gold medal … it’s just been an amazing experience.”\n\nSimone Biles' floor routine\n\nSimone Biles closed out the entire Olympic women's gymnatics team final on floor and got a standing ovation from the crowd. She scored a 14.666.\n\nSimone Biles' beam score\n\nBiles appeared to almost lose her balance on a wolf turn, then did lose her balance on an aerial, clinging to the edge of the beam with her toes. But she didn't let the wobble turn into a fall, and ultimately, her score of 14.366 was still be one of the higher marks of the night.\n\nSimone Biles' uneven bars score\n\nSimone Biles isn't a big fan of the uneven bars, nor is she quite as dominant on that apparatus as the other three. But she was smooth and steady in her routine, nearly sticking the landing en route to a score of 14.400. And she was grinning wide as soon as her feet hit the ground.\n\nThe U.S. gymnasts look almost relaxed as they reach the midway point, while some of their would-be rivals have already suffered mistakes. Both Brazil and China had falls on the balance beam in this rotation, which could only widen the gap between Team USA and the rest of the field.\n\nSimone Biles' vault score\n\nSimone Biles didn't do her signature Yurchenko double pike, opting for the second-hardest difficult vault being done these days. Biles scored a 14.9 for her Cheng, which included a small hop on the landing. She smiled and exchanged high fives with coach Laurent Landi and then Cecile Landi, who is both Biles' co-coach and coach of the U.S. women here in Paris.\n\nThat Biles opted for the \"easier\" vault isn't a surprise. First, the U.S. didn't need it. Though the Yurchenko double pike is worth 0.8 points more than the Cheng, they still posted 44.1 points on the rotation. Second, Biles tweaked her left calf in qualifying. There's no reason to push it.\n\nSuni Lee, Jordan Chiles beam scores\n\nThe Americans gave themselves enough of a cushion on vault and uneven bars that they could have afforded to make a mistake or two — and still win gold. That meant Jordan Chiles' fall when mounting the beam wasn't reason to panic. Chiles recovered from the mistake and was relatively clean for the rest of her routine for a score of 12.733, and Suni Lee then followed with an outstanding performance and a 14.600.\n\nSuni Lee' bars routine\n\nSuni Lee, who specializes on uneven bars, got a deduction for her feet touching the floor. She still scored a 14.566.\n\nJordan Chiles' bars routine\n\nJordan Chiles killed it on bars, scoring a 14.366, and she let out a huge scream after. We're verging into the territory when the competition becomes a coronation.\n\nHow many rotations in gymnastics final?\n\nThere are four. Here was the complete run-of-show for the U.S. women.\n\nVault: Jordan Chiles (14.400), Jade Carey (14.800) and Simone Biles (14.900)\n\nJordan Chiles (14.400), Jade Carey (14.800) and Simone Biles (14.900) Uneven bars: Jordan Chiles (14.366), Simone Biles (14.400) and Suni Lee (14.566)\n\nJordan Chiles (14.366), Simone Biles (14.400) and Suni Lee (14.566) Balance beam: Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee and Simone Biles\n\nJordan Chiles, Suni Lee and Simone Biles Floor exercise: Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles and Simone Biles\n\nSimone Biles' calf was wrapped, but she was walking normally\n\nSimone Biles was walking normally but had a wrap that covered almost her entire left calf. Remember, she tweaked the left calf on floor exercise warmups during qualifying, and briefly left the floor before returning and getting her ankle heavily taped. She remained in the competition and showed no ill effects, posting the highest individual score. Coach Cecile Landi said afterward it was a flareup of an injury that occurred several weeks earlier, but that it wasn't a cause for concern.\n\nWho is Simone Biles married to?\n\nShe is married to NFL player Jonathan Owens, who is in the arena, sitting with Biles' parents and wearing a T-shirt with \"BILES\" on it and a huge photo of his wife in action on it. He landed in Paris on Tuesday morning. In addition to the team final, Owens will be able to watch Biles in the all-around final on Thursday, Aug. 1.\n\nDuring the first rotation, Owens was seen with a pen in hand, possibly recording scores, as Biles performed her vault routine. Mic’ed up on NBC’s broadcast, Owens let out a healthy “let’s go!” after Biles recorded a 14.900 on the vault, the highest score among the three U.S. gymnasts.\n\nWhat are the twisties?\n\nBiles missed most of the Tokyo Olympics after developing a case of “the twisties,” which caused her to lose her sense of where she was in the air and jeopardized her physical safety.\n\nHow does Olympic gymnastics scoring work?\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that’s your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it’s a single skill.)\n\nSimone Biles, U.S. women got huge welcome from crowd\n\nThe teams are being introduced to the crowd, Simone Biles and the U.S. women receiving the biggest of all from the crowd. Biles forgot they were supposed to pose and started walking onto the floor before catching herself. Her and Jade Cade were cracking up.\n\nSimone Biles' moves named after her: What to know\n\nSimone Biles has left her mark on the sport of gymnastics. In addition to her record number of medals — she has 37 at the world championships and Olympics, more than any other gymnast, male or female — Biles has five skills named after her. Skills are named after the first gymnast to do them in a major international competition, like the world championships or Olympics. She has two on vault, two on floor exercise and one on balance beam. Here’s are the Simone Biles moves named after her. — Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles' Yurchenko double pike: What to know\n\nThe Biles II is also known as the Yurchenko double pike, one of five moves named after Simone Biles. Vaults are categorized by “families,” which are based on the entry. On Yurchenko vaults, a gymnast does a roundoff onto the takeoff board and a back handspring onto the table. Biles then follows it with a double somersault in the piked position.\n\nFew men even try this vault, which is so difficult because of the power it takes to get two somersaults as well as its lack of a bailout. If something goes awry, more likely to land on her head or neck than her knees.\n\nBiles began doing this vault in 2021 but didn’t do it at a worlds or Olympics until the 2023 world championships. With a 6.4 difficulty value, it is the hardest vault in the women’s code.\n\nWhen Biles did the vault last year, she took a half-point deduction for having coach Laurent Landi standing on the landing mat, ready to step in and redirect her into a safe position if it looked as if she was headed for a scary landing. But neither Biles nor Landi feel the need for him to do that anymore.\n\nThe most difficult vault commonly executed by other gymnasts is valued at 5.6, eight-tenths lower than the Biles II, so doing it gives Biles a huge scoring advantage.\n\nIs Simone Biles the greatest gymnast of all time?\n\nBiles is the greatest gymnast of all time. She has consistently dominated the sport for over a decade, which would have been an unimaginable feat just a few years ago as most gymnasts reach their peak in their late teens. Her ability to win is in a class of its own. With 37 Olympic and world championship medals — 27 of which are gold — Biles has won the most of any gymnast in history. She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.\n\nBiles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she completes. Biles has no less than five skills named after her — two on the vault and floor and one on the balance beam — because she was the first, and in most cases, the only athlete to complete them in competition.\n\nHow many Olympic medals does Simone Biles have?\n\nBiles has won eight Olympic medals, five of which are gold. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Biles won three individual golds in the all-around, vault and floor exercise and led Team USA’s “Final Five” to the team gold. She also added a bronze medal on the balance beam. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Biles added a silver medal in the team event and an additional bronze medal in the balance beam to her hardware collection.\n\nHow many Olympics has Simone Biles been to?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics are Simone Biles' third Olympic Games.\n\nWhere Simone Biles trains and what it's like to train with her\n\nSimone Biles trains at Champions Centre World, which is owned by Biles’ parents Nellie and Ron and is just outside Houston, has become one of the premier gyms in the country. WCC has two gymnasts on the five-woman US team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Biles and Jordan Chiles, with Joscelyn Roberson a traveling alternate and Tiana Sumanasekera a non-traveling alternate. It also sent the most gymnasts, five, to the Olympic trials, and had three more at the US championships.\n\n\"Training with Simone is, like, once in a lifetime,\" said Roberson, who moved to WCC after the US championships in 2022. \"She's always so bubbly in the gym. Plus, she can hit. All the time. Like, she never has a bad day, which is insane to me.\"\n\nHow Simone Biles, US Olympic women's gymnastics shattered age stereotype\n\nSimone Biles, 27, is seeking to become the oldest all-around Olympic champion in women's gymnastics in 72 years, and she is one of four athletes on the U.S. team who fit what used to be a rare mold, as repeat Olympians in their 20s. The other three − Jade Carey (24), Jordan Chiles (23) and Suni Lee (21) − all competed in college between their two Olympic appearances, which also used to be uncommon. (Hezly Rivera, 16, rounds out the team.)\n\nWith an average age north of 22 years old, it will be the oldest U.S. women's gymnastics team to compete at the Olympics since 1952, according to USA Gymnastics.\n\n\"The longevity of this sport has been totally changed. Simone has changed that,\" Chiles said. not to control everything that I can’t control anymore,” Biles said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/05/olympic-gymnastics-live-results/74194380007/", "title": "Olympic gymnastics live results: Simone Biles wins silver on floor", "text": "PARIS — Simone Biles won silver in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday at the 2024Paris Games, giving her four medals, including three golds, at these Games. It is the first time she has not won gold in a floor exercise final — ever.\n\nBrazil’s Rebeca Andrade won gold. After a score inquiry, Jordan Chiles won bronze, her updated total moving her to third place from fifth.\n\nThe medal is the 11th of Biles’ Olympic career, seven of which are gold. Biles won four medals in Paris, leading the U.S. to gold in the team final and winning gold in the all-around and vault finals and silver in the floor final.\n\n\"I’ve accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at these Olympics but in gymnastics,\" she said in a news conference Monday. \"Walking way with four medals, I’m not mad about it. I’m pretty proud of myself.”\n\nSimone Biles, Jordan Chiles bow down to Rebeca Andrade\n\nThe greatness of Simone Biles can be summed up in one photo.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nIt’s not of her with her many, many medals. Or of a score that reflects another dominant performance. It doesn’t show her soaring high above the vault. It’s of Biles and Jordan Chiles, bowing down to new Olympic floor champion Rebeca Andrade as the Brazilian steps onto the medals podium at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\n“I love Rebeca. She’s absolutely amazing,” Biles said Monday afternoon. “Jordan was like, 'Should we bow to her?’ And I was like, 'Absolutely.’ It was just the right thing to do.”\n\nYes, but not many athletes — not many people — would be big enough to celebrate someone else’s success in the wake of their own disappointment. Or mature enough to do it so genuinely. Not many would be generous enough to show the grace that so often isn’t extended to her. Read Nancy Armour's column on Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles bowing down to Rebeca Andrade after the floor final.\n\nWhat Simone Biles said after floor, beam finals\n\nBefore Simone Biles won silver on floor, she finished fifth in the balance beam final, in which nearly every gymnast came off beam, including USA’s Suni Lee, who finished sixth.\n\n\"Today has been absolutely wild,\" she said. \"I've been competing here at the Olympics for, what, a week or so now? I don't know, I've been on that floor so many times competing. So obviously exhaustion and all that sets in, but we still had to go out and compete one more time today.\n\n\"It's such an honor to compete with these girls on both the beam and on the floor, obviously wasn't my best performances, but at the end of the day, it's whoever meddled meddled and that's what's so exciting because you just never know.\n\n\"So I'm not very upset or anything about my performance. I think these Olympics I'm actually very happy, proud and even more excited that it's over.\"\n\nKeep up with the Paris Olympics with USA TODAY's daily Chasing Gold newsletter. Sign up here.\n\nWhy Jordan Chiles' score changed on floor\n\nAna Barbosu of Romania was celebrating on the floor with her country's flag, jumping up and down, when Jordan Chiles' new score came through. She was granted one-tenth of a point increase in her difficulty score, which moved her above Barbosu and gave her the bronze.\n\nAfter the routine, her coaches Cecile and Laurent Landi submitted an inquiry with the judging panel, and it worked. Chiles' execution score was not changed, but the D score went up by one tenth of a point, to 5.9, and that was enough to give her a bronze. Read the full explainer on why Jordan Chiles' score changed in the floor final.\n\nSimone Biles floor routine\n\nSimone Biles scored a 14.133 to take second place behind Rebeca Andrade with two competitors left. Biles stepped out of bounds twice but stuck the landing on the Biles I. She held her salute until she was off the podium.\n\nDuring warmups, she overcooked the Biles II and took a hard, awkward fall. She could be seen mouthing, \"I'm fine\" after. Biles tweaked her calf during qualifying on July 28 and has had it wrapped in competition since.\n\nJordan Chiles floor routine\n\nThere was a score inquiry for Jordan Chiles after her floor routine and she ultimately won bronze with a 13.766.\n\nSimone Biles on silent balance beam final: 'It was really weird and awkward'\n\nIf you were expecting raucous cheers or thumping music in the background during the balance beam final, you would've been disappointed. As each of the each competitors mounted the beam, the arena went almost completely silent.\n\nSimone Biles and Suni Lee each got some shushes from the crowd while cheering for each other, which they agreed was \"annoying,\" said Lee, who finished sixth after coming off during her routine.\n\n\"You're trying to stay in your zone, and then people start cheering and then the shushing gets louder, so really, they should be shushed because they're louder,\" Biles said after the beam and floor finals. \"It was really weird and awkward. And we've asked several times if we can have some music, or some background noise, so I'm not really sure what happened there. But, yeah, not our favorite. None of us liked it.\"\n\nRebeca Andrade floor routine\n\nThe Brazilian drew a massive applause from the crowd with a terrific routine that earned her a 14.166 and ultimately gold. She hopped on a few of the landings but that goes into the nitpicking category. She pumped her fist when she finished and looked skyward. During the medal ceremony, Brazilian fans erupted into cheering Andrade, chanting her name just before the medal was draped around her neck.\n\nSimone Biles leotard change\n\nSimone Biles wore a new leotard for the floor final, swapping her blue and white one for one that is red and blue.\n\nSimone Biles balance beam video\n\nSimone Biles came off the balance beam on her aerial series, scoring a 13.100 and finishing fifth. It's the first time in 33 individual finals at the world championships or Olympics (on events other than uneven bars) that she did not win a medal.\n\nSuni Lee on balance beam\n\nIt wasn't to be for Suni Lee in the balance beam final. Seeking her fourth medal of these Games, Lee's right foot slipped off the balance beam at the end of her aerial series, causing her to split the beam and then take a hard fall onto the mat. The result was a score of 13.100 that effectively eliminates her shot at the podium.\n\nThe 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Simone Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal — this time a bronze — to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday.\n\nFloor exercise final scores, results\n\nHere are the scores women’s floor exercise final.\n\nRebeca Andrade, Brazil: 14.166\n\n14.166 Simone Biles, USA: 14.133\n\n14.133 Jordan Chiles, USA: 13.766\n\n13.766 Ana Barbosu, Romania: 13.700\n\n13.700 Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, Romania: 13.700\n\n13.700 Alice Domato, Italy: 13.600\n\n13.600 Rina Kishi, Japan : 13.166\n\n: 13.166 Ou Yushan, China: 13.000\n\n13.000 Manila Esposito, Italy: 12.133\n\nBalance beam final results, scores\n\nHere are the scores from the women’s balance beam final.\n\nAlice Domato, Italy: 14.366\n\n14.366 Zhou Yaqin, China: 14.100\n\n14.100 Manila Esposito, Italy: 14.000\n\n14.000 Rebeca Andrade, Brazil: 13.933\n\n13.933 Simone Biles, USA: 13.100\n\n13.100 Suni Lee, USA: 13.100\n\n13.100 Julia Soares, Brazil: 12.333\n\n12.333 Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, Romania: 11.733\n\nHow many Olympic medals does Simone Biles have?\n\nBiles now has won 11 Olympic medals after she led the U.S. women's gymnastics team to gold, won gold in the all-around and vault finals and silver on floor.

Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nWhy Suni Lee's Olympic bronze on uneven bars means even more this time\n\nSuni Lee won the all-around gold in Tokyo, the biggest prize there is in gymnastics and, if we’re being honest, one of the most coveted titles at the Olympics. The medals she’s won at the 2024 Paris Olympics, including a bronze on uneven bars Sunday, mean even more.\n\n“I’m really proud of myself. This time around, it’s just been so much more amazing,” said Lee, who also has a gold she won with the U.S. women in the team final and her bronze in the all-around final. “I know I keep saying amazing and it’s probably really annoying, but that’s really all the words that I have because it’s just amazing.\n\n“It’s so much fun and I’m so happy with all of my performances.”\n\nSuni Lee on uneven bars wins bronze\n\nSuni Lee is three-for-three in Paris Olympics. Lee won her second consecutive Olympic bronze medal on uneven bars Sunday, adding to the gold she won with the U.S. women in the team final and her bronze in the all-around final. She has a chance to add one more Monday, when she competes in the balance beam final.\n\nLee was the last to go, and the only flaw in her routine was a slight step on her dismount. She looked happy with the routine, and when the score of 14.8 was announced, her jaw dropped. That put her just slightly ahead of Nina Derwael, the Tokyo Olympic champion.\n\nJust making the podium was an achievement in this uneven bars final, which looked more like a heavyweight fight. It featured the reigning Olympic, world and European champions, and everyone brought their best.\n\nKaylia Nemour wins gold on uneven bars\n\nAlgeria's Kaylia Nemour, 17, was waiting to go when the score for China's Qiu Qiyuan was announced. But if it flustered her, she didn't show it. Her routine is jam-packed with difficulty — her 7.2 difficulty score is one of the few in the women's competition above 7, and she added a tenth from qualifying — but she made it look effortless. She flits from bar to bar like a hummingbird and landed without a wiggle.\n\nNemour scored a monster 15.700 and won gold. Lee walked over and congratulated Nemour after her routine. What a final this was.\n\nChina's Qiu Qiyuan wins silver on uneven bars\n\nChina's Qiu Qiyuan, who won the world title last year, was first up of the top contenders and did a gorgeous routine. Her pirouettes on the high bar would make ballerinas jealous, and she looked like a statue as she held perfectly still on her handstands. She was beaming when she finished and cried when her score of 15.5 was announced.\n\nUneven bars final results at 2024 Olympics\n\nHere are the scores from the uneven bars final.\n\nKaylia Nemour, Algeria: 15.700\n\n15.700 Qiu Qiyuan, China: 15.500\n\n15.500 Suni Lee, USA: 14.800\n\n14.800 Nina Derwael, Germany: 14.766\n\n14.766 Alice Domato, Italy: 14.733\n\n14.733 Helen Kervic, Germany: 14.566\n\n14.566 Rebecca Downie, Great Britain: 13.633\n\n13.633 Zhang Yihan, China: 12.800\n\nUS gymnastics medals on uneven bars\n\nAn American woman has medaled in the event at all but two Olympics going back to 1992. The only outliers were in 2000 and 2012. Lee is the most recent medalist, winning a bronze in Tokyo. Madison Kocian (2016), Nastia Liukin (2008), Terin Humphrey (2004) and Amy Chow (1996) all won silvers, and Courtney Kupets (2004) and Shannon Miller (1992) won bronzes. The only American woman to win gold on uneven bars was Julianne McNamara, in 1984.\n\nPhilippines' Carlos Edriel Yulo wins gold on vault\n\nThe Philippines came into the Paris Games having won one Olympic gold medal. Now Carlos Yulo has given his country two in two days. Yulo added gold on vault Sunday to the one he won on floor exercise Saturday. He finished with 15.116 points, ahead of Armenia's Artur Davtyan, who earned silver with a 14.966 score and Britain's Harry Hepworth, who got bronze with 14.949.\n\nYulo wasn't quite as overwhelmed as he was with his floor exercise, when he collapsed to the floor in sobs. He put his hand on his head several times, as if in amazement, but left the competition floor waving to the crowd and patting the Filipino flag on his chest. Gifts for Yulo poured in after his first gold medal. He was given, among other things, $173,000, a fully furnished condo, tuition credits and a lifetime supply of cookies. Imagine what he'll get for two golds.\n\nHere are the scores from the men’s vault final.\n\nCarlos Edriel Yulo, Philippines: 15.116\n\n15.116 Artur Davtyan, Armenia: 14.966\n\n14.966 Harry Hepworth, Great Britain: 14.949\n\n14.949 Jake Jarman, Great Britain: 14.933\n\n14.933 Aurel Benovic, Croatia: 14.900\n\n14.900 Nazar Chepurnyi, Ukraine: 14.899\n\n14.899 Mahdi Olfati, Iran: 14.266\n\n14.266 Igor Radivilov, Ukraine: 14.166\n\nChina's Liu Yang wins still rings gold\n\nWinning an Olympic gold medal was so nice, Liu Yang did it twice.\n\nLiu won his second Olympic title on still rings Sunday, defending his gold medal from the Tokyo Games. He finished with 15.3 points, edging teammate Zou Jingyuan by 0.67 points. Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece, the Olympic champion on rings at the Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016, won his second consecutive bronze.\n\nPetrounias finished just ahead of crowd favorite Samir Ait Said of France. The crowd roared when Ait Said stuck his dismount, and he pumped his fists in jubilation. But a couple of form breaks during his routine left him 0.10 behind Petrounias, fourth for a second consecutive Olympics. Here are the scores from the still rings final.\n\nLiu Yang, China: 15.300\n\n15.300 Zou Jingyuan, China: 15.233\n\n15.233 Eleftherios Petrouinas, Greece: 15.100\n\n15.100 Samir Ait Said, France: 15.000\n\n15.000 Adem Asil, Türkiye: 14.966\n\n14.966 Vahagn Davtyan, Armenia: 14.866\n\n14.866 Harry Hepworth, Great Britain: 14.800\n\n14.800 Glen Cuyle, Belgium: 13.833\n\nIs Simone Biles competing today?\n\nNo. Biles will compete again Monday in the finals for balance beam and floor exercise. She has won three gold medals so far in Paris, bringing her career gold total to seven and her overall medal count to 10.\n\nHow Suni Lee's illness changed her mindset\n\nSuni Lee went to Auburn right after winning gold in Tokyo, wanting to have the college experience and to compete at the NCAA level. She announced in November 2022 that she’d leave Auburn at the end of her sophomore season. Before that season could even end, however, Lee developed a kidney disease that caused her to retain so much fluid there were days she couldn’t even put on her grips. She returned to Minneapolis and began working with doctors at the Mayo Clinic, who discovered she was suffering from a second kidney ailment.\n\nThus began a nearly yearlong nightmare of tweaking medications and Lee feeling as if she had no control over her body. At one point, she said, she’d gained 40 pounds. There were days she could train and days she could only do certain things. Then there were days she couldn’t even get out of bed. By the end of February, Lee had returned to competition. It was an inauspicious start — she did only uneven bars and balance beam at Winter Cup and fell off both — but it let her know she could still do this.\n\nOlympic gymnastics schedule\n\nHere is the remaining gymnastics schedule at the Paris Olympics after Sunday.\n\nMonday, Aug. 5: Parallel bars final, balance beam final, high bar final, women’s floor final\n\nHow does gymnastics scoring work?\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that’s your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it’s a single skill.)\n\nUS women’s gymnastics schedule\n\nThe U.S. women's gymnasts will compete in these event finals.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/01/olympic-gymnastics-all-around-live-results/74193970007/", "title": "Olympic gymnastics highlights: Simone Biles wins gold medal in all ...", "text": "PARIS — It was closer than expected, but the final result was no surprise.\n\nSimone Biles cemented her legacy as the world's most dominant gymnast Thursday night, narrowly defeating Rebeca Andrade of Brazil in the 2024 Paris Olympics all-around final to become the oldest all-around Olympic champion since 1952. Biles, 27, is also just the third woman in history to win multiple golds in the all-around, and the first to win all-around titles eight years apart. Andrade finished silver and Suni Lee took bronze.\n\nBiles, who hasn't lost an all-around competition in more than a decade, gave herself a bit of work to do after a major mistake on uneven bars, which left her sitting third at the midway point behind both Andrade and Kaylia Nemour of Algeria. But she responded by hitting a big routine on the sport's trickiest apparatus, balance beam, and then put the competition to bed with a typically brilliant performance on floor.\n\n\"I’m getting uncomfortable guys!\" says of how close she was to Andrade. \"I was stressing. But I knew if I did my work it’d all be fine.\"\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThursday's victory gave Biles her second Olympic gold of these Games, after the U.S. women’s squad captured gold in the team final on Tuesday, and her ninth Olympic medal overall, the most ever won by an American gymnast. In the coming days, Biles could add as many as three more golds as she is due to compete in the apparatus finals for balance beam, floor exercise and vault.\n\nBiles, who has also won 30 medals at world championships, has said she is on a bit of a redemption tour in Paris after her experience at the 2021 Tokyo Games. Biles withdrew midway through the team final with a bout of the \"twisties,\" which caused her to lose a sense of where she was in the air on twisting elements. She proceeded to withdraw from most of her other remaining events and take a two-year hiatus from competitive gymnastics.\n\nBiles has proven to be perhaps even more dominant upon her return last year. She cruised to the all-around world title last fall and has continued to push the boundaries of the sport with new skills, including her now-famous Yurchenko double pike vault – which helped carry her to gold Thursday night.\n\n\"It is crazy I am in the conversation of the greatest of all time,\" Biles said. \"I just think I’m still Simone Biles from Spring, Texas, who loves to flip.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought you live results, scores and highlights throughout the team final. Check out the highlights.\n\nSimone Biles is now GOAT of all GOATs\n\nSimone Biles is the best to ever do it and it’s not even close. In her sport. And in all others. Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt, Serena Williams and anyone else you want to throw in the mix — they all take a backseat to Biles. With her second Olympic all-around title Thursday night, Biles surpassed all the other GOATs. She’s now, as teammate Jordan Chiles put it earlier this week, the greatest of the greats. Read Nancy Armour's full column on Biles being the greatest of all time.\n\nSimone Biles' goat necklace\n\nAfter Biles won all-around gold — again — she pulled out a necklace with a very blingy goat.\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete next?\n\nBiles has three individual finals left.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 3: The vault final is at 10:20 a.m. ET.\n\nThe vault final is at 10:20 a.m. ET. Monday, Aug. 5: The balance beam is at 6:36 a.m. ET, and floor final 8:20 a.m. ET.\n\nWho is competing in women's individual gymnastics finals?\n\nHere are the individual final events the U.S. women's gymnasts team will compete in.\n\nSimone Biles: all-around, vault, floor exercise, balance beam.\n\nall-around, vault, floor exercise, balance beam. Suni Lee: all-around, uneven bars, balance beam.\n\nall-around, uneven bars, balance beam. Jordan Chiles: floor exercise.\n\nfloor exercise. Jade Carey: vault.\n\nSimone Biles vault all-around\n\nSimone Biles got some serious height off the table on her Yurchenko double pike — the famous (and incredibly dangerous) vault that is now among her many eponymous skills. And even with a significant hop backwards on the landing, she has already established a commanding lead.\n\nBiles' score of 15.766 puts her more than six-tenths ahead of Rebeca Andrade Andrade through one rotation. While Andrade had a better execution score on her vault, the starting value of the Yurchenko double pike (6.40) dwarfs that of the Cheng vault that Andrade hit (5.60).\n\nSimone Biles' floor routine\n\nSimone Biles held a .166 lead over Brazil's Rebeca Andrade with one rotation left, floor exercise, and she scored a 15.066 to win the gold medal.\n\nSimone Biles' beam routine\n\nIce. Cold. In the trickiest event in women's gymnastics, balance beam, Simone Biles put up a big-time score under big-time pressure. Despite two small wobbles, she nailed her aerial series and had a relatively clean landing on the dismount to earn a 14.566.\n\nSimone Biles bars routine\n\nSimone Biles winced as she walked away from the uneven bars after a nervy moment as she transitioned from the higher bar to the lower. It appeared that she got a bit too much power on the release and got a bit too far away from the low bar, raising her knees to avoid touching the ground.\n\n\"The fact that she did not come off the bar, it's just another thing to be in awe about for Simone,\" NBC analyst Laurie Hernandez said on Peacock's broadcast.\n\nBiles didn't fall, but the sequence forced her to take an additional unplanned swing and significantly hurt her execution score, resulting in a 13.733 that move her into third place (29.499) behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade (29.766) and Algeria's Kaylia Nemour (29.566) after two turns.\n\nSuni Lee's floor routine\n\nSuni Lee, who sat in fourth entering the final rotation, scored a 13.666 on floor, moving her into the bronze medal position. It's her second Olympic medal in the all-around final.\n\nSuni Lee's beam routine\n\nSuni Lee had a few small wobbles — but no fall — in her beam routine to score an even 14.000.\n\nSuni Lee's bars score\n\nSuni Lee was smiling before she even stuck the landing on her uneven bars routine — a stellar showing that earned a score of 14.866.\n\nSuni Lee's vault score\n\nSuni Lee got things started on vault with a double-twisting Yurchenko, taking a hop on the landing but notching a solid 13.933. Vault is not Lee's strongest event, but her performance there should put her in good position heading into uneven bars.\n\nRebeca Andrade Olympic all-around final performance\n\nRebeca Andrade couldn't have asked for a much better start in the all-around final. On vault, she stuck the landing on a Cheng — the second-hardest vault being done today — and notched a big-time score of 15.100, with a 9.500 execution score (out of 10).\n\nTrailing Simone Biles by almost seventh-tenths of a point after their first rotation, she needed to be pretty much impeccable over the remaining three events to catch up. And she certainly as on uneven bars. Andrade and Biles both had the same difficulty score on their uneven bars routines, but Andrade's execution was significantly better — resulting in a score of 14.766 that was almost a full point better than Biles'.\n\nShe then turned in an impressive performance on beam, especially under the circumstances. Going last in the rotation, and having just seen Simone Biles hit her routine, Andrade managed to block out the pressure and register a score of 14.133. Despite a few balance checks and minor issues, it was a strong showing. She closed out on floor, scoring a 14.033.\n\nSteph Curry at gymnastics all-around final\n\nThe NBA's greatest shooter of all time, Steph Curry, is the stands to watch the women's gymnastics all-around final.\n\nSimone Biles, Suni Lee introduced at all-around final\n\nBiles and Lee were introcued to the crowd here to huge cheers.\n\nHow high can Simone Biles jump?\n\nDuring her floor routine at Olympic gymnastics trials, Simone Biles reached 12 feet in the air at one point.\n\nHow many gold medals does Simone Biles have all time?\n\nBiles now has won nine Olympic medals after the U.S. women's gymnastics squad won team gold at the team final in Paris. Six of her medals are gold. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Biles won three individual golds in the all-around, vault and floor exercise and led Team USA’s “Final Five” to the team gold. She also added a bronze medal on the balance beam. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Biles added a silver medal in the team event and an additional bronze medal in the balance beam to her hardware collection.\n\nWhy is Simone Biles called the GOAT?\n\nBiles is the greatest gymnast of all time. She has consistently dominated the sport for over a decade, which would have been an unimaginable feat just a few years ago as most gymnasts reach their peak in their late teens. Her ability to win is in a class of its own. With 39 Olympic and world championship medals — 28 of which are gold — Biles has won the most of any gymnast in history. She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.\n\nBiles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she completes. Biles has no less than five skills named after her — two on the vault and floor and one on the balance beam — because she was the first, and in most cases, the only athlete to complete them in competition.\n\nSuni Lee kidney illness: How it changed her gymnastics mindset\n\nSuni Lee went to Auburn right after winning gold in Tokyo, wanting to have the college experience and to compete at the NCAA level. She announced in November 2022 that she’d leave Auburn at the end of her sophomore season. Before that season could even end, however, Lee developed a kidney disease that caused her to retain so much fluid there were days she couldn’t even put on her grips. She returned to Minneapolis and began working with doctors at the Mayo Clinic, who discovered she was suffering from a second kidney ailment.\n\nThus began a nearly yearlong nightmare of tweaking medications and Lee feeling as if she had no control over her body. At one point, she said, she’d gained 40 pounds. There were days she could train and days she could only do certain things. Then there were days she couldn’t even get out of bed. By the end of February, Lee had returned to competition. It was an inauspicious start — she did only uneven bars and balance beam at Winter Cup and fell off both — but it let her know she could still do this.\n\nHas anyone won two Olympic all-around titles before?\n\nYes, but it's been a minute. Or a half-century. Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union was the first to win two Olympic all-around titles, winning in 1956 and 1960. Vera Caslavska of then-Czechoslovakia then won the next two, in 1964 and 1968. But it's been a new champion at every Games since then.\n\nIn fact, there hasn't been a reigning all-around champion who's won another medal of any color since Ludmilla Tourischeva of the Soviet Union. After winning gold in the all-around in 1972, she was the bronze medalist in 1976.\n\nHow many Olympics has Simone Biles been to?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics are Simone Biles' third Olympic Games.\n\nHow old was Simone Biles at her first Olympics?\n\nBiles was 19 years old at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nWhat are the twisties in gymnastics?\n\nBiles missed most of the Tokyo Olympics after developing a case of “the twisties,” which caused her to lose her sense of where she was in the air and jeopardized her physical safety.\n\nWho is Simone Biles married to?\n\nSimone Biles is married to NFL player Jonathan Owens, who will be at the all-around final today. At the team final on Tuesday, he sat with Biles' parents and wearing a T-shirt with \"BILES\" on it and a huge photo of his wife in action on it. He landed in Paris on Tuesday morning.\n\nDuring the first rotation of Monday's team final, Owens was seen with a pen in hand, possibly recording scores, as Biles performed her vault routine. Mic’ed up on NBC’s broadcast, Owens let out a healthy “let’s go!” after Biles recorded a 14.900 on the vault, the highest score among the three U.S. gymnasts.\n\nSimone Biles' Instagram caption deservedly put MyKayla Skinner on blast\n\nThe scorch marks on MyKayla Skinner are going to be visible for a while after Simone Biles put her on blast Wednesday. Deservedly so, mind you. The Tokyo Olympian had the audacity earlier this summer to criticize the women who eventually made the team for the Paris Games, saying they weren’t as talented and didn’t have the same work ethic as in Skinner’s day.\n\n“Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,” Biles captioned an Instagram post of her and her teammates — Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee and Hezly Rivera — celebrating their gold medal Tuesday night.\n\nSimone Biles' moves named after her: What to know\n\nSimone Biles has left her mark on the sport of gymnastics, in addition to her combined 28 world championship and Olympic medals. Biles has five skills named after her: Two on vault, two on floor exercise and one on balance beam. Here’s are the Simone Biles moves named after her.\n\nSimone Biles' Yurchenko double pike: What to know\n\nThe Biles II is also known as the Yurchenko double pike, one of five moves named after Simone Biles. Vaults are categorized by “families,” which are based on the entry. On Yurchenko vaults, a gymnast does a roundoff onto the takeoff board and a back handspring onto the table. Biles then follows it with a double somersault in the piked position.\n\nFew men even try this vault, which is so difficult because of the power it takes to get two somersaults as well as its lack of a bailout. If something goes awry, more likely to land on her head or neck than her knees.\n\nBiles began doing this vault in 2021 but didn’t do it at a worlds or Olympics until the 2023 world championships. With a 6.4 difficulty value, it is the hardest vault in the women’s code.\n\nWhen Biles did the vault last year, she took a half-point deduction for having coach Laurent Landi standing on the landing mat, ready to step in and redirect her into a safe position if it looked as if she was headed for a scary landing. But neither Biles nor Landi feel the need for him to do that anymore.\n\nThe most difficult vault commonly executed by other gymnasts is valued at 5.6, eight-tenths lower than the Biles II, so doing it gives Biles a huge scoring advantage.\n\nWhere Simone Biles trains and what it's like to train with her\n\nSimone Biles trains at Champions Centre World, which is owned by Biles’ parents Nellie and Ron and is just outside Houston, has become one of the premier gyms in the country. WCC has two gymnasts on the five-woman US team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Biles and Jordan Chiles, with Joscelyn Roberson a traveling alternate and Tiana Sumanasekera a non-traveling alternate. It also sent the most gymnasts, five, to the Olympic trials, and had three more at the US championships.\n\n\"Training with Simone is, like, once in a lifetime,\" said Roberson, who moved to WCC after the US championships in 2022. \"She's always so bubbly in the gym. Plus, she can hit. All the time. Like, she never has a bad day, which is insane to me.\"\n\nHow Simone Biles shattered gymnastics age stereotype\n\nSimone Biles, 27, is seeking to become the oldest all-around Olympic champion in women's gymnastics in 72 years, and she is one of four athletes on the U.S. team who fit what used to be a rare mold, as repeat Olympians in their 20s. The other three − Jade Carey (24), Jordan Chiles (23) and Suni Lee (21) − all competed in college between their two Olympic appearances, which also used to be uncommon. (Hezly Rivera, 16, rounds out the team.)\n\nWith an average age north of 22 years old, it will be the oldest U.S. women's gymnastics team to compete at the Olympics since 1952, according to USA Gymnastics.\n\n\"The longevity of this sport has been totally changed. Simone has changed that,\" Chiles said. not to control everything that I can’t control anymore,” Biles said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/03/olympic-gymnastics-live-results/74194250007/", "title": "Olympic gymnastics highlights: Simone Biles wins gold on vault", "text": "PARIS — Simone Biles has captured another gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, this one in the women’s vault final on Saturday. It’s her third gold medal of these Games, after leading the U.S. to gold in the team final and winning gold in the all-around final.\n\n“Not many people in the world can do it to this level, so once we’re out here, the floor is our stage. It just feels so freeing for us. We’re in our element, we’re having fun and doing what we love to do,” Biles said. “I think that’s why I love it so much.”\n\nBrazil’s Rebeca Andrade won silver, her second silver and third medal overall of these Games. Biles’ teammate Jade Carey won bronze, her second medal here and third of her career.\n\n\"This medal means everything to me,\" Carey said. \"It was one of my biggest motivators to get back here.\"\n\nFor her career, it’s Biles’ seventh gold and 10th medal overall, extending her record of most Olympic medals by an American gymnast.

Check it out.\n\nSimone Biles leaves the door open to compete at 2028 Olympics in LA\n\nMinutes after winning gold on vault – that’s her third of the Paris Olympics, for those counting, and seventh overall – Simone Biles left the door open to competing at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Or, rather, she didn’t close it.\n\n“Never say never. The next Olympics is at home, so you just never know,” she said Saturday night, before starting to laugh. “But I am getting really old.”\n\nSimone Biles vault score\n\nAdd another gold medal to Simone Biles' collection. Biles won her second Olympic title on vault Saturday, adding to the gold she won in 2016. It's also her 10th Olympic medal and seventh gold. At these Paris Games alone, Biles has already won three medals, all of them gold. And she still has the balance beam and floor exercise finals Monday.\n\nThe gold was a given after Biles did her signature Yurchenko double pike, which is so difficult few men are even doing it. She followed with one of the best Chengs she's ever done, getting so much hang time the U.S. men's basketball team that came to watch her in the all-around final would be impressed.\n\nThose vaults gave her a combined score of 15.3, more than 0.300 ahead of Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, who won gold on vault in both Tokyo and at last year's world championships.\n\nPommel horse guy Stephen Nedoroscik wins bronze\n\nStephen Nedoroscik became just the fourth American man since World War II to win an Olympic medal on pommel horse Saturday, barely holding on to win bronze. Less than a week after becoming an internet phenomenon with his medal-clinching performance in the team final, Nedoroscik turned in a largely clean routine in the apparatus final to record a score of 15.300 — one tenth of a point better than Max Whitlock of Great Britain, the two-time defending Olympic champion in this event.\n\n\"It's just been unbelievable,\" he said after winning bronze. \"I've just consistently been on top of the world for like a week now.\"\n\nWhile Nedoroscik's difficulty score of 6.400 wasn't quite as high as the men who took gold and silver -- Rhys McClenaghan of Ireland and Nariman Kurbanov of Kazakhstan — his execution score of 8.900 was good enough to secure the bronze.\n\nJade Carey vault score\n\nJade Carey won her second Olympic medal of the Paris Games, taking bronze in vault Saturday afternoon. Carey, 24, finished a solid third behind Biles and Andrade. She hit a Cheng, which is the second-hardest vault being performed today, with her first vault for a score of 14.733. Then she landed an incredibly clean double-twisting Yurchenko with her second attempt to jump ahead of An Chan-ok of North Korea, who took fourth.\n\nThis is the only apparatus final for which Carey qualified, though she was also part of the U.S. team that won gold Tuesday. Carey said in qualifying that she had been dealing with an illness and was struggling to keep food down, though her mom said on NBC a few days later that the Oregon State product was feeling better. Saturday's bronze gives Carey the third Olympic medal of her career; she also won gold at the 2021 Tokyo Games.\n\nRebeca Andrade vault score\n\nBrazil's Rebeca Andrade scored a combined 14.966 on vault, putting up a 15.100 on her first and 14.833 on her second, which earned her silver.\n\nWomen's vault final scores\n\nEach gymnast performs two vaults and their final score is an average of the two.

Yulo won gold in the Olympic floor exercise final. In addition to being the Philippines' first medal in gymnastics, it's also only the second gold a Filipino athlete has won in any Olympics. When the last competitor's score was posted, Yulo burst into tears and sank to the floor. As he left the competition floor, he waved at a fan who was holding a Philippines' flag. Artem Dolgopyat of Israel won the silver medal and Jake Jarman of Britain claimed the bronze. No American man was in the floor final.\n\nSimone Biles vault: Yurchenko double pike\n\nThe Biles II is also known as the Yurchenko double pike, one of five moves named after Simone Biles. Vaults are categorized by “families,” which are based on the entry. On Yurchenko vaults, a gymnast does a roundoff onto the takeoff board and a back handspring onto the table. Biles then follows it with a double somersault in the piked position.

Seven of her medals are gold.\n\nHow many Olympics has Simone Biles been in?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics are Simone Biles' third Olympic Games.\n\nHow does gymnastics scoring work?\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that’s your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it’s a single skill.)\n\nUS womens gymnastics schedule\n\nThe U.S. women's gymnasts team will compete in these event finals.\n\nHow high can Simone Biles jump?\n\nDuring her floor routine at Olympic gymnastics trials, Simone Biles jumped 12 feet in the air at one point.\n\nApparatus finals for gymnastics at Olympics\n\nHere is the remaining gymnastics schedule at the Paris Olympics.\n\nSunday, Aug. 4: Still rings final, uneven bars final, men’s vault final.\n\nStill rings final, uneven bars final, men’s vault final.

He sneaked onto the podium at the end of the all-around competition at the 2023 world championships, becoming the first American man to medal at worlds since Jonathan Horton in 2010. But he was unable to replicate that feat in Paris.\n\nJuda had said over the weekend that he was thrilled just to have made it to the all-around final.

Richard, whose last turn was on floor (13.200), totaled 82.166 while Juda, who finished on pommel horse (13.866), finished with 82.197 points.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results: Final rotation\n\nFrederick Richard, Paul Juda on fifth rotation\n\nFrederick Richard has moved up to 12th after a strong high bar routine, though his score of 14.400 wasn't quite as high as his score in the team final Monday night. He'll wrap up the night on floor. Paul Juda, who is in 16th, will conclude on pommel horse.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results: Fifth rotation\n\nThe men's all-around final looks like it's going to come down to the wire. With just one rotation to go, there are now six men at the top separated by 1.1 points or less, each of them with a shot at earning an Olympic medal. Shinnosuke Oka of Japan is back in first, followed by Ruoteng Xiao and Boheng Zhang of China. Here are the top three in the standings after five rotations.\n\nFirst: Japan's Shinnosuke Oka, 72.332\n\nJapan's Shinnosuke Oka, 72.332 Second: China's Xiao Ruoteng, 71.998\n\nChina's Xiao Ruoteng, 71.998 Third: China's Zhang Boheng, 71.966\n\nPaul Juda, Frederick Richard on fourth rotation\n\nIn the fourth rotation, Paul Juda scored a 13.766 on high bar. Frederick Richard scored a 14.133 parallel bars this rotation. The metaphorical ship has probably sailed for the Americans' hopes of earning a medal. Juda and Richard are sitting tied for 18th and 20th, respectively, with just two rotations remaining.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results: Fourth rotation\n\nFor all the hype entering Wednesday about China and Japan, it is actually the two Ukrainians — Oleg Verniaiev and Illia Kovtun — who are sitting in first and second, respectively, through four rotations.\n\nFinishing with one, if not two, gymnasts on the podium would of course be incredibly meaningful for Ukraine, which brought a delegation of around 140 athletes to the Paris Olympics amid its war with Russian. Ukraine has so far just won a single bronze medal, in fencing. Here are the top three in the standings after four rotations.\n\nFirst: Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev, 57.766\n\nUkraine's Oleg Verniaiev, 57.766 Second: Ukraine's Illia Kovtun, 57.632\n\nUkraine's Illia Kovtun, 57.632 Third: Ziao Ruoteng, 57.232\n\nFrederick Richard, Paul Juda after three rotations\n\nAfter falling on pommel horse, Frederick Richard has actually performed better than he did in qualifying on both still rings and vault. But he still has a long way to go if he's going to get back in the picture for a medal. Richard is sitting 22nd in the 24-man field, about 2.5 points behind leader Shinnosuke Oka of Japan. He's also slightly behind U.S. teammate Paul Juda, who is sitting in 17th after recording a 13.866 on parallel bars.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results: Third rotation\n\nTwo gymnasts from Ukraine and two from China occupy the second through fifth spots, while reigning world champion Daiki Hashimoto of Japan is in 18th at the halfway point.\n\nHere are the top three at the halfway point.\n\nFirst: Japan's Shinnosuke Oka, 42.932\n\nJapan's Shinnosuke Oka, 42.932 Second: Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev, 42.766\n\nUkraine's Oleg Verniaiev, 42.766 Third: China's Xiao Ruoteng\n\nBrody Malone, Asher Hong, Stephen Nedoroscik supporting teammates at all-around final\n\nBrody Malone, three-time U.S. champion, missed out on tonight's event after a rough performance in qualifying. But he's on the floor helping out Frederick Richard and Paul Juda. Before Richard went on pommel horse, Malone brought the chalk bag onto the podium and helped adjust the height of the horse. Between rotations, he helped lug everyone's bags to the next event. Meanwhile, Asher Hong and Stephen Nedoroscik are watching from the stands.\n\nWhile it might seem unusual, other gymnasts will often help their teammates during all-around and event finals. The Netherlands' Loran De Munck, for example, was helping his teammate, Frank Rijken.\n\nFrederick Richard on still rings, Paul Juda on vault\n\nAs for the Americans, Frederick Richard followed up his fall on pommel horse with a solid routine on rings, while Paul Juda lost some points on his vault for taking a sideways hop out of the landing zone. They'll both by sitting in the back of the pack by the end of the second rotation.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results: Second rotation\n\nTwo of the favorites to win gold tonight, Boheng Zhang of China and Daishi Hakimoto of Japan, have both already had shocking mistakes in the early stages of the competition.\n\nZhang, who topped the leaderboard in qualifying, came up short on a tumbling pass on floor and leaned forward onto his head in his first rotation. Then, minuteslater, Hakimoto fell off the pommel horse after stalling on a handstand. Their mistakes left the door open for 20-year-old Shinnosuke Oka of Japan to move into the lead, at least for now.\n\nStandings after the second rotation:\n\nFirst: Japan's Shinnosuke Oka, 29.006\n\nJapan's Shinnosuke Oka, 29.006 Second: Great Britain's Jake Jarman, 28.966\n\nGreat Britain's Jake Jarman, 28.966 Third: Felix Dolci, 28.699\n\nFrederick Richard falls off pommel horse\n\nOf the two Americans in the field tonight, reigning world bronze medalist Frederick Richard entered with the best chance of winning an all-around medal. But his start on pommel horse won't help. Richard, 20, appeared off balance as soon as he mounted the apparatus and then fell off it altogether when his hand slipped during a flare. While there's still a lot of gymnastics to go, his score of 12.733 left him sitting 23rd out of 24 gymnasts after the first rotation.\n\nPaul Juda on still rings\n\nPaul Juda, meanwhile, got off to a much more solid start on still rings: A 13.433 that was almost exactly on par with his performance in qualifying.\n\nOlympic gymnastics results: First rotation\n\nHere are the men's all-around final standings after the first rotation.\n\nFirst: Great Britain's Jake Jarman: 14.900 (floor)\n\nGreat Britain's Jake Jarman: 14.900 (floor) Second: Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev: 14.833 (pommel horse)\n\nUkraine's Oleg Verniaiev: 14.833 (pommel horse) Tied for third: Japan's Daiki Hashimoto 14.633 (floor), Ukraine's Illia Kovtun 14.633 (pommel horse)\n\nWho is last US man to win an Olympic all-around medal?\n\nThat would be Danell Leyva, who won a bronze at the 2012 Olympics in London. He was just the third American man to win an all-around medal at the Olympics, following Peter Vidmar's silver in 1984 and Paul Hamm's gold in 2004.\n\nThe U.S. men haven't had much more success in the all-around at the world championships. Frederick Richard's bronze last year was the first since 2010, when Jonathan Horton also won a bronze. The only other two all-around medals by U.S. men at the world championships were by Paul Hamm, who won gold in 2003, and Kurt Thomas, the silver medalist in 1979.\n\nHow does Olympic gymnastics scoring work?\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that’s your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it’s a single skill.)\n\nUS men winning Olympic team bronze shows strategy changes are working\n\nFor years, the U.S. men’s gymnastics teams would insist they were within striking distance of the podium, that they were thisclose to winning a medal. But if the Americans ever wanted a medal, they were going to have to do more than talk.\n\n“We had to trust the process,” said Sam Mikulak, a three-time Olympian who now coaches Brody Malone and Stephen Nedoroscik. “The first couple of years were rough.”\n\nIt worked, though. The bronze medal hanging around the U.S. men's necks Monday night is proof. The medal is the Americans’ first at an Olympics since 2008, when they also won a bronze. It comes a year after they snapped a nine year drought at the world championships, also with a bronze.\n\n“I just hope it shows promise, shows capability and shows that when you put trust in one another and you put the hard work in that things do happen,” said Paul Juda, a member of both drought-busting teams.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/27/gymnastics-floor-exercise-final-paris-olympics/74450312007/", "title": "When is Olympic gymnastics floor final?

She is heavily favored to win her second all-around Olympic gold medal, and tasked with leading the Americans to another team victory at the Games.

Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nSimone Biles deserves this moment. She earned it, in every meaning of the word\n\nSimone Biles is headed to the Olympics for a third time, seeking a better experience than the nightmare of Tokyo three years ago. “She’s calm. She laughs. She’s back to her same goofy self that we had missed,” Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles with husband Laurent Landi, said last week. “She has a few tools that are personal to her but that help her stay calm and remember why she’s here.”\n\nIt isn’t to try to burnish her legacy, either. She long ago established herself as the greatest gymnast in history and another title, even a second all-around crown, isn’t going to change how history remembers her. It’s for herself. And it’s because she can, not long after she feared she couldn’t. Read Nancy Armour's full column on Simone Biles.\n\nSimone Biles' floor routine gets a standing ovation\n\nNext stop, Paris for Simone Biles. Biles concluded her performance at Olympic trials with a floor exercise routine that has become a fan favorite and generated buzz on social media. She soared up 12 feet above the floor on her first pass, according to NBC, and turned in another brilliant performance for a score of 14.275.\n\nAs the crowd gave her a standing ovation, Biles flashed a bright smile before sitting on the top step of the set of stairs going up to the floor. She appeared to be either trying to catch her breath, soak up the moment or both. The score gave her a two-day all-around total of 117.225 — and another Olympic trials victory.\n\nWhat Simone Biles, U.S. Olympic gymnasts said after making the team\n\nSuni Lee, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Hezly Rivera spoke on the NBC broadcast after the team was named.\n\nSuni Lee: “Well, I was just reminded of my goals every day and constantly surrounded by people who never let me give up. I’m so thankful because a year ago, I didn’t even think this was …” she said as she choked up and shed some tears, “yeah, I didn’t think this was possible and I’m so grateful for all these amazing ladies. They’re absolutely incredible, so I can’t wait to be in Paris.”\n\nJade Carey: “This is the most stressful meet I’ve ever been a part of in my life. Those past experiences really helped me, reminded me why I’m doing this sport and where I wanna go and I couldn’t do it without my family, my coaches, my friends, even these ladies right here, so I’m ready to rock it in Paris with them.”\n\nJordan Chiles: “Honestly, one thing I can say is (it’s) all God. I wouldn’t be where I am right now if it wasn’t for him, if it wasn’t for these amazing ladies, my coaches, my family, my friends. I was out here today doing it for the two I lost last year, my grandpa and my aunt. They always believed in my and that’s what made me continue to push my dream, push to another olympics, which is crazy to say. And this was for you, Uncle.\" At the end, Chiles gave a mod to Megan Thee Stallion and her signature ad-lib: \"And Megan, I’m going to the, AH, Olympics.”\n\nHezly Rivera: \"I’m so grateful for everything. I’ve made a lot of sacrifices to be here, so I”m so incredibly grateful forever. I could not be more happy. I’m ecstatic.”\n\nSimone Biles is Team USA’s new grandma\n\nSImone Biles is 27 years old and is the oldest female American gymnast to make the Olympics since the 1950s. After the team was announced on Sunday, her four teammates expressed their gratitude for Biles offering her guidance and mentorship, something Biles said is important to her.\n\n\"I've been in their exact same spot, I know exactly how they're feeling and if I can be a mentor and a guide, then that's what I'm gonna do to lighten the load,” Biles said on NBC.\n\nAnd in a funny twist, Biles may be the new grandma of the team.\n\n“I used to call Aly (Raisman) grandma, and I’ve surpassed that,” Biles said with a laugh, “so I love you, Aly, and I love these girls, so I’m gonna take care of them in Paris.”\n\nWhat Simone Biles said after gymnastics trials\n\nOn her journey to this point: \"Being in a good mental spot, seeing my therapist every Thursday is kind of religious for me, so that's why I'm here today.\"\n\nOn being the oldest female American gymnast since the 1950s to head to the Olympics: “I knew I wasn’t done after the performances in Tokyo. Getting back in the gym and trusting the process with Cecile and Laurent,” Biles said, referring to co-coaches Cecile and Laurent Landi, “I knew I’d be back.”\n\nOn Taylor Swift responding to her floor routine and if Swift knew Biles would use her music: \"I think my team talks to her team sometimes and I've met her a couple times, so it's been really sweet.\"\n\nSimone Biles scores high on beam even after fall\n\nSimone Biles dropped an expletive as she left the balance beam Friday night, disgusted after an uncharacteristically shaky routine. On Sunday, she appeared to just be exasperated.\n\nBiles was absolutely brilliant for roughly 75% of her routine until she lost her balance on an aerial and fell off the beam. This time, she had a \"what the heck\" sort of grin on her face as she left the podium, and NBC's cameras caught her saying \"that was so good\" until the point where it went wrong.\n\nThe crazy thing is that Biles still got a score of 13.900, even with her fall. And she will enter the final rotation with a gigantic lead in the all-around standings. With one rotation left, Biles has a score of 102.500.\n\nSimone Biles' bars routine\n\nSimone Biles put up a 14.200 on bars, which was 0.250 lower than her score on Friday night.\n\nSimone Biles overcooked Yurchenko double pike on vault\n\nSimone Biles simply has bigger skills than everyone else, as she showed with her Yurchenko double pike vault. It's so difficult few men even try it, yet Biles gets so much height and power she actually overcooked it and had to run backwards. She got a 15.5, down from the first night of trials but still likely to be one of the few scores above 15 of the night. As understandably shaky as everyone looked Friday night, they look that good tonight and are cooking with gas so far.\n\nSuni Lee highlights at gymnastics trials\n\nSuni Lee put up a 14.100 on vault on Night 2.\n\nLee scored a 13.850 on floor.\n\nLee rocked her routine on uneven bars, her signature event, and had the hometown crowd roaring with each of her release moves. More impressive? She'd struggled in the warmup just minutes before. A broad grin broke across Lee's face after she finished, and the crowd gave her a standing ovation as she trotted off the podium. The judges were equally wowed, giving her a 14.875. That vaulted her into second place behind Biles, whose place on the Paris team has been all but assured since she returned.\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full story on Suni Lee’s health journey after dealing with a kidney disease and how it changed her gymnastics mindset.\n\nSuni Lee falls on beam, Simone Biles gives her a pep talk\n\nSimone Biles is always there with the pep talk when Suni Lee needs one. Lee had a rough go on balance beam, falling on her mount and needing to put her hands down later in the routine, which counts just as much as a fall. She looked upset after finishing the routine and immediately headed backstage, not even waiting to see her score. (A 12.825.)\n\nWhen she came back out, she and Biles chatted and both were soon seen laughing. After a few seconds, Lee gave a nod, like, \"OK, I'm better.\"\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of what happened the second night of the U.S. championships. Lee had botched her vault, her first event, and ran backstage. Biles followed, asking if she was OK and telling her she needed to trust in her gymnastics. And if Lee couldn't, Biles said she'd do it for her. Biles then stayed by the uneven bars podium to watch Lee compete, cheering her on throughout her routine before heading back to her own event.\n\nGymnastics trials scores\n\nRotation 1\n\nVAULT : Simone Biles (15.500), Jade Carey (14.675), Jordan Chiles: 14.500, Joscelyn Roberson: 14.500, Tiana Sumanasekera (14.350), Dulcy Caylor (13.900), Zoey Molomo: 13.850, Evey Lowe (13.675).\n\n: Simone Biles (15.500), Jade Carey (14.675), Jordan Chiles: 14.500, Joscelyn Roberson: 14.500, Tiana Sumanasekera (14.350), Dulcy Caylor (13.900), Zoey Molomo: 13.850, Evey Lowe (13.675).

Jones could still technically be named to the Olympic team, because she completed an uneven bars routine on the first night of Olympic trials. But after withdrawing from nationals and missing almost the entirety of trials, it seems like a remote possibility.\n\nJones was one of three athletes who suffered injuries in competition or warmups this week. Skye Blakely and Kayla DiCello both ruptured Achilles tendons. \"Before this week started, many people would've had those three athletes on the Olympic team,\" NBC analyst Samantha Peszek said on Sunday's broadcast. \"So it changes things.\"\n\nJordan Chiles vault on Night 2\n\nJordan Chiles clapped on the runway as she awaited her second vault. The crowd joined along. And then Chiles turned in a 14.500.\n\nIs Simone Biles going to Paris Olympics?\n\nYes. Widely considered to be the greatest gymnast ever, Biles will be making her third appearance at the Summer Olympics. She won four golds and a bronze at the 2016 Rio Games, then a silver and bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nSuni Lee's health journey and how it changed her mindset\n\nSuni Lee is in good shape to make the five-person U.S. team for the Paris Olympics. She was fourth at the national championships in early June and has upgraded her routines on uneven bars and floor since then. But a health crisis 15 months ago — she developed a kidney disease that caused her to retain so much fluid she couldn’t even put on her grips — has upended her life. There were days she couldn’t even get out of bed.\n\nLee said a phone call she got Jan. 4, the details she wants to keep private, was a turning point for her. “I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I’m going back into the gym tomorrow and I'm going to be better than I ever was.’ That was the day I was like, 'Yep, this is what I want. And I'm gonna put my mind into it,’” she said.

However, she only competed in some of her scheduled events in 2021 after experiencing a case of the \"twisties,\" which caused her to lose track of where she was in the air, jeopardizing her physical safety.\n\nHow old was Simone Biles in her first Olympics?\n\nSimone Biles was 19 years old at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nHow many gold medals does Simone Biles have?\n\nSimone Biles has won four Olympic gold medals, all of them at the 2016 Rio Games. She led the \"Final Five\" to team gold, claimed the individual all-around gold and won two of the four individual events: Floor exercise and vault. She has also won a silver medal (in the 2021 team competition) and two Olympic bronzes on balance beam in 2016 and 2021.\n\nSimone Biles Netflix show: What to know\n\nNetflix released the trailer recently for “Simone Biles: Rising” and said the four-part docuseries will begin streaming July 17, nine days before the Opening Ceremony. “Rising” follows Biles’ return to competition after a case of “the twisties” forced her out of most of the Tokyo Games.\n\nSimone BIles leotards\n\nHere's a look at her leotards over the years.\n\nWhen do the Summer Olympics start?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics begins with the Opening Ceremony on July 26.

Only the top all-around finisher at trials is guaranteed a spot on the Olympic team.\n\nJordan Chiles (56.400) and Suni Lee (56.025) are sitting in second and third entering Sunday night's trials finale, when the five-member team will be finalized.\n\nBeyond the leaderboard, the story of Friday night was the injuries. Shilese Jones, the reigning world bronze medalist, was already managing a long-term shoulder injury before she injured her left knee while landing a vault in warmups. The injury prompted her to compete only in uneven bars, where she was stellar, and raises questions about her fitness and health for Paris.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nKayla DiCello also sustained an injury on vault less than an hour later, and her injury could prove to be more serious. She left the floor in a wheelchair and immediately scratched from the remainder of the night.\n\nHere's how the action unfolded on the first night:\n\nJordan Chiles finds inspiration in Beyonce, Megan Thee Stallion, GloRilla\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − If Jordan Chiles makes her second Olympic team, Beyonce, Megan Thee Stallion and GloRilla deserve some of the credit.\n\nChiles said she was having a rough practice Friday morning and it put her in a funk. She was overthinking and stressing out. As she got ready for the meet, however, she was listening to music and it changed her attitude.\n\n\"Megan, Beyonce, GloRilla, every girl artist you can think of was popping up. I was like, `You know what? If these girls can slay like this, I can go out there and slay like them,'\" Chiles said. \"So what I came in to do today was just to have fun and vibe with everybody.\"\n\nThe inspiration worked. Chiles posted the second-highest score after Simone Biles, a 56.4. She also had the third-highest score on floor exercise and fourth-best on both vault and uneven bars.\n\nThe five-woman Olympic team will be named Sunday, after the second night of competition.\n\n\"This meet is stressful enough,\" Chiles said. \"So I might as well put some good energy out there.\" −Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles earns standing ovation for Yurchenko double pike\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − The audience at the Olympic gymnastics trials knows greatness when they see it.\n\nSimone Biles got a standing ovation from fans for her Yurchenko double pike. It doesn't matter how many times she does it, it's always jaw-dropping to see it in person.\n\nBiles gets great height on the vault, and the power that's needed to do it practically ripples off her as she flips. She had to take a step to control the landing, but that's just nitpicking. The judges clearly agreed, giving her a 15.975 that included a 9.75 for execution.\n\nBiles was happy with the effort, grinning as she trotted off the podium to exchange high fives with coach Laurent Landi. −Nancy Armour\n\nWho's healthy enough to join Simone Biles on US team?\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Call it carnage, chaos or just plain bad damn luck, the four women who join Simone Biles at the Paris Olympics might wind up being whoever’s healthy enough to make the trip.\n\nIn a 30-minute span Friday night, Shilese Jones suffered a knee injury that limited her to one event and Kayla DiCello was knocked out with an ankle injury. Meanwhile Skye Blakely, a member of the U.S. teams that won gold at the last two world championships, was hobbling around the floor on crutches because of the ruptured Achilles that occurred during training two days earlier.\n\nHere's more on how the injuries could impact the team for Paris from columnist Nancy Armour.\n\nSimone Biles dazzles with floor routine\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Simone Biles' floor routine remains masterful.\n\nIn the highest-scoring routine of the night so far, Biles put together another brilliant performance on floor, starting with an especially massive Biles II − one of several skills named after her − on her first pass. A slight step out of bounds on a subsequent pass was one of the few small blemishes in a routine that generated a score of 14.850 and boosted her into first place in the all-around standings.\n\nVault − and, most likely, Biles' famed Yurchenko double pike − is all that's standing between Biles and a first-place finish on the first night of trials.\n\nMeanwhile, on balance beam, Suni Lee showed why she is still one of the best in the world, turning in a 14.400 despite a significant wobble on her flight series. She spent one or perhaps two seconds on one foot before regaining her balance, drawing awe from NBC's broadcasting crew and a loud cheer from the crowd at Target Center. −Tom Schad\n\nSimone Biles uncharacteristically shaky on balance beam\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Remember this moment, as it will likely be fleeting: Simone Biles is in second place through two rotations.\n\nBiles had an uncharacteristically shaky showing on balance beam, nearly falling on her mount and taking a small hop on her dismount. Her score of 13.650 is solid by most gymnasts' standards, but not her own. She turned in scores of 14.800 on both of her balance beam routines at nationals about a month ago.\n\nBiles' disgust could hardly have been more obvious after her beam performance, when the jumbotron cameras captured her clearly mouthing an expletive as she left the podium. (The expletive was not audible on NBC's broadcast.)\n\nLeanne Wong is, for now, atop the all-around leaderboard − and, with the injuries to Shilese Jones and Kayla DiCello, she is strengthening her case for Paris. Jordan Chiles and Sunisa Lee were sitting third and fourth, respectively, at the midway point of Friday's competition. −Tom Schad\n\nShilese Jones has a world-class uneven bars routine, her only event\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Shilese Jones made her only event of the night a good one.\n\nJones, who injured her left knee in pre-meet warmups and scratched her first event, vault, delivered a world-class performance on uneven bars. Her score of 14.675 is the highest of the meet so far, and also means she can officially be considered by the selection committee. There are no injury petitions onto the team for the Paris Olympics, so gymnasts have to compete at trials.\n\nJones took a hop forward on her dismount, and then a hop to the side. After saluting the judges she was limping visibly, walking slowly to the end of the podium before sitting down. She scratched her remaining two events, balance beam and floor exercise, shortly after. −Nancy Armour\n\nSimone Biles opens with terrific uneven bars routine\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Leave it to Simone Biles to bring a little sanity to a chaotic night at the Olympic trials.\n\nAfter Shilese Jones hurt her leg in warmups, Kayla DiCello had to withdraw with a right ankle injury and Suni Lee avoided a scare when her hand slipped on the vault table, Biles delivered a terrific uneven bars routine. Her 14.25 put her atop the standings until Leanne Wong appealed her score on vault.\n\nWong had two points deducted for not pushing off the vault table with both hands. But her appeal was successful, boosting her score to 14.45.\n\nJordan Chiles, a Tokyo Olympian and Biles' WCC teammate, is third with a 14.35 on bars.\n\nThose are the highlights. The rest of the night has been a hot mess. DiCello, the first competitor of the night, did a tucked Yurchenko vualt and immediately rolled to her back, tears filling her eyes as she shook her head no. She was crying as she was wheeled off the floor. Lee, who is DiCello's best friend, had to go next on vault and her hand slipped on the table. She was at least able to land her vault on her feet, but she was clearly upset afterward.\n\nAnd Jones, considered almost as much of a lock as Biles for the Paris team, scratched vault after injuring her leg in pre-meet warmups. Jones' first event was vault, and she did a test run on the podium before heading backstage with coach Sarah Korngold. She can still compete in the other three events. −Nancy Armour\n\nShilese Jones scratches from vault; Kayla DiCello injury ends her night\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Shilese Jones walked off the floor during her warmup period on vault and has scratched from the event, per USA Gymnastics' online scoring system.\n\nJones was speaking with her coach and members of the medical staff after sustaining a potential injury during warmups. She is due up next on uneven bars.\n\nMeanwhile, USA Gymnastics announced that Kayla DiCello is out for the night after sustaining an injury of her own on the first vault of the night. −Tom Schad\n\nSuni Lee salvages vault after scary takeoff\n\nMINNEAPOLIS – A scary moment for Suni Lee, whose hand slipped on the vault table. The reigning Olympic champion still managed to land her Yurchenko double on her feet, taking a step to the side.\n\nKayla DiCello injures ankle on vault as gymnastics trials begin\n\nMINNEAPOLIS – More worrisome news for the U.S. On the very first vault of the competition, Kayla DiCello sat down on her landing and appeared to sustain a right ankle injury. She was helped off the mat by members of the medical staff.\n\nDiCello finished third in the all-around competition at nationals and is one of several gymnasts in the mix for a spot on the Paris Olympic team. The 20-year-old was an alternate on the Tokyo Olympic team.\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete at U.S. gymnastics Olympic trials?\n\nSimone Biles is likely to compete her first rotation (uneven bars) shortly after 7:45 p.m. ET on Friday, then move in the order of events that is in place for Olympic competition − to balance beam, then floor exercise, then vault. On Sunday night, Biles will start on vault, with her first attempt around 8:20 p.m. ET. She will then go to uneven bars and balance beam before concluding on floor.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts!

But USA Gymnastics announced \"Shilese Jones will compete.\" When Jones' name was called, she ran out onto the podium, not looking as if anything is amiss.\n\nJones is already nursing a shoulder injury that kept her out of the national championships four weeks ago.\n\nShilese Jones has injury scare before competition begins\n\nMINNEAPOLIS – Shilese Jones appeared to injure her left leg during warmups before the first night of Olympic trials.\n\nJones was practicing on vault when she landed awkwardly and rolled backward on the mat, grabbing her leg. Simone Biles, who was just across the way on uneven bars, immediately ran to check on Jones, who nodded at something Biles said to her.\n\nJones was able to walk off the floor with help from her coach and a medical staffer, but she was walking very gingerly.\n\nJones, an all-around medalist at the last two world championships, is considered almost as much of a lock for the Paris team as Biles. But she was already nursing a shoulder injury, which forced her to withdraw from the national championships.\n\nSkye Blakely attends trials after Achilles injury\n\nMINNEAPOLIS − Skye Blakely was on the floor during warmups, on crutches and her right leg heavily bandaged.\n\nBlakely ruptured her Achilles tendon during training on floor exercise on Wednesday. She landed a tumbling pass and immediately fell to the mat. She was sobbing as she was carried off the podium, and she had to be taken out of the arena in a wheelchair.\n\n\"This is not the way I saw my Olympic trials going or how my season ends,\" Blakely said in an Instagram post Thursday. \"I’m devastated and heartbroken but I believe everything happens for a reason. I was so close to reaching my dream but this injury was unavoidable.\"\n\nBlakely had been considered a strong contender for the Olympic team. She was part of the U.S. teams that won gold at the last two world championships, and her stock rose even higher after she debuted a monster new vault at the national championships earlier this month.\n\nIt's not clear if she'll continue competing at the elite level. She has already committed to Florida. −Nancy Armour\n\nU.S. gymnastics Olympic trials announcers\n\nMike Tirico will host NBC's coverage, and Terry Gannon (play-by-play) will be joined by analysts Tim Daggett, Samantha Peszek and John Roethlisberger on the call.\n\nSimone Biles is a lock for Paris Olympics. But who's going to join her?\n\nThe top contenders are: Shilese Jones, an all-around medalist at the last two world championships; reigning Olympic champion Suni Lee; Tokyo floor exercise gold medalist Jade Carey; and Tokyo Olympian Jordan Chiles. Also keep an eye on Kayla DiCello and Leanne Wong, two of the Tokyo alternates, and Josc Roberson, a member of last year’s worlds team. And if you’re looking for dark horses, Hezly Rivera and Tiana Sumanasekera could make things interesting.\n\nSkye Blakely, a member of the last two world teams whose stock was rising after debuting a monster vault at the national championships, is out after an Achilles injury during podium training Wednesday.

Here’s how\n\nSuni Lee is in good shape to make the five-person U.S. team for the Paris Olympics. She was fourth at the national championships in early June and has upgraded her routines on uneven bars and floor since then. But a health crisis 15 months ago –– she developed a kidney disease that caused her to retain so much fluid she couldn’t even put on her grips –– has upended her life. There were days she couldn’t even get out of bed.\n\nLee said a phone call she got Jan. 4, the details she wants to keep private, was a turning point for her.\n\n“I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I’m going back into the gym tomorrow and I'm going to be better than I ever was.’ That was the day I was like, 'Yep, this is what I want. And I'm gonna put my mind into it,’” she said.\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full story on Suni Lee’s health journey.\n\nShilese Jones shoulder injury update\n\nShilese Jones is no longer feeling pain in her injured shoulder and \"feels pretty good\" ahead of this week's U.S. Olympic gymnastics trials, her coach Sarah Korngold said Wednesday.\n\nJones, who has established herself the United States' top female gymnast outside of Simone Biles, withdrew from the U.S. championships about a month ago but successfully petitioned USA Gymnastics for her spot at trials, which begin Friday. She has been dealing with a small tear in her right labrum for approximately two years, Korngold said, and growing pain ahead of nationals led her to withdraw and take a week off as a precaution.\n\n\"We've slowly been building back up into routines. So she's been doing her full routines,\" Korngold said Wednesday.\n\nWhy Simone Biles is 'close to unstoppable' as she just keeps getting better with age\n\nHere Simone Biles is at 27 at the U.S. gymnastics Olympic trials, better now than anyone, ever, has ever been in her sport. “I use the phrase, 'Aging like fine wine,’” she joked in early June, after she’d extended her own record with her ninth U.S. championship. Perhaps the biggest difference at this stage of her career is that Biles’ mind and body are in sync.

The Starliner, like SpaceX's Dragon, is being contracted by NASA to ferry crews to-and-from the ISS.\n\n\"Because it is a test flight, we give extra attention ... they are checking out a lot of the systems, the life support, the manual control, all of those things that you want to be checked out,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson at a Friday news conference. \"That's why we put two test pilots onboard.\"\n\nThe Starliner capsule is set to launch atop the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on the Crewed Flight Test mission at 10:34 p.m. Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Launch Complex 41. The early weather outlook appears good with a 95 percent chance of acceptable conditions for launch.\n\n\"We’re at peak performance right now and we’re really looking forward to executing this weekend, executing the launch and executing the mission in the same way that we got here,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager for Boeing's Starliner program. \"We’re ready to go.\"\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the mission.\n\nDon't miss the next rocket launch:Is there a launch today? Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, ULA, NASA in Florida\n\nWhere will Starliner launch from?\n\nStarliner will launch from Space Force Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThe pad has been the launch site for historic missions beginning with the Titan rockets in 1965. Other notable missions include the New Horizons deep space probe, the Voyager spacecraft and even the Curiosity Mars rover.\n\nWhat has never happened from the pad before: the launch of humans. The Atlas V rocket has launched from the site since 2002, but this will be the first time it carries astronauts to space.\n\nTo prepare for this mission, the launch complex recently saw the addition of a crew access arm.\n\nAnother interesting note: the last crewed launch from this military side of the Cape occurred in 1968 with the launch of Apollo 7. All other crewed launches since have taken place from Kennedy Space Center.\n\nAlso, this will be only the sixth time in history NASA astronauts have flown a new spacecraft. These include: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle, Dragon, and now Starliner.\n\nRole of Boeing Starliner in NASA's Commercial Crew Program\n\nThe day the Starliner spacecraft was finally mated to the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket for the crew flight test was a long time coming for the team at Boeing.\n\nNASA originally awarded Boeing the contract to fly astronauts in 2014, alongside SpaceX. Boeing received $4.8 billion for Starliner while SpaceX received $3.1 billion for Dragon. Both companies were part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which replaced the space shuttle after its retirement in 2011.\n\nBoth were late to deliver, hoping to launch as soon as 2017 and restore NASA astronauts access to space from American soil (NASA astronauts were hitching rides aboard the Russian Soyuz).\n\nFollowing a successful crewed demo flight in 2020, SpaceX has since flown eight NASA crews and multiple private crews to the ISS.\n\nAfter facing multiple setbacks, including issues found after a successful uncrewed docking with the ISS and landing in 2022, Boeing hopes to prove the capability of its Starliner spacecraft to take on its designated role ferrying NASA crews to the station.\n\nOnce successful, Starliner will fly NASA crews in rotation with SpaceX's Dragon− a needed redundancy to ensure NASA access to low Earth orbit.\n\nGoing beyond this test flight, according to Boeing, NASA has already contracted for six crewed missions on Starliner.\n\nNASA astronaut and former NASA Associate Administrator and former KSC Director Bob Cabana told FLORIDA TODAY that the success of Boeing Starliner is essential to ensure NASA always has a way to access the station.\n\n“We want that dissimilar redundancy,” said Cabana, adding that NASA cannot rely on solely one company.\n\nWith the commercial crew program charged with ensuring access to low Earth orbit, NASA continues to work on its Artemis program, which will fly a crew around the Moon as soon as late 2025. That will mark the first time humans have returned to the Moon since the Apollo missions ended over five decades ago.\n\nNASA's confidence in Starliner\n\nFLORIDA TODAY spoke with Kim Ess, manager of the Integrated Performance Office (IPO) in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) at Johnson Space Center. Ess explained that NASA has done demonstration testing alongside Boeing to ensure the safety of the spacecraft.\n\n\"We took more risks when it was just a test flight,\" Ess said on the topic of the second uncrewed flight in 2022. \"Now that our payload, our two crew members, Butch and Suni, we did a lot more research.\"\n\nShe explained that NASA provided Boeing requirements to meet before this crewed flight, and Boeing returned with the necessary results.\n\n\"In many cases, we do an independent verification of those requirements,\" Ess said. She used the example of Boeing demonstrating that they would be able to return the crew safely during a simulation of the landing. NASA ran the same simulation at the organization's Johnson Space Center to compare the data.\n\n\"Any differences, we bring in and we talk with them and see 'okay, did you have an error in your model, or did we have an error in our model, or are these true differences?'\" Ess said.\n\n\"As long as they're along the same lines, we're good. And we have done that extensively for this flight,\" Ess said.\n\nWhat is the Starliner spacecraft?\n\nBoeing calls it the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner, or simply “Starliner”. Like SpaceX's Crew Dragon, it can carry a mix of crew and cargo or up to seven crew memebers.\n\nWith a total height of 16.5 ft (capsule + service module combined) and a diameter of 15 ft, it is a what Boeing refers to as \"a next-generation space capsule.\"\n\nThis Starliner spacecraft has a name\n\nThe capsule flying Monday was named Calypso by Williams.\n\nWilliams, a lover of the ocean, has stated in the past that she named the spacecraft Calypso after the ship of Jacque Cousteau, which was an ocean explorer in the mid-20th century.\n\nThat ship was remembered for its underwater observation chamber and being equipped with a helicopter and submersibles, assisting in scientific expeditions. Williams mentioned being excited by Cousteau's television show as a young girl and looked forward to watching his expeditions.\n\nWilliams has a special connection to Brevard County\n\nAfter gaining a B.S. in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Williams graduated from Florida Tech in 1995 with her M.S. in Engineering Science.\n\nLast year, she gave a commencement speech to the 2023 Florida Tech graduates.\n\nWilliams' first chance to fly to space came when assigned to STS-116. On December 9, 2006, Williams and crew took off onboard Space Shuttle Discovery for a six month stay onboard the ISS.\n\nWilliams returned to the ISS during Expedition 32/33. Launching from Kazakhstan in a Soyuz spacecraft on July 14, 2012, Williams saw another long stay onboard the space station. After that 127-day visit to space, she accumulated a total of 322 days spent off the planet.\n\nNow, she said, she's been waiting a long time for this moment.\n\n\"With each launch that was rescheduled, I've been given perspective I would've never had without those delays,\" Williams said before going on to explain how the crew not only got more time to learn about the spacecraft, but to also help shape the Starliner program.\n\nThe Starliner crew's playlist and ride to the pad\n\nDuring a preflight NASA Q and A, Wilmore and Williams mentioned the new Astro Van. Unlike SpaceX crews, who ride in a Tesla, Boeing astronauts will ride to the rocket in a new van. This ride to the pad is reminiscence of the shuttle days, during which NASA astronauts rode in a similar van.\n\nOf course, there will be music on the way.\n\nAsked what would be on their playlist, Wilmore quipped \"Epic music.\" Smiling, he added, \"It's in a fight scene in Top Gun Maverick, it's on my playlist.\"\n\nGuardians at the Gate and Freedom Fighters are two songs Wilmore has on his list.\n\nWilliams, however, is going for a more relaxing feeling before launch. \"A bit of Country Western and a little bit of Pop. I got a little bit of Kenney Chesney, a little bit of Zac Brown ready to go,\" she said.\n\nHow to watch Boeing Starliner launch\n\nFLORIDA TODAY's Space Team will continue to bring you the latest information on the mission. While the launch is currently set for 10:34 p.m. Monday, various factors can change this.\n\nFollow the FLORIDA TODAY Live Blog on launch day as we await the liftoff of Starliner.\n\nTo received launch alerts and updates, download the free FLORIDA TODAY app and enable push alerts from the app settings.\n\nA night launch is difficult to miss under clear conditions. If you are on the Space Coast, simply look towards the sky above the area south of the Kennedy Space Center.\n\nShould conditions Monday night cause a scrub, the next backup launch opportunity is 10:11 p.m. Tuesday. But so far, weather looks like it will cooperate.\n\nWhat awaits the Starliner crew on the space station\n\nPlans call for Starliner to dock with the station about 26 1/2 hours after launch.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will be busy testing all aspects of Starliner. Being a test flight, demonstrating that the spacecraft preforms as it should will be the crew's main focus.\n\nEss told FLORIDA TODAY that one of the biggest objectives is the crew's ability to take manual control of Starliner. While Starliner is autonomous, there must be the ability to control the spacecraft manually in case of an emergency situation.\n\n\"Prior to docking to the space station ... we're going to approach and then stop, and the crew is going to go through several flight test objectives for manual control and demonstrate that they can do it,\" said Ess.\n\nEss said the crew also will be monitoring the spacecraft's software performance.\n\nOnce Starliner receives certification to fly NASA crews, it will carry a crew of four on Starliner-1. For this reason, Williams and Wilmore stated during a May 1st press briefing that Crew-8, four astronauts who are currently onboard the ISS, will provide assistance in checking out that the spacecraft can comfortably fit a crew of four in space.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore stated that they plan to give Crew-8 the full Starliner tour.\n\nWhile their stay onboard the ISS is expected to be approximately eight days, there remains the possibly of this stay being extended due to various factors, such as weather at the landing site. As experienced NASA astronauts, Williams and Wilmore have the training needed to jump in and assist on the ISS if needed.\n\nWhere will Starliner land?\n\nAfter spending approximately a week on the International Space Station thoroughly testing every function of the spacecraft, the Starliner crew will return to Earth.\n\nLanding will not be like in the SpaceX Dragon, which lands in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nStarliner, as it did successfully in the uncrewed test flights, will land under a parachute system and airbags in the New Mexico desert. Boeing refers to it as a \"soft landing\".\n\nSpaceX also targeting Monday\n\nThere could be a doubleheader launch Monday.\n\nSpaceX is targeting a Monday morning Starlink mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, navigational warnings indicate.\n\nThough SpaceX has not publicly announced this mission, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Coast Guard maritime safety bulletins show a Starlink launch window will open Monday from 11:34 a.m. to 4:05 p.m. EDT. SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rockets on its Starlink missions deploying satellites into low-Earth orbit.\n\nFor the latest on the launch, go to floridatoday.com/space.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today.

Here is the latest info on the mission.\n\nBoeing will have to wait to head to space as a planned Monday evening launch to send two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station aboard its Starliner space capsule was called off due to a \"faulty oxygen relief valve observation,\" according to NASA.\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner test mission scheduled for Monday night was years in the making and serves as a final demonstration before the spacecraft can be approved for routine trips to orbit. The stakes were high for the third and final orbital flight test for Starliner, as it would have been the first with a crew on board.\n\nJust like Elon Musk's SpaceX capsule, Starliner is intended to be a vehicle that can ferry astronauts to and from the space station as NASA pivots to more partnerships with private industry. But Boeing has largely lagged behind its competitor, which launched its first crewed mission in 2020, according to Reuters.\n\nHere's what to know about Monday's scheduled launched and how to watch it live.\n\nChina launches lunar probe:Mission is to get samples from far side of moon\n\nWhat to know about the Boeing Starliner, crew\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit. For NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the ISS.\n\nThe two NASA astronauts flying the commercial crew mission are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are Navy test pilots who have flown in space twice, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWilliams, 58, is a former Naval test pilot with experience flying over 30 different aircraft. Selected as an astronaut in 1998, she has has logged 322 days in space over two missions since her first flight in 2007.\n\nWilmore, 61, is a retired Navy captain who completed 21 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm before joining NASA in 200. Since then, he has logged 178 days in space after his first trip to orbit in 2009.\n\nThe astronauts will be in space for a little more than a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems. After the mission, the pair will board the Starliner for a return trip to Earth and a parachute and airbag landing in the American Southwest.\n\n“The first crewed flight of a new spacecraft is an absolutely critical milestone,\" NASA Associate Administrator James Free told reporters during a recent flight readiness review, according to Florida Today. \"The lives of our crew members, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are at stake. We don’t take that lightly at all.”\n\nHow to watch the Boeing Starliner launch\n\nBoeing and NASA are targeting 10:34 p.m. ET on Monday for Starliner's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The capsule will fly to space on top of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nNASA will provide live coverage beginning at 6:30 p.m. on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, the agency's YouTube page and its website. A postlaunch news conference is also planned.\n\nWatch here:\n\nExpect more coverage when the Starliner is expected to dock to the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module at 12:46 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nWhat went wrong on past Boeing tests\n\nDozens of software and engineering issues resulted in the failure of a previous attempt in 2019 to send an uncrewed Starliner to the ISS for a week.\n\nWhile it reached orbit, the capsule failed to reach the space station and instead returned to Earth, according to Florida Today. That mission raised questions and doubts about NASA's future with Boeing, which is scheduled to fly six crewed astronaut missions once it's certified as safe for flight, Reuters reported.\n\nThe follow up flight test in 2022 met standards of docking to the space station and successfully landed, but not without the discovery of multiple issues as Boeing crews inspected the spacecraft later on, Florida Today reported.\n\nEngineers have expressed a high level of confidence about the upcoming launch, the outlet reported.\n\n\"Our process in human spaceflight is very robust. We design around redundancy,\" Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Starliner program, said during a March NASA news conference. \"We test, test, and test.\"\n\nNASA paid Boeing, SpaceX to develop spacecraft\n\nBoeing was selected along with SpaceX to provide spacecrafts that would transport astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit for NASA.\n\nBoeing's contract with the U.S. space agency awarded in 2014 was good for $4.8 billion, while SpaceX received $3.1 billion, according to Florida Today.\n\nThe partnership is part of NASA’s commercial crew program in which the space agency is paying private companies to build spacecraft capable of ferrying trained astronauts to the space station for scientific missions. Under NASA's more ambitious Artemis lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the moon and eventually Mars.\n\nIn March, SpaceX had its most successful test yet of the Starship rocket needed for NASA's Artemis missions. While in orbit, the Starship hit several key milestones and conducted a handful of in-flight tests that are a crucial step forward for it to be reliable and functional.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched March 3 and docked March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nContributing: Brooke Edwards, Florida Today\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

CNN reached out to nearly 20 departments nationwide, along with other key stakeholders including elected officials, union officials and outside recruiters for departments for this story.\n\nThey all point to similar concerns including Covid-19, the great resignation, the climate for law enforcement and local reform efforts that are making recruitment and retention difficult.\n\nThe challenges have led the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to join her officers in patrolling her own city. The department is down 90 officers out of a budgeted force of 627. The department has started to offer a $5,000 bonus for new hires to fill its ranks.\n\nDurham, North Carolina, Police Department Headquarters. CNN\n\n“It’s been tough,” Chief Patrice Andrews said of the current staffing issues facing her city. “We’ve had to be very creative with staffing, you know, putting investigators and those that typically wouldn’t necessarily be taking 911 calls, putting them back on the street.”\n\n“The 911 calls don’t stop. People are still having emergencies, the emergencies don’t stop and certainly the emergencies don’t care if you are 60% staffed or below,” Andrews told CNN while she was on patrol. “This profession is, is something we were all called to do and not everyone is meant to be the police. This profession is certainly a noble one, even yet and still, despite everything, this profession is certainly noble.”\n\nA national survey from June of 2021 found that departments around the country on average were filling 93% of budgeted positions available, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n“You’ve got a workforce that’s being compressed on the front end, you’ve got a drop in people who want to be cops. And on the other end, you have a significant increase in people who are resigning and retiring. And we have a survey that we did (that found a) 44% increase in retirements, 18% increase in resignations (in police departments),” according to Police Executive Research Forum President Chuck Wexler.\n\nOn average, officers spend 8 months training before they can patrol the streets alone, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Meaning, it will take years to fill the open jobs at departments across the country, Wexler said.\n\n“It’s a trying time to be a police officer in this country,” Wexler said. “So, police chiefs are wondering who are going to be the cops of the future.”\n\nDepartments are also struggling daily to cover those out sick due to Covid-19, and higher rates of crime, Wexler and several departments said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is down 440 officers or 7% of the number of police officers budgeted for the city, the department told CNN.\n\n“Well, right now it’s not a very desirable job,” John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), told CNN. “Everything that’s been going on around the country for the last couple of years. … But right now, I mean just getting people to apply is a monster in itself.”\n\nDuring a recent recruitment event, 600 people said they would attend, only 200 showed up and only 26 moved on to the physical assessment phases, McNesby said. The FOP also points to a recently passed requirement that requires all applicants to have lived in the city for at least a year, as an additional challenge to find new officers in the city of brotherly love.\n\nIn Atlanta, which like many cities in America also saw unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, two incidents of police use of force also put pressure on the local community. Community outreach events like Clippers and Cops, held in local barbershops around the city, are trying to “bridge the gap” between the community and the police. The events allow officers to open a dialogue between themselves and the citizens who they serve and protect, participants say.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant, left, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. CNN\n\nDuring an appearance at the event this month, Andre Dickens, the newly elected mayor of Atlanta, said he is working to get the police department back to full strength.\n\n“The goal is to be smart on crime, and so we have to have a balanced approach to safety and justice,” Dickens said. “That means getting more officers in because we lost about 400 to 500 officers over the past three years. So I’m trying to get those 400 officers back, but training them in conflict resolution and skills on how to de-escalate issues so that they can be better community-based cops.”\n\nThe mayor said a number of issues contributed to the decrease in the rank and file. “There was a morale challenge across the last couple of years with Covid and with a lot of issues related to police, excessive use of force that went unchecked, but then … everybody said get rid of police and these sorts of things,” Dickens said.\n\nTyrone Dennis CNN\n\nThe founder of Clippers and Cops was one of those 400 officers who left the department. Detective Tyrone Dennis retired from the force in August 2020, moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to be with his family and took a job as a director of school safety, a job that paid more than being a police officer.\n\n“They got to do better with pay … incentives to retain officers,” he said. “It would be foolish for me to stay for $48,000. When I have a wife and three kids to feed for $48,000. I can almost qualify for public assistance. That’s not cool,” Dennis said.\n\n“Basically we’re one bullet away from death, and one mistake away from indictment so why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?” Dennis said.\n\nPolice leadership also say that pay should be more in line with work requirements. “When you think of what the line of work calls for and what they’re having to do, they’re wanting to be compensated, you know, but also to they’ve got to be able to support their families. You know, we have officers that can’t even qualify for apartments because their, their income doesn’t match up with what the apartments require. That’s a problem,” Andrews said.\n\nIn Phoenix, the police department is sending detectives and officers from various specialty assignments to patrol. Last month, the department started to take additional reports virtually rather than send officers out, police department spokesperson Sgt. Andy Williams told CNN.\n\nThe police department is down 13% of its allotment of officers, according to data provided by Phoenix Police to CNN.\n\nIt is offering hiring bonuses of up to $8,700 dollars for new hires with college degrees, the department said.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Police Chief Catriana A. Thompson says the situation is “alarming.” The department is down 96 officers or 18% of its allotted force. Some of the department’s “specialized units have been disbanded temporarily until staffing levels improve,” Thompson told CNN in a statement.\n\nReliant Hiring Solutions, a firm that works with law enforcement around the country to set up job fairs, said it was more difficult to find recruits in more “liberal cities,” Randall Blanchard, told CNN.\n\nIn Seattle, the department is experiencing “unprecedented” losses of staff, the department told CNN. The department is short more than 225 officers or 17% of its workforce.\n\n“Our losses over the last two years have been unprecedented,” police department spokesperson Sgt. Randy Hyserik told CNN. “Many of our newer officers separated from our department and moved to smaller agencies in the area, and some left law enforcement altogether. In their exit interviews, many cited the ‘defund’ movement and a lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving our department, or for leaving law enforcement completely.”\n\nSeattle’s attrition rate has over doubled in the last two years. Prior to 2020, the annual attrition rate was 70 to 75 officers a year. The department has had 356 officers leave over the last two years, according to data provided to CNN by the department.\n\nPeople that call police for non-life-threatening calls may have to wait longer for a response, unless staffing levels are improved, “you may be lucky if you get an officer 2, 3, 4 hours down the line,” McNesby said.\n\n“I mean it’s easier for me to sit here and talk about it,” McNesby said, “but it really affects the people standing at roll calls in the morning when they look to the left and look to the right and there’s nobody else there … or you have a citizen that’s on the line … where they feel the need for police attention and they dial 911 and you’re not getting anybody coming.”", "authors": ["Ryan Young Devon M.

Know your rights | CNN Business", "text": "The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle.\n\nBut it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse.\n\nHere’s a quick primer on what employees need to know.\n\nHow much advance notice should I get?\n\nFor a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act.\n\nIf an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave.\n\n“Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield.\n\nIf a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh.\n\nTechnically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in.\n\nHow much severance am I entitled to?\n\nUn-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it.\n\nThat said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination.\n\nA second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said.\n\nWhat do I give up in exchange for accepting severance?\n\nAn employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money.\n\nPut bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said.\n\nGenerally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing.\n\nYou also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include:\n\nA confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement.\n\nA non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place.\n\nA cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there.\n\nA non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company.\n\nA non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business.\n\nWaiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes.\n\nCan I negotiate the terms of the severance?\n\nIf you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead.\n\n“A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said.\n\nIf you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package.\n\n“Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said.\n\nYou might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay.\n\nShould I hire a lawyer?\n\nSince a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer.\n\nIf hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement.\n\nIf your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case.\n\nOr, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone.\n\nHow long will I have to decide whether to accept a severance package?\n\nUnder federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement.\n\nIn either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind.\n\nThat said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are.\n\nWill I lose my severance if I start earning income again?\n\nMany employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position.\n\nIf you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid.\n\n“They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said.\n\nIn either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms.\n\nBut if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/us/highland-park-suspect-family-turmoil-invs/index.html", "title": "Highland Park gunman's family was in turmoil for years leading up to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Bob’s Pantry and Deli opened for business in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park in 2008, loyal customers lined up in the snow at 4 a.m. to support Bob Crimo, who was striking out on his own after years running a convenience store franchise. Photos from opening day showed customers hoisting massive sandwiches and Crimo posing with his beaming family – including his eight-year-old son Robert Crimo III, who went by Bobby.\n\nThe deli quickly became a popular local fixture: a hangout spot for teenagers, a friendly gathering place for the neighborhood, and a pit stop for an affordable, delicious lunch.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the Crimo family was in turmoil. Police reports show that officers were regularly called to their home over domestic disputes between Crimo and his wife, and in 2019, police briefly confiscated a collection of knives after then 18-year-old Bobby threatened to “kill everyone.”\n\nMore recently, after the once-bustling deli closed, the family appeared to fall into dire financial straits, with foreclosure cases proceeding against both of the homes they owned and Bob Crimo telling a judge several weeks ago he was on food stamps.\n\nThen, as Highland Park prepared to celebrate the Fourth of July this week with the annual parade through the city’s picturesque downtown, Bobby allegedly climbed onto a cosmetics store rooftop with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire on the festivities, killing seven people and injuring dozens of others.\n\nIn the wake of the tragedy, the close-knit community of Highland Park is reeling and trying to understand a massacre with no apparent motive. Locals said that it was even more shocking that the shooter was Bobby Crimo – the son of a well-known local figure beloved by his regular customers, who even ran for mayor several years ago.\n\nBob Crimo at the Bob's Pantry and Deli opening in 2008. Obtained by CNN\n\nThe elder Crimo is facing scrutiny in part because he sponsored a permit allowing his son to purchase firearms before he turned 21, including the gun he used in the shooting. Locals who once lined up for “Nicky D” sandwiches at Bob’s say they can’t comprehend how the family could have missed warning signs, including violent imagery in the music videos Bobby posted online, or why Crimo would have signed the gun permit application.\n\n“To be that irresponsible and signing off is mind-blowing to me,” said Barbara Medina, a longtime Highland Park resident who often shopped at the deli and was marching in the parade when the shooting took place. “It’s a shock that it’s anybody in your town, that they could come in and do that to their own community.”\n\nCrimo did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, but in an interview with the New York Post, he said he had no idea Bobby was preparing to commit the shooting and that he wasn’t responsible for his son’s actions.\n\n“I’ve been here my whole life, and I’m gonna stay here, hold my head up high, because I didn’t do anything wrong,” he declared.\n\nPolice called to family home several times\n\nMore than a dozen Highland Park residents who knew the shooter or his family spoke to CNN about his upbringing, as they tried to piece together how their city had joined the long list of American communities whose names have become shorthand for mass shootings.\n\nBy all accounts, Bobby Crimo was a quiet kid, who could be seen running around his dad’s shop as he grew up. His father ran the White Hen Pantry, a franchise of a local convenience store chain that became known for its sandwiches.\n\nIn an affluent lakeside suburb where most shops closed early, the White Hen Pantry was open 24 hours, giving teenagers a safe hangout spot at night. Regulars remembered the elder Crimo as a gregarious, generous presence who would let customers waiting on a paycheck buy food on credit, and who seemed to be manning the counter at all hours of the day and night.\n\nLocals described Crimo as “the mayor of Ravinia,” the local neighborhood where the store was located, who knew all his customers and their regular orders.\n\nLoyal customers eagerly await the opening of Bob Crimo's deli in 2008. Obtained by CNN\n\nCrimo could be eccentric: One time, a friend said, he competed with another local restaurant owner to see which business could go longer without replacing any lightbulbs – until both stores were almost completely dark.\n\nCrimo’s shop closed after 7-Eleven bought out the White Hen Pantry chain. But Crimo reopened in a new location under his own name, and his loyal clientele followed.\n\nStill, there were signs of trouble in the family. One longtime customer and friend of Crimo’s — who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about the family — remembered that he and his wife, Denise Pesina, would have heated arguments in the deli, even in front of customers.\n\n“It was awkward for people,” the friend said. “I remember thinking, if that’s the public arguments, I can only imagine the private ones.”\n\nPolice reports released this week show that the couple’s fights continued behind closed doors. In the six years after the deli opened, officers were called to their home at least a dozen times to settle domestic disputes or respond to allegations that one or the other was intoxicated.\n\nIn one 2010 incident, Crimo alleged that Pesina “had hit him with a screwdriver on the left forearm” – before recanting once he got to the police station – and in another, he claimed she hit him on the head with a shoe.\n\n“He threatens to call the police for any and every argument we get in,” Pesina wrote in one handwritten witness statement. “He says he wants the police to think I’m crazy.”\n\nThere is no record that any of those incidents led to criminal charges against either Crimo or Pesina.\n\nThe two separated at some point, according to friends, with Pesina staying in their Highland Park home and Crimo moving to his father’s home in neighboring Highwood. Bobby lived in both homes over the years.\n\nPesina had had another brush with the law as well: In 2002, when Bobby was nearly two years old, she was arrested for child endangerment after allegedly leaving him in a locked car at a Toys-R-Us parking lot for about 27 minutes on a 79-degree day with the windows rolled up, according to court documents. Pesina pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment, and completed a year of court supervision.\n\nPesina did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. Her lawyer at the time, Steven Lunardi, said that she admitted having made a mistake.\n\nJeremy Cahnmann, who taught Bobby and his brother in an elementary after-school sports program, said the boys stuck out in his memory because their parents almost never picked them up on time.\n\n“I remember talking to faculty at the school about how uninvolved the parents were,” he said. Bobby was “always the kid there at the end who didn’t get picked up.”\n\nFormer classmates describe suspect as withdrawn and odd\n\nAt school, Bobby kept to himself, with former classmates of the future gunman describing him as an odd, soft-spoken kid who showed little interest in class, school activities or his peers. But he explored a different side of his personality with rap songs and music videos he posted online – some of which included troubling imagery.\n\nMolly Handelman, who attended middle school and high school with Bobby, described him as a “very quiet” guy. “When he did talk, he was very soft. He didn’t seem aggressive ever, at all,” she said.\n\nHandelman, who worked with Bobby on class projects a few times, said “something definitely seemed off” about him. “He made it very clear he didn’t care about school,” she said.\n\nAnother former classmate who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns said he and Bobby used to hang out, play video games and skateboard together in middle school. “He would make YouTube videos all the time back then,” the classmate said, “DIY videos on how to grip a skateboard or replace a wheel, stuff like that.”\n\nBut in high school, the former classmate said, Bobby grew more insular and distant. “He was always by himself,” he said. “No one seemed to try to be his friend.”\n\nAccording to a school district spokesperson, Bobby stopped attending Highland Park High School in 2016, after his freshman year. It’s unclear whether he went to another school after dropping out.\n\nA body is transported from the scene of a mass shooting during the July 4th holiday weekend in Highland Park, Ill. Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/AP\n\nIn recent years, Bobby revealed a louder side of himself online, posting music videos he apparently made – some of which featured ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence. Bobby, who made music under the moniker “Awake the Rapper,” uploaded his music on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website.\n\nIn one video titled “Are you Awake,” Bobby sports multicolored hair and face tattoos and declares, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.” The video shows a cartoon animation of a stick-figure man resembling Bobby in tactical gear, carrying out an attack with a rifle.\n\nIn another video, a similar stick-figure cartoon character resembling Bobby is depicted lying face down on the ground in a pool of his own blood, surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn. And in a third, Bobby is seen wearing a helmet and a tactical vest and dropping bullets onto the floor of a classroom.\n\nFinancial struggles took a toll\n\nAs Bobby was struggling in school, his father’s business was also having trouble staying afloat. Regular customers said that they noticed more of the shelves in the store going empty, and the hours it was open shrinking. In conversations with friends, Bob Crimo complained about a downturn in the business, increases in rent, and fees he said he had to pay the city.\n\nIn 2018, Crimo settled on a solution: running for mayor of Highland Park. People who knew him said they were puzzled about why he would embark on what seemed like a quixotic campaign against the popular incumbent, Nancy Rotering, who was Bobby’s former Cub Scout leader.\n\nIn a local news profile, Crimo talked about making the city more business-friendly, but he didn’t seem to actively campaign, and it’s unclear how seriously he took the race. State records show Crimo didn’t receive any campaign donations other than a $560 loan from himself, which he spent on yard signs. In the end, Rotering won 72% of the vote in the April 2019 election, soundly defeating Crimo.\n\nIn another blow, Crimo’s deli shuttered around the same time. Google Street View photos show that while the shop had a big “Bob Crimo for Mayor” poster hanging in the window in late 2018, by September 2019, the storefront was vacant and empty.\n\nAccording to court documents, the store was under a mountain of debt: A lender sued the deli and Crimo in late 2018, alleging he owed more than $764,000. A judge ruled in the lender’s favor by default in March 2019 after Crimo failed to appear in court. It’s unclear whether the debt was ever paid.\n\nGun permit granted despite ominous threats\n\nAround the same time, Bobby started showing more troubling behavior.\n\nIn April 2019, according to police reports released by Highland Park, officers performed a wellness check on the 18-year-old Bobby after receiving a report that he had “attempted to commit suicide by machete” a week prior. Mental health professionals handled the episode, officers wrote.\n\nThen in September of that year, police received the report that Bobby had “stated that he was going to kill everyone.” Bobby admitted that he was depressed and had a history of drug use, according to the report. His father turned over a collection of 16 knives, a dagger and a “Samurai type blade” to police, and officers sent the Illinois State Police a “clear and present danger” report related to the threats Bobby made. But the state police declined to approve that determination, which could have blocked Bobby from buying guns, because there wasn’t enough evidence to do so, the agency said this week.\n\nJust three months later, Crimo signed his son’s application for a Firearm Owners Identification card, a requirement to buy guns in Illinois. Under state law, young adults under 21 years of age need a parent or guardian to sponsor them in order to get the permit.\n\nCrimo told the New York Post that he sponsored the application so his son could shoot at a gun range. This week, an attorney for Bob Crimo – who no longer represents him – told the Chicago Tribune that Crimo was not aware of the incident that resulted in the confiscation of the knives when he signed the card. Yet, according to the state police, Crimo was actually the one who reclaimed the knives from officers. In the Post interview, Crimo downplayed Bobby’s threats in that incident as a “childish outburst.”\n\nAttorney George Gomez, who is representing both parents, told CNN that “the family denies that there was any issues of suicide at the time,” and stressed law enforcement found “no safety risk.”\n\nBobby went on to use the card to legally purchase multiple guns before he turned 21 last year, passing a total of four background checks, according to the state police. That included the semi-automatic rifle he used in the shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, the family’s finances appeared to unravel in recent years. HSBC Bank filed for foreclosure on their Highland Park house, where Bobby had grown up, in December 2019, alleging Crimo, Jr. owed more than $460,000. The case was delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the lender restarted efforts to take possession of the home last year.\n\nIn April 2022, a mortgage servicing company filed to foreclose on a second property Crimo owns in the neighboring town of Highwood. The company, NewRez LLC, alleged that he had failed to make payments since July 2020, and owed more than $197,000.\n\nIn the Highland Park case, a judge granted Crimo a full waiver of court fees in May after he appeared in person and provided proof that he was receiving food stamps, according to court documents.\n\nLast Thursday – four days before the shooting – Crimo filed a last-ditch motion to block foreclosure of the house, arguing the lender hadn’t given him sufficient notice of being in default or of accelerating the due date for the balance of the mortgage.\n\nPaul Crimo, Bob’s brother, who lives with him and worked at his delis, told CNN he didn’t think the financial stress affected Bobby.\n\n“My brother always made sure his kids always had a roof over (their) head at all times,” he wrote in a text message, adding that Crimo “is a great father.”\n\nCommunity looks to family for answers\n\nMourners embrace during a memorial for the victims of the July 4th parade shooting on July 5, 2022 in Highland Park, Ill. Taylor Glascock for CNN\n\nSome of the Highland Park residents who were at the parade when Bobby opened fire said they blamed the father for allowing his son to buy guns.\n\nThe elder Crimo “should be held liable for it and responsible for it,” declared Fred Kroll, a three-decade Highland Park resident who attended the parade with his wife and daughter and said he saw multiple people shot dead. “Whether it’s civil lawsuits by the survivors or he goes to jail … he should be punished.”\n\nState officials have poured cold water on the idea of Crimo facing criminal responsibility over the deaths. “There’s not a criminal liability that’s directly attached to vouching for someone else… and they end up doing something terrible like this,” said Eric Rinehart, the Lake County State’s Attorney.\n\nGomez said the family is “trying to cooperate with all local, state, and federal authorities at the moment.” When asked if he felt there was any criminal wrongdoing on part of his clients, particularly the father, Gomez said, “we take the position that my client, Crimo Jr., did nothing wrong in this case.”\n\nCrimo reportedly has said he wants “a long sentence” for his son, who faces seven counts of first-degree murder and a sentence of life in prison, if convicted. Illinois abolished capital punishment in 2011.\n\nStill, even Crimo’s friends say they doubt he’ll be able to stay in his hometown, or ever open a business here again.\n\n“His kid shot up his hometown, and he’s going to have to come to terms with that action and, honestly, the role he played in his son’s evolution as a person,” one friend said. “It was his son’s name on the news – and that’s his name, too.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Daniel A.

Her wounds were “very serious,” Wedding said at the time.\n\nNo law enforcement officers fired shots, according to Sheriff Rick Singleton of Lauderdale County, Alambama, where the pair – who are not related – fled on April 29.\n\nBefore the chase ensued, officers conducting surveillance spotted Vicky White exiting a hotel with a wig on, according to US Marshal Marty Keely. Then, she and Casey White got into a car and drove away.\n\nAuthorities continued to watch them until a vehicle pursuit began, ending when a US Marshals task force member drove a vehicle into the Cadillac the pair were in. The car wrecked and rolled over, he said. Casey White was driving the car, according to the US Marshals, though Wedding had earlier told reporters Vicky White was the driver.\n\nOfficers were able to remove the inmate from the wrecked car, but Vicky White was pinned inside with a gunshot wound to her head, Keely said.\n\nCasey White reportedly told officers to help “his wife” who had shot herself in the head, according to Keely, and told them he didn’t do it. Keely said to their knowledge Casey White and Vicky White are not married.\n\nThe scene at the end of the police chase in Evansville, Indiana. WFIE\n\nThe pair’s capture brought to a close an 11-day manhunt that gained widespread national attention and saw hundreds of tips flood in from all corners of the country, including one that ultimately lead to the location and arrest of the fugitives.\n\nThat tip came Sunday night, Singleton said.\n\nWedding said the duo were believed to have been in Evansville since May 3. “It’s hard to believe they’ve been here that many days, but we’re lucky that we stumbled upon them today,” he said.\n\nSingleton said Casey White, 38, will be brought back to Alabama. The inmate faces previous murder charges. Vicky White, 56, was first charged with permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree and was later facing additional forgery and identity theft charges.\n\n“He will be in a cell by himself,” Singleton said. “He will stay in handcuffs and shackles while he’s in that cell and if he wants to sue me for violating his civil rights, so be it. He’s not getting out of this jail again. I’ll assure you that.”\n\nSingleton said, “I’ve always expected this outcome. I knew we would catch them. It was just a matter of time.”\n\nMost escapes from a county jail are spontaneous, he said.\n\n“This escape was obviously well planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles, had everything they needed to pull this off, and that’s what made this last week and a half so challenging. We were starting from ground zero, and not only that, we started – they got a six-hour head start on us.”\n\nPhotos from Indiana car wash released\n\nEarlier Monday, US Marshals released photos of who they believe was Casey White caught on a surveillance camera at an Evansville car wash.\n\nIt was the first time since he escaped a Lauderdale County detention center with Vicky White that he was reported seen.\n\nVicky White was not seen in the photos.\n\nUS Marshals released photos of who they believe is fugitive Casey White at an Indiana car wash. US Marshals Service\n\nInvestigators were notified Sunday night that a 2006 Ford F-150 had been discovered at a car wash in Evansville, about 175 miles north of Williamson County, Tennessee, where the 2007 Ford Edge the pair had been traveling in was found abandoned.\n\nThe owner provided the images from a security camera, US Marshals said in a release.\n\nMarshals went to Indiana following up on the tip, the agency said.\n\nUS Marshals Service said it believes the person in the photo is Casey White. US Marshals Service\n\nA reward of up to $15,000 was offered for information leading to his capture, and $10,000 for information leading to Vicky White’s capture.\n\nVicky White was facing multiple charges\n\nBefore she died, Vicky White was facing new forgery and identity theft charges in Alabama, in addition to the charge of permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree that was filed last week.\n\nThe new charges were announced Monday and stemmed from the officer using an alias to purchase the vehicle used in the escape, a 2007 Ford Edge, officials said.\n\nVicky White, who was an assistant director of corrections for Lauderdale County, took Casey White from the county jail on April 29, saying she was taking him for a mental health evaluation, which authorities learned later had never been scheduled. She then said she was going to get medical care after dropping the inmate off because she wasn’t feeling well.\n\nVicky White’s use of aliases may have complicated the search, Singleton said Monday.\n\n“If she was using her own identity, that would make it fairly easy for us to maybe find her,” Singleton told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga. “We do know she used a false identification to purchase a car here locally.”.\n\nBefore Vicky White’s death, Singleton said he hoped she would survive her injuries.\n\n“We don’t wish any ill will on Vicky, but she has some answers to give us,” he said. “I have every bit of trust in (her). She had been an exemplary employee. I don’t know if we’ll ever know” what happened to change that.\n\nSurveillance video footage of Vicky White taken before the getaway showed the level of preparation that went into the escape, Singleton said.\n\nInvestigators found footage of White shopping for men’s clothes at a department store and at an “adult store,” Singleton said, adding she “obviously had a change of clothes” for the inmate.\n\n“It just tells us that it was very well planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “Obviously she well-planned this escape down to a T.”\n\nInvestigators earlier released video footage showing Vicky White at a Quality Inn in Florence, where she stayed the night before the escape more than a week ago.\n\nThe patrol car the officer and inmate took from the jail was found abandoned in a shopping center parking lot. Vicky White’s jail keys, radio and handcuffs were found inside. Authorities believe the pair left the lot in a different vehicle: Vicky White’s 2007 Ford SUV she parked in the lot the night before.\n\nThe vehicle was spotted on May 6 at a Tennessee tow lot. The car had been abandoned in the woods without any identifying information on the same day the duo escaped, indicating they drove about two hours north from the jail in Florence to Williamson County, Tennessee.\n\nAuthorities believe the vehicle may have had mechanical problems that prompted the abrupt stop in the area.\n\nVicky White and Casey White had known each other since at least 2020, the sheriff told CNN earlier this week.\n\nPrior to their disappearance, Vicky White had announced plans to retire and sold her home for a price well below market value.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Here's how Casey White's criminal history led him to Vicky White 02:32 - Source: CNN\n\nThe sheriff’s office had announced on May 4 that she was no longer employed by them, adding that while April 29 was her last day of work, her retirement papers were never finalized.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the wrong first name for US Marshal Marty Keely.", "authors": ["Theresa Waldrop Elizabeth Wolfe Jaide Timm-Garcia", "Theresa Waldrop", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Jaide Timm-Garcia"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/payton-gendron-buffalo-shooting-suspect-what-we-know/index.html", "title": "Payton Gendron: What we know about the Buffalo supermarket ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe 18-year-old man who allegedly shot and killed 10 people Saturday afternoon in Buffalo, New York, was motivated by hate, authorities said, targeting a supermarket in the heart of a predominantly Black community.\n\nEleven of the 13 people shot by the White suspect at the Tops Friendly Market were Black, officials said. Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism. We are continuing to do everything we can to assist law enforcement and the investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCNN asked the Discord spokesperson when the company became aware of Gendron’s posts and if any of the individuals who were invited to view his private server alerted moderators to the content but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nCNN also reached out to 4Chan asking about Gendron’s posts being shared on the platform but has not heard back.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nDocument talks about ‘dwindling size’ of White population\n\nInvestigators are sifting for clues in a 180-page document attributed to Gendron and posted online, Flynn said. The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said. Gendron remains on suicide watch, Garcia said, and in custody without bail.\n\nThere may be more charges coming, officials said.\n\n“My office is working closely with the US Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement into potential terrorism and hate crimes. This is an active investigation and additional charges may be filed,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron is set to return to court Thursday morning for a felony hearing, the release said.\n\nHe is likely the “most highly visible incarcerated individual” in the country, Garcia told CNN on Monday.

Don’t go out.”\n\nHe said emergency responders will go, and have gone, to homes without heat and take people to warming shelters. Too many people, including residents just going out to see the massive snowfall, are going out in their vehicles and getting stuck and blocking recovery efforts, he said.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted that 14 people in the county had died of exposure, three people were found in their vehicles, four had no heat, three were from “shoveling/(snow) blowing cardiac events, and three people passed away after EMS services were delayed.\n\nHe told CNN that unfortunately it appears the numbers will go up.\n\n“I am aware of additional bodies that have been recovered and are being brought to our temporary morgue,” he told The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. “We’ve had so many bodies that various hospitals are full and we’re just having to go through and determine if the individuals have died from a blizzard-related death.”\n\n“It’s just been a horrible, horrible situation,” he added.\n\nThe deadly storm comes just one month after the region was slammed with a historic snowstorm.\n\nAnd snow was continuing to fall Monday. At a morning news conference, Poloncarz noted officials expect between 8 and 12 more inches of snow to fall between Monday morning and 1 p.m. Tuesday. “This is not helpful as we’re trying to recover and clear off streets and get into areas that still have not” been plowed, he said.\n\nWhile driving bans have been lifted in some communities, one such order remains in place in Buffalo, Poloncarz said, describing the city is “impassable in most areas,” with abandoned vehicles scattered everywhere.\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles sent out to help have gotten stuck in the snow as rescue crews and hundreds of snowplow drivers fanned out on Christmas. Eleven abandoned ambulances were dug out Sunday, officials said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See houses frozen over by massive winter storm 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\n“We had to send specialized rescue crews to go get the rescuers,” Poloncarz told “CNN This Morning” Monday, adding it was the worst storm he could remember. “It was just horrendous, and it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\n“We’re used to snow here, we can handle snow,” he said. “But with the wind, the blinding views – it was complete whiteouts – and the extreme cold, it was some of the worst conditions that any of us have ever seen.”\n\nSnow covers downtown Buffalo, New York, on Monday, December 26, 2022, in this photo from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's Twitter page. Gov. Kathy Hochul/Twitter/AP\n\nThe storm has drawn widespread comparisons to Buffalo’s famous blizzard of 1977. Poloncarz said in Monday’s news conference the current storm’s “ferocity … was worse than the blizzard of ’77.” The death toll in that storm was 23 people, 22 of whom died in Erie County.\n\nAnd in a news conference Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called this storm the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history.” On Monday, she requested President Joe Biden issue federal emergency declarations for Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n“I spoke with @GovKathyHochul to get an update on the extreme winter weather hitting New York,” Biden tweeted. “We stand ready to make sure they have the resources they need to get through this. My heart is with those who lost loved ones this holiday weekend. You are in my and Jill’s prayers.”\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to help with rescue efforts in New York. State police had been involved in over 500 rescues by Sunday, including delivering a baby, Hochul said.\n\nWhile abandoned vehicles pepper the snow-covered roadways, conditions are also difficult inside homes.\n\nSome residents have remained in their homes for more than two days, some without power in the freezing cold, Hochul said Sunday – due not to a lack of resources, but the challenges utility companies face in terms of mobility and access. As of Sunday evening, however, 94.5% of Erie County residents and 87% of Buffalo residents have had their power restored, Hochul said.\n\nAs of Monday, fewer than 10,000 customers were without power, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in an afternoon news conference, adding temperatures in his own home dropped to 40 degrees. “We certainly understand the challenges that so many families are going through and the frustration that people are facing.”\n\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect in New York for Jefferson and Lewis counties until 1 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasts show an additional 8 to 16 inches of snow could fall, according to the National Weather Service. Erie County could see another 4 to 8 inches and is under a winter weather advisory.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Since the start of the storm, the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nElectricity was not the sole utility impacted: Jackson, Mississippi, issued a boil water notice Sunday after its water system lost pressure due to line breaks “likely caused by the weather,” officials said on Facebook. The city – which just two months ago overcame a separate lengthy water crisis – distributed water to residents throughout Christmas Day.\n\nThe storm also snarled travel in the US during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday and more than 3,100 canceled on Christmas.\n\nAbout 3,800 flights into or out of US airports have been canceled as of 7 p.m. ET Monday, according to tracking site FlightAware. The total includes more than 2,500 flights canceled by Southwest Airlines, according to FlightAware.\n\nSouthwest said in a statement: “With consecutive days of extreme winter weather across our network behind us, continuing challenges are impacting our Customers and Employees in a significant way that is unacceptable.\n\n“And our heartfelt apologies for this are just beginning.”\n\nAnother 7,000 US flights have been delayed, according to FlightAware.\n\nSeparately, the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, which closed Friday due to “hazardous weather conditions” and saw 43 inches of snow, is expected to remain closed until late Wednesday morning, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said on Twitter. The closure means the Buffalo Sabres’ NHL game at Columbus will be postponed because the team cannot fly to Ohio, Sabres officials said.\n\nSnow blankets a neighborhood, December 25, 2022, in Buffalo, New York.

Yet she delivered a sentence slightly above that range, noting the victims’ disturbing testimony and Maxwell’s “direct and repeated participation in a horrific scheme.”\n\n“Miss Maxwell is not punished in place of Epstein,” she said. “Miss Maxwell is being punished for the role that she played.”\n\nNathan also said Maxwell failed to accept responsibility for her role in the crimes or show remorse.\n\n“Today’s sentence will attempt to acknowledge the harm that Ms. Maxwell has caused,” Nathan said.\n\nThe 20-year sentence represents a pivotal moment in an international sex trafficking case that stretched over decades and exemplified the ways that the rich and powerful can avoid – or, at least, delay – consequences for their actions.\n\nMaxwell was also sentenced to five years of supervised release and a $750,000 fine, which her attorney said she is unable to pay. The judge said she will be sent to a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.\n\nEpstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges, was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 but died by suicide in prison a month later. Maxwell has been detained since her arrest in July 2020, and prosecutors said she received credit for two years of time served.\n\nUS Attorney Damian Williams praised the sentence and thanked the victims for testifying.\n\n“Today’s sentence holds Ghislaine Maxwell accountable for perpetrating heinous crimes against children,” he said. “This sentence sends a strong message that no one is above the law and it is never too late for justice.”\n\nHowever, defense attorney Bobbi Sternheim said Maxwell planned to appeal the conviction and, as she did during the trial, pushed the blame onto Epstein.\n\n“We all know that the person who should have been sentenced today escaped accountability, avoided his victims, avoided absorbing their pain and receiving the punishment he truly deserved,” Sternheim said. “Jeffrey Epstein left Ghislaine Maxwell holding the whole bag.”\n\nVictim impact statements say Maxwell facilitated abuse\n\nPrior to the sentence, four women spoke in court to describe the long-lasting effects of Maxwell’s and Epstein’s abuse. The judge granted requests from eight women in all to give victim impact statements either in writing or in person at the sentencing.\n\nAnnie Farmer, one of the victims, asked the judge to consider the lasting effects of Maxwell’s behavior on her victims.\n\n“Judge Nathan, I hope when you consider the appropriate prison sentence for the role Maxwell played in this sex trafficking operation, you take into account the ongoing suffering of the many women she abused and exploited as we will continue to live with the memories of the ways she harmed us,” she wrote. “I hope you weigh the systemic effects of the crimes she perpetrated – the ways that our family members, romantic partners, and friends have been hurt through our suffering.”\n\nAnother victim, identified only as “Kate,” said Maxwell’s “final insult” was her lack of remorse after being found guilty. She said Maxwell was “a manipulative, cruel and merciless person” and could have stopped the abuse.\n\n“You could have put an end to the rapes, the molestations, the sickening manipulations that you arranged, witnessed and even took part in,” Kate said in court.\n\nSarah Ransome, another accuser who was not part of this trial, told the court about the ramifications the years of abuse had on her, saying she suffered from alcoholism and had twice attempted suicide.\n\n“I frequently experience flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares reliving the awful experience,” she said.\n\nAfterward, Farmer said she was happy with the 20-year sentence and said she didn’t believe Maxwell’s statement of apology.\n\n“Her statement felt like a very hollow apology to me,” she said. “She did not take responsibility for the crimes that she committed and it felt like, once more, her trying to do something to benefit her and not at all about the harm she had caused.”\n\nShe also said she appreciated the opportunity to speak in court.\n\n“It actually felt very powerful to finally have a chance to speak and have my voice on the record and say the things that I wanted to say about how her crimes impacted myself and the people that I know and care about,” Farmer said.\n\nWhat happened at the trial\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch: Court artist responds after Ghislaine Maxwell sketches her back 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nMaxwell’s monthlong trial last year alternated between disturbing testimony from sexual abuse victims and illuminating testimony about some of Epstein’s connections to high-profile celebrities.\n\nProsecutors argued Maxwell and Epstein conspired to set up a scheme to lure young girls into sexual relationships with Epstein from 1994 to 2004 in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands. Four women testified during the trial that Epstein abused them and that Maxwell facilitated the abuse and sometimes participated in it as well.\n\nHer defense, meanwhile, said she was a “scapegoat” for Epstein’s actions and attacked the memories and motivations of the women who say they were sexually abused.\n\nThe prosecution’s case rested primarily on the testimony of the four women.\n\nJane, testifying under a pseudonym, said Maxwell organized sexual massages with Epstein and sometimes joined in the abuse. The charges of enticing – on which Maxwell was acquitted – and transporting relate to testimony solely from her.\n\nCarolyn, who testified using only her first name, said that when she was 14, Maxwell touched her breasts, hips and buttocks and told her she “had a great body for Epstein and his friends.” The child sex trafficking count – the most serious of all the charges – relates to her testimony.\n\nKate testified Maxwell invited her over and directed her how to give Epstein a sexual massage. She said Maxwell spoke often of sexual topics with her and asked Kate to invite other young girls for Epstein’s sexual desires.\n\nFarmer, the only accuser to testify by her full name, said that she was 16 when Maxwell massaged her naked chest at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch in 1996.\n\nThough she was convicted of five charges, Maxwell was sentenced on only three counts after the judge agreed that two of the conspiracy counts she faced were repetitive.", "authors": ["Lauren Del Valle Mark Morales Sonia Moghe Eric Levenson", "Lauren Del Valle", "Mark Morales", "Sonia Moghe", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/28"}]}

A guide to understanding chemicals behind ...", "text": "PFAS is an acronym for a family of chemicals called per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances that are celebrated for their use in nonstick cookware and water resistant clothing but also feared for their potential toxicity, which has been linked to types of cancer and other harmful effects.\n\nThese chemicals are synthetic and do not appear naturally in the environment. They were originally discovered in 1938, when a chemist working on refrigerants accidentally created a slippery, white substance that would later lead to the creation of the Teflon brand of nonstick pots and pans.\n\nAs of February 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency counted about 12,000 different kinds of PFAS. The common characteristic of all PFAS is that they include a carbon-fluorine molecule bond, one of the strongest known in chemistry. Other molecules cannot break between the carbon-fluorine bond, and instead slide off of surfaces treated with PFAS.\n\nThat same characteristic can also make PFAS harmful, as the chemicals are virtually indestructible and do not fully degrade in the environment or within living tissue. For that reason, they're often referred to as “forever chemicals.”\n\nRED F:Is EPA putting interests of chemical companies ahead of your health? These experts think so\n\nWhich products contain PFAS?\n\nPFAS chemicals are perhaps best-known for their use in nonstick cookware. The Teflon brand revolutionized such products, but the use of PFAS is widespread across many nonstick cookware brands.\n\nPFAS are also often behind any product that boasts waterproof or stain-resistant properties. Such products include clothing, rainwear, furniture, outdoor equipment, tapes, and cosmetics. They are also frequently used in food packaging to minimize the leaking of grease.\n\nPFAS are also frequently used in electronics, medical equipment, and renewable technologies. The military has used them in foams to help douse fires, particularly those that involve oil and can be water-resistant.\n\nWhat are PFOA and PFOS?\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are perhaps the two most studied PFAS chemicals. PFOA was a product primarily used by DuPont in its product lines, while PFOS was primarily used by 3M.\n\nDue to concerns about their persistence in the environment and potential for toxicity, DuPont, 3M, and other manufacturers reached an agreement with the EPA in 2006 to phase out PFOA and PFOS in the U.S.\n\nThat resulted in the increased use of a new generation of PFAS, still used today in many common products. Concerns have also arisen over their safety, most notably the “GenX” PFAS chemical, which led to significant contamination in North Carolina.\n\nWhat do PFAS do to your body?\n\nResearch is ongoing about how PFAS move through the environment, how Americans are exposed, and what the chemicals may do to our health.\n\nHealth experts become particularly concerned with any persistent chemical that also displays two other characteristics: those that are bioaccumulative, meaning they build up in living tissue, and those that are toxic, which means they harm living organisms, like plants, animals, and humans.\n\nThe degree to which PFAS are bioaccumulative or toxic changes based on both the specific PFAS chemical considered, and the opinion of researchers.\n\nIt is increasingly well established that PFOA and PFOS in particular are likely both bioaccumulative and toxic. Federal testing shows that they are in the blood of more than 98% of Americans and stay in the body years after exposure.\n\nLarge and numerous studies of highly exposed populations have linked them to health effects including ulcerative colitis, diagnosed high cholesterol, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.\n\nResearchers are also concerned about exposure to PFOA and PFOS among the general U.S. population, with some studies showing that even typical blood levels could be measurably driving up rates of kidney cancer, weakening immune systems and possibly causing tens of thousands of low-birthweight babies each year.\n\nThe threat posed by the 12,000 types of PFAS as a class of chemicals is a point of contention. Advocates of the chemical industry often argue that each PFAS chemical should be judged separately, and that newer PFAS chemicals are less likely to be harmful due to their chemical structures.\n\nBut advocates for stricter regulation say studies suggest many have shared characteristics and risks. They say testing each PFAS chemical individually is not feasible because of how many exist, and that instead the chemicals should be regulated as a class as a precaution.\n\nWhat’s the solution to PFAS?\n\nBecause the commercial and technological benefits of PFAS are substantial, it would be difficult stop their use. The chemicals also are already widely spread in the environment, even in remote areas such as the Arctic.\n\nIn the U.S., the EPA has laid out plans to learn where PFAS are, how to clean them up, how toxic they are, and which regulations need to be implemented to protect the public.\n\nBut many environmental groups and scientists say that more should be done, up to a complete phaseout of PFAS, except for absolutely essential uses.\n\nA commonly held view among environmental groups is that PFAS should at least be regulated as a single class in drinking water and the environment, to simplify the process of evaluating toxicity and deciding when to filter water.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/02/16/what-is-chlormequat-chemical-pesticide-cheerios-quaker-oats/72627355007/", "title": "Study finds chlormequat in Cheerios and Quaker products: What to ...", "text": "Four out of five Americans likely have a lesser-known pesticide in their bodies thanks to the consumption of certain foods, according to a new study.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology on Thursday, the study found that 80% of tested Americans had the chemical chlormequat in their systems, a plant regulating agent that is currently not approved for use on edible crops in the U.S.\n\nImported foods treated with chlormequat are allowed to enter the country, however. According to a brief published alongside the study by the advocacy organization Environmental Working Group (EWG), the findings \"ring alarm bells,\" as the chemical is thought to be harmful and was found in common oat and wheat-based products, including Cheerios and Quaker Oats.\n\nHere's what to know about the findings.\n\nWhat is chlormequat?\n\nChlormequat chloride is a pesticide used as a plant growth regulator. The agricultural chemical works by decreasing stem height. This prevents crops from bending over, which can make harvesting more difficult. It is most commonly used on wheat, oats and barley, per the EWG.\n\nChlormequat is not approved for use on edible plants in the U.S. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided in 2018 to allow the importation of foods treated with the chemical. It is approved for use on food crops, mostly grains, in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nWhat did the study say?\n\nListeria outbreak:Salad kit from Bristol Farms now included in listeria-related recalls as outbreak grows\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, found that chlormequat was detected in 77 of 96, or 80%, of Americans tested for chlormequat.\n\nResearchers used urine samples collected from three geographical regions between 2017 and 2023 to test for the presence and concentration of chlormequat in the bodies of the participants. The study found not only that 4 out of 5 Americans have the pesticide in their system, but that the concentration has increased compared to prior years.\n\nThe study also found the chemical in 92% of oat-based foods purchased and tested in May 2023, including Quaker Oats and Cheerios.\n\nWhat products were found to contain chlormequat?\n\nResearchers found the presence of chlormequat in both traditional and organic oat and wheat-based foods.\n\nResearchers tested conventional oat-based products purchased in June and August 2022 and May 2023. Of both sets, chlormequat was detected in 92% of the tested products. Organic oat-based products had a lower detection rate of 12.5%.\n\nA sample of conventional wheat-based products tested in February 2023 also found that 22% had traces of chlormequat.\n\nThe study authors tested several individual items from a variety of brands for the presence of chlormequat. The chemical was found in several General Mills products, including Cheerios; Quakers Food products including oatmeal, granola bars and Old Fashioned Oats; and some generic store-brand granola and cereals, including Walmart and Target.\n\nMollie Wulff, a spokesperson for General Mills, told USA TODAY in a statement: \"All our products adhere to all regulatory requirements. Food safety is always our top priority at General Mills, and we take care to ensure our food is prepared and packaged in the safest way possible.\"\n\nPepsiCo, which owns Quaker Foods, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nWhat are the effects of chlormequat?\n\nScientists don't know the exact impact of chlormequat on the human body, as testing has been focused on animals thus far.\n\nSome prior studies have found that chlormequat is linked to infertility, disrupted fetal growth, delayed puberty and disruptions to the metabolic system. However, these studies were performed on mice and rats and have not been conducted on or translated to humans.\n\nEWG said that studies on the pesticide are ongoing but argued, \"Although these studies focus only on the chemical’s potential effects on animals, they raise questions about whether it could also harm humans. \"\n\nThe EWG also noted a 2023 proposal by the EPA to allow the use of chlormequat on barley, oat, triticale and wheat grown in the U.S. for the first time following chlormequat manufacturer Taminco's application to do so in 2019.

The EPA said Seresto is a “key part” but not all of the reason for the proposal.\n\nTransferring regulation to FDA is a “potential long-term solution,” said Jake Li, EPA’s deputy assistant administrator for pesticide programs, in an interview with Investigate Midwest.\n\n“We can't play this whack-a-mole game where every time a Seresto-like incident comes up, we have to divert our staff to it,” Li said.\n\nInvestigation:Popular flea collar linked to almost 1,700 pet deaths. The EPA has issued no warning.\n\nThe EPA has been conducting a formal review of Seresto for nearly two years and expects to finalize the updated science assessment “in the next few months, Li said, adding that the FDA helped with the assessment, both by lending staff and a framework to evaluate post-market incident data.\n\nThe work on Seresto illustrated the flaws with EPA’s process, Li said.\n\n“In our ongoing review of Seresto incidents what really became evident to us is that, compared to FDA, we at EPA have far fewer resources, which means staff, expertise, infrastructure and funding, to evaluate animal safety and carry out the ongoing monitoring of products in the marketplace,” Li said.\n\nLi said the EPA’s pesticide office has only two veterinarians on staff, and both were pulled from their regular duties to work on a review of Seresto “almost full time,” which slowed down their other jobs.\n\nThe Seresto review “has poached so much time out of people who are not assigned to any of this work that we believe there needs to be a much better solution for the long term,” Li said.\n\nThe agencies said in a joint whitepaper that FDA would need “significant new resources” to take over the management of the 600 topical products currently regulated by the EPA; however, the agencies said building a comparable program at EPA also would require even more resources and would be redundant with the FDA’s system.\n\nFDA spokeswoman Veronika Pfaeffle said in an emailed statement that the current set-up doesn’t accommodate scientific advancement.\n\n“A modernized approach that better aligns with each agency’s expertise will better protect animal health and safety and improve clarity for pet owners,” Pfaeffle said in the email.\n\n‘FDA should be the one-stop-shop’\n\nUnder the current setup, the EPA is responsible for regulating pet pesticide products that are “not systemic,” or aren’t supposed to enter the bloodstream, while the FDA regulates “systemic” pet pesticide products, which are generally consumed by pets.\n\nHowever, the agencies said in the recent whitepaper that scientists now understand that many topical flea and tick treatments, including spot-on treatments and collars, actually do enter a pet’s bloodstream, raising questions about the EPA’s product approval process.\n\n“Both agencies agree that FDA should be the one-stop-shop for animal drugs, for these external parasite treatments and so forth,” Li said.\n\nThe EPA and FDA are holding a joint virtual public meeting, titled “Modernizing the Approach to the EPA and FDA Oversight of Certain Products,” on March 22 at 1 p.m. EDT to discuss the changes. People can register for the meeting here. The proposal is also open for a 60-day public comment period until April 24.\n\n“Moving this forward is a good thing, but it will take years to do. This is the beginning of a very, very long process,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director of the Center for Biological Diversity, which petitioned to ban Seresto.\n\nDonley expressed concern the EPA is allowing harm to continue by failing to take action on products like Seresto.\n\n“It doesn't let the EPA off the hook,” Donley said. “They’ve got to do things now that are in their authority.”\n\nSeresto is just one product connected to major concerns about pet and human safety. In October 2022, the EPA announced it would ban flea and tick collars containing the chemical tetrachlorvinphos, which has been linked to neurological damage in children.\n\nEPA staff have also raised concerns in internal documents about pet products that contain fipronil, a chemical used in popular spot-on treatment Frontline Plus, which has been the subject of more than 5,000 human health incident reports, according to an Investigate Midwest review of incident data.\n\nReview in the works for ‘years’\n\nEPA staff sounded alarms about the safety of Seresto as early as 2015. But the agency did not launch a formal review until after the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition asking the agency to cancel Seresto, following Investigate Midwest's and USA TODAY’s reporting.\n\nLast summer, a congressional subcommittee called on the EPA to cancel Seresto’s registration, noting that Canada had rejected the collar based on the EPA’s own incident data – and the EPA found an even greater link between pet death and the collar than Canadian regulators did.\n\nMore:Congressional subcommittee seeks voluntarily recall of Seresto flea and tick collar\n\nFor years, EPA and officials from Bayer and Elanco, which purchased the animal health division of Bayer – including Seresto – in 2020, met to discuss the agency’s issues with the product. In those meetings, company officials blamed other factors, including the high number of Seresto collars sold.\n\nElanco maintains the collar is safe based on internal studies. A company-funded analysis found that the two chemicals in Seresto – imidacloprid and flumethrin – have not been responsible for any pet deaths.\n\nEPA scientists did multiple comparisons over the years between Seresto and other products that indicated Seresto had a higher number of pet deaths than other products, documents show. Those scientists often emailed that information, until a superior told two scientists to keep their concerns off email.\n\nYet the EPA did not make the public aware of any risks. The EPA’s inspector general has launched a review into the agency’s handling of incident reports associated with the product.\n\nLi said the proposal to transfer pet-pesticide product regulation to the FDA was in the works since before the public outcry over Seresto.\n\n“Seresto is a key part of that, but it's not the only part,” Li said. “It predates Seresto by three to four years. It's really driven by the discussion between our career staff and the FDA’s career staff.”\n\nIn a March 2021 presentation made in response to the Investigate Midwest/USA TODAY story about Seresto, EPA staff pointed out that compared to the FDA, the agency’s process is lacking. The presentation noted the EPA’s process relies on company-funded studies that use less sensitive pet breeds and small sample sizes. By comparison, the FDA has a much more comprehensive pet product regulation process, which includes pre-market clinical trials and post-market surveillance.\n\nThe EPA also has no process for evaluating pet incident reports or any trigger for when incident numbers need further review.\n\nDocuments show that EPA officials briefed Ed Messina, director of the Office of Pesticide Programs, which oversees all pesticides, on the FDA/EPA issues in March 2021, shortly after the Investigate Midwest/USA TODAY story was published.\n\nIn response, Messina attempted to reach out to the FDA, but FDA staff members declined to give Messina the email for Dr. Steven Solomon, director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine.\n\n“FDA counterparts don’t seem to want to give us his contact information. We don’t know what to do, it’s a very odd situation,” wrote Meredith Laws, an EPA employee.\n\nCongressional action necessary to move forward\n\nThe proposal is taking “two separate but parallel tracks” – one for public input and one briefing Congress, Li said.\n\n“In the end, Congress is the one who will decide whether and how to move this forward,” Li said. “We can only describe the challenges and what we're seeking directionally in terms of solutions.”\n\nLi said the agencies are still briefing congressional committees on the proposal and aren’t yet finished.\n\nPfaeffle, the FDA spokeswoman, said in her emailed statement that the agencies are working with Congress on potential solutions.\n\n“We are asking for Congress’ help to work toward a modernized approach to product oversight that increases transparency and government efficiency, aligns with each agency’s expertise and provides regulatory certainty – to stakeholders, including animal owners, industry, veterinarians and others,” the statement said.\n\nLi said the agencies have already met with industry and environmental groups to get feedback.\n\n“We're in the very early stages of socializing this proposal,” Li said. “We decided, let’s get this out there early and start to get some high-level feedback from folks, then adjust it and see what people say.”\n\nInvestigate Midwest (previously The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting) is an independent, nonprofit newsroom focused on exposing dangerous and costly practices of influential agricultural corporations and institutions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2021/11/08/seresto-flea-and-tick-collar-should-not-banned-company-tells-epa/6201046001/", "title": "Seresto flea-and-tick collar should not be banned, company tells EPA", "text": "Johnathan Hettinger\n\nMidwest Center for Investigative Reporting\n\nThe company behind the popular Seresto flea-and-tick collar filed a lengthy defense of the safety of its product amid calls for federal regulators to ban it over concerns of harm and death to the pets who wear it.\n\nIn a public comment to the Environmental Protection Agency filed last month, Elanco said its collar is safe despite reports of more than 86,000 adverse incidents, including 2,340 pet deaths, since it hit the market nine years ago.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/agriculture/2024/05/31/will-corteva-agriscience-benefit-judge-ordered-epa-to-revoke-bayer-other-herbicides-dicamba/73899212007/", "title": "Will Corteva benefit from EPA ban of Bayer, others' dicamba products?", "text": "Could a federal court decision blocking Bayer AG and two other companies from selling their dicamba herbicide boost sales for products from Corteva Agriscience, with its research facility in Johnston?\n\nSome experts say it will.\n\nHere’s what to know about the controversy surrounding the dicamba.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/12/14/epa-begins-process-to-potentially-ban-vinyl-chloride-used-in-pvc/71923363007/", "title": "EPA begins process to potentially ban vinyl chloride, used in PVC", "text": "The U.S. Environmental Agency Thursday took the first step toward potentially restricting or banning the use of five toxic chemicals used to make plastics, adhesives and paints.\n\nAmong them is a key ingredient in PVC plastic – vinyl chloride – a common material for water and sewer pipes, medical equipment and toys.

Almost 50 years later, the EPA has announced that it has put this highly toxic chemical on a list to be evaluated for future restrictions or an outright ban.”\n\nThe EPA’s announcement on vinyl chloride and the other four chemicals – acetaldehyde, acrylonitrile, benzenamine, and MBOCA – kicks off a yearlong process during which the agency plans to prioritize them for a risk evaluation under its Toxic Substances Control Act.\n\nThe risk evaluation itself would come only if the agency designates the chemicals as “high priority substances.” After that would come a years-long review process, which could lead to restrictions or outright bans of the chemicals.\n\n“Under the Biden-Harris Administration, EPA has made significant progress implementing the 2016 amendments to strengthen our nation’s chemical safety laws after years of mismanagement and delay.

Seresto has been the subject of more adverse incident reports than any other product in EPA history, according to EPA documents, yet the agency has not taken any action to inform the public of risks associated with the pesticide-based collar. The petition outlines how the EPA’s registration decisions regarding the pesticides failed to protect pets and humans.\n\n“Every day this is on the market, someone else might get poisoned,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health program director for the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which under federal law must decide whether the use of pesticides causes unreasonable adverse effects, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the petition.\n\nBurd said petitions have been filed over controversial pesticides in the past, including chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to brain damage in children, and tetrachlorvinphos, another pesticide often used in pet collars. The National Resource Defence Council originally petitioned to ban it in 2009. Neither pesticide has been banned, despite years of legal action.\n\nBurd said the agency frequently ignores petitions, but organizations have a six-year statute of limitations to sue the agency to get them to respond.\n\nThe Biden administration has pledged to follow science in its decision-making and has raised concerns about Trump administration decisions that valued politics over science.\n\n“If this administration wants to show it’s different, this is the chance,” Burd said.\n\nElanco Animal Health spokeswoman Keri McGrath said in a statement that the company stands by the safety of Seresto collars, and there is no medical or scientific basis to cancel the registration of the collar.\n\nThe company is “disappointed this is causing confusion and unfounded fear for pet owners trying to protect their pets from fleas and ticks,” she said.\n\nMcGrath said more than 80 countries have rigorously reviewed and approved the product, and that incident report numbers are “raw data” that cannot be used to draw conclusions on what caused adverse incident reports.\n\n“Thorough investigation of available data has shown no established link between exposure to the active ingredients in Seresto and pet deaths,” she said.\n\nElanco Animal Health, a former subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Co., did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Elanco purchased German pharmaceutical giant Bayer’s animal health division in 2019 for $7.6 billion. In its 2019 annual report, German agribusiness and pharmaceutical company Bayer reported revenue of more than $300 million on Seresto alone. In previous interviews, Elanco has said that it has reviewed the 1,698 incident reports related to pet deaths and found no link between the collars and the deaths.\n\nPesticide approval problems\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of regulating products containing pesticides, and conducts registration review of chemicals every 15 years.\n\nSeresto collars, which are supposed to work for eight months by frequently expelling a pesticide onto a pet’s fur, contain two active ingredients: flumethrin and imidacloprid.\n\nImidacloprid is a member of the neonicotinoid class of insecticides, which are the most widely used in agriculture. Much of the registration focused on agricultural uses, though imidacloprid is frequently used in pet flea and tick treatments. Imidacloprid and most neonicotinoids are banned in the European Union because of their links to massive die-offs of non-target insects such as bees.\n\nFlumethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide that is only used in one product: Seresto.\n\nBoth pesticides are in the final stages of re-approval. Many of the studies the EPA approval is based on are conducted by the company that sells the product.\n\nThe petition argues that the EPA underestimated the danger of the collar in its approval of both pesticides.\n\nFor example:\n\n► Epidemiological studies of both pesticides found that when pregnant women are exposed to the chemicals, their children have an elevated risk of autism spectrum disorder.\n\n► Despite a Bayer study emphasizing the two chemicals “synergy,” or the toxic effects caused by the mixing of the pesticides, the agency only looked at each chemical individually when approving Seresto.\n\n► In a 2017 risk assessment for imidacloprid, the agency relied on toxicity studies on rats to determine that the chemical is safe for dogs, despite studies showing that dogs are more sensitive than rats at one-seventh the dose.\n\n► In a 2017 risk assessment, the EPA determined that children exposed to imidacloprid in pet collars could be at risk. However, after the assessment, Bayer Animal Health submitted two new studies that lowered the likelihood that children would be exposed. One of these studies was conducted on rats using an agricultural seed treatment, rather than a pet collar.\n\nThe petition also includes copies of a handful of complaints filed by pet owners and veterinarians about Seresto with the National Pesticide Information Center and Food and Drug Administration.\n\nCompany says incident rates are low\n\nUnder federal pesticide laws, companies must submit incident reports associated with products to the EPA. Often, the company receives the complaint via customer service and then later forwards the complaint numbers to the EPA.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity argues that this leads to an underreporting of incidents, but Elanco and associated veterinarians argue it could inflate the number of adverse incident reports because the reports show correlation, not causation.\n\nIn a recent interview, Renee Schmid, a senior veterinary toxicologist at the Pet Poison Helpline and SafetyCall International, said she is “very comfortable with the safety profile with both of these ingredients.”\n\nSchmid said the Pet Poison Helpline has received 400 calls about Seresto in the past five years and about 9 out of 10 involve a pet ingesting the collar. Most of those pets were vomiting or had diarrhea.\n\nElanco recommended that the Midwest Center and USA TODAY speak with Schmid. Elanco frequently hires SafetyCall International to assess the safety of Seresto, as well as other products.\n\nSchmid said one of her colleagues did a review of incidents related to Seresto and found that it was unlikely Seresto caused the 1,698 deaths.\n\n“We feel the likelihood of a true fatality being due to the ingredients in a Seresto collar would be very, very low,” Schmid said.\n\nWith more than 25 million collars sold, the overall incident review rate is also low, Schmid said. In a press release, Elanco said it has an incident rate of 0.3%, meaning one-in-300 dogs has a reported issue. Most of those are hair loss, the company has said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/04/18/new-report-warns-against-using-pvc-pipes-drinking-water-systems/11688737002/", "title": "New report warns about human health risks from PVC pipes used in ...", "text": "A report from a coalition of U.S. environmental advocacy groups has warned of the health risks of PVC plastic and urged public officials against using the material in community drinking water pipes.\n\nPVC is made with vinyl chloride, the same hazardous material released in the fiery train derailment that triggered a public health and environmental crisis in East Palestine, Ohio. It's also a known carcinogen and endocrine disruptor.\n\nYet, because of its relatively low cost, PVC – polyvinyl chloride – has become a popular option for communities replacing old drinking water pipes and, in particular, the lead pipes and service lines that carry their own public health risks. In 2021, the Biden administration allocated $15 billion through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for communities coast to coast to replace lead service lines.\n\nThe report's contributors criticized the EPA for issuing no guidance on which piping materials should be used for such projects.\n\n\"In the months and years ahead, this new federal money will be flowing to state and local governments, and it's unfortunate the EPA is not providing any guidance on what is a safe substitute for lead service line pipes,\" said Judith Enck, a former regional EPA administrator and the president of Beyond Plastics, a nonprofit environmental group based at Bennington College, Vermont.\n\nBeyond Plastics released the report Tuesday along with two other nonprofit environmental advocacy groups: Environmental Health Sciences and the Plastic Pollution Coalition.\n\nEPA spokeswoman Dominique Joseph did not respond directly to the criticism but confirmed the agency has no requirements for plumbing materials except that they be lead free. She said that the EPA \"supports independent, third-party testing standards for plumbing materials under NSF/ANSI 61, which has been incorporated into many state and local plumbing codes.\n\nThe NSF stands for the National Sanitation Foundation, and ANSI stands for the American National Standards Institute.\n\nEnck said the report raises legitimate concerns about the health consequences from chemicals in PVC pipes leaching into the drinking water. Instead of PVC or CPVC – chlorinated polyvinyl chloride – Enck said, communities should use safer alternatives like stainless steel or copper even if those materials cost more.\n\n\"When people say that plastics is cheap, they are dead wrong,\" Enck said at a virtual news conference Tuesday. \"The price is paid widely and for decades through health care costs and tax dollars.\"\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the use of vinyl chloride in aerosols in 1974, but the chemical is still used in other products and remains a key component in PVC pipes.\n\nThe global PVC pipe market is on the rise, fueled in part by the increasing demand for PVC pipes in water, sewage and irrigation projects, according to several industry trend reports.\n\nPVC was cited as the preferred material for water infrastructure projects in a 2021 survey of more than 200 contractors, engineer and municipal officials by the Accountability Information Management, a marketing research company. Respondents said they anticipate using PVC pipes in nearly 65% of all water projects.\n\nBut not all communities are turning to PVC.\n\nFor its lead service line replacement project, the city of Troy, New York, opted instead for copper, said Troy's deputy director of public information, Frank Sainato.\n\n\"We only use copper, because copper is tried and true,\" he said. \"It may cost more, but public safety is always worth the extra expense.\"\n\nSainato said the city expects to break ground this year.\n\nRochester, New York, just three hours to the west, also avoided PVC for its lead service line replacement program, said public information director Barbara Pierce.\n\n“The City of Rochester does not use PVC or CPVC for water service material, instead it uses copper and cross-linked polyethylene pipe, which does not contain polyvinyl chloride or vinyl chloride,” Pierce said in an email to USA TODAY.\n\n“All water service pipe the City uses – along with all other materials used in the water system – is certified for use in potable water systems by the National Sanitation Foundation, AWWA, and approved for use by both USEPA and NYSDOH.”\n\nA woman who answered the phone at Uni-Bell PVC Pipe Association – a national nonprofit organization that touts itself as “the authoritative source of information on PVC water, sewer, and reclaimed water pipe\" – said nobody there would want to comment on the report.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council did not specifically dispute the report but said that PVC has 35-45% \"less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to iron pipes, and PVC pipes used for delivering drinking water are certified by NSF International to conform to EPA safety regulations.\"\n\nIn addition to highlighting the health risks from PVC chemicals leaching into the water supply, the report noted the health and environmental consequences involved in the production of vinyl chloride used to make PVC.\n\nThe East Palestine train derailment is emblematic of that risk, said Mike Schade, a program director of the environmental health research and advocacy organization Toxic-Free Future, during the virtual press conference.\n\nSince the derailment Feb. 3, people living in and around East Palestine have reported numerous health symptoms including headaches, sore throats, eye irritation and coughing.\n\nSchade said people who live near facilities involved in the production of vinyl chloride face those risks and more. These communities, he said, are disproportionately low-income and minority.\n\n“It is deeply troubling that more than 10 billion pounds of vinyl chloride are produced in a year, and low-income communities and communities of color are bearing the brunt of these harmful exposures,” Schade said. “We all know that lead is toxic, but so is PVC pipe, which is known as the poison plastic. If EPA is truly committed to environmental justice, they would ban local and state governments from using PVC pipe to replace lead service lines.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2022/06/15/congress-epa-must-cancel-seresto-collar-over-link-pet-deaths/7581966001/", "title": "EPA should cancel popular Seresto collar over link to pet deaths ...", "text": "Johnathan Hettinger\n\nMidwest Center for Investigative Reporting\n\nOne of the most popular flea and tick collars in America poses “too great a risk to animals and humans” and should be removed from the market, a congressional subcommittee recommended in a report released Wednesday before its hearing titled “Seresto Flea and Tick Collars: Examining Why a Product Linked to More than 2,500 Pet Deaths Remains on the Market.”\n\nThe House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, part of the House Oversight Committee, the main investigative body in the U.S. House of Representatives, held the hearing Wednesday afternoon to probe the Environmental Protection Agency’s “failure to regulate the Seresto collar as well as Elanco’s refusal to take action to protect pets and their owners from the collar’s harm.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}]}

A consent decree signed last month by Drummond Co. Inc., a coal mining and processing company that dates back to 1935, and the Black Warrior Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court will require the company to remediate the long-shuttered Maxine Mine site near the town of Praco. The consent decree calls for elimination of the discharges of acid, sediment, and toxic, heavy metals, among other pollutants, that have been flowing into the Locust Fork for decades. “The rulings in this case and the consent decree itself are critical to protecting the Black Warrior River from harmful legacy impacts of coal mining, and set a precedent for polluters throughout the state,” said a news release from Barry Brock, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented Black Warrior Riverkeeper in this case. The consent decree requires Drummond to pay $2.65 million in court costs and $1 million for a supplemental environmental project to mitigate the effects of past pollution, plus set aside funds to operate treatment systems for at least 30 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has entered a contract with a former Dunleavy aide for up to $50,000 in part to advise the administration on what legal fights to pursue against the federal government. The contract with Strategic Synergies LLC was signed in April and released by Dunleavy’s office last week. Brett Huber is listed on the contract as the firm’s sole owner. The contract period is for April 25 through Oct. 24. Alaska has long had a contentious relationship with the federal government over lands and resource development and other issues. The state has a history of pushing back in areas where it thinks the federal government is overreaching. Huber was Dunleavy’s campaign manager in 2018 and an aide to Dunleavy following the Republican’s election. Huber went on the manage an unsuccessful campaign in 2020 against a voter initiative that ends party primaries and institutes ranked choice voting for general elections. He was brought back to the administration last year as a senior policy advisor for “statehood defense.” Huber left work in state government April 2, said Patty Sullivan, a Dunleavy spokesperson. She said the position Huber held within the administration “has not been filled, and existing staff cannot perform the unique work.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cities across metro Phoenix have partnered with the Salt River Project to figure out how best to increase water storage on the Verde River. In the long run, the partners want to offset the declining capacity of Horseshoe Reservoir by raising the height of the Bartlett Dam, which sits about 20 miles downstream, to store that amount of water and then some. The SRP and 20 partners are working with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on the effort. The partnership is kicking off a four-year study into the feasibility of modifying the Bartlett Dam. Congress authorized the study last year, after a two-year-long SRP and Reclamation appraisal study, the Arizona Capitol Times reports. Ron Klawitter, a senior principal at SRP, said accumulating sediment at Horseshoe Reservoir has led to the loss of more than 45,749 acre-feet of water storage, about one-third of the reservoir’s original capacity. An acre foot contains 325,851 gallons. Exploring how to address that loss, the feasibility study will look at the impacts of raising the height of the 287-foot Bartlett Dam by between 62 feet and 97 feet. If the dam were raised by 97 feet, that would increase its capacity to 628,000-acre feet from its current 178,186 acre-feet.\n\nArkansas\n\nHuntsville: Ronnie Hawkins, a brash rockabilly star from Arkansas who became a patron of the Canadian music scene after moving north and recruiting a handful of local musicians later known as The Band, has died. His wife, Wanda, confirmed to The Canadian Press that Hawkins died Sunday morning after an illness. He was 87. “He went peacefully, and he looked as handsome as ever,” she said by telephone. Born just two days after Elvis Presley, the Huntsville native known to friends as “The Hawk” (he also nicknamed himself “The King of Rockabilly” and “Mr. Dynamo”) was a hell-raiser with a big jaw and a stocky build. He had minor hits in the 1950s with “Mary Lou” and “Odessa” and ran a club in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where acts included such early rock stars as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty. Hawkins didn’t have the gifts of Presley or Perkins, but he did have ambition and an eye for talent. He first performed in Canada in the late ’50s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse. With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-’60s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves The Band.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans. Legislators advanced a bill last week to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes needed “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The California Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Rescuers have recovered the body of a second victim after a boat carrying 13 people capsized on a lake over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife rescue team located the body Tuesday morning in 107 feet of water at Lake Pueblo State Park after an all-night search, the state agency said in a statement. The 11 others on the boat survived. The Pueblo County coroner plans to release the victim’s identity after next of kin are notified. The eight children and three adults were on the large, flat boat near a picnic area at Lake Pueblo State Park when witnesses reported high winds apparently overturned the boat Sunday evening. The second victim, 38-year-old Jessica Prindle, of the community of Pueblo West, died at the scene, the coroner’s office said. The survivors were treated for hyperthermia at hospitals, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. Park manager Joe Stadterman said the accident “underscores the importance of being extremely careful around the water.” “If you are on or even near the water, we strongly urge you to wear a life jacket,” he said. Lake Pueblo is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases – known as “gifting” – could now carry a heavy price tag in the state. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year. Thousands of people have attended the events, often paying a fee to be admitted, and exchanged cannabis-related products for other items or received them along with the purchase of an item such as a T-shirt. The Connecticut Post reports cannabis advocates say the bill penalizes people for doing something that’s now legal in the state. The legislation’s supporters say it still allows friends and family to gift cannabis as long as no money is exchanged.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The opening trial day in the criminal corruption case against the state auditor came to an abrupt halt Tuesday when the judge decided to give attorneys more time to consider issues raised by defense arguments that the indictment against Auditor Kathy McGuiness is defective. Judge William Carpenter Jr. ordered a halt to the proceedings after expressing concern about arguments made by defense attorney Steve Wood and the prosecution’s response to those arguments. Wood argued in a Wilmington courtroom that the indictment should be dismissed because it fails to allege where McGuiness’ supposed crimes occurred. Wood said venue regarding where an alleged offense occurred is among essential elements required by Delaware law in an indictment. McGuiness lives in Sussex County, and her office is in the capital, Dover, in Kent County, but prosecutors brought the case in New Castle County. “Nothing happened here,” said Wood, who rejected prosecution arguments that jurisdiction in New Castle County – or any county for that matter – is appropriate because McGuiness is a statewide elected official. Deputy Attorney General Maria Knoll argued the indictment is sufficient for trial because McGuiness serves all three counties, and her alleged crimes affected all three counties. The judge appeared skeptical of that argument.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With signs in hand after traveling from afar, thousands of people made their way to see D.C.’s annual Memorial Day parade Monday afternoon – the first parade held since the pandemic began, WUSA-TV reports. Some families traveled from across the country to be in the city for the parade’s return and to pay a visit to monuments around town. Area bands were in full gear in the sweltering heat to honor the men and women who died in service to their country. Rick Johnson, a retired Marine who served for 22 years, said he hopes those who came out take time to understand the true meaning of the day. “We as Americans need to truly understand what being free is and what the American flag truly represents,” he said. A Virginia woman, who asked to only go by Marlene, said though she’s lived in Arlington for 20 years, this is the first time she was able to give her thanks in person and honor those who are no longer here. As the bands played familiar tunes, and veterans passed by, Chris Stockwell, an Army veteran, said he is thankful for those who chose America and choose it every day. “Not everybody goes out there and serves, but those that do, we need to show support for those people,” Stockwell said. “They go out there and give their all to this country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Detectives have arrested an 18-year-old man after receiving a tip that he threatened a mass shooting at a school in a social media post. Corey Anderson’s post showed him with a handgun, a rifle and a tactical-style vest along with a caption that said: “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. Anderson was arrested at his home near Tampa on Sunday and charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. “This type of threat is unacceptable. This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. The sheriff said his agency will “do everything within our power” to track down anyone who makes school threats. “Protecting our students is our greatest priority,” Chronister said in the release. “We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.” Deputies discovered that the weapons in the photo were airsoft guns, the news release said. Anderson was booked into jail and later released on bond, jail records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The district attorney of coastal Georgia’s largest county has become the latest prosecutor in the state to say she’ll generally stop prosecuting misdemeanor marijuana cases involving possession of less than an ounce of the drug. Like other prosecutors, police chiefs and sheriffs who have stopped marijuana enforcement, Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones cited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to test for small amounts of marijuana unless other felony charges are involved. “Without a verified test, the state cannot prove that the accused violated the law,” Jones said in a statement. She also cited Georgia’s 2019 law that made hemp farming illegal, saying it’s hard to tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. The change began immediately. Officials in other jurisdictions including the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties, as well as Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County, have made similar announcements since 2019. “Disposing of low-level petty offenses that do not threaten public safety and do not involve a victim allows the state to focus already-limited resources on the serious cases that do,” Jones said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The former head of the Hawaii National Guard has been chosen to be the city’s new police chief. The Honolulu Police Commission chose retired Army Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan from among four finalists. Logan takes over from interim Chief Rade Vanic. Logan retired from the military in December 2019. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Honolulu police officer for 20 years. The department is still recovering from the 2019 conviction of former chief Louis Kealoha after he used his law enforcement power to frame his then-wife’s uncle for stealing their mailbox. He’s serving a seven-year federal prison sentence. His wife, a former city prosecutor, is serving 13 years. Logan said he was “just as surprised as anyone” by the decision, and his goal was to motivate, inspire and mentor people in the department. “I have to make myself available to the public to get their insights and answer their questions and concerns and show that the department ... is going to help them in what they would like in their community,” he told reporters after his selection. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi congratulated Logan and said building back public trust and restoring morale within the department need to be top priorities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Just under a third of the state’s registered voters cast ballots in the May 17 primary election, nearly matching the percentage that voted in the 2018 primary. Including new election-day voter registrations, 32.4% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2022 primary, the Idaho Press reports. That compares to 32.6% of registered voters who participated in the 2018 primary. In both of those primaries, there were hotly contested races for governor. Gubernatorial races normally guide turnout numbers, said former longtime Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. “If you get a third, 33%, that’d be a great turnout. That’s a sad commentary on our process,” Ysursa said, “especially when the whole ballgame’s in the primary.” Idaho is a strongly Republican state, and so the primary election is generally a strong predictor of the general election outcomes. Voter turnout in the state’s primary has been stagnant or declining for years since peaking in 1972 with more than 58% of registered voters casting ballots. Turnout was high that year because it was the first time residents between the ages of 18 and 20 were allowed to vote. “That was a big deal,” said Andy Brunelle, a retired Forest Service employee who worked for the state and tracked voter turnout as an editor for the Idaho Blue Book for many years, starting in the late 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An attempted murder charge has been filed after an attack on the “Walking Man,” a 75-year-old homeless man who over years has become a recognized figure in downtown Chicago. Joseph Kromelis was badly burned while resting on Lower Wabash Avenue last Wednesday and might not survive, Assistant State’s Attorney Danny Hanichak said. A 27-year-old man charged with attempted murder and aggravated arson was denied bond during a court hearing Monday, the Chicago Tribune reports. “This defendant did not target someone he got in an argument with, someone who wronged him or someone that he even knew,” Hanichak said. “This defendant decided to target the most vulnerable person possible: a 75-year-old homeless man sleeping on the street.” The man told police he poured gasoline on blankets without knowing Kromelis was under them, the prosecutor said. Kromelis has been the subject of news stories and a documentary. He once told the Tribune he roams around downtown “as a way of life.” In 2016, Kromelis was attacked with a bat. A GoFundMe account raised more than $32,000, though it was unclear at the time if he wanted the money, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Dozens of St. Vincent Health and Ascension Health workers in the state who were suspended without pay for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are asking a federal court to open a class-action lawsuit. The 64 workers claim the hospital network discriminated against them because they objected to the vaccine on religious grounds. “Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will,” the lawsuit said. Ascension Health owns St. Vincent Health. In July 2021 Ascension Health announced a requirement that its associates had to get the COVID-19 vaccination by November. There are roughly 14,700 associates in Indiana. Ascension Health said in a July release that “tens of thousands” of its workers had already been inoculated. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve,” the release said. Like other hospital networks in Indiana, St. Vincent Health allowed workers to get an exemption for religious beliefs or medical conditions. But the 64 workers who filed the lawsuit Friday say St. Vincent Health and its parent company “failed to individually and properly assess each application for religious exemption.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An invasive earthworm native to east Asia that was discovered in Iowa in 2018 has now spread to at least 11 counties. Officials in Dubuque and Muscatine counties were the first to report finding jumping worms, which are also known as crazy worms or Alabama jumpers due to their vigorous writhing and wriggling when disturbed. The snake-like worms can grow up to 8 inches long and are found amid leaf litter and closer to the soil surface than other earthworms commonly seen in Iowa. A map released in April by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach showed that the worms have now been found in Polk and Story counties, as well as Buchanan, Clayton, Jefferson, Johnson, Linn, Scott and Winneshiek. The ISU Extension website notes: “We assume jumping worms are much more widely spread than reports indicate.” ISU Extension said the worms, which have been infiltrating U.S. soil since the late 1800s, likely arrived in North America in potted plants, nursery stock or soil. They’re typically 3 to 5 inches long but are known to grow up to 8 inches. Jumping worms are darker and smoother than earthworms commonly found in Iowa. Identifiable characteristics include a cloudy-white and smooth narrow band; that band is raised on other earthworms. They do not produce an exterior layer of slime.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The recent bulldozing of a camp for homeless people has advocates arguing that Topeka should adopt more liberal policies modeled after ones in Kansas City, Missouri. Social worker Russell Burton and other advocates hope to raise the issue at the Topeka City Council’s meeting June 7, The Kansas City Star reports. Burton wants the city to require outreach workers to visit before a camp is bulldozed and to remain until city workers leave, something Kansas City mandates under a policy adopted in mid-April. He also wants to require the city to store people’s personal items for 60 days, as Kansas City does, twice the time set by Topeka’s policies. Topeka on May 10 razed an encampment just north of the Kansas River where more than a dozen people were living. Ken Saffer, a 57-year-old resident of the encampment on and off since 2017, said his belongings were confiscated, including clothing, tools and a generator. Others scrambled to collect medication and important documents. Spokesperson Gretchen Spiker said the city provided more than the required 72 hours notice before clearing the camp and followed its policies regarding belongings. She said the city “went above and beyond” to protect individuals’ constitutional rights.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new park that will allow public access to the Kentucky River is planned in Fayette County. The city plans to purchase 30 acres on the river near the Interstate 75 bridge into Madison County, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said in a statement. The city has signed an agreement, but the Urban County Council still needs to approve it. “This will provide new opportunities for recreation in Lexington. It will be a beautiful new park. And those who love kayaks and canoes will have a place to get onto the river and travel 12 miles between locks,” Gordon said. The $1.16 million cost for the property will come from fees developers pay to the city for the purpose of acquiring land for parks, officials said. Outdoor recreation has grown significantly in the past two years, and the park will establish a new kind of regional tourism with other river counties, said Mary Quinn Ramer, who is president of Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State and local governments and educational institutions could not require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for entry into government facilities under legislation advanced by a state Senate committee Tuesday. The 4-2 vote sends the House-passed bill by Rep. Larry Bagley, R-Stonewall, to the full Senate. As it came out of the committee, the bill would subject any government or state-run educational institution to civil penalties if it requires COVID-19 vaccinations for entry. Backers say government entities shouldn’t be asking about a person’s health status. Opponents of the bill said they didn’t want local governments subjected to civil fines for trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The bill would not apply to government health care facilities that would risk losing federal funding under any federal requirements for vaccines. It passed the House last month on a 59-26 vote. If approved by the Senate, it would go back to the House for approval of Senate amendment. The deadline for final adjournment of the legislative session is Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nWaterville: The Maine Attorney General’s Office has ruled that the fatal shooting of a man by police last year was justified. Waterville police responded in February 2021 to reports of Eric Porter, 32, armed with a knife and threatening people outside a hotel. The attorney general’s office said Friday in a report about the shooting that police ordered Porter to drop the knife and surrender when he charged at an officer with the weapon. Another officer shot and killed Porter, the attorney general’s report said. The report said officers tried using PepperBall launchers at Porter to no effect, and an electroshock weapon also didn’t subdue Porter because of his thick winter coat. Attorney General Aaron Frey wrote in the report that the officer who shot and killed Porter believed his colleague “would have been seriously injured or killed had he not shot Mr. Porter.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Thanks to the preservation of an early 19th-century plat, residents can soon see for themselves how the town – founded by Jonathan Hager in the 1760s – began to blossom in the years after the American Revolution, the Herald-Mail reports. After nearly two years in the hands of an expert document conservator, the plat and other documents – including a rare copy of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s proclamation to Marylanders in the days preceding the Battle of Antietam – are finally home with the Washington County Historical Society. Plans are to keep the delicate originals stored and preserved but to display copies for everyone to see. “My best guess is the plat plan was generated in the early 1800s,” said society President Bill Maharay. “It descended through the Hager family; it’s on vellum, and it shows the development of Hagerstown through various growth patterns.” This plat shows where the town was expanding as it developed. “And it’s not done in an orderly fashion,” Maharay said. “What I find most interesting is the water source for the town was the stream that starts up over by where the post office is. It’s now all underground, but it shows that stream pattern. And then the area on North Potomac where it rises up past Franklin was called the ‘healthy’ part of town because of sanitation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Firefighters battling a huge fire in the grandstand of a Boston horse racing track were hampered by a limited water supply and had to use thousands of feet of hose, officials said. There were no reports of injuries in the fire at Suffolk Downs that was reported about 10 p.m. Monday. The fire was knocked down by about 2 a.m. Tuesday, but crews remained on site to put out hot spots, the Boston Fire Department said in a tweet. Suffolk Downs, which first opened in 1935, has not had live racing since July 2019, but the grandstand remained open for simulcasting. The fire was first seen in the old press box on the roof, according to a statement from HYM Investment Group, which is redeveloping the site, but the cause remains under investigation. Boston firefighters were aided by several other area departments. The 161-acre site partially in Revere is being redeveloped into a mix of housing, retail, hotel, office and lab space. “The fire did not impact the area of Suffolk Downs currently under construction and redevelopment of the site remains ongoing,” HYM said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Any summer plans for late-night scooting through downtown Detroit have been thwarted by a new curfew established by city officials. The curfew, first reported by Outlier Media, applies to rentable electric scooters in Detroit’s Central Business District, bordered by the John C. Lodge Freeway, Interstate 75, Interstate 375 and the Detroit River. In cooperation with scooter operators, scooters will be shut down in this area between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew was announced by the Detroit Police Department during a press conference addressing summer safety efforts, including increased patrolling in Greektown and drag racing restrictions. Electric scooters operating in Detroit include Lime, Bird, Spin, LINK scooters operated by Superpedestrian and Boaz Bikes. During the curfew and within the designated area, enforcement by the operators varies, but some scooters will operate at reduced speeds or allow riders to finish their already activated trips. The city has not determined when the summer curfew will end, Outlier reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council has approved $1.2 million in legal settlements with two people injured by police during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of officers two years ago. The settlements with St. Paul resident Virgil Lee Jackson Jr. and Nashville freelance photographer Linda Tirado mean the city has agreed to pay a total of $5.4 million to settle federal civil rights lawsuits over injuries caused by police in May 2020, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The City Council approved the two settlements Thursday. The council agreed to pay Jackson $645,000. His lawsuit said that a Minneapolis police officer repeatedly shocked him using a Taser’s “drive stun” mode, pressing the electrodes directly onto his skin. He was in a parking lot at the time. Tirado lost the sight in her left eye after an officer fired a rubber bullet while she covered protests outside a police station. The City Council agreed to pay her $600,000. Floyd, 46, who was Black, died after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 91/ 2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was sentenced to 221/ 2 years in prison for murder and manslaughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the state of using a discriminatory proof-of-citizenship requirement for some new voters under a law dating back to the Jim Crow era. The dismissal came weeks after Mississippi repealed a 1924 law that required naturalized citizens – but not people born in the U.S. – to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A new law enacted in its place has also drawn opposition but is being grudgingly accepted by voting rights groups who say it ultimately should protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote. The secretary of state had been running names of potential new voters through a state Department of Public Safety database of people with Mississippi driver’s licenses and identification cards. Voting rights advocates said this practice disproportionately hurt people of color by flagging them as possible noncitizens. The new law says that if the public safety database raises questions about citizenship, the potential new voter’s name must be run through a federal immigration database. Groups that advocate for voting rights and immigrants’ rights said the federal database provides a safeguard to protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal judge has ordered St. Louis County to pay $300,000 to two people who sued after police barged into their home six years ago with guns drawn and without a warrant. A final judgment in the case was entered Thursday against the county, ordering it to pay Jon Luer and Andrea Steinebach for damages stemming from the home intrusion, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said in a news release. The ACLU said Luer and Steinebach were awoken about 3 a.m. July 10, 2016, to find armed officers in their hallway searching for a suspect who had skipped out on cab fare. The two officers interrogated the couple’s teenage son and searched his room. The officers left after deciding he was not the suspect but did not file an incident report about their contact with the family, the ACLU said. “Our family is still haunted by the illegal middle-of-the-night invasion of our home by the very people that are supposed to protect us,” Steinebach said in a statement. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the family’s lawsuit could proceed, calling police actions in the case a “severe, warrantless intrusion.” A police spokeswoman referred questions to the St. Louis County Counselor’s Office, which did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s top schools administrator has been cited in the case of a vehicle illegally passing a stopped school bus last month. Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen was cited Thursday after speaking with an officer, Helena Police Lt. Jayson Zander said. According to a police report, a school bus driver said a truck driven by Arntzen passed his bus while it was stopped to pick up children just after 7:30 a.m. May 19 in a Helena subdivision. The bus driver recognized Arntzen and recorded the license plate number on the red pickup truck, the police report said. A video of the incident reportedly “does not show the license plate of the vehicle involved,” Arntzen’s office said in a statement Friday. “Superintendent Arntzen does not recall the alleged incident,” Brian O’Leary, spokesman for the Office of Public Instruction, said in a statement Thursday. “She does acknowledge she drives a red pickup and lives in the area.” Montana’s 2021 Legislature passed a bill to improve bus safety after a student in northwestern Montana was hit and critically injured by a driver who passed a stopped bus in November 2019. Arntzen testified during a February 2021 legislative committee hearing in support of the bill, which doubled the fine for illegally passing a school bus to a maximum of $1,000.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A large fire that raged through a chemical plant was extinguished by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents who were initially evacuated were allowed to return to their homes, authorities said. Thick smoke billowing from the Nox-Crete facility just southwest of downtown Omaha could be seen as far away Monday evening as the Elkhorn River, about 20 miles to the west. Battalion Chief Scott Fitzpatrick said the first call for help came shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, and firefighters who initially entered the building found a much bigger fire than they had anticipated, forcing them to retreat. Fire crews then fought the blaze from outside the building, noting the presence of chemicals and propane bottles inside. Explosions could be seen and heard as propane tanks ruptured. No injuries were reported from the fire or explosions. Officials said the smoke posed no major toxicity risks to the public. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. According to its website, Nox-Crete makes a chemical coating and deactivator that keeps curing concrete from bonding to forms. It also makes liquid floor hardeners, joint fillers, curing and sealing compounds, and water repellents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal Bureau of Land Management is collecting public comment until Wednesday on a big north-south electricity transmission project that Nevada’s main utility, NV Energy, says is a key to its plan for a statewide renewable energy network. The project, dubbed Greenlink West, would stretch about 350 miles to connect electricity facilities near Las Vegas in southern Nevada and Yerington in the north by the end of 2026. It would generally run parallel to and east of the California state line. Conservationists and protesters say they do not want to see that much public land disturbed, and members of a tribe adjacent to the route say the transmission lines would adversely affect culturally significant land. Barbara Durham, tribal historic preservation officer for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, told the Las Vegas Sun that disturbed areas could include former village sites and areas where tribal ancestors found food and traded objects. Timbisha Shoshone homelands are in Nevada’s Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda counties and California’s Inyo, Kern, San Bernardino and Mono counties. “We would prefer that they go through already existing areas that have been disturbed,” Durham said. “No matter which way they go, they’re going to find the same thing.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: Fireworks shows at a popular beach were canceled for Memorial Day weekend and put on hold for several weeks because endangered piping plovers are nesting there. Local officials hope they can still have fireworks on the Fourth of July at Hampton Beach, which is close to the Massachusetts border. Hampton Beach Village District Chairman Chuck Rage said two nests were found on the beach. Piping plovers are endangered in New Hampshire and threatened nationally. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Endangered Wildlife Program has been monitoring and protecting breeding piping plovers and their habitat on the seacoast since 1997. The sighting of endangered piping plovers prompted officials to cancel fireworks shows at the beginning of the summer season at Hampton Beach last year, too. The small birds nest in the sandy dunes at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. The number of nests is expected to reach a new record in the state this year, with 16 in total, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The fireworks shows will resume when the eggs hatch and the plovers abandon their nests on the beach, which could take about a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewton: Paddlers who want to camp overnight along the Delaware River within a national recreation area must now have a reservation and pay a fee. An increase in visitors to the area who choose to stay overnight has prompted the move. The 62 primitive river campsites within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area will cost $16 per site, per night. Starting in 2015, the park piloted a similar system for six of the sites known as Alosa. This new change brings all river campsites under that system. “Falling asleep and waking up at a primitive boat-in campsite along the banks of a nationally designated scenic and recreational river is a unique and special experience, particularly within one of the most densely populated areas of the country,” said Elizabeth Winslow, fee program manager. Because the Water Gap is part of the National Park Service, the recent announcement by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that entrance fees at state parks are being lifted this summer does not apply. The Water Gap does not charge an entrance fee but does have several areas, such as boat launches and beaches, which have user fees. Winslow said there are several concerns about the primitive sites, such as flooding, resource protection and operational issues, that have reduced the number of official river campsites in the past 20 years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As nearly 3,000 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Monday, federal forest officials worried about future flash floods, landslides and destructive ash from the burn scar. The nearly 8-week-old fire was surrounded by containment lines cut and scraped around half of of its perimeter, enclosing 493 square miles of forested mountains and foothills east of Santa Fe. A Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team has started publishing data from its post-fire assessments. Micah Kiesow, team leader and a soil and watershed program manager with the Santa Fe National Forest, said steep mountain slopes had acted like a sponge before the fire. “Post-fire in some of these areas, especially the high soil burn severity areas and the moderate, we’re looking at now a steep slope that’s more like a parking lot,” Kiesow told the Santa Fe New Mexican. He said that could signal an “extreme change in watershed response” during monsoon season. Flooding presents another problem for communities near burn scars with ash flowing into rivers and streams, according to Kiesow. Many water treatment facilities aren’t equipped for the expensive, time-intensive process of filtering ash. Experts say ash and debris can harm water quality with high levels of nitrates and phosphorus.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A black bear wandered into the city, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet off the ground Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net. The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile from the Capitol. The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones and single-family homes. Albany police tweeted out several pictures of bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap. Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city. Police closed off the street off for a few hours as the state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican legislation that supporters argue would give parents more say over their children’s public schooling and health – but that critics say would intimidate and harm LGBTQ youth – headed to the state Senate floor after another affirmative committee vote Tuesday. The “Parents’ Bill of Rights” legislation includes a provision that would prevent instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school curricula for kindergarten through third grade. Schools would have to notify parents about changes to their child’s health and services that they are receiving, such as psychological treatment, or before they could change a child’s name or pronouns in records. LGBTQ activists likened these provisions to those in a Florida law opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Several urged GOP lawmakers Tuesday to stop the measure, saying more young people would have their sexuality revealed against their will. Other youth will keep their sexuality hidden, increasing further the threat of suicide, opponents said. “This bill proposes forced outing of queer kids,” said the Rev. Vance Haywood, senior pastor of St. John’s Metropolitan Community Church in Raleigh. “It’s creating an environment where we’re telling folks that it’s not OK to be yourself. You have to hide parts of who you are.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The longest-serving member of the state Senate declined to comment Tuesday on whether he’s the subject of an ongoing investigation following a report that he’d traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg had previously announced plans to resign Wednesday, six months before the end of his term. “There is a time,” Holmberg told the Associated Press on Tuesday when asked about why he was abruptly ending his 46-year career. Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from Holmberg’s home in November. “The rain will stop one of these days, and things will go on,” he said, declining to elaborate. Homberg said he planned on attending a luncheon with some current and former lawmakers Tuesday. He plans on turning in his state-issued computer and legislative credentials that include access to the state Capitol on Wednesday. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four times, he chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio students would have to take a self-defense class to graduate from high school if a bill introduced Tuesday by two Republicans in the state House becomes law. “Young women between the ages of 16-19 are the most vulnerable to be sexually assaulted,” Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Township, said in a statement. “This training will also provide opportunity for development of relationships between students and their local law enforcement and school resource officers.” Called the Student Protection Act, House Bill 639 would require incoming freshmen in public and private schools to complete self-defense training as part of their health education starting in the 2023-2024 academic year. The instructors would have to be school resource officers or certified self-defense instructors. “Physical, emotional or sexual abuse and assault are never okay. These behaviors should never be tolerated or go unreported,” Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, said in a statement. “Reinforcing this message with our young people, while equipping them with defensive tactics and proactive strategies will help them protect themselves and avoid dangerous situations.” She added that self-defense training could also help students identify early signs and symptoms of mental health issues and potentially aggressive behavior in their peers. Young said the bill has been in the works for months, and the timing of its introduction soon after a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, was coincidental.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s cannabis regulator was busy last week working on final implementation of a “seed-to-sale” tracking system, the latest major update as it prepares to be reformed as a stand-alone agency this fall. The changes represent a watershed moment for the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority in its nearly four-year history. After launching in 2018, the agency struggled to keep up with the exploding industry that quickly boasted more dispensaries than any other state in the country and has been plagued with black market activity, while also supporting over 380,000 licensed cardholders who regularly purchase more than $64 million of medical cannabis products monthly. Now under the guidance of its fourth executive director, the agency continues to expand its personnel and oversight duties. Seed-to-sale, which went into effect Thursday, means every product sold to a consumer should theoretically be traceable back to its literal roots – a capability officials claim will create a safer and more legitimate industry. The marijuana authority’s independence from its current place in the state Health Department won’t happen until Nov. 1, but work is already happening to hire its own personnel to handle administrative positions, human resources and payroll.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: Officials in Clackamas County said Tuesday that they have finished duplicating the majority of primary election ballots that were rejected by vote-counting machines because of a printing error that resulted in blurred barcodes on tens of thousands of ballots. Elections officials were forced to transfer the voter’s intent from a spoiled ballot to a fresh one that could be read by the machines. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. Elections officials expect to finish tallying the vote by the end of the week and to certify all election results by June 13, the state’s deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: On Roosevelt Boulevard, where 10% to 13% of the city’s traffic fatalities happened each year prior to the pandemic, plans to redesign the city’s “corridor of death” – as some residents and safety advocates call Roosevelt – could be gaining traction. Studies show Black communities have been hit even harder by a national surge in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosevelt Boulevard is a chaotic, almost 14-mile maze that passes through some of the city’s most diverse neighborhoods and census tracts with the highest poverty rates. Driving can be dangerous, but biking or walking can be even worse, with some crosswalks longer than a football field and taking four light cycles to cross. “You would not design a street or a road like that today,” said Christopher Puchalsky, policy director for Philadelphia’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. “It feels like an expressway, but it’s in the middle and between neighborhoods.” The city is hoping for federal money to begin a long-term, billion-dollar redesign of Roosevelt outlined in a study released in 2019, as well as to fund a series of smaller projects to improve safety at high-fatality stretches on the road by 2025.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee, the Rhode Island State Police and the state Department of Education have asked every school district to complete a comprehensive survey of potential emergency hazards. The effort, announced at the State House on Tuesday, is aimed at identifying potential school safety issues and addressing any necessary repairs or upgrades. Through the School Building Authority, the Department of Education will approve up to $500,000 in emergency funds for each district to make additional security upgrades. They will be reimbursed once the work is completed. Approximately $25 million is available statewide. McKee said the country is still processing the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed by a lone gunman. Since then, he said, there have been 12 new mass shootings across the nation. “No one thing alone will end gun violence,” McKee said. Limiting high-capacity magazines and banning assault weapons will help reduce that risk, he said. “The safety of our children must be the highest priority,” the Democrat said. Every school superintendent will conduct walkthroughs of buildings, including reviews of doors and windows, car access, landscape features, lighting, alarm and camera systems, and communications systems.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hurricane season officially starting Wednesday, state emergency officials want residents to prepare. Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Hurricane Preparedness Week began Sunday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is emphasizing this year that people know their evacuation zone, how to prepare their home to ride out a storm and what highways they need to take to evacuate with the slogan “Know Your Zone, Prepare Your Home, Remember Your Route.” Preparing a home not only includes checking hurricane shutters and roofs but also making sure to have the right kind and right amount of insurance, the agency said. And it’s not just coastal homes that need preparation. Recent hurricanes to hit South Carolina have brought massive floods inland and can also bring tornadoes and high winds well away from the coast. Health officials said residents should also make sure their COVID-19 boosters and vaccinations are up to date and include masks and other disease-fighting items in their hurricane kits in case they need to evacuate to areas where there is high spread of disease. Four hurricanes have directly or indirectly impacted South Carolina in the past six years. Meteorologists are predicting an above-average number of hurricanes and tropical storms this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican candidates in state House races are raking in unprecedented amounts of campaign cash ahead of next week’s primary election. And a handful of ultra-competitive contests in the Sioux Falls area are driving that trend. A review of campaign finance reports filed this week by dozens of state House candidates in legislative primary races statewide found that dozens have brought in tens of thousands of dollars ahead of the June 7 election. And of the 10 candidates reporting the highest fundraising totals, more than half are seeking office in Sioux Falls or the surrounding area. Three of the top seven fundraisers come from a single contest that could tip the scales in an intra-party power struggled that’s pitted two factions of the state GOP against each other.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: After years of a stalemate, the Shelby County Commission is once again poised to consider funding new voting machines. County commissioners have in the past voted down a similar arrangement, voicing support for hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If approved, the agreement would spend $5.8 million on new machines from vendor Election Systems & Software LLC, known as ES&S, having the equipment fully operational by the August 2022 general election; $2.4 million of those funds would be reimbursable by the State of Tennessee. “We are at risk for the election that’s coming up in August, so that’s why we’re trying to move forward with having a process by which hopefully having this new equipment will achieve the outcome that it’s intended for,” said Shelby County Commission Chairman Willie Brooks Jr. Voters would then be able to choose at the polls between a paper ballot and an electronic ballot. The ballot marking machines will not allow voters to overvote and are accessible for voters with disabilities. The machine used to count votes can tabulate both printouts from the ballot marking machines and paper ballots that have been filled out by hand. It will also catch if someone has overvoted on a paper ballot, asking the voter if they want to move forward.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials are warning beachgoers to stay away from an overly friendly dolphin off North Padre Island. The marine mammal has gotten a bit pushy in the water off the island about 20 miles east of Corpus Christi, according to a press release from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Biologists report the animal is showing more aggressive behavior, separating children from their parents in the water, and isolating swimming pets from their owners,” the release said. The problem is that people have been feeding, swimming and playing with the dolphin for more than a year despite warnings from biologists, law enforcement and residents to stay away from it, according to the release. It said the dolphin “has become so used to humans that it now seeks out people, boats, and any form of interaction.” The mammal also has wounds caused by boats, and there are concerns about its safety, officials said. People are being asked to leave the dolphin alone. Boaters are asked to avoid stopping if the dolphin comes too close and to slowly move away. Swimmers are being asked to leave the water if they see the dolphin, the release said. “While the dolphin may seem friendly, this is a wild animal with unpredictable behavior,” according to NOAA.\n\nUtah\n\nMonument Valley: Federal officials signed an agreement with leaders of the Navajo Nation on Friday that provides funding for clean drinking water infrastructure for reservation residents and resolves questions about long-standing Navajo claims to water rights in the drought-stricken U.S. West. The signing formalizes the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement, which became law in 2020 as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. As part of the agreement, the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation $210 million for drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County – the part of the 27,000-square-mile reservation that lies in Utah. Many Navajo homes lack running water. Residents often fill containers at public taps or rely on water deliveries from volunteer organizations. Utah, which was also party to the agreement, will pay the Navajo $8 million as part of the settlement. “We had two real problems in our state. One was the Navajo Nation had claims to the Colorado (River) that would impair Utah’s water rights,” U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The other concern we had was about half the Navajo Nation residents (in Utah) didn’t have running water.” The settlement also quantifies the Navajo Nation’s water rights, quelling Utah’s anxieties.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to the city Sunday, after being canceled or shortened the past three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times, and they looped the half-marathon course twice. More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon, while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont, was first across the finish line, and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California, resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Authorities said two women were missing Tuesday after a group of people in rafts and on paddleboards went over the Bosher Dam on the James River a day earlier. WWBT-TV reports 12 people were involved in the accident Monday afternoon. WAVY-TV reports the dam has a 12-foot drop, and water levels have been high. Images of the search show the river seemingly placid above the dam but roiling below, with some of the group’s paddleboards and inflatable rafts caught in the currents below the rush of water. One of them managed to reach a nearby house for help. Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said kayakers in the area helped to rescue nine more. But Segal said two women were unaccounted for despite a very thorough search. Crews searched for the two women until dusk, and the search resumed Tuesday morning, Henrico County police said in a news release. Police said they have worked with friends and families of Lauren E. Winstead, 23, of Henrico County, and Sarah E. Erway, 28, of Chesterfield County, listing them as missing. Police warned that the river is at dangerous levels in some areas and that anyone entering the river should be extremely cautious.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A cougar attacked a 9-year-old girl who was playing hide-and-seek at a church camp, seriously wounding her and sending her friends running in fear. Lily A. Kryzhanivskyy and two other children were playing in the woods Saturday at the camp near the small town of Fruitland, northwest of Spokane. Lily jumped out to surprise her friends when the cougar attacked, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Adults rushed to help and found the girl covered in blood. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she had surgery for multiple wounds to her head and upper body. Lily was released from the intensive care unit Monday and remained hospitalized in stable condition, the department said Tuesday. Following the attack, adults staying at the church camp found the young male cougar and killed it. “We are extremely thankful for this little girl’s resiliency, and we’re impressed with her spunk in the face of this unfortunate encounter,” Fish and Wildlife Police Capt. Mike Sprecher said. “It happened fast, and we are thankful that the adults at the camp responded so quickly.” Tests completed over the weekend showed the animal did not have rabies, the agency said. Cougar attacks on humans are rare. There have been just two fatal attacks on humans in Washington state in the past 100 years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAlum Creek: Guided hikes, exhibits and interactive programming will greet guests during the weekend’s grand opening of the Claudia L. Workman Wildlife Education Center, officials said. The event Saturday is being hosted by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and the Forks of Coal State Natural Area Foundation. Those who attend the free event in Alum Creek can tour the 9,500-square-foot building, explore the 102-acre property and attend shows presented by the West Virginia Raptor Rehab Center, the Division of Natural Resources said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to having everyone come out and experience all that we have to offer, including ‘Touch a Snake’ and ‘Bird ID’ activities,” said Ashley Anderson, the agency’s park activities coordinator. The opening fulfills the vision of the center’s namesake, Claudia Workman, whose husband donated the land in 2015 so a nature-based education center could be built. The center has five main areas that include an introduction to Forks of Coal State Natural Area, an aquarium and reptile exhibit, a wildlife management area, a habitat management area and a wildlife observation area. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday beginning June 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOshkosh: The judge presiding over a case involving a violent altercation in a Wisconsin high school postponed the trial after defense attorneys argued that public sentiment related to the school shootings in Texas could taint the jury pool. Grant Fuhrman, accused of stabbing a high school resource officer multiple times with a barbecue fork in Oshkosh in 2019, is charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During a struggle, the officer shot the then-16-year-old student. Neither of them was seriously injured, and the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Fuhrman’s attorneys filed a motion to delay last week, four days after an 18-year-old entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot 19 children and two teachers. The defense said their client could not get a fair trial in the current environment. The request said the Texas case would have been on the minds of every potential juror if the interview process had started Tuesday as scheduled. “The length of time between the outside influence and the trial is critical. Here that time frame is mere days,” the motion said. Judge Daniel Bissett granted the delay and scheduled a status hearing for July 7.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A record haul in super PAC spending has poured into the race for the state’s sole U.S. House seat this year, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. More than $1 million has been reported to federal officials in such spending, with much of it aimed at unseating Rep. Liz Cheney, who angered many other Republicans with her stance against ex-President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The spending total by independent expenditure-only political committees has already more than doubled Wyoming’s previous record, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2024/05/23/100-milwaukee-objects-for-culture-history-sports-food-drink-more/73307718007/", "title": "100 Milwaukee objects for culture, history, sports, food & drink, more", "text": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nSome of us used to say we were from Milwaukee with a hint of shame.\n\nBut there are signs everywhere we look that Cream City is rising. Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs.

In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/2022-in-review-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "2022 In Review Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere is a look back at the events of 2022.\n\nNotable US Events\n\nJanuary 3 - The US Food and Drug Administration expands the emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine boosters to children ages 12 to 15.

State senators on Tuesday voted 29-0 for the bill. The legislation now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. The bill by Rep. Laura Hall creates a Women’s Tribute Statue Commission to fund, commission and place statues of Parks and Keller on the Capitol grounds. Parks was arrested Dec. 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated Montgomery city bus to a white passenger. Her arrest helped spark the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the civil rights movement. Keller, who was both deaf and blind, became a world-famous author and activist.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Many are familiar with uninvited guests unexpectedly crashing at the house, but an eagle took such a scenario to new heights. An eagle grabbed a piece of freezer-burned halibut that someone had thrown out and apparently misjudged its climb up a cliff with the 4-pound piece of fish while likely being chased by another eagle, the Kodiak Daily Mirror reports. The wrong trajectory led the eagle to smash through a front window of Stacy Studebaker’s home Saturday. “It was so unbelievably loud. My first thought was I thought an atomic bomb had dropped and the windows were blowing out,” says Studebaker, who founded the local chapter of the Audubon Society. She and a neighbor struggled to get the raptor out of her home as it dealt mayhem. Except for some blood around the beak, the eagle didn’t appear to be injured.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Tonto National Monument, a desert park northeast of Phoenix, has been designated an International Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association. That honor is bestowed on areas worldwide that take steps to make it easier for people to enjoy the night sky without the distractions of light pollution. Achieving this designation involves retrofitting light fixtures and bulbs, acquiring data for darkness analysis, and monitoring and interpreting the importance of preserving darkness. The state is awash in dark-sky sites, including the communities of Camp Verde, Flagstaff, Fountain Hills, Oak Creek and Sedona; Grand Canyon National Park; Kartchner Caverns State Park; Oracle State Park; Petrified Forest National Park; Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument; Parashant National Monument; Tumacacori National Historical Park; Walnut Canyon National Monument; and Wupatki National Monument.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Local leaders are considering a measure that would prevent the city from using public money to buy disposable products made with Styrofoam. The Fayetteville City Council discussed the proposal Tuesday night but took no action. The measure would also prohibit vendors, concession stands or food trucks operating on city property from using polystyrene foam, better known as Styrofoam. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the proposal is set to be considered again later this month. Cities and states across the nation have been busy banning or imposing fees for single-use foam and plastic products, while a wave in the opposite direction has led some states to seek prohibitions against such bans at the local level.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBeverly Hills: A fiery debate is breaking out as people at tony hair salons, gas stations and stores weigh in on whether the city of the rich and famous should become the first in the U.S. to outlaw the sale of tobacco products everywhere except a few cigar lounges. The City Council decided Tuesday night to make some changes to the proposal, such as allowing guests in Beverly Hills’ luxury hotels to acquire cigarettes through their concierge or room service. Members indicated they plan to pass the amended measure May 21. Abstainers have said yes to the idea, and the sooner the better, while smokers protested. California already outlaws smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars. It also has one of the highest cigarette taxes in the country – nearly $3 a pack. The proposed ordinance would ban all tobacco products from grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and gas stations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Voters narrowly made the city the first in the nation to decriminalize psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in “magic mushrooms.” Decriminalization led by a slim 51%, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday’s election released by Denver’s Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesman Alton Dillard said. Final results will be released May 16, he said. Organizers say their only goal in the mushroom measure is to keep people out of jail for using or possessing the drug to cope with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions. The initiative effectively decriminalizes use or possession of psilocybin by people 21 and older, making it the lowest enforcement priority for police and prosecutors. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by cannabis businesses.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An effort to better market the state as a good place to live, visit and do business has cleared a key legislative hurdle. The House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 113-28 for a bill requiring the Department of Economic and Community Development to come up with a marketing strategy that includes outreach to startup businesses and entrepreneurs, a new social media photo competition highlighting Connecticut’s beauty, and a campaign highlighting successful businesses. The bill, which awaits Senate action, also suggests DECD consider updating the state’s “Still Revolutionary” logo or design a new one with the help of a middle-school design competition. Other suggestions include targeting former residents between ages 30-45 and improving print marketing in airport lounges. Some Republicans opposed the bill, arguing lawmakers should simply cut taxes to attract business.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: In an effort to better identify victims of human trafficking, hospitals across the state will start to use the same techniques, making the First State likely the first in the country to adopt a coordinated approach, health officials say. Delaware has become an attractive place for traffickers because of its place along the I-95 corridor – and critics say state officials have been slow to address the growing problem. The Delaware Healthcare Association, which represents all the hospitals in the state, announced five recommendations Wednesday that will be implemented at all hospitals within the next year: educating the entire staff about human trafficking, using a specific assessment to identify red flags, following a step-by-step process to respond to suspected trafficking, using a hospital code for trafficking victims to collect statewide data and following a memo on how best to address minors who are being trafficked.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Comedian Dave Chappelle has been chosen to receive this year’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. The 45-year-old Chappelle shot to international stardom through his Comedy Central program, “Chappelle’s Show,” which gleefully skewered racial stereotypes and hot-button societal issues. He later made headlines for walking away from a lucrative contract over creative differences. Chappelle attended Washington’s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, and his first hourlong comedy special was filmed in the nation’s capital. Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter called Chappelle “a hometown hero” and said his social commentary and body of work embody Twain’s statement that “against the assault of humor, nothing can stand.” Chappelle will be presented with the award in a star-studded ceremony Oct. 29 that will be broadcast on television Jan. 6, 2020.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The lovebugs that are driving Floridians crazy right now may not be good for the finish on cars, but they are good for the environment, particularly the soil, according to the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. The pesky, slow-flying insects lay their eggs in places with dying vegetation, such as thatch, which is the cut grass spit out by lawn mowers. That’s where immature lovebugs, which actually are a type of fly known scientifically as plecia nearctica, live and eat. Feeding on the dead vegetation redistributes essential nutrients back into the ground, and that benefits plants and the environment. Also known as honeymoon flies, double-headed bugs and kissing bugs, the adult insects feed on plant nectar, especially sweet clover, goldenrod and Brazilian pepper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is seeking proposals to develop a Medicaid waiver that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp says will make health care more affordable and accessible. If approved by the federal government, the waiver would allow Georgia to expand Medicaid more conservatively than federal rules typically allow. The Department of Community Health asked six consulting firms Monday to submit proposals for waivers addressing Georgia’s Medicaid program and private health insurance. Officials are aiming to submit them to the federal government by the end of 2019. A bill that Kemp signed in March gave his office wide leeway to seek a waiver that reshapes the state’s health care system. Georgia is one of 14 states that haven’t fully expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The State Department of Health has launched a new website that provides near real-time data on the air quality following last summer’s Kilauea eruption. The site is expected to serve as an online resource, particularly in the event of future volcanic eruptions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “We listened to the concerns of residents, took action to improve our air quality monitoring system, and created a one-stop, user-friendly website. We’re much more volcano-ready than we have ever been,” says Health Director Bruce Anderson. Data for the website is pulled from air quality monitoring stations at strategic locations throughout the state. Most are on the Big Island. The state upgraded and expanded its air quality monitoring system with more than $1.5 million in federal and state funds. People can access the data via an interactive air quality map.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A planned hiking-and-biking trail connecting the popular central Idaho tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley is being challenged in federal court by the owners of Sawtooth Mountain Ranch. David Boren and Lynn Arnone filed the lawsuit last month seeking to stop a U.S. Forest Service plan to build a 4.4-mile trail for pedestrians, cyclists and horseback riders. The trail cuts across the Sawtooth Mountain Ranch. But the Sawtooth National Forest has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that it says allows the trail to cross the private property. The lawsuit contends the planned trail deviates from the easement and has “numerous flaws and illegalities.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Community and environmental activists are pushing for the opening of Lake Calumet on the city’s South Side to public access for recreation. Currently, a chain-link fence topped with razor wire surrounds the lake, blocking public access to hundreds of acres of natural habit. Ders Anderson of Chicago-based Openlands told the Daily Southtown in Tinley Park that Lake Calumet has long been recognized for the waterfowl, bald eagles and other bird species that roost nearby. Anderson says in addition to bird-watching, walking or bicycling on trails near the water, canoeing on the shallow lake or simply relaxing would benefit residents of Chicago and nearby suburbs. About 1,500 acres around Lake Calumet are part of the Port of Chicago, controlled by the Illinois International Port District.\n\nIndiana\n\nFranklin: Researchers at Franklin College have received a record-breaking research grant to study the behavior and management of Canada geese in the state, where the migratory bird’s population is growing along with complaints. The four-year grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act includes a $250,000 award that will fund Franklin College’s contribution to the study, on which the college is partnering with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and Ball State University. It is the largest research grant ever awarded to the small college about 20 miles south of Indianapolis. Indiana’s Canada goose population is estimated around 130,000, according to the DNR, but the rise in complaints involving geese in urban areas suggests that figure may actually be higher.\n\nIowa\n\nOnawa: A new report has named this small town, known for its wide main street and its claim to the invention of the Eskimo Pie, the poorest in the state. According to 24/7 Wall Street, Onawa is the only town in Iowa where more than 1 in 4 residents lives below the poverty line. The town’s 24.9% SNAP benefit recipiency rate is more than double the 11.2% rate statewide, the report says. The town with a population of 2,849 has a median household income of $31,089 (state: $56,570), a poverty rate of 25.3% (state: 12%) and a median home value of $93,500 (state: $137,200). The population is 90% white and 8% American Indian. Onawa is most widely known for staking a claim as the town with the “widest main street in America” at 150 feet wide. It’s also known as the birthplace of the Eskimo pie, a frozen treat made of ice cream encased in a chocolate coating, reportedly invented by Chris K. Nelsen in the summer of 1919.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A water park where a 10-year-old boy was decapitated isn’t hiring lifeguards, advertising or selling tickets with just weeks left before its typical Memorial Day weekend opening date, underlining speculation that it could be put up for sale. Schlitterbahn remains mum on its plans but has largely removed reference from its website about the park where Caleb Schwab was killed in 2016 when the raft he was riding on the 17-story Verruckt slide went airborne and hit a metal pole. Verruckt – German for “crazy” – never reopened and was torn down last year. Season tickets have been on sale for months for Schlitterbahn’s four Texas locations, but not the Kansas park. Speculation about a potential sale was fueled by mortgage lender EPR Properties announcing last week that Schlitterbahn is expected to pay off its approximately $190 million loan on the property soon.\n\nKentucky\n\nWalton: The high school senior who went to court over a restriction tied to chickenpox at his school has come down with the illness, his lawyer says. Christopher Wiest says Jerome Kunkel, 18, got sick last week, nearly two months after the Northern Kentucky Health Department issued its order to control an outbreak at two small parochial schools in Boone County. “He’s fine,” Wiest said. “He’s a little itchy.” In January, chickenpox broke out at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School and Assumption Academy, its high school. The schools and church in Walton are affiliated with the Society of St. Pius X, a conservative branch of Roman Catholicism that rejects Vatican II reforms. Nearly 90% of the schools’ students have religious exemptions against vaccinations. Kunkel and his classmates did not receive the vaccine because its production involves laboratory-generated cells taken from a fetus aborted in 1966.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A display of “magic, luck and friendship” will brighten up downtown’s Shreveport Common neighborhood this fall. The FriendsWithYou artist group will install a vivid, colorful public park called Rainbow City, including more than 35 larger-than-life, vinyl, multicolored inflatable sculptures standing up to 50 feet high. Rainbow City will be unveiled in late October in the Common Park. Various interactive and entertaining experiences are programmed at the inflatable park from Oct. 26 through Dec. 7, including a Dia de los Muertos celebratory dance party, a PJs and Pancakes breakfast, a romantic movie screening under the stars, a yoga session and more. On Oct. 26, FriendsWithYou will lead a Rainbow City Parade, featuring a new inflatable character named “Gumball,” designed by Caddo Parish student Isaiah Roberts. The fourth grader’s drawing was selected from hundreds of submissions.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s baby eel fishermen are enjoying a steady harvest and strong prices during the first season in which regulators are using new controls to stop poaching. Baby eels, called elvers, are one of the most lucrative marine resources in the U.S. on a per-pound basis, but the fishery has had problems with poaching. This year, packing and shipping of the fish is subject to more scrutiny by the Maine Marine Patrol. Fishermen are more than 90% of the way through their quota for the year, which is slightly less than 10,000 pounds. The average price is more than $2,000 per pound, which would be the third highest average on record if holds, state officials said. “For the guys who want to do the right thing and grow this fishery, they’re happy to comply,” says Jeffrey Pierce, a former state legislator who is an adviser to the Maine Elver Fishermen Association.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Police arrested seven people Wednesday as they ended a monthlong sit-in in the lobby of an administrative building at Johns Hopkins University, where a group of protesters have demonstrated against the creation of a campus police force and the institution’s contracts with the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency. City police officers and firefighters “provided assistance” shortly before 5 a.m. to reopen Garland Hall, the primary administrative building, the university announced. Protesters had chained the doors shut and blocked stairwells, defying a city fire marshal’s orders to keep the entrances and exits clear. Firefighters used an electric saw to get inside. The city’s top prosecutor swiftly dismissed the idea of prosecuting them. “No one arrested, student or community member, will be prosecuted,” said Melba Saunders, spokeswoman for State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: America’s oldest performing arts group is looking for a child who was literally wowed by a recent classical music concert. The Handel & Haydn Society had just finished its rendition of Mozart’s “Masonic Funeral” at Symphony Hall on Sunday when a youngster blurted out loudly: “WOW!” Boston classical music station WCRB-FM captured the exuberance on audio. The crowd can be heard bursting first into laughter and then into rousing applause for the child. Now the organization founded in 1815 has mounted a search for the kid it’s calling the “Wow Child” – not to reprimand him or her but to offer a chance to meet the conductor and hear the orchestra again as a guest of honor. “It was one of the most wonderful moments I’ve experienced in the concert hall,” Handel & Haydn president and CEO David Snead wrote in a letter to concertgoers asking them to share the child’s name.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A 17-foot bronze sculpture that arrived downtown last year got people talking, taking selfies and wondering what exactly it means. This week, the conversation sparked by “Waiting,” a work of art by internationally acclaimed artist Kaws, will get some fresh context, thanks to the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. “Kaws: Alone Again,” which opens Friday and runs through Aug. 4, is a solo exhibition of work by Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, who goes by the alias Kaws. The show was organized by MOCAD’s executive director Elysia Borowy-Reeder in collaboration with the contemporary art superstar. “Riffing on specific genres of pop art, figuration, deconstruction, collage and fashion, the exhibition represents an underlying irreverence and affection for our turbulent times, as well as Kaws’ agility as an artist to appropriate and transform,” MOCAD says about the exhibition.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Mississippi River flooding in the capital this spring swamped the record for the longest period of flooding ever measured in the city. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports that the river was above flood stage for 42 straight days, easily surpassing the 2001 record of 33 days. The National Weather Service says the river fell below flood stage last weekend. The city is continuing to assess and clean up riverside streets that were submerged before reopening them. All of the city’s flood plain parks, including boat launches, remain closed.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The mayor is apologizing about confusion over parking meters. Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill says drivers will not be ticketed for parking at a malfunctioning meter. The Oxford Eagle reports the city put stickers on meters a couple of weeks ago warning people not to park at broken ones. The city’s parking director, Matt Davis, had also told the newspaper that citations would be issued. Parking meters are still fairly new on the town square in Oxford. Tannehill says the mayor and aldermen never voted to allow ticketing for vehicles parked at broken meters. She said Saturday on social media that if someone finds a broken meter, the city should tell that driver: “ ‘It’s your lucky day.’ ”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: An Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has upheld a previous ruling on a city ordinance that prohibits women from showing their nipples and areolas in public, despite protests from local activists who argue the policy is discriminatory. The decision Monday is the latest in a four-year controversy that started when some women walked shirtless through downtown Springfield to protest the differing rules for men and women. Members of the City Council, who feared the scandalizing of children and moral degradation of the community, later passed an ordinance prohibiting women from showing their nipples in public. But the ACLU and local “Free the Nipple” activists sued, and a federal judge upheld the city’s ordinance in 2017. On Monday, a three-judge panel for the appeals court agreed with the lower court, citing at least eight cases during which courts upheld similar laws.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Law enforcement officials say they’ve managed to slow an increase in violent crime rates in the state’s most populous county that’s being driven largely by methamphetamine trafficking and abuse. U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme and Montana Attorney General Tim Fox on Wednesday announced results from the first year of an initiative targeting violent criminals in Yellowstone County. They say the number of murders, robberies and aggravated assaults increased just over 1% over the past year, after surging 26% in the prior 12-month period. Alme credited the government’s Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative for helping bring federal charges against 170 defendants in Yellowstone County for drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offenses. Alme says a similar effort in Missoula County is also showing positive results.\n\nNebraska\n\nNiobrara: People who suffered losses when the Spencer Dam failed have gotten more bad news: State law limits the liability of the dam’s owner. That owner, Nebraska Public Power District, has said the March 14 collapse was due to a combination of high Niobrara River flows and massive chunks of ice. The home of a man who lived below the dam, Kenny Angel, was swept away. His body still has not been found. The Norfolk Daily News reports that attorney David Domina addressed a gathering of homeowners, farmers and businesspeople Monday in Niobrara. He told them state law limits the district liability to $1 million per claim per occurrence and $5 million per occurrence for all claimants. He says Knox County already is listing more than $17 million in damages.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Forest Service’s rejection of a proposal to drill for oil or gas in the Ruby Mountains has become official after no one complained during the 45-day objection period. Forest Supervisor Bill Dunkelberger says the agency’s decision became final Tuesday. He says the service didn’t receive a single objection after it determined the drilling wasn’t suitable for the area and selected the “no leasing” alternative in mid-March. He says that reaffirms his belief he made the right decision for future management of more than 82 square miles of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest along the mountain range in northern Nevada’s Elko County. Dunkelberger concluded any economic benefits from the drilling would be limited compared to money the natural resources contribute to the area economy through tourism, recreation and livestock grazing.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: University of New Hampshire researchers say they’ve discovered a new strain of canine distemper virus in wild animals in New Hampshire and Vermont. Over one year, pathologists diagnosed canine distemper virus infection in eight mammals: fishers, gray foxes, a skunk, a raccoon and a mink. Pathologists found all of the animals were infected with a distinct strain of the virus that had been identified only in a single raccoon in Rhode Island in 2004. They said the identification of this strain fills a gap in the general knowledge of canine distemper virus strains circulating in North America. The strain was identified by UNH pathologists in collaboration with colleagues at Cornell University, University of Georgia, Northeast Wildlife Disease Cooperative, and state Fish and Game departments.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed four bills into law aimed at improving maternal health care, particularly for residents using Medicaid. The Democrat signed the measures Wednesday at University Hospital in Newark. The new laws were enacted just a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study showing that pregnancy-related deaths are rising and that being black is a main risk factor. One measure provides for Medicaid to cover doulas. Another sets up a pilot program for perinatal care for those on Medicaid. The third bill bars early, elective deliveries that are not medically necessary for those on Medicaid and on the state’s health benefits plans. The final measure codifies a current practice by requiring perinatal risk assessment forms be filled out by Medicaid providers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: A group of college students is helping redesign the Jemez Historic Site visitor center using multimedia tools. New Mexico Highlands University announced this week that 15 of its media arts students are creating floor-to-ceiling video projections of historic images and oral histories at the Native American site. The students also are adding interactive touch-screen computer tablets that focus on artifacts and an event called “Light Among the Ruins.” Supervisory archaeologist Ethan Ortega says the students used oral histories and texts written by Jemez tribal members to create the new components. The Jemez Historic Site includes the stone remains of a 500-year-old village and the San Jose church, which dates to 1622. It’s located at Jemez Springs, about 50 miles north of Albuquerque.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A new exhibit chronicling the end of one of the most turbulent decades in American history has opened to the public at the Empire State Plaza. The exhibit titled “1969” opened Wednesday at the Vietnam Memorial Gallery in the Robert Abrams Justice Building in downtown Albany. Events such as the first moon landing and Woodstock music concert occurred 50 years ago this year, while the Vietnam War raged in Southeast Asia. The exhibit includes photographs, archival footage and artifacts from the era, along with audio recordings of veterans from New York telling stories about their Vietnam experience in ’69. Nicholas Valenti, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Vietnam and is now a leader of the Vietnam Veteran chapters of New York, joined state officials at the official opening.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: Duke University has received a $5 million grant to improve the 55-acre Sarah P. Duke Gardens site on campus, which attracts about 400,000 visitors each year. University President Vincent Price said in a news release that The Duke Endowment is providing the grant for the Garden Gateway Project, a fundraising campaign. The grant brings the total raised to $16 million of the $30 million goal for the project, which will revitalize the gardens’ front entrance and fund new and improved facilities and classrooms. The plan also calls for a new performance lawn and expanded indoor event hall. The Duke Endowment is a private foundation based in Charlotte. The university, the foundation and Duke Energy are separate organizations despite sharing a name.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: Part of the scenic drive and some trails are being temporarily closed at Theodore Roosevelt National Park’s North Unit while prescribed fire projects are completed. Planned burns are used as a resource management tool. The National Park Service says one fire Thursday is to encompass about 4,300 acres, or nearly 7 square miles. There also will be a smaller fire covering 700 acres, or about a square mile. The scenic drive will be closed at the Caprock Coulee trailhead to the end of the road. Portions of the Achenbach and Caprock Coulee trails will be closed for visitor safety. Burning is expected be completed by the end of the day.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is expecting two new babies this year. “Two of our giraffes are pregnant. One, Tessa, is due in June, and the other, Cece, is due in the fall,” spokeswoman Michelle Curley says. Both Tessa and Cece have given birth at the zoo before, but these will be the first giraffe calves in three years. Cece’s daughter Cora and Zoey, who was born to Jambo, made their debut in 2016. In 2014, Tessa gave birth to Nasha. Way back in 2011, Tessa gave birth to the zoo’s first baby giraffe in 26 years. According to the zoo, giraffe calves typically weigh about 125 pounds at birth and are approximately 6 feet tall.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Fines, dues and court expenses assessed to defendants in the state have spiked since fiscal year 2007, and some criminal justice reform advocates say state and local government agencies are increasingly relying on them as an income source. Tulsa World reports that citations, fees and costs have risen 27% since 2007. State lawmakers have also imposed two administrative charges that collectively require defendants to pay an additional 25% of all fees amassed by the courts for the executive branch. Court collections have contributed to about 66% to 90% of yearly district court subsidies over that same period. Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform director Kris Steele says an impoverished person’s inability to pay either puts them in jail or leads to their return to crime in order to satisfy the debts.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Legislature is considering a bill that would let farmers sue companies, such as Bayer and Syngenta, that hold patents on genetically engineered seeds if crops grown from those seeds contaminate other crops. Contamination from genetically engineered crops can make organic and conventional crops unable to be sold. GE crops also can escape their fields and become a nuisance for other farmers that is hard to eradicate. House Bill 2882 would allow landowners or tenants to seek three times actual economic damages if GE organisms, also called GMOs, are present on their land without permission. It also would allow residents to sue the corporations if GE organisms are found on land owned or occupied by a public body in the area where they live.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Three Mile Island, site of the United States’ worst nuclear power accident, will begin a planned shutdown starting June 1 now that it is clear that it will not get a financial rescue from the state, its owner said Wednesday. Exelon Corp.’s statement comes two years after the energy giant threatened to close the money-losing plant without what critics have called a bailout. The fight over Three Mile Island and Pennsylvania’s four other nuclear power plants invigorated a debate over the “zero carbon emissions” characteristics of nuclear power in the age of global warming and in one of the nation’s largest fossil fuel-producing states. Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 is licensed to operate through 2034, and shutting it down will cut its life short by 15 years. It will go offline by Sept. 30, Exelon said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A school district has changed its policy after facing criticism for a plan to serve students who owe lunch money sun butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a hot meal. Warwick Public Schools, which serves students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, said Wednesday that a school subcommittee recommended students get the lunch of their choice regardless of their account balance. Chairwoman Karen Bachus clarified that under the current policy students would’ve been provided the sandwich, which is also a daily choice on the school lunch menu, vegetables, fruit and milk. The district faced pushback after announcing in a Facebook post Sunday that students who owed money on paid, free or reduced lunch accounts would be served cold sandwiches until the balance is paid starting May 13.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state’s largest detention center is facing a serious staffing shortage, and officials are hoping to hire those looking for work. WCIV-TV reports there are about 90 vacancies currently out of nearly 400 jobs at the Al Cannon Detention Center. Deputy PJ Skipper says the job isn’t for everyone, but it’s one that has kept her coming back every day for 23 years. She says she initially planned a short two-year stint but realized working there is a calling. She says if she can make a difference with just one inmate, she’s done her job. The sheriff’s office is holding a Career Day on Saturday. Those interested should bring a driver’s license or other ID and be ready to take tests to see if they qualify for the posts.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nKeystone: Fireworks will return to Mount Rushmore National Memorial for the Fourth of July celebration in 2020. Mount Rushmore’s fireworks were discontinued after 2009 due to concerns related to the pine beetle infestation that increased fire concerns in the Black Hills National Forest. The forest has since rebounded, and advances have been made in pyrotechnic safety. Gov. Kristi Noem, federal Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith on Tuesday announced the resumption of fireworks. Noem said the agreement came after several months of meetings and discussions.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Along with classic country songs like “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” there’s a legendary tale that millions associate with George Jones – the lawn mower story. Once, during a terrible bout of binge drinking, Jones says he was left alone in his house with no booze. To stop him from driving to the liquor store, his wife had hidden all his car keys. “But she forgot about the lawn mower,” Jones wrote in his autobiography, “I Lived to Tell It All.” Jones cleaned up his act for good in 1999, living a sober life until his death in 2013, but the lawn mower legend lives on. Now, it’s been immortalized in a new mural on the side of Nashville’s Colonial Liquors, where Jones was once a frequent customer. The mural was painted by Nashville artist Shawn Catz, along with a crew of musician friends. But the cartoon design actually comes from an episode of “Tales From the Tour Bus,” an animated TV series by Mike Judge (“Beavis & Butthead,” “King of the Hill”).\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Removal of Confederate and other historical markers would need approval from voters or state lawmakers under a bill that won initial approval from the state Senate on Tuesday. The measure would take removal powers away from local governments and other public entities who have grappled with calls to remove Confederate markers that are now facing protests over the era’s racist history. The Dallas City Council voted last year to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a park, and the University of Texas in 2017 removed several statues of Lee and other Confederate figures. Earlier this year, Gov. Greg Abbott and other top state Republicans agreed to remove a Capitol plaque that said slavery was not the underlying cause of the Civil War.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Southern Utah University has secured funding for a new child development center, which officials say could fill a previously unmet need of on-campus child care. But city residents as a whole may also be struggling to find quality, affordable child care. Data suggests care in Cedar City isn’t just hard to come by but also expensive. Though finding affordable, quality child care is an issue many families and individuals face, SUU is focusing its services on students who are single mothers. Construction on the Sorenson Legacy Child and Family Development Center will begin in July, and it will be open for student use by August 2020. Kathy Wyatt, steering committee chair of the child care center and SUU’s first lady, says the center will double as a preschool, taking in children who are infants up to age 5.\n\nVermont\n\nDerby Line: U.S. officials have marked the completion of a new U.S.-Canada border crossing facility that is designed to smooth the flow of people and trade between the two countries while keeping the U.S. safe from terrorism and criminal organizations. The new $33 million facility at the northern end of Interstate 91 in the Vermont town of Derby Line replaces another facility that was built in 1965. High-tech improvements make the new facility more energy efficient, and it includes technological upgrades and larger spaces where officers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection can process both people and cargo. Construction began in fall 2016. The port of entry processes about 1.1 million people a year, says Christopher Averill, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A police officer who cursed at a group of black middle schoolers and later promised to publicly apologize has rescinded the offer. Richmond police Chief William Smith tells The Richmond Times-Dispatch that the officer, whose name hasn’t been released, no longer feels he can handle the large setting. A March video shows the officer telling the Albert Hill students to “wait until your asses turn 18, then you’re mine.” Student Cameron Hilliard filmed the video and says someone outside her group yelled an obscenity directed at officers, launching the confrontation. The officer apologized to the students and their guardians last week and signed an agreement to publicly apologize at a school assembly. The chief says the officer is sorry for not being able to meet with the school.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee, who is seeking a path to the White House on the message of climate change, signed a measure Tuesday that makes the state the fourth in the nation to establish a mandate to provide carbon-free electricity by a targeted date. The measure was among several environmental bills that Inslee signed at a park in Seattle, surrounded by climate advocates and others. The signing of the new law comes less than a week after Inslee unveiled his first major policy proposal of his presidential campaign, in which he called for the nation’s entire electrical grid and all new vehicles and buildings to be free of carbon pollution by 2030. “We are determined to build a solar and wind and electrical system where people can access clean energy and cleaner air to breathe for our kids as long as Washington state is here,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The U.S. government sued nearly two dozen of Gov. Jim Justice’s coal companies Tuesday to get them to pay about $4.8 million in unpaid mine safety fines. The civil lawsuit was filed by federal prosecutors on behalf of the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Justice’s companies committed more than 2,000 federal Mine Health and Safety Act violations since May 2014 but have refused to pay the penalties despite multiple attempts by federal agencies to get the money, according to the lawsuit. “This is unacceptable, and, as indicated by this suit, we will hold them accountable,” said U.S. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Republicans with prisons in their districts are complaining about Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ decision to grant temporary raises at only six institutions. Nineteen Republicans sent a letter Wednesday to Evers saying that the raises aren’t fair and that compensation should be addressed through the state budget. A state audit released last week found entry-level guard pay in Wisconsin was second-lowest among seven Midwestern states. Evers’ budget calls for spending an additional $23.8 million to create a pay progression system for prison workers. Days before the audit was released, Evers’ administration gave temporary raises of up to $5 an hour to workers at Columbia, Dodge, Green Bay, Taycheedah and Waupun correctional institutions as well as the Lincoln Hills youth prison. Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff says Evers is trying to fix problems Republicans have ignored.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: If Thomas Foulke has his way, some of the oldest domesticated crops in the world will help grow a new industry in the state. Foulke, a senior research scientist at the University of Wyoming in the Department of Agriculture and Applied Economics, is leading an effort called the Wyoming First-Grains Project, which aims to develop a niche industry around growing “first grains.” He describes those as the earliest domesticated cereal crops, among them Emmer wheat, spelt, barley and einkorn. “People were making bread from wild grains before they even domesticated it,” he said. “There was something about bread and something about wheat that was really important to early humans.” In conjunction with UW research farms in Lingle, Powell and Sheridan, the First-Grains Project produced about 20 acres of spelt and Emmer wheat last year.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/14/manatee-mortality-bug-zapper-zaps-vision-borat-pot-suit-news-around-states/117514348/", "title": "Manatee mortality, bug zapper zaps vision: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The fees imposed by Alabama Power on the company’s customers who generate their own electricity with rooftop or on-site solar panels are now the subject of a federal lawsuit against the state’s regulators. Environmental groups argue that punishing fees are purposely discouraging the adoption of solar power in the sun-rich state. Alabama Power maintains that the fees are needed to maintain the infrastructure that provides backup power to customers when their solar panels don’t provide enough energy. The Southern Environmental Law Center and Ragsdale LLC filed the lawsuit Monday against the Alabama Public Service Commission on behalf four Alabama Power customers who installed solar panels on their properties and the Greater-Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution, or GASP. “We’re asking the court to require the Commission to follow the law so that Alabama Power will stop unfairly taxing private solar investments,” Keith Johnston, director of SELC’s Alabama office, said in a statement. “Alabama is being left behind by other Southern states when it comes to solar generation, and the jobs, bill savings and other benefits that come with it,” SELC’s statement said. “These charges are a significant roadblock to our state’s success.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit challenging a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries and institute ranked-choice voting for general elections in Alaska is alleging constitutional violations, but the accusations are actually policy objections, an attorney for the state argued Monday. Assistant Attorney General Margaret Paton Walsh said the initiative setting out the new system does not violate constitutional rights. Political parties previously have used primaries to advance a nominee to the general election. Under the new system, the top four voter-getters in each race would advance to the general election, regardless of party. Superior Court Judge Gregory Miller did not immediately rule Monday after hearing arguments from Paton Walsh, attorneys for the plaintiffs and the group behind the initiative. Changes under the initiative that voters narrowly approved in November are set to take effect for next year’s elections, which will decide races for offices including U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governor and lieutenant governor. The lawsuit was filed late last year by residents affiliated with the Libertarian Party and the Alaskan Independence Party. Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus said Monday that he expected the case would go to the Alaska Supreme Court.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Members of the Legislature who live outside the metro Phoenix area will be getting a big increase in their daily expense pay under legislation Republican Gov. Doug Ducey allowed to become law Monday. It was the first time in seven years a bill became law without his signature. Ducey’s decision came two years after he vetoed similar legislation that would have boosted the expense pay of all 90 lawmakers. He said such an increase shouldn’t benefit Phoenix-area legislators who don’t have to maintain a second home, nor should it take effect without an election in between. The governor’s spokesman, C.J. Karamargin, said the new law isn’t perfect but is far more limited than the 2019 version. Lawmakers earn $24,000 a year. Those who live in Maricopa County get $35 a day in expense pay for the first 120 days of the session or while doing actual legislative work outside of session. Lawmakers from other parts of the state get $60 a day. The expense pay drops significantly after 120 days. Under the bill Ducey allowed to become law without his signature Monday, rural lawmakers will get the federal winter per diem rate for Phoenix during session, which is $207 a day – $151 a day for lodging and $56 for meals. Proponents of the legislation called it long overdue, noting that there had not been a change in the rate since 1984.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s coronavirus hospitalizations increased by 68 over the weekend, the Department of Health said Monday as Arkansas remained tops in the country in new cases. The department said the state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations now total 565. The state’s virus cases increased by 2,013 to 357,473 total since the pandemic began. The department recently stopped reporting daily COVID-19 numbers on weekends, releasing the figures on Mondays instead. Arkansas has seen a resurgence in the coronavirus in recent weeks, fueled by the delta variant of the virus and the state’s low vaccination rate. The state’s COVID-19 deaths increased by seven over the past three days. The state leads the country in new cases per capita over the past two weeks, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. Only 35% of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom can’t put his Democratic Party affiliation on the ballot voters see when they decide whether to remove him, a judge ruled Monday. Newsom’s campaign missed a deadline to submit his affiliation to California Secretary of State Shirley Weber for the Sept. 14 recall election. Newsom’s campaign said it was inadvertent and asked Weber, who was appointed by Newsom, to allow the affiliation to appear. She said the issue needed to go to a judge, so Newsom filed a lawsuit. His Republican opponents criticized the move as an attempt to change rules everyone else must follow. Newsom’s elections attorney, Thomas Willis, and an attorney for Weber both argued during an hourlong hearing Friday that Newsom merely missed an arbitrary, harmless filing deadline and that it is in the voters’ interest to know his party preference. Adding that information now wouldn’t cause a procedural problem because elections officials still have enough time to ensure Newsom’s party preference appears on the ballot along with those seeking to replace him, Weber said in a court filing. An attorney representing recall supporters noted that Newsom himself had signed the law that recently changed recall rules to speed up the election.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: The Northern Colorado Wildlife Center has seen double the number of turtles treated at the facility after being injured by vehicles, chewed on by dogs or picked up by people this year compared to years past – and there remains plenty of summer left. “We have had a lot more turtle patients this year,” said Kate Boyd, the center’s licensed wildlife rehabilitator. “All have been human-caused. The good news is a lot of folks are reaching out to us to get help for these animals. In the past, we have had a lot of folks see an animal that is or might get injured but think it’s not a big deal because it’s just a reptile, snake or turtle.” Boyd isn’t sure what is causing the rise in turtle injuries. The center has treated nine this year and expects to treat at least that many more before things quiet down. She said the end of May through August is when turtles are most mobile. During that period, they are moving to make nests and lay eggs, young are hatching, and some are looking for new homes. She said another reason turtles move is when being displaced by development. “All these movements happening simultaneously makes it a busy time of the season for people and turtles,” Boyd said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nGlastonbury: An 18-year-old has been charged with computer crimes after police say he hacked into a database and put a quote from Adolf Hitler into a high school yearbook. The teen was a student at Glastonbury High School, where the quote appeared in May beneath the photo of an unsuspecting classmate, police said. It read: “It is a quite special secret pleasure how the people around us fail to realize what is really happening to them.” The quote was attributed in the yearbook to George Floyd, the Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer last year. Police said the same student also was responsible for another unauthorized yearbook entry, which referenced one of the Boston Marathon bombers and drug use. The teen, who was previously barred from attending his graduation ceremony, faces two counts of third-degree computer crime and is due in court Aug. 6. The quotes were discovered in May after distribution of the yearbooks began. The school recalled the books to remove the offending quotes. “We deeply regret not having caught the act of bigotry and vandalism before the yearbook was printed,” school administrators said in a statement at the time of the recall. “We are examining and will revise our yearbook procedures for collecting and reviewing future student submissions.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Delaware’s COVID-19 state of emergency, implemented in March 2020 when the coronavirus reached the First State, ended Tuesday. The effect of the official end of the emergency order is minimal, as the bulk of the state’s COVID-19 restrictions, including its mask mandate for vaccinated individuals and social distancing requirements, have been lifted for almost two months. But it signifies the coronavirus is no longer a public health emergency, Gov. John Carney said last month when announcing the emergency order’s end, adding that it’s still important for unvaccinated people to protect themselves and their families. The state of emergency granted Carney the power to shut down businesses in the initial scramble to contain the virus and implement other public health measures such as testing and contact tracing. Carney issued more than two dozen modifications to the emergency order. They changed rules on mask-wearing and restrictions as case counts in Delaware waxed and waned and as scientists learned more about how the virus spreads. Carney on Monday signed a public health emergency order to allow the Division of Public Health and Delaware Emergency Management Agency to continue its vaccination and testing programs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The so-called Little Lady Liberty has finally made her way to the nation’s capital, just in time for Bastille Day on Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. France initially shipped the 9-foot-tall replica to New York City and placed it near the original sculpture. The Statue of Liberty stands more than 150 feet tall on Liberty Island, where it was reassembled in 1886 after being constructed across the Atlantic and gifted to the United States by its longtime ally. As of Tuesday, the more diminutive Liberty is on display at the French ambassador’s residence in Northwest D.C. And there is plenty of time for residents and visitors to see it: The statue, which is on loan from France, will stay on display in Washington for the next 10 years.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: More manatees have died already this year than in any other year in Florida’s recorded history, primarily from starvation due to the loss of seagrass beds, state officials said. The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission reported that 841 manatee deaths were recorded between Jan. 1 and July 2, breaking the previous record of 830 that died in 2013 because of an outbreak of toxic red tide. More than half the deaths have occurred in the Indian River Lagoon and its surrounding areas in Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties. The overwhelming majority of deaths have been in Brevard, where 312 manatees have perished. Some biologists believe water pollution is killing the seagrass beds in the area. “Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,” Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute wrote as it announced the record Friday. “Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon, where the majority of seagrass has died off.” Boat strikes are also a major cause of manatee deaths, killing at least 63 this year. The manatee was once classified as endangered by the federal government but was reclassified as threatened in 2017. Environmentalists are asking for reconsideration.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The staff of Green Truck Neighborhood Pub got the surprise of a lifetime Thursday when first lady Jill Biden walked in to pick up a few pecan pies, according to co-owner Whitney Shephard-Yates. After her visit to Beach High School to urge residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Biden made an unscheduled stop at the restaurant on the recommendation of U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Savannah native. Shephard-Yates, who has previously met Warnock through her day job as a transportation engineer, jokingly said she planned to give the senator a hard time for not giving the staff a heads-up that Biden was going to stop by the restaurant. “The staff was thrilled to meet both Rev. Warnock and Dr. Biden,” Shephard-Yates said. “I think you could tell by the looks on their faces how exciting it was for everyone involved.” The surprise visit was significant timing, as the staff of Green Truck had recently celebrated being fully vaccinated. Fortunately, no one on staff got sick during the pandemic, which Yates credited to their cautiousness. Having everyone immunized has been an incredible relief and experience given the stress of the past year, she said. “Being a small-business owner during the pandemic was incredibly challenging, personally and financially,” Shephard-Yates said. “We’re really thankful for this opportunity to rebuild and the small amount of attention that the senator and first lady’s visit is bringing to the cause.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state said people haven’t been completing the paperwork they need to continue receiving food stamps, raising concerns that thousands may be unintentionally cut off from public assistance. The concerns come after the federal government, citing the coronavirus pandemic, dropped the normal requirement that people on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program do an eligibility review and a six-month review, in an effort to ensure that people did not experience a lapse in benefits during the public health emergency. It lifted the waiver this month. The state Department of Human Services sent 2,200 letters for the six-month review last month, but only 700 were returned, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It sent 15,000 eligibility review letters, but only 7,000 were returned. “Typically, we receive about 80% back in normal years,” said Brian Donohoe, the department’s benefit, employment and support services administrator. He called the response rates “frighteningly low.” Those who do not turn in their paperwork on time will be notified that their SNAP benefits have been terminated. While the person’s Electronic Benefit Transfer card will still work, no new funds will be added. The person would have to reapply and would likely see a gap in receiving the service.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state senators plan to meet this week to discuss the possibility of a special session after three large health care providers announced policies requiring employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations, the top Senate Republican said Monday. Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said GOP senators will meet online Friday morning amid growing calls for a special session on employers requiring the vaccines. Winder said he hopes to “find out where everyone is at and what their level of interest is in coming back” but said that “at this stage, I don’t really have a good feeling on it. I want to make sure we don’t take away from the contract rights of health care providers. There are always two sides to every story.” The House never fully adjourned earlier this year under a plan to allow Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke to simply call lawmakers back to the Statehouse without needing Republican Gov. Brad Little’s OK. Typically, only governors can call special sessions. Little’s spokeswoman, Marissa Morrison, said Little had received no formal requests for a special session. There is some disagreement among legal experts over whether the Legislature is still in session because the Senate officially adjourned, while the House only recessed. But lawmakers appear to be proceeding on the belief the Legislature is only recessed.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: New signs are popping up along highways across the state to let drivers of electric vehicles know where they can refuel. The signs are being posted on designated “alternative fuels corridors” and will direct drivers to stations that offer alternative fuels, with the first signs focused on electric charging stations. The Illinois Department of Transportation said future signs will direct drivers to sites for liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas, hydrogen and propane fueling stations. The signage is part of a national effort to promote alternative fuels, as well as a push by Gov. J.B. Pritzker to increase the number of electric vehicles on Illinois roads. The Federal Highway Administration has designated 145,000 miles of interstate as alternative fuel corridors. In Illinois that includes stretches along Interstates 39, 55, 70, 74, 80, 90 and 94.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the state must temporarily continue payment of federal unemployment benefits, affirming an earlier court order for Indiana to restart the extra $300 weekly payments to jobless-aid recipients. Chief Judge Cale Bradford denied a request from the state government to issue a stay on a Marion County judge’s order that Indiana resume participation in the federal government’s programs that supplement unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb, who has pushed to drop the state from the federal programs before they’re scheduled to end Sept. 6, did not say Monday whether the state would next call on the Indiana Supreme Court to consider the preliminary injunction. “We acknowledge the court of appeals decision today,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “Notwithstanding, the Department of Workforce Development will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Labor on finalizing the pandemic unemployment insurance benefits to comply with the judge’s order.” Holcomb announced in May that Indiana would reinstate a requirement that those receiving jobless benefits would again have to show they are actively searching for work as of June 1 and that the state would leave the federal programs effective June 19.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials expect hundreds or possibly thousands more parents to teach their children to drive after a new law expanded the opportunity beyond home-schooling families. Advocates for more parental choice in education applauded the move as widening options for families and providing a potentially less expensive option for parents. But some critics of the new law are concerned that children will be less prepared as a result. “We have a lot of kids who come to us, and their parents do a great job. And there’s still a lot those kids don’t know,” said Ed Jennings, personnel manager for Street Smarts, a driver education company that trains thousands of Iowa students a year. “There’s a huge difference between driving a car and driving it safely.” The new Iowa law, which went into effect July 1, builds on the parent-taught option for home-schoolers that the Legislature established in 2013. That year, parents could serve as their home-schooled child’s driver education instructor rather than enrolling their child in a program at a school or a for-profit driver education company. Parents must still meet certain qualifications to teach their child, including holding a valid Iowa driver’s license and having a clear driving record for the previous two years.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Wichita State University plans this fall to stop allowing Kansas residents 60 and older to audit its courses for free. The university sent a letter this month to people who’ve previously audited its classes to notify them of the fees, The Wichita Eagle reports. Interim Executive Vice President and Provost Shirley Lefever said the new fees will help cover instructional costs. The new fees range from $7.75 a credit hour for liberal arts courses to $68 a credit hour for business courses. Most courses are three credit hours. The move comes after the Kansas Board of Regents in June approved the university’s proposal to keep its tuition flat during the upcoming school year. Donna Perline is currently auditing a water fitness class and plans to audit another course on the Holocaust in film this August. She said she hopes the new charges don’t discourage seniors from auditing classes. The university still plans to offer free four-week classes specifically for people 60 and older if they enroll by Sept. 8.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A pickup truck crashed into a building housing the city’s jail Tuesday, and the driver was detained, police said. The truck was painted with a popular rallying cry among demonstrators in Cuba, “Patria y vida,” which translates to “fatherland and life” in English. The truck rammed into the front of Louisville’s Metro Corrections building shortly after noon. The streets surrounding the jail were blocked off. The front side of the the jail, where administrative staff are located, was evacuated, said Steve Durham, assistant director of Louisville Metro Corrections. Inmates were informed of the crash. “Everybody is all right,” he said. “No one was hurt in this particular event. There is just some concern that inmates have, so we’re trying to answer those questions.” The bomb squad was deployed to the scene as a precaution, Louisville police spokesperson Elizabeth Ruoff said. In a tweet, Louisville Metro Police urged drivers to avoid the area around the building.\n\nLouisiana\n\nArabi: A New Orleans-area film and TV studio plans to expand into a building that opened in 1923 as an assembly plant for Model T Fords. The Ranch Film Studios didn’t say what it paid for the 225,000-square-foot building in Arabi. But the company said it is looking for partners and plans to raise $35 million to complete the historic restoration and $35 million to create film stages and spaces for tech-, gaming- and film-related companies. Arabi is less than a 10-minute drive away from the studio in Chalmette, which CEO Jason Waggenspack and his partners created in 2014 from what was left of two big-box stores blighted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The 219,000-square-foot studio currently houses about 25% of all entertainment productions in Louisiana, according to the company. Productions filmed there have included “Terminator Genisys,” “Deepwater Horizon,” “Bill & Ted Face the Music,” the limited Showtime series “Your Honor,” the Disney+ series “Secrets of Sulphur Springs,” and the Netflix films “The Lovebirds” and “The Dirt,” a biopic about the band Motley Crue. The Ford building was designed by famed industrial architect Albert Kahn, who also designed Detroit’s Belle Isle Aquarium and Book Depository.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: The Passamaquoddy Tribe held an educational session near a replica of a Christopher Columbus ship that was visiting for Maine’s bicentennial and had drawn condemnation from tribes. A language keeper for the tribe, Dwayne Tomah, spoke to a gathering of people Monday evening at the Bucksport waterfront near where the ship was anchored, the Portland Press Herald reports. The replica of the Nao Santa Maria was scheduled to tour multiple ports in the state to mark the bicentennial. Organizers canceled those events when tribal leaders said the touring ship was disrespectful to the tribes and ignored the history of atrocities Columbus committed against Native Americans. The town of Bucksport posted on Facebook that the purpose of the educational session was to “have a constructive dialog and provide historical information.” Maine’s bicentennial was last year, but events were moved to this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Thousands of people have taken tours of the ship since it anchored in Bucksport on Friday, the newspaper reports. The ship will leave Wednesday when its docking permit expires.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A judge has blocked Gov. Larry Hogan’s plan to end pandemic-related federal enhanced unemployment benefits early. Circuit Court Judge Lawrence Fletcher-Hill issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday morning ordering the Hogan administration to keep paying the expanded benefits at least until two lawsuits brought by out-of-work Marylanders are resolved. The governor’s office said the state doesn’t plan to appeal, according to news outlets. Fletcher-Hill found that plaintiffs showed they would suffer “irreparable harm” if the preliminary injunction weren’t issued and noted that the plaintiff’s stories are reminders that while the impact of the pandemic has been universal, it has also been “cruelly uneven.” “As one who has enjoyed the privilege of continuous, secure employment, the Court is particularly struck by the plight of those who have had to struggle with irregular or no employment,” he wrote. The judge also ruled that the legal challenges would likely win at trial since Maryland law, strengthened by General Assembly Democrats this year, appears to require the state to accept all federal unemployment aid. Last month, Gov. Larry Hogan announced that the state would discontinue benefits July 3 ahead of their expiration in September.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Actor Sacha Baron Cohen has sued a cannabis dispensary he says used an image of his character Borat on a billboard without his permission, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Boston. The billboard for Somerset-based Solar Therapeutics Inc. showed Baron Cohen posing as Borat with two thumbs up and the words “It’s nice!” – one of Borat’s catchphrases. “By use of the billboard, the defendants falsely have conveyed to the public that Mr. Baron Cohen has endorsed their products and is affiliated with their business,” according to the complaint filed Monday. “To the contrary, Mr. Baron Cohen never has used cannabis in his life. He never would participate in an advertising campaign for cannabis, for any amount of money.” The billboard along a Massachusetts interstate highway was taken down in April, three days after Baron Cohen’s attorneys sent a cease-and-desist order to the dispensary, according to the suit. “Mr. Baron Cohen is highly protective of his image and persona, and those of his characters. Mr. Baron Cohen is very careful with the manner in which he uses his persona and his characters to interact with his fans and the general public,” the complaint says.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Wolf pups have been spotted again on Isle Royale, a hopeful sign in the effort to rebuild the predator species’ population at the U.S. national park, scientists said Monday. It’s unknown how many gray wolves roam the island chain in northwestern Lake Superior. The coronavirus pandemic forced cancellation of the census that Michigan Technological University experts had conducted each winter for 63 years. Remote cameras detected four pups on the park’s eastern end in January, the researchers said in a new report. The sightings, along with additional clues such as previously observed scats and tracks, suggest that two litters were born in the area last year and perhaps another on the western side. Park officials said last fall that at least two pups likely were born in 2019. The population was 12 to 14 during the last Michigan Tech survey in winter 2020. The latest births would indicate it is higher now, but some older wolves may have died. “It most likely will be winter of next year before we have firm information,” said Sarah Hoy, a research assistant professor and animal ecologist, adding that the presence of young wolves is reason for optimism. “Things are definitely looking up.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A St. Paul woman who says she was shot in the face with a projectile while protesting peacefully outside a Minneapolis police precinct after the killing of George Floyd has filed a federal lawsuit. Ana Marie Gelhaye says the shooting caused permanent injury to her eye. The suit alleges that police violated her constitutional rights, including First Amendment protections. “Making matters worse, no MPD officer rendered aid to Gelhaye after she was shot,” according to the suit. “Instead, several bystanders (who happened to be nurses/medical workers) provided immediate first aid on the street and then at Moon Palace Books, a store in the area, before rushing Gelhaye to Abbott Northwestern Emergency Department.” Medical professionals say in court documents that Gelhaye suffered iris and retinal trauma and other permanent damage, incurring expensive medical bills. Documents say she also experienced psychological damage, the Star Tribune reports. The Minneapolis city attorney declined to comment on the suit.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi State Department of Health is now blocking comments on its Facebook posts that relate to COVID-19 because of a “rise of misinformation” about the coronavirus and vaccinations, a health official said. “The comments section of our Facebook page has increasingly come to be dominated by misinformation about COVID-19,” state health department spokesperson Liz Sharlot said in a statement. She said allowing the comments that “mislead the public about the safety, importance and effectiveness of vaccination” is “directly contrary” to the state’s public health mission, which includes encouraging members of the public to be vaccinated against COVID-19, which has been recently making a resurgence in the state. Only about 31% of Mississippians have been fully inoculated, a statistic that has left it at or near the bottom of all U.S. states. The Department of Health posts multiple times each day on its Facebook page about COVID-19. Posts include information on numbers of new coronavirus cases, details on pop-up vaccination clinics and transportation services to vaccination clinics for homebound residents. Federal regulators have said the vaccines are safe and offer strong protection against contracting the potentially life-threatening disease.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson has signed into law the state’s first gasoline tax increase in decades. Longtime transportation funding advocate Parson signed the bill late Monday, spokesperson Kelli Jones said. He held ceremonial bill signings near Kansas City’s John Jordan “Buck” O’Neil Memorial Bridge and at other infrastructure projects in the state Tuesday. The law will gradually raise the state’s 17-cent-a-gallon gas tax to 29.5 cents over five years, with the option for buyers to get a refund if they keep track of their receipts. The first 2.5-cent increase is slated to take effect in October, which will bring the gas tax to 19.5 cents. The money will be used for Missouri’s roads and bridges. “Whether rural, suburban, or urban, all Missourians benefit from better roadways,” Parson said in a statement. Once fully implemented, the gas tax hike could generate more than $500 million annually for state, county and city roads. But it’s unclear how much of that money governments will get to keep after some people request refunds. Dan Mehan, the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s president and CEO, said bolstering infrastructure with money from the gas tax will help the state capitalize on its location to become a “logistics hub for the Midwest and North America.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal officials will give the public more time to comment on a contentious proposal to expand bison grazing on public lands in north-central Montana, officials said. The move comes after Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte criticized the Bureau of Land Management for holding just one virtual meeting on the proposal, which covers about 108 square miles south of Malta. Ranchers in the area have been resistant to plans by Bozeman-based conservation group American Prairie Reserve to assemble a 5,000-square-mile expanse of public and private lands that would hold at least 10,000 bison. John Mehlhoff, area director for the Bureau of Land Management, said the open comment period would be extended through Sept. 28 because of heightened interest in the proposal. The agency did not agree to Gianforte’s request for at least five in-person meetings in surrounding counties. It gave its preliminary approval of the proposal earlier this month and found the plan would not have a significant economic or environmental impact. Massive herds of bison once migrated through the area but were hunted to near-extinction in the 19th century. The American Prairie Reserve has been buying up ranchland in Montana since 2004. It owns 165 square miles and holds leases on about 500 square miles of state and federal land.\n\nNebraska\n\nMcCook: An 80-year-old woman was sentenced Monday to eight to 10 years in prison for the shooting death of her husband, who she said had abused her for years. Lavetta Langdon was sentenced after pleading no contest June 1 to manslaughter, KNOP reports. Police found the body of her 79-year-old husband, Larry Langdon, at their McCook home in August 2020. Court documents said Lavetta Langdon told investigators her husband had abused her for 30 years. An affidavit said she warned her husband she would kill him if he hit her again. She said on the day he died, her husband hit her in the face. She said considered killing him for 30 minutes, then shot him in the chest while he was sleeping, according to the affidavit. Langdon then called police.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Temperature records continue to tumble across all corners of the scorching state. Elko tied a record that stood for more than a century Monday when the 104 degrees Fahrenheit at Elko Airport equaled the old mark set in 1917. It was 104 in Tonopah, breaking the record of 102 set in 1990, and Reno tied the record of 104 set in 2005. Desert-Rock-Mercury north of Las Vegas set a new record Monday of 112, eclipsing the old mark of 111 set in 2003. The heat briefly gave way to thunderstorms late Monday and early Tuesday around Las Vegas, where the National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning around Valley of Fire State Park and areas south toward Lake Mead. About 7,500 homes in North Las Vegas lost power due to damage from high winds.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Auditors concluded that miscounts in an election were primarily caused by the way ballots were folded, according to a report released Tuesday. The Legislature mandated the audit, backed by lawmakers from both parties, after a losing Democratic candidate in a legislative race in the town of Windham requested a recount. That effort showed Republican candidates getting hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider claim of election fraud from 2020. Critics of the audit said before the report was finalized that they felt it had not gone far enough to find the source of the miscount. A team of auditors, however, “found no basis to believe that the miscounts found in Windham indicate a pattern of partisan bias or a failed election.” The town used a machine to fold the absentee ballots before sending them to voters. After they were returned, the ballots were fed into a counting machine. Because the folds on some ballots went through a Democrats name, either the ballot was not counted, or a vote was wrongly given to the Democrat. Auditors said the problem was most likely limited to Windham, a claim echoed by Secretary of State Bill Gardner.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAvalon: The mayor has ordered the closure of the boardwalk and beaches overnight due to large crowds and what he called “unsafe and disruptive behavior.” Avalon Mayor Martin Pagliughi’s executive order Friday continues the pandemic-related state of emergency restrictions blocking access to the beach from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. and closing the boardwalk between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m., the Cape May County borough said. Pagliughi said the order, which will remain in effect until further notice, is aimed at enabling local police “to disperse large groups of individuals who are congregating in unmanageable numbers on public property, which often results in unsafe and disruptive behavior.” “Recently, the beach and boardwalk have experienced vandalism to public property and excessive litter and debris created by large groups of individuals who congregate at night,” the mayor said. The mayor blamed what he called an “unfortunate measure” on state initiatives calling on authorities to issue warnings to juveniles and avoid jailing them except for serious offenses. Avalon Police Chief Jeffrey Christopher said the state directives bar police from doing anything other than issuing warnings for ordinance and disorderly persons offenses “even when alcohol or cannabis use or possession is involved.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A regulatory agency hopes to avoid a possible shortage by raising the number of marijuana plants that licensed producers could maintain. The Cannabis Control Division of the state Regulation and Licensing Department last week raised the previously planned per-grower limit of 4,500 plants to 8,000, and producers also would be able to apply for incremental increases of 500 with a total cap of 10,000, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. The change responds to concerns that the 4,500-plant limit would lead to a supply shortage, especially among patients in the state’s medical marijuana program. New Mexico’s legalization of possession and growth of small amounts of recreational marijuana took effect June 29, and the legal market for recreational marijuana is expected to launch in early 2022. The department has scheduled an Aug. 6 hearing on the program’s revised draft rules. The department has until Sept. 1 to finalize the rules for producers. Draft rules for manufacturing, testing and selling cannabis products have yet to be released.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The federal government’s count of the COVID-19 death toll in the state has 11,000 more victims than the tally publicized by the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, which has stuck with a far more conservative approach to counting coronavirus deaths. The discrepancy in death counts continued to widen this year, according to an Associated Press review, even as the Democrat has come under fire over allegations that his office purposely obscured the number of deaths of nursing home residents to protect his reputation. New York state’s official death count, presented daily to the public, stood at roughly 43,000 this week. But the state has provided the federal government with data that shows roughly 54,000 people have died with COVID-19 as a cause or contributing factor listed on their death certificate. “It’s a little strange,” said Bob Anderson, chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. “They’re providing us with the death certificate information, so they have it. I don’t know why they wouldn’t use those numbers.” The Cuomo administration’s count excludes people who likely died of the virus but never got a positive test to confirm the diagnosis. The gap has widened even as testing has become more widely available.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: A bug zapper that had the wrong kind of light bulb caused vision problems for five people at a veterans medical facility, a spokesperson said. Yves-Marie Daley from the Durham VA Health Care System said the bulb emitted light that was too strong, affecting the vision of three employees, a resident and a contractor who had a meeting near the device, The News & Observer reports. The people affected are healing, and their vision is improving, according to Daley. She didn’t specify the date of the incident or the severity of the vision loss. Bug zappers attract insects with ultraviolet light and then electrocute them, but the light usually isn’t intense enough to harm people. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says more powerful UV lamps – like those used as disinfectants against the coronavirus – can cause eye injuries and skin reactions similar to burns. The center opened an internal investigation and is evaluating other bug zappers for similar problems.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s trust fund for oil taxes is realizing hefty earnings due to a rebounding economy and better-than-expected stock investments, officials said Tuesday. Revenue from the Legacy Fund for the two-year budget cycle that ended last month was about $872 million, up from the $736 million that budget writers and the Legislature had forecast. “The stock market has rebounded from the initial COVID drop, and it has bounced back tremendously,” state Treasurer Thomas Beadle said. State Office of Management and Budget Director Joe Morrisette said nearly half of the extra revenue – $65 million – will be used to reimburse a constitutional fund that benefits schools but had been shortchanged in error for about a decade. Money from the Common Schools Trust Fund is distributed to North Dakota’s public schools. Voters in 2010 endorsed a constitutional amendment that requires setting aside 30% of state tax revenues on oil and natural gas production in the Legacy Fund, which is valued at about $8.8 billion. The most recent deposit into the fund was $45.5 million in June.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s elections chief on Monday referred for possible prosecution 117 apparent noncitizens who either registered to vote or cast a ballot last year – a tiny fraction of the state’s electorate and a significantly reduced number from two years ago despite record 2020 turnout. Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose said that of those, 13 cast ballots, and 104 registered but did not vote. They were identified as part of a routine review and referred to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. “The bottom line is this: Citizenship matters. It’s an important status that we should all treasure,” LaRose said at a Statehouse news conference. “With that comes the ability to be a voter. We want all Ohioans who are eligible to be able to cast a ballot, but certainly that means only citizens are able to do so.” Ohio has more than 8 million registered voters and does not allow noncitizens to register or vote. LaRose made a similar referral of 277 individuals to Yost after the 2018 election, including 77 who cast a ballot. Only a handful were ever prosecuted, according to data from the Franklin County prosecutor’s office. Ohio produced an extraordinary level of access in last year’s presidential election, setting records with nearly 6 million votes cast and a 74% turnout that tops the average of the past 20 years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Byron Berline, a renowned fiddler who played with superstars like Elton John and the Rolling Stones and owned a popular Oklahoma instrument shop, has died. He was 77. Bette Berline, Byron’s wife, said he was hospitalized after suffering a stroke, and on Saturday his “lungs gave up, and so did his heart.” Bette recalled her husband as a fun and loving father and husband, who until soon before his death looked and acted like a man 20 years younger. “He was more than a musician, an incredibly gifted musician,” she said. “He was a good, good man.” A three-time National Fiddle Champion, Berline grew up in Grant County along the Oklahoma-Kansas state line and worked with music greats like John, Vince Gill and Bob Dylan. The Stones recruited Berline for “Country Honk,” a country version of their “Honky Tonk Women,” based on Gram Parsons’ recommendation. Berline moved to Guthrie in 1995 and opened the Double Stop Fiddle Shop & Music Hall, which was destroyed by a fire in 2019. He later opened a new shop across the street.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: After 16 months of being closed to the public as a COVID-19 safety measure, Oregon’s Capitol building reopened Monday. The building’s closure has been a point of tension between Democratic and Republican lawmakers, as Republicans argued throughout the pandemic that everyone should have access to the Capitol. “Last March, we consulted with infectious disease doctors and public health officials about what changes were needed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the Capitol,” House Speaker Tina Kotek and Senate President Peter Courtney said in a joint statement Monday that announced the Capitol’s reopening now that more than 70% of the state’s adult residents have been partially or fully vaccinated. “In the end, we made the very difficult decision to limit Capitol entry to legislators, essential staff, and members of the press.” Republican legislators opposed closure of the Capitol, saying it is “the people’s building” and should be open to the public. In protest of the closure, some Senate Republicans routinely voted “no” on matters unrelated to COVID-19. In the House, Republicans refused to suspend rules that require bills be read in their entirety on final passage, slowing the pace of the session. Tensions boiled over in the community as well.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The centerpiece of Gov. Tom Wolf’s plan to fight climate change took another step Tuesday toward the final regulatory threshold to impose a price on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in the state. The Environmental Quality Board, composed primarily of Wolf appointees, approved the plan 15-4 to send it on to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission, which could take it up this fall. Wolf, a Democrat, wants to the plan to take effect next year as part of a multi-state consortium, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, that sets a price and declining limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. If Wolf is successful, Pennsylvania would become the first major fossil fuel state to adopt a carbon pricing policy. Heavily populated, fossil fuel-rich Pennsylvania has long been one of the nation’s biggest polluters and power producers. Opponents include coal- and natural gas-related interests, various business groups, and labor unions whose workers maintain power plants, build gas pipelines and mine coal. Wolf’s plan has drawn backing from environmental advocacy organizations and companies with solar, wind and nuclear power interests. Imposing a price on carbon emissions is projected to reduce air pollution and raise tens of millions of dollars annually for the state.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city on Tuesday joined a small but growing number of counterparts across the U.S. pledging to provide a guaranteed monthly income to a certain number of low-income residents. Under the Providence Guaranteed Income pilot program announced by Mayor Jorge Elorza and others, 110 city families living at or under 200% of the federal poverty level are eligible to apply for the opportunity to receive $500 a month for 12 months. The unconditional cash payments are intended to supplement, rather than replace, existing social safety net programs and can be used as the recipient sees fit, such as for unpredictable expenses, officials said. The $1.1 million to fund the program is coming from private and philanthropic sources, and no tax dollars will be used, Elorza said. “The global pandemic has highlighted the inequities of our social safety net and exacerbated the disparities of health and wealth that exist for Black, Indigenous, and communities of color,” Elorza said in a statement. “The best way to protect the longterm health and wellbeing of our communities is by providing direct financial assistance to our residents.” Similar programs in other cities have proven successful in improving the quality of life, health and education, said state Sen. Tiara Mack, D-Providence.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state now has the lowest rate of released inmates returning to prison within three years in the country thanks to an in-depth and expanding program of job and life skills, the state prison director said. Less than 22% of South Carolina inmates released in 2017 found themselves back in prison within three years, South Carolina Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling said at a Tuesday ceremony at one of the state’s reentry programs. That rate was 33% just before Stirling took over the prison system in 2013. The director said he went to a nearby Greyhound bus stop right after he was hired and was discouraged by what he observed. “I saw people leaving in prison uniforms – all we did was take the stripe off. They were just given a bag, a little bit of money and said ‘good luck,’ ” Stirling said. During the next eight years, Stirling made one of his chief goals giving inmates as much support as his agency can to make sure they can make it their last term behind bars. Inmates can learn a wide range of job skills from plumbing to carpentry and cooking to running a backhoe.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Family members of the man struck and killed by the state attorney general’s car are denying recent claims that Joseph Boever was suicidal. “I knew my cousin quite well, and he never mentioned suicide as any type of option to me,” said Victor Nemec, Boever’s cousin. On Friday, Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg’s defense attorney filed a motion to require the health care providers of Boever to release his psychiatric and psychological records and “information concerning his suicidal ideation,” according to the filing made with the Sixth Circuit Magistrate Court. The six-page document alleges a pattern of alcoholism and prescription drug use by Boever, who Ravnsborg struck the night of Sept. 12, 2020, while walking along South Dakota Highway 14 on the west outskirts of Highmore. That factored into a “broadening depressive streak” that led at least one family member to believe Boever died by suicide, the court documents said. But the victim’s cousin dismissed the allegation Monday afternoon. “If Ravnsborg is trying to claim that (it was suicide), that’s him and his defense grasping at straws,” Nemec said. All the physical evidence from the crash site and the report issued “prove” Ravnsborg was driving on the shoulder of the road at the time, Nemec said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Health will halt all adolescent vaccine outreach – not just for COVID-19 but for all diseases – amid pressure from Republican lawmakers, according to an internal report and agency emails. If the health department must issue any information about vaccines, staff are instructed to strip the agency logo off the documents. The agency will also stop all COVID-19 vaccine events on school property, despite holding at least one such event this month. The decisions to end vaccine outreach and school events come directly from Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey, the internal report says. Additionally, the health department will take steps to ensure it no longer sends postcards or other notices reminding teenagers to get their second dose of COVID-19 vaccines. Postcards will still be sent to adults, but teens will be excluded from the mailing list so the postcards are not “potentially interpreted as solicitation to minors,” the report says. These changes to Tennessee’s vaccination strategy, detailed in a COVID-19 report distributed to health department staff Friday and reiterated in a mass email Monday, will take effect just as the coronavirus pandemic shows new signs of spread in Tennessee. The average number of new cases per day has more than doubled in the past two weeks.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Abortion providers filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to block a new state law that would ban most abortions in Texas. Senate Bill 8, set to take effect Sept. 1, would prohibit abortions as early as the sixth week of pregnancy, before most women know they are pregnant. Between 85% and 90% of abortions take place after the sixth week, the lawsuit said. “If permitted to take effect, SB 8 will create absolute chaos in Texas and irreparably harm Texans in need of abortion services,” the lawsuit argued. The suit also took aim at the “unprecedented” method used to enforce the law – civil lawsuits filed by “any person” against somebody who provides an illegal abortion or “aids and abets” an abortion after the six-week limit. “SB 8 places a bounty on people who provide or aid abortions, inviting random strangers to sue them,” the lawsuit said, adding that the law would encourage “vigilante” enforcement, particularly by abortion opponents who could file a nearly endless stream of harassing lawsuits that could bankrupt providers. When Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB 8 into law May 19, abortion opponents hailed the measure as the nation’s most restrictive, serving as an example for other Republican-run states interested in testing the boundaries of Roe v. Wade.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Health officials announced Monday that the governor’s previous assertion that the state had reached its goal of vaccinating 70% of adults by the Fourth of July was false because of a data error. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox issued an apology to residents for the mistake Monday, about a week after he publicly celebrated Utah surpassing its goal of 70% of all adults getting at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The governor said the mistake was a result of “simple human error.” “We screwed up. And I sincerely apologize,” Cox wrote in an open letter. State health department statistics showed that 65.2% of adults had received one dose of the vaccine after the holiday weekend, but Cox wrote on Twitter that that did not include nearly 115,000 doses that had been given out by federal agencies, incorrectly bumping the percentage to 70.2%. Health officials said Monday that the department miscounted how the federally administered doses were categorized, which led to some single doses being counted multiple times. As of Monday, 67% of Utah adults had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. “While federal data sharing has been extremely difficult, this one is on us,” Cox said. “Our data team is devastated and embarrassed. And so am I.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city has launched a new workforce training program for future caregivers and nursing assistants to help fill a growing demand for those professions. Mayor Miro Weinberger said the pandemic showed the need for more caregivers and licensed nursing assistants, creating opportunities for many low-wage or unemployed workers looking for new skills. The “Moving On, Moving Up” workforce training initiative will offer 10 weeks of free, specialized training to 35 students. The program is a partnership among the city, the University of Vermont Medical Center, Cathedral Square and Ethan Allen Residence. “The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has made the essential nature of caregiving and health care services crystal clear,” Weinberger said last week when he announced the new program.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Business news network CNBC named Virginia this year’s “Top State for Business” on Tuesday, welcome news for Democrats who control state government and are defending their record during a critical election year. With previous wins in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2019, Virginia surpassed Texas for most years at the top of the ranking since CNBC debuted it in 2007, Gov. Ralph Northam’s office said in a news release. CNBC did not publish the rankings in 2020 because of the pandemic. “I could not be prouder of what this says about the inclusive, commonsense policies that we have put in place and how they encourage business investment,” Northam said, speaking at a news conference at the Port of Virginia with other Democratic elected officials. The network’s methodology scores the states in ten categories including infrastructure, workforce and education, “weighted based on how frequently the states cite them in their economic development marketing pitches.” In a new category called “Life, Health and Inclusion,” Virginia earned points for voting rights and anti-discrimination laws, areas that have seen sweeping change since Democrats took full control of state government in 2019.\n\nWashington\n\nEdmonds: New renovations will allow threatened salmon species to return to Lunds Gulch at Meadowdale Beach Park. After a decade of planning, construction has begun on renovations at the waterfront park to create a 1.3-acre pocket estuary that will bring back Chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as cutthroat trout, the Everett Herald reports. The centerpiece of the renovations is a five-span railroad bridge that will create a 90-foot opening for the creek to flow through. It will replace a 6-foot culvert – a hobbit-sized tunnel to the beach for visitors who make the trek down the ravine trail. Though the acreage is small, the project was a complicated and expensive affair involving a collection of state and federal grants. It also required a unique partnership with BNSF Railway, representing new possibilities in how to approach important habitats that butt up against railroads. All told, the bill will likely exceed $15 million. Less than half of that is funded by grants, with the rest coming from Snohomish County. Strider Construction of Bellingham won the bid for the work. The county estimates construction will be done by next spring. In the meantime, the beach is closed to the public.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Department of Education has a new program to encourage students, teachers and staff to get their COVID-19 vaccinations. The “I Got Vaxxed Competition” will award $5,000 each to a high school, a middle school and an elementary school for having the highest percentage of eligible people vaccinated, the department said in a news release Monday. The winners will be announced the week of Oct. 3. School participation is voluntary. “We know that students and staff lost so much more than instructional days during the pandemic, and this is just a way to try and restore some normalcy and recognize the importance of vaccinations,” state Superintendent of Schools W. Clayton Burch said. “Children need the benefits of a consistent school year to regain some of those lost experiences, which, in turn, support their social-emotional needs.” Students ages 12 and older and all teachers and staff are eligible for the vaccines.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A survey conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison has found 92.5% of incoming dorm residents will be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the start of classes this fall. Nearly 90% of UW-Madison’s dorm residents filled out the survey, providing a promising glimpse into how vaccination rates will look despite the University of Wisconsin System’s decision to strongly encourage, but not require, the shots. Another 3.2% of dorm residents said in the survey that they plan to get vaccinated once they arrive on campus. The university is still providing free, on-campus vaccination. “We’re pleased to see so many students choosing vaccination, which is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19,” said Jeff Novak, director of university housing. “Having a highly vaccinated community helps protect everyone, including those who cannot be vaccinated.” Dorm residents who chose not to get vaccinated will need to keep getting regularly tested for the coronavirus, first at move-in and then weekly for the rest of the semester. Testing is free for all UW-Madison students and employees. UW universities statewide have been leveraging the chance for students to get out of regular testing as one of several enticements to get as many students vaccinated as possible without a mandate.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A sheriff’s deputy helped rescue two women who were hanging onto tree branches after the inflatable raft they were in popped and sank in the North Platte River over the weekend. Five people were floating down the river Saturday when the raft was punctured, the Natrona County Sheriff’s Office said. None of them were wearing life vests. One person swam to shore, and two others made their way to an island. The other two grabbed tree branches near the island but could not pull themselves out of the water due to the swift current, steep bank and exhaustion, officials said. Deputy Dexter Bryant arrived first, followed by Sgt. Mark Bahr, who was downstream with a throw rope in case one of the women let go.

What it means for you.", "text": "In the most significant legal ruling against a major technology giant in more than two decades, a federal judge says Google illegally monopolized online search and advertising by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to install Google as the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nBy monopolizing search queries on smartphones and browsers, Google abused its dominance in the search market, throttling competition and harming consumers, U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta said in his 286-page decision. Google owes much of its more than $300 billion in annual revenue to search ads.\n\n“Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta wrote.\n\nThe massive win for the Department of Justice could fundamentally reshape how Google does business. It also could change how we use the internet and search for information.\n\nThe DOJ filed antitrust charges during the final weeks of the Trump administration, making good on Donald Trump’s pledge to challenge the runaway power of Big Tech. That mission continued during the Biden administration, which has been aggressive in pursuing antitrust cases.\n\n“This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “No company – no matter how large or influential – is above the law.”\n\nThe case is the most significant victory for the DOJ in a monopoly case in decades, said Notre Dame Law School professor Roger Alford, who served in the DOJ’s antitrust division. “Not since Microsoft lost in the 1990s have we seen a case of this magnitude.”\n\nGoogle said it would appeal the decision. “This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available,” Kent Walker, president of global affairs, said in a statement.\n\nShares in Google's parent company Alphabet slipped following the judge's ruling. They closed down nearly 5% Monday, part of a broader tech stock selloff.\n\nIf upheld, the decision will be a “major boost” for other antitrust cases pending against Google as well as other major tech players like Amazon, Apple and Meta, said Loyola University Chicago School of Law professor Spencer Weber Waller.\n\nMonday’s ruling did not include remedies. Remedies will be decided separately, likely after an appeal. One remedy could see Google losing its ability to strike device deals that have helped make its search engine so ubiquitous.\n\nDevising the right remedy is critical to restoring competition to the marketplace, Waller said.\n\n“There are no fines or monetary penalties in these types of cases, but the court will have to decide whether Google should be broken up in some way. More likely, it will order Google to eliminate the exclusive contracts and licensing restrictions that have reinforced its monopoly position for years,” he said.\n\nGoogle has argued that its distribution deals are common in the business world. It pays for its search engine to be on phones the way a food manufacturer pays to promote its products at eye level in a grocery store aisle.\n\nThe way Google sees it, if you don’t like Google, you can switch the default search engine on your device. But people don’t switch, Google says, because they prefer Google.\n\nIf Google was not the default search engine on so many devices, would consumers still use it for 90% of web searches?\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that Google’s unchallenged dominance created a “Google web.”\n\n“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,” Nadella said at one point in his testimony. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.”\n\nNadella has expressed concern that Microsoft’s disadvantage would increase as artificial intelligence becomes a major component of search.\n\nIn a research note Monday, Baird Equity Research senior analyst Colin Sebastian pointed to a range of tactics Google's arch-competitor Microsoft has used to grow the market share of its Bing search engine over the years, from paying users to use its search engine to embedding it in Office.\n\n“People clearly prefer Google to Bing,” Sebastian said.\n\nChamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said Monday's ruling hands Microsoft an unearned boost.\n\n“The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it’s Microsoft,” Kovacevich said in a statement. “Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today’s ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing. That’s a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it’s the best.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/tech/google-loses-eu-fine-appeal/index.html", "title": "Google loses appeal against record $4 billion EU fine | CNN Business", "text": "Google (GOOGL) suffered one of its biggest setbacks on Wednesday when a top European court fined it 4.125 billion euros ($4.13 billion) for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals, offering a precedent for other regulators to ratchet up pressure.\n\nThe unit of US tech giant Alphabet had challenged an earlier ruling, but the decision was broadly upheld by the Europe’s second-highest court in Wednesday’s ruling and the fine was reduced only modestly from 4.34 billion euros ($4.34 billion).\n\nIt is a record fine for an antitrust violation. The European Commission has imposed a total of 8.25 billion euros in antitrust fines on the world’s most popular internet search engine in three investigations stretching back more than a decade.\n\nThis is the second court defeat for Google which lost its challenge to a 2.42 billion euro ($2.42 billion) fine last year, the first of a trio of cases.\n\n“The General Court largely confirms the Commission’s decision that Google imposed unlawful restrictions on manufacturers of Android mobile devices and mobile network operators in order to consolidate the dominant position of its search engine,” the court said.\n\n“In order better to reflect the gravity and duration of the infringement, the General Court considers it appropriate however to impose a fine of 4.125 billion euros on Google, its reasoning differing in certain respects from that of the Commission,” judges said.\n\nGoogle, which can appeal on matters of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe’s highest, voiced its disappointment.\n\n“We are disappointed that the Court did not annul the decision in full.

Lawsuit claims it's intentional.", "text": "Emily Le Coz, USA TODAY and Johnathan Hettinger, Investigate Midwest\n\nPet owners paying for Advantage II and K9 Advantix II topical flea-and-tick treatments could have saved hundreds of dollars by now had they switched to the generic versions that first hit the market six years ago.\n\nBut first, they would have had to find them.\n\nCheaper equivalents for the blockbuster brands, which both kill and repel pests, have quietly eluded consumers for years. Even today, they’re nowhere to be found at many of the biggest pet specialty stores, like PetSmart or Petco. And they’re absent from popular online pet pharmacies like Chewy.com or PetMed Express.\n\nTheir elusiveness is not by accident, according to a federal lawsuit by one of the generic’s makers, but a scheme by the brand-name products’ company to block competition.\n\nFiled in the U.S. District Court in Northern California, the lawsuit by Tevra Brands offers a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse of the multibillion-dollar pet medication market, where a few major companies have a stranglehold on pricing. Tevra’s suit claims it lost tens of millions of dollars because Bayer Animal Health, a former subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical giant, conspired to maintain its monopoly over the treatment it created.\n\nTevra sells its generic topical treatments for cats and dogs on its website, on Amazon and elsewhere, but the company argues that Bayer prevented it from reaching pet owners where they’re most likely to shop and depriving them of a better deal.\n\nIts line includes TevraPet Activate II for dogs and ActiSpot II for cats, as well as Vetality Avantect II for dogs and Advotect II for cats. Its ActiSpot II six-dose treatment for large cats cost $30 on Amazon.com, as of May 15. The brand-name equivalent, Advantage II for cats, cost more than twice as much – $64 – on Chewy.com.\n\nUnlike the human pharmaceutical industry which abounds in cheap alternatives once brand-name patent protection expires, the pet med market offers relatively few choices.\n\nJust 14% of federally approved animal drugs have a generic version, according to the Generic Animal Drug Alliance. Meanwhile, generics in human health care last year accounted for 9 out of 10 filled prescriptions, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAmong the many reasons for the difference is that human health insurance requires generic drug substitution whenever possible, which has spurred the development and availability of low-cost alternatives. Pet insurance is nowhere near as widespread or influential.\n\nThat allows pioneer drug companies – those that own the brand-name or patented versions – to dominate much of the pet medication market. And industry insiders have long decried their outsize leverage through exclusivity agreements.\n\nSuch agreements block vendors – including pet stores, online pharmacies and wholesale distributors that supply retailers and veterinarians – from selling products that directly compete with their brand-name goods.\n\nTied to those deals are often lucrative financial incentives such as discounts and rebates that vendors can ill afford to turn down, especially if their rivals are taking advantage of them.\n\nIt’s ‘price-fixing in its purest form’\n\nExclusive dealing is a common and legal practice in many industries, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces consumer protection laws. The practice can encourage distributors and retailers to specialize in specific products and offer consumers related services and amenities.\n\nWhen big companies use them to choke rivals out of the market, however, the deals become unlawful and the FTC can intervene.\n\nThe agency has known about the dubious use of exclusivity deals in the pet medication market since at least 2012; industry stakeholders complained about it during a public workshop the FTC hosted that year “to examine competition and consumer protection issues in the pet medications industry.”\n\nA representative of the Generic Animal Drug Alliance told the agency she knew of at least two large drug companies whose agreements banned national distributors from carrying the generic versions, or any similar versions, of their brand-name products.\n\nThe alliance’s then-chairperson, Jennifer S. Johansson, said in a statement sent to the FTC that such deals limit the availability of generic treatments and drive up consumer prices. She didn’t name any companies.\n\nIn an email to USA TODAY, Vicky Graham, a spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment on whether the agency investigated any such complaints raised during or after the workshop. It appears, though, the FTC took no action; it deemed the evidence and effects of the agreements presented at the workshop contradictory, according to a staff summary report.\n\nThe report was published in 2015, just as Tevra Brands was being formed. Two years later, the Omaha, Nebraska-based startup says it learned for itself the effects of the agreements.\n\nIt’s “price-fixing in its purest form,” Tevra said in its complaint against Bayer, which it initially filed in 2019 and has amended twice. “The only losers in the deal were consumers who were forced to pay higher prices, generic manufacturers such as Tevra that were foreclosed from competition, and the rule of law as enshrined in the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act.”\n\nThe Sherman Act prohibits actual or attempted monopolization, as well as any contracts and conspiracies that result in the unreasonable restraint of trade. The Clayton Act bans certain discriminatory prices or services between merchants, as well as mergers and acquisitions that restrict competition.\n\nTevra claimed in its lawsuit that Bayer’s scheme cost it more than $76 million in net profits that it would have earned on the sale of those products from 2017 through 2021.\n\nBayer denied Tevra’s allegations in court filings. It said Tevra failed to make a case that Bayer intended to, or even succeeded in, blocking generics from the market. Bayer claimed that its agreements with distributors and retailers were legal and provided only “modest incentives” for exclusivity but did not require it.\n\nEven if the deals blocked Tevra’s generics from the online and brick-and-mortar pet specialty stores – which Bayer denied – Bayer said Tevra could still sell elsewhere, including directly to consumers on websites like Amazon, or through veterinarians.\n\nBut Tevra said in its lawsuit that it does not market its over-the-counter generics to veterinarians, most of whom prefer private-label brands. And its lack of name recognition makes direct-to-consumer sales difficult. Without access to the biggest pet retailers, the lawsuit said, Tevra's financial aspirations were dashed.\n\nBayer sold its entire animal health division in 2020 to Elanco, an animal health business spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., for $7.6 billion. Although Elanco is not named as a party in the lawsuit, it is now responsible for defending the case. It said in its latest Securities and Exchange Commission report in March that it intends “to defend our position vigorously.”\n\nUSA TODAY asked Elanco if the company has maintained any exclusivity agreements in effect at the time of the acquisition, but Colleen Dekker, a spokeswoman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Elanco’s attorneys did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nBayer’s parent company, Bayer AG, is no longer a party in the case, nor is its Bayer Healthcare subsidiary, both of which initially were named as defendants, along with its former animal health division. Bayer AG spokesman Philipp Blank had no comment other than to note the company’s lack of involvement.\n\nTevra did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Polsinelli Law Firm, which represents Tevra, said attorneys there are unable to discuss the lawsuit.\n\nThe case, which has survived several motions to dismiss, is still in the discovery and deposition stages. It could go to trial as early as July 2024.\n\n‘If I lose Bayer, I’ll get fired’\n\nEven before it won federal approval to sell its line of generics in May 2017, Tevra had hired a sales team to pitch it to major pet product distributors, retailers and e-pharmacies for pets.\n\nTevra had expected to sell nearly $10 million of the topicals the first year and projected steady annual sales revenues of nearly $30 million by 2019. Instead, it sold less than $600,000 worth in the first year as, one by one, distributors and retailers turned the company down, citing the “no generics” agreements with Bayer, its lawsuit claims.\n\nThat included at least two major national distributors: Veterinary Service and Animal Supply Company.\n\nIn March 2017, according to the lawsuit, a Veterinary Service representative told a Tevra salesperson they weren’t sure whether the “Bayer agreement” allowed them to purchase another product made with imidacloprid and would have to find out. Imidacloprid, an insecticide, is the key ingredient in both the brand name and generic versions of the flea and tick treatment.\n\nUltimately, the company chose not to purchase Tevra’s topicals.\n\nAnimal Supply Company “was even more explicit when its agent told a Tevra salesperson in March 2021 that they could not purchase ‘any products with Imidacloprid’ from Tevra because of an agreement with Bayer, and added ‘If I lose Bayer, I’ll get fired,’” according to the lawsuit.\n\nSimilar statements were made by representatives of PetMed Express, which owns 1-800-PetMeds; Drs. Foster & Smith, which is now Petco.com; and Chewy.com, the lawsuit said.\n\nA representative of Chewy.com told Tevra if they bought its imidacloprid generics, they’d forfeit a huge rebate from Bayer.\n\nWithout the rebate, the lawsuit said, Chewy.com, “would lose $3 million dollars in net margin taking into account the reduced Bayer rebate vs. what they thought they would make” selling Tevra’s imidacloprid products.\n\nAt least one national pet retail chain that bought Tevra’s products still got discounts from Bayer by agreeing not to say the generics “compared to” the brand name versions in store displays or on websites and advertisements, the lawsuit said. The discount applied not just to the spot-on treatments, but an entire bundle of Bayer products, including the popular Seresto flea-and-tick collar.\n\n“This restriction severely handicapped the sale of the generic Imidacloprid topical at Pet Supplies Plus,” Tevra said in its lawsuit.\n\nIn court filings, defendants dispute Tevra’s allegations that Bayer had a “no generics” agreement with retailers or that it used discounts to block generic competition.\n\nBayer’s marketing efforts “in no way point to the existence of an exclusive dealing arrangement, much less the who, what, where, and when of an extra-contractual conspiracy,” defendants said in a 2021 motion to dismiss the case. They described Bayer’s purchase agreements with retailers as being of “short duration and easy terminability.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the vendors cited in the lawsuit for comment. Petco.com and Chewy.com did not respond; PetMed and Animal Supply declined to comment.\n\nLoyal Burns, chief operating officer at Veterinary Service, said he doesn't recall Tevra Brands pitching its products and denied that his company ever had a “no generics\" agreement with Bayer.\n\nFlea-and-tick products market grows as Americans spend more on pets\n\nMore Americans own pets than at any time in recent history, and more of them treat their fur babies like members of the family. Nothing’s too good for Fluffy and Fido and, last year alone, we collectively spent $137 billion on them – from pet food and supplies to boarding and veterinary care.\n\nThat’s more than double spending from a decade ago.\n\nA sizable chunk went toward flea-and-tick treatments, according to the 2023-2024 American Pet Products Association’s National Pet Owners Survey. Roughly 6 in 10 dog owners use some form of flea-and-tick treatment, ranging from collars and shampoos to pills or spot-ons, for which they spent an average of $92 in the past year, the survey said.\n\nUsage was less common among cat owners – about 4 in 10 collectively spent an average of $76 over the same timeframe.\n\nThose numbers have climbed from the group’s previous survey. And there’s no slow down in sight, especially as veterinarians and public health officials push for more pets to use them.\n\n\"Preventing tick bites on people and pets is a critical issue,” said tick expert Thomas Mather, a professor of public health entomology at the University of Rhode Island. Mather added that protecting pets also protects humans from the many diseases these pests can carry.\n\nBut consumer surveys show that cost is the top reason people don’t protect their pets from fleas and ticks, Mather said. And cost can vary significantly depending on how the products are marketed and where they’re sold.\n\nCompanies typically develop different lines of the same product, each with a different price: a generic line that offers the best value; a brand-name line that’s modestly priced; and an exclusive veterinary line that’s more expensive, according to the lawsuit and industry experts.\n\nNovartis said its generic topical was blocked, too\n\nVeterinarians have long relied on product sales for a significant chunk of income, and for many years, they were often the sole supplier of such treatments. Vets used to be able to mark up prices by as much as 100%, said John Volk, a senior consultant for Brakke Consulting focusing on the animal health industry.\n\nOnline and retail competition has cut into that markup, though. The industry standard for flea-and tick-treatments today is about 65%, according to the American Animal Hospital Association.\n\nMost people, Mather said, \"want to buy the less expensive product they think is the same.\"\n\nBut while generics offer the best bang for the buck, exclusivity deals have interfered with their widespread availability. Even big pharmaceutical firms have been thwarted in efforts to get their generics to the masses.\n\nNovartis, itself a major drug company, couldn’t overcome the exclusivity deals it blamed for dooming one of its generic pet medications, its then-Animal Health Division Vice President Clinton Vranian said at the 2012 FTC workshop.\n\nVranian, who did not name the branded product or its generic equivalent, said the generic was more effective than the brand name version and well-received by veterinarians, but distributors wouldn’t touch it.\n\nNovartis achieved just 1%-2% market penetration in the drug’s launch, Vranian said.\n\nEli Lilly and Co., the pharmaceutical giant that used to own Elanco, acquired Novartis in 2015.\n\nElanco’s spokeswoman at the time revealed the generic product as Parastar Plus, a flea-and-tick treatment that directly competed with the brand name version, Frontline, then owned by Merial, according to a story by VIN News Service, which serves the veterinary industry.\n\nThe spokeswoman, Christina Diane Gaines, told the news service that Elanco itself does not use blocking agreements.\n\n“Elanco believes competition drives innovation in the industry, which results in greater customer benefit,” the article quotes Gaines as saying. “Our product strategy is focused on investing in innovation over restrictive contracts.”\n\nElanco’s current spokeswoman, Colleen Dekker, declined to answer a question from USA TODAY about whether the company still eschews such agreements.\n\n“Because this is part of pending litigation,” Dekker said, “we don’t have any further comment beyond what’s in our legal documentation.”\n\nGenerics give consumers ‘lower prices and more choices’\n\nNot all flea-and-tick treatments are the same.\n\nProducts like Frontline Plus, whose active ingredient is fipronil, are effective at killing fleas, ticks and lice only after they’ve bitten pets. Treatments made with imidacloprid, like K9 Advantix II, not only kill, but repel the parasites, making them more effective at preventing the spread of flea-and-tick-borne diseases.\n\nBy the time Tevra came along, the market for fipronil-based topical treatments was saturated. Frontline, first introduced in 1997, faced a host of generic competition starting in 2011 and, by 2018, had lost more than half its market share, according to Tevra’s lawsuit.\n\n“The results of generic Fipronil topicals entering the separate market for Fipronil topicals have been more competition against Frontline, lower prices, and more choices for retailers and consumers in that market,” Tevra’s lawsuit said.\n\nTevra decided to introduce its own line of fipronil-based generic topicals, which includes Vetality Firstect Plus and TevraPet FirstAct Plus, from which it anticipated modest revenues. But, according to the lawsuit, it believed its biggest moneymaker would be in the imidacloprid market, where, at the time of the company’s founding, only one line of treatments was available: Bayer’s.\n\nTevra hoped to capture a large chunk of the untapped market – with earnings potentials 10 times greater than that of its fipronil line – by being one of the first to roll out a generic equivalent.\n\nWhen another company with the same plan, CAP IM Supply, introduced its generic line a few months before Tevra, in January 2017, Bayer sued for patent infringement. The parties settled two years later.\n\nAs part of that settlement, CAP IM Supply had to pay Bayer royalties on its generic products, which allowed Bayer to maintain a monopoly of the imidacloprid-based topical flea-and-tick market, Tevra’s lawsuit said, since it earned money from both its brand-name line and the generic equivalent.\n\nBecause Tevra’s formulation differs from the patented version, the lawsuit said, it does not infringe on Bayer’s patents.\n\nHow the Brown Shoe case factors into flea-and-tick treatments\n\nThe outcome of the case likely will hinge on which side’s definition of the “relevant market” prevails, said R. Mark McCareins, a clinical professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management who spent three decades litigating antitrust cases for a global law firm.\n\nTevra’s lawsuit defined the relevant market as one that includes only topical, squeeze-on flea-and-tick treatments whose active ingredient is imidacloprid.\n\nSeveral product lines fit that definition, most notably: Bayer’s brand-name Advantage and Advantix series, now owned by Elanco; the generic Advecta and PetLock series for which CAP IM Supply pays royalties; and Tevra’s Activate, ActiSpot, Avantect and Advotect products, which have struggled to gain a foothold.\n\nBayer made roughly 85% of all sales in that market in 2018 and earned patent license royalties for most of the other 15%, Tevra said in its lawsuit, arguing that Bayer effectively had monopolized the market.\n\nOther generic imidacloprid topicals also are now on the market, but are equally absent from major pet specialty stores and online pharmacies. They include, PetArmor Max, Adventure Plus for Dogs and Amazon Basics Flea, Tick & Mosquito Topical.\n\nBut Bayer argued the market encompasses all flea-and-tick treatments regardless of insecticide or delivery method. That includes fipronil topicals like Frontline, as well as shampoos and collars, Bayer said.\n\nIn that case, Bayer said, the brand name Advantage and Advantix products represent a fraction of the market and its contractual agreements did nothing to block Tevra from fairly competing.\n\nCourts determine a product’s relevant market based on which other products consumers would reasonably consider a substitute for it. And within that market may exist separate submarkets, which courts determine by considering things such as the product’s “peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors,” according to the landmark antitrust case, Brown Shoe v. United States.\n\nThe Brown Shoe case, in which the government sought to block the merger of two of the nation’s then-biggest shoe manufacturers and retailers, set the standard for this process more than 60 years ago and is still used today.\n\nBoth sides cited Brown Shoe in various court filings.\n\n“If Bayer is able to convince the court that its broader market definition conforms better to the legal requirements – set forth first before (the U.S. Supreme Court) in a case called Brown Shoe in 1962 – then Bayer is a likely winner in the case,” McCareins said. “Alternatively, through the same type of evidence, if the plaintiff prevails in its narrow market definition, then the odds shift in its favor.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

The last ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWhen Christine Martinez found out last month that Kroger and Albertsons planned to merge in a deal worth nearly $25 billion, she thought, “here we go again.”\n\nMartinez lost her job as a pharmacy technician in the aftermath of a prior supermarket mega-merger: Albertsons’ $9 billion tie-up with Safeway in 2014.\n\nThat deal has since become a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when two supermarket giants merge. Now the fallout from that troubled transaction hangs over this latest, even bigger merger proposal. The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday afternoon to scrutinize the potential impact of the Kroger-Albertson merger.\n\nBack in 2014, Martinez was working for a subsidiary of Safeway in Valencia, California.”It was a really great company,” she said. “Morale was very high. They cared about our needs. We could depend on our paychecks.”\n\nBut things changed after Albertsons and Safeway joined together.\n\nTo win approval for the deal from antitrust regulators, Albertsons and Safeway agreed to sell 168 of their stores to buyers approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The companies’ divestiture plan addressed the FTC’s competition concerns in communities where the two chains had overlapping stores, which would have given the new company a dominant market share.\n\nWith the FTC’s blessing, Haggen, a small supermarket chain in the Northwest with just 18 locations, bought 146 of the former Albertsons and Safeway stores, including the one where Martinez worked.\n\nHaggen went bankrupt soon after buying Albertsons and Safeway's divested stores. Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nProblems emerged quickly.\n\nHaggen overhauled the Valencia store and changed the branding and labels. Sales slowed and the company raised prices. The company cut hours and laid off employees. Workers began getting paid every other week, instead of weekly.\n\n“Tensions with Haggen were at an all-time high,” Martinez said. “I think about how hard it was on my family. It brings me back to a time I don’t like to remember.”\n\nMartinez’s store closed. She and dozens of her co-workers lost their jobs.\n\nHer store wasn’t the only location that Haggen struggled to manage. The grocer expanded more than eight-fold essentially overnight, and couldn’t absorb the stores it acquired.\n\nLess than a year later, Haggen filed for bankruptcy and closed some locations. In an weird twist, Albertsons bought back dozens of the same stores it previously sold to Haggen in bankruptcy court — at a lower price.\n\nMartinez found a new job as a pharmacy technician at a Ralphs supermarket, owned by Kroger.\n\nNow she worries Kroger will divest Ralphs as part of its merger with Albertsons in a repeat of the Haggen 2015 deal.\n\n“It brought back a lot of fear and anxiety,” she said. “My co-workers are feeling anxious. They’re hearing that Kroger is going to have to divest. Everyone is worried it will be their store.”\n\nUnintended consequences\n\nThe Albertsons-Safeway merger and subsequent Haggen bankruptcy show that divestitures and other concessions required to gain FTC approval sometimes fail. And while these remedies are designed to promote competition, they can have unintended consequences.\n\n“It was a belly flop,” said Robert Feinstein, a corporate restructuring attorney who represented Haggen’s unsecured creditors during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIn fact, current FTC chair Lina Khan has been skeptical of divestitures as an effective tool to promote competition. She has even criticized the FTC’s handling of Albertsons’ deal with Safeway, pointing to it as a prime example of the limitations of divestitures.\n\nIn a 2017 law review article she wrote prior to working at the FTC, Khan said the agency’s approval of the divestiture to Haggen was “[hard] to fathom” and a “spectacular” failure.\n\n“Even a casual observer could have predicted that Haggen would have great difficulty expanding its storefronts,” Khan said. “The skeptics have been proven right.”\n\nIt was the “cruelest of ironies and a stinging rebuke to the FTC” that Albertsons bought back some of the Haggen stores from the bankrupt company, she added.\n\nKroger and Albertsons say their merger, which they expect to complete in 2024, will help them compete against larger chains and benefit shoppers, workers and local communities.\n\nThe two companies believe they have a “clear path” to gain regulatory approval, they added.\n\nKroger wants to merge with Albertsons to better compete against larger chains. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n“We expect to make store divestitures in certain areas, and we will work cooperatively with the FTC to obtain clearance for the transaction,” Kroger finance chief Gary Millerchip said on a call with analysts last month.\n\nTo address antitrust concerns that the merger will stifle competition in local markets where they overlap, Kroger and Albertsons plan to divest stores.\n\nOne way they may do this is by creating a new, standalone company comprised of between 100 and 375 of their current locations. This new entity would be spun off to Albertsons’ shareholders.\n\nThe new company would become an “agile competitor with quality stores” with strong management. “We think it’s a really clean option in the sense that it could potentially be a faster way to package up the strategy around divestitures,” Millerchip said.\n\nBut it’s not yet clear if the stores to be divested can be viable in the cutthroat grocery industry.\n\nIf the those locations are weak, or unloaded to a buyer that can’t handle them, it could be a repeat of Haggen’s swift collapse, antitrust experts warn.\n\n“The big question the FTC should ask is how is this different than what they promised before,” said Christine Bartholomew, who teaches antitrust law at the University of Buffalo School of Law.\n\nKroger and Albertsons say they must get bigger to compete against larger chains. But it’s unlikely that a new, smaller spinoff could successfully handle those same challenges, she said.\n\nDave Durflinger, city manager of Carpinteria, California, said the FTC can’t afford to get it wrong. Supermarkets are economic anchors in small towns, and support hundreds of jobs. Closures can lead to severe gaps in food access.\n\nDurflinger knows that all too well. In 2015, Haggen bought a Vons grocery store (owned by Safeway at the time) in Carpinteria as part of the Albertsons and Safeway divestitures.\n\n“Things went south right away. Shelves were scant. They just weren’t able to keep up,” he said. “It stopped being an attractive store in short order.”\n\nThe store closed within months, which “created a lot of anxiety in the community,” he said.\n\nAnother chain bought the closed Haggen location out of bankruptcy and has since turned it around. But the experience, Durflinger said, “illustrates just how vulnerable small communities are to mergers and losing economic vitality.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/09/22/overcharged-for-chicken-scam-chicken-class-action-lawsuit-settlement/5810320001/", "title": "Chicken class action lawsuit: How to claim money in massive ...", "text": "If you purchased chicken in the last decade, you could be entitled to some money back.\n\nA $181 million settlement is pending in the Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation, a class-action lawsuit that alleges price-fixing within the poultry industry.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the defendants and “their co-conspirators conspired to restrict the supply of, and fix, raise, and stabilize the price of chicken, as of January 1, 2009, in violation of federal and state consumer and antitrust laws.”\n\nTo be eligible to receive money, you need to have purchased fresh or frozen raw chicken between January 2009 and Dec. 31, 2020, and submit a claim form at Overchargedforchicken.com.

WALKER and RALPH D. RUSSO\n\nAP\n\nThe NCAA lost another legal battle Friday as a federal judge barred the organization from enforcing its rules prohibiting name, image and likeness compensation for recruits by granting a preliminary injunction demanded by the states of Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nIt was another blow to the NCAA's ability to govern college sports and more than 500,000 athletes.\n\nGabe Feldman, a sports law professor at Tulane, said an act of Congress might save the NCAA even as he noted this was just a preliminary injunction in one district court with the NCAA expected to appeal. That would go to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overseeing Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan.\n\n“There’s no question the NCAA has never faced more attacks from different areas at one time,\" Feldman said. “And things are snowballing. And I think that’s why there are so many serious discussions about how college sports needs to change and what those changes will look like.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Clifton Corker in the Eastern District of Tennessee issued the injunction that undercuts what has been a fundamental principle of the NCAA's model of amateurism for decades: Third parties cannot pay recruits to attend a particular school.\n\nThe judge wrote the NCAA's stance likely violates antitrust law with Congress so far unwilling to give the association an exemption. The judge said athletes with a limited window are hurt by not being able to know their true value before committing to a school.\n\nThe decision led to questions about whether boosters will suddenly open the floodgates with offers to potential recruits. Oklahoma State athletic director Chad Weiberg said the Cowboys had anticipated the decision but “we are awaiting further guidance from the Big 12 Conference and NCAA.”\n\nThe NCAA said it would review the ruling and talk with its member schools about possible policy changes. But the NCAA said turning rules supported by its members “upside down” will only make an already chaotic situation worse and lessen protections keeping athletes from being exploited.\n\n“An endless patchwork of state laws and court opinions make clear partnering with Congress is necessary to provide stability for the future of all college athletes,” the NCAA said in its statement on the same day NCAA President Charlie Baker discussed the situation on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I think in the end, we are going to need Congress to do something,” Baker said. “Because people will draw a lot of conclusions from court decisions. And then there will be new ones.”\n\nHelen Drew, a professor of sports law at the University of Buffalo, said Baker is not identifying any specific bill for Congress. She also said this all is accelerating quickly after the NCAA did virtually nothing for years.\n\n“Why have they not been addressing this?” Drew said. \"The model’s falling apart.’”\n\nThe attorneys general of Tennessee and Virginia filed a federal lawsuit on Jan. 31 challenging the NCAA’s NIL rules after it was revealed the University of Tennessee was under investigation for potential infractions.\n\nThey argued that since the NCAA lifted its ban on athletes being permitted to cash in on their fame in 2021 recruits are factoring in NIL opportunities when they choose a school — decisions that should not be limited. The judge noted the NCAA's contention that allowing so-called NIL collectives — business entities backed by boosters — to strike deals with recruits would eviscerate the difference between college athletics and professional sports.\n\n“While the NCAA permits student-athletes to profit from their NIL, it fails to show how the timing of when a student-athlete enters such an agreement would destroy the goal of preserving amateurism,” the judge wrote.\n\nCorker has made clear he believed the states are likely to prevail in the long run.\n\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said the injunction ensures athlete rights will be protected from the NCAA's “illegal NIL-recruitment ban.” He said the bigger fight continues.\n\n“We will litigate this case to the fullest extent necessary to ensure the NCAA’s monopoly cannot continue to harm Tennessee student-athletes,” Skrmetti said. \"The NCAA is not above the law, and the law is on our side.”\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares called the injunction a significant ruling for athletes who deserve the freedom to negotiate and benefit as the NCAA and its member schools earn millions.\n\n“It’s only fair that they have more freedom over what they earn,\" he said. \"The NCAA has taken advantage of talented young athletes for too long.”\n\nJoshua Lens, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas and former college athletics administrator, called this lawsuit and the judge's order very specific. Lens said the NCAA still can enforce its other NIL rules. Whether this becomes a national precedent depends on the NCAA's response.\n\nThe NCAA already is not enforcing certain transfer rules after a federal judge's ruling in December.\n\n“I think the NCAA is just going to pause for a minute on trying to enforce the so called NIL recruiting ban,” Lens said.\n\nThe injunction helps the University of Tennessee, which is facing an inquiry by the NCAA into possible recruiting violations. University officials declined to comment Friday but its chancellor revealed Jan. 30 in a scathing letter to Baker that the association was alleging Tennessee violated NIL rules through deals made between athletes and a booster-funded NIL collective that supports Volunteers athletes. Donde Plowman called it “intellectually dishonest” for NCAA staff to pursue infractions cases as if students have no NIL rights.\n\nThe NCAA’s authority to regulate compensation for athletes has been under attack from a variety of avenues and its legal woes are growing.\n\nThe Tennessee case is one of at least six antitrust lawsuits the NCAA is defending as it also asks for antitrust protections from Congress. A National Labor Relations Board official ruled in early February that members of the Dartmouth men’s basketball team are employees of the school and could vote to form a union, which the players plan to do.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Cliff Brunt, John Zenor, Mark Long, Ben Nuckols and Hank Kurz contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2021/12/20/mlb-sued-by-4-former-affiliates-over-minor-league-cuts/49553247/", "title": "MLB sued by 4 former affiliates over minor league cuts", "text": "AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Four minor league teams that lost their big league affiliations before the 2021 season have filed an antitrust lawsuit against Major League Baseball, using a law firm that has represented players’ unions.\n\nParent companies of the Staten Island Yankees, Tri-City Valley Cats, Norwich Sea Unicorns and Salem-Keizer Volcanoes filed suit Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, accusing the baseball commissioner’s office of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nMLB ended the Professional Baseball Agreement that governed the relationship between the majors and minors in late 2020, after minor league seasons were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.

There’s a lot here, numbers that will make your eyes glaze and dollar figures that will make your head spin, but don’t worry too much about that. Nobody told you there’d be math, and we’ll keep it to a minimum, but there’s an old saying: Math is logical.\n\nThe NCAA, sadly, is not.\n\nThe NCAA, a group started in good faith in 1906 to oversee college sports, lost its way along the way as the money grew and problems rose and doing the right thing, every time, became too damn difficult. For years the NCAA has done the right thing only when convenient, much like its largest college sports programs, who have too much money at stake — too many high-paying jobs in too many wood-paneled, brass-trimmed offices — to do the right thing simply because it’s the right thing.\n\nAll that history, all that arrogant incompetence from the NCAA and condescending greed from the leaders in this Darwinian clubhouse — what we call the Power 5 conferences — has led us to the point of chaos and the brink of destruction of college sports. But the survival instinct is strong among schools in the SEC, Big Ten and Co., and the obeisance is disgusting in the NCAA offices staining the White River in Downtown Indianapolis, so here we are:\n\nThe NCAA is on the verge of settling the landmark House vs. NCAA anti-trust lawsuit — a lawsuit filed after decades of condescending greed and arrogant incompetence — with a final bill projected in the range of $2.8 billion, according to reporting from Yahoo! Sports.\n\nHow it started: Federal judge's ruling puts billions at stake for NCAA\n\nThe class-action lawsuit has thousands of plaintiffs and three types of damages, with the overwhelming majority of damages tied to broadcast revenue attributable to Power 5 football and men’s basketball. Although two other categories of damages are involved (video game NIL and third-party NIL), reporting from Yahoo! Sports and ESPN show the damages are largely connected to revenue from media agreements. According to expert witness testimony in case filings, approximately 90% of the value of those media agreements is attributable to football and men’s basketball, which means an overwhelming majority (roughly 90%) of damages will be paid to Power 5 athletes.\n\nThose athletes have asked for their fair share of the revenue long denied them — all that TV money, not to mention the Name, Image and Likeness revenue generated when someone like Tim Tebow or Joe Burrow or Bryce Young shows up in a video game but it’s Florida, LSU and Alabama who cashed the checks.\n\nYou can imagine the cost for the NCAA and its 60 or 70 largest sports programs to pay up to 90% of $2.8 billion. It would be fair but financially crushing, and if there’s one thing we know about the largest schools in college sports, it’s this: They’re not interested in being financially crushed.\n\nLucky for them, the NCAA isn’t interested in being fair.\n\nSo how to pay off 90% of $2.8 billion?\n\nSend a bill or withhold significant future revenue distributions to the Mid-American Conference and the Horizon League. And the MEAC and Patriot League and all of the 27 conferences that make up the 32-league NCAA — the Power 5, and the Other 27 — and ask those 27 smaller leagues, whose former student-athletes account for a tiny fraction of the plaintiffs in the House class action, to pay nearly $1 billion of the total bill.\n\nMath is hard, but logical. Find a calculator, or just trust me on this: The other 27 conferences are not responsible for 60% (or even half of that) of the damages; 10% of $2.8 billion is $280 million. That’s what the Other 27 ought to be asked to pay.\n\nBut the NCAA, along with the Power 5, want the Other 27 to pay closer to $990 million. And that’s not even the full amount due. More on that in a minute.\n\nJust know this: If the NCAA and Power 5 aren’t stopped, that miscarriage of justice will happen in the next few days.\n\nSettlement negotiated in secret\n\nThe math gets wonky. Let’s put a few more numbers here for history’s sake, for future generations searching the Internet for evidence that we tolerated something as self-serving as this version of the NCAA. And understand, these numbers aren’t guesswork or spin. They come straight from a communique from the NCAA to each of its 32 conferences, hard evidence that was followed by a conference call to drive home the point that, yes, that communique was real.\n\nFirst, the background. That proposed settlement you read, where the Other 27 are being asked to pay nearly $1 billion, was negotiated over the past several months in private. In secret, even. The principal players at the negotiating table were representatives of the NCAA and the Power 5.\n\nGuess who wasn’t included?\n\nThe Other 27.\n\nThose smaller leagues — places like the Big Sky, Ohio Valley and SWAC — didn’t find out about the proposed settlement, and their nearly $1 billion contribution, until about two weeks ago. After the deed was all but done.\n\nWhen does the deed become done? As early as this week. The NCAA’s Board of Directors meet Tuesday. The Board of Governors are expected to meet Wednesday. Unless you get angry enough, by Thursday morning the 27 most vulnerable leagues in the NCAA, servicing most of the country’s college athletes — but without the head-spinning greed of the Power 5 — will be on the hook for more than 35% of that $2.8 billion, when the equitable amount is closer to 10%.\n\nThe NCAA is settling House, rather than fighting, because the NCAA (and Power 5) hold a losing hand. Should this go to court, the NCAA has told its members, the final cost could be as large as $20 billion — payable immediately. The settlement of $2.8 billion would be paid out over 10 years. Punishing, yes, but otherwise the NCAA might have to file for bankruptcy. You think the era of NIL and the transfer portal have led to chaos in college sports? Hold my beer, says an NCAA mired in bankruptcy court.\n\nLots of numbers and legal gobbledygook, I know. Here’s just a little more of each from that settlement negotiated by the NCAA and Power 5, and that four-page communique distributed last week to the Other 27, that must be included for a more complete understanding:\n\n>> The proposed settlement starts with the NCAA agreeing to pay 41% of the $2.8 billion — roughly $1.15 billion — from its general operational expenses. Sounds OK? It’s not. That 41% of this settlement, that $1.15 billion hit, taps deep into the NCAA reserves and would impact all NCAA members with cuts to national office programs and services, meaning the Other 27 being hammered right off the top for a class-action lawsuit where the biggest winners among the plaintiffs will come from the Power 5.\n\n>> The other 59% of the $2.8 billion — roughly $1.65 billion — would come through withheld NCAA Division I revenue.\n\nWhat the NCAA and Power 5 propose to do with that 41% of the settlement isn’t fair to the Other 27, but their plan for the rest of the settlement — the other 59%, or $1.65 billion — is diabolical. The NCAA and Power 5 are proposing a 60-40 split on that $1.65 billion, with the Other 27 footing the bill for 60% — $990 million — and the Power 5 responsible for the other 40% ($660 million).\n\nThe NCAA and Power 5 are hiding behind numbers, mainly this one: The Other 27 conferences, with close to 300 schools total, receive approximately 60% of total NCAA revenue distributions. The Power 5 receives the other 40%. Ergo, by the NCAA’s sense of fair play, the Other 27 should pay 60% of that $1.65 billion.\n\nI know, lots of numbers. Just remember this one: 10%.\n\nThat’s how much of the proposed $2.8 billion settlement will likely be earmarked for athletes from Other 27 schools.\n\nIn sum: Other 27 conferences pay 60% of $1.65 billion, not to mention a share of the $1.15 billion mentioned in the first bullet-point, despite having athletes who stand to earn roughly 10% of the $2.8 billion settlement.\n\nHow could the NCAA ask that with a straight face? This is how: For years the NCAA has faced the existential threat of the schools from the Power 5 — the SEC, Big Ten, ACC, Big 12 and whatever’s left of the Pac-12 — breaking away, forming a quasi-NCAA of its own and pocketing all that TV revenue for itself.\n\nWith annual football and basketball coaching salaries soaring toward $10 million and athletes now earning huge sums of NIL funds — and most of those coaches and athletes coming from Power 5 schools — the pressure is on the Power 5 to keep as much of that TV revenue as possible.\n\nWhich means the pressure is on the NCAA — which employs lots of nice people in nice offices who drive nice cars to their nice homes — to appease the Power 5.\n\nThe Other 27?\n\nCollateral damage.\n\nCan IU Indianapolis, Indiana State survive this without cutting sports?\n\nSchools in the Power 5 are all but printing money thanks to TV and other media contracts, to say nothing of the revenue coming from all those big-time football games. Schools from those leagues are making so much money, they’ve agreed since 2022 to pay 10 different (former) football coaches a combined $176 million just to get rid of them. Those buyouts are happening at football schools huge (Texas A&M is paying $76 million to Jimbo Fisher) and modest (IU football is paying $15.5 million to Tom Allen).\n\nPower 5 schools can afford that, just as they’ll find a way to afford whatever hit is coming from House vs. NCAA.\n\nThe other 27? They’re lost. The proposed $2.8 billion settlement, with so much of it being asked of the Other 27, will come down to at least $2 million to $3 million a year across those conferences for the next 10 years. For the next decade, that would whittle $20-30 million from conferences and schools like IUPUI and Valparaiso, Evansville and Indiana State.\n\nThere’s no more fat to be cut from athletic programs like those, and very little muscle. Next to go will be bones — scholarships being eliminated for young men and women at most places, outright sports being cut at others.\n\nAll because the NCAA, and Power 5, want the Other 27 to subsidize a settlement weighted heavily — 90% to 10% — toward plaintiffs from Power 5 schools.\n\nThis is neither right nor fair. It’s the Power 5 making up the rules as they go along, and it’s the NCAA doing what the NCAA has done for decades — cowering to schools like Ohio State and Texas, and taking it out on the likes of Southern Indiana and Purdue Fort Wayne.\n\nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/greggdoyelstar.\n\nMore: Join the text conversation with sports columnist Gregg Doyel for insights, reader questions and Doyel's peeks behind the curtain.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2014/08/08/ed-obannon-antitrust-lawsuit-vs-ncaa/13801277/", "title": "Judge releases ruling on O'Bannon case: NCAA loses", "text": "Steve Berkowitz\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nA federal judge ruled Friday that the NCAA's limits on what major college football and men's basketball players can receive for playing sports \"unreasonably restrain trade\" in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nU.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken, in a 99-page ruling in favor of a group of plaintiffs led by former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon, issued an injunction that will prevent the NCAA the \"from enforcing any rules or bylaws that would prohibit its member schools and conferences from offering their FBS football or Division I basketball recruits a limited share of the revenues generated from the use of their names, images, and likenesses in addition to a full grant-in-aid.\"\n\nAlthough Wilken's ruling could enable football and men's basketball players to receive more from schools than they are receiving now, Wilken imposed some limits and she rejected the plaintiffs' proposal that athletes be allowed to receive money for endorsements. \"Allowing student-athletes to endorse commercial products would undermine the efforts of both the NCAA and its member schools to protect against the 'commercial exploitation' of student-athletes,\" she wrote.\n\nWilken said the injunction will not be stayed pending any appeal of her ruling, but it will not take effect until the start of the next Football Bowl Subdivision and Division I basketball recruiting cycles. So, at the earliest, the first group of recruits to be affected by the ruling likely would be those entering school in 2016.\n\nWilken's ruling said the NCAA will be able to cap the amount of new compensation that Football Bowl Subdivision and Division I men's basketball players can receive while they are in school, but that cap will not be allowed to be an amount that is less than the athletes' cost of attending school. (It is widely acknowledged that the NCAA's current version of a scholarship — which basically comprises tuition, room, board, books and manadatory fees — does not cover costs of attendance like transportation and various incidental expenses. In the wake of Thursday's Division I NCAA Board of Directors vote approving autonomy for the Power Five conferences, cost of attendance scholarships might not be far off anyway.)\n\nThe ruling also will allow schools and conferences to deposit money in trust for football and men's basketball players that will become payable when they leave school or their eligibility expires. Under this setup:\n\n•The NCAA will be allowed to set a cap on the amount of money that may be held in trust, but that cap cannot be less than $5,000 in 2014 dollars for every year the athletes remain academically eligible.\n\n•Schools will be allowed to offer less than the NCAA maximum amount if they so choose, but they cannot unlawfully conspire with each other in setting the amounts they offer.\n\n•The NCAA will be allowed have rules that prevent the athletes from using the money being held in trust for them to obtain other financial benefits while they are in school.\n\n•The NCAA also will be able to have rules that prevent schools from offering different amounts of deferred money to athletes who are in the same recruiting class on the same team.\n\n•The amounts that schools decide to place in trust for the athletes may vary from year to year.\n\n\"We disagree with the Court's decision that NCAA rules violate antitrust laws,\" NCAA Chief Legal Officer Donald Remy said in a statement. \"We note that the Court's decision sets limits on compensation, but are reviewing the full decision and will provide further comment later. As evidenced by yesterday's Board of Directors action, the NCAA is committed to fully supporting student-athletes.\"\n\nKevin Sweeney, legal counsel for the Big 12 Conference, called Wilken's verdict a \"thoughtful and narrow and focused ruling.\"\n\n\"We will have to carefully evaluate this to figure out how we comply with this ruling,\" Sweeney said. \" ... We will move forward with promoting the collegiate amateur model. … (Wilken) doesn't throw out the collegiate amateur model.\"\n\nMichael A. Carrier, a Rutgers-Camden law school professor and antitrust expert, told USA TODAY Sports: \"I think for the NCAA, this is a huge loss because for the first time you have a court looking at its prized defenses, things like amateurism and competitive balance, and saying this is not persuasive.\n\n\"This has to be viewed as a significant win for the plaintiffs and significant loss for NCAA.\"\n\nAlthough the case did not include a financial damages component, Wilken wrote that the plaintiffs \"shall recover their costs from the NCAA.\"\n\nIn a filing in late May related to the settlement of claims against video game manufacturer Electronic Arts and Collegiate Licensing Co., the nation's leading collegiate trademark licensing and marketing firm, plaintiffs' lawyers noted that in the O'Bannon antitrust case against the NCAA, the amount of the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees \"exceeds $30 million and expenses exceed $4 million\" — and that was a few weeks before the start of a trial that lasted three weeks.\n\nThe NCAA is almost certain to appeal Wilken's ruling, which may have an impact on another set of antitrust cases that are before her.\n\nIn those cases, two sets of plaintiffs are challenging the NCAA's limits on what athletes can receive under and athletic scholarship. One of those cases — which is against the NCAA and 12 Division I conferences — seeks monetary damages based on the difference between the value of an athletic scholarship as currently defined by the NCAA — tuition, mandatory fees, room, board and books — and the actual cost of attending college, a figure that includes out-of-pocket costs such as transportation to and from school. The damages in that case, which would be tripled under antitrust law, could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars if the plaintiffs prevail.\n\nThe NCAA and the conferences must give Wilken their responses or motions to dismiss the suits by Aug. 20.\n\n\"I think it's a fantastic win for the student-athletes, and it's rare that you have victories against the NCAA and victories in this type of antitrust case but I think it shows the facts were clear that there was an unfairness here,\" said Robert Carey, the attorney for Arizona State and Nebraska quarterback Sam Keller, who sued in a separate case focusing on college sports-themed video games.\n\n\"I think there are more fights that are going to occur here, but this is a very important victory for the student athletes. You can't say otherwise. You just can't.\n\n\"She found that it was unfair and that the student-athletes were entitled to have some of the restrictions the NCAA was imposing struck.\"\n\nO'Bannon called the ruling \"a game-changer for college athletes.\"\n\n\"From the outset when I saw my image being used as a character in a video game, I just wanted to right a wrong,\" O'Bannon said in a statement. \"It is only fair that your own name, image and likeness belong to you, regardless of your definition of amateurism. Judge Wilken's ruling ensures that basic principle shall apply to all participants in college athletics.\"\n\nMichael Hausfeld, the lead attorney for the O'Bannon plaintiffs, said in statement Friday night he is \"gratified with the court's decision. It demonstrates conclusively that the NCAA's standard affirmative defenses, such as amateurism or competitive balance, cannot be used to justify naked restraints on competition for college athletes. This was a hard-fought case and the athletes justifiably prevailed; the decision sets a major precedent for future disputes regarding the NCAA's recruiting restrictions.\"\n\n\"This is a major step toward decency for college athletes,\" Bill Isaacson, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"The judge's decision strikes down NCAA rules restricting their compensation and permits reasonable but significant sharing with athletes — both for the costs of education and to establish trust funds — from the billions in revenues that schools earn from their football and basketball players.\"\n\nFormer Arizona linebacker Jake Fischer, one of the O'Bannon plaintiffs, told USA TODAY Sports: \"It's a big step in helping out with basically student-athlete rights. It's getting things moving in the right direction.\"\n\nFischer, who works for Primerica Financial Services in Tucson with plans to become an investment adviser, praised the NCAA's recent decision to provide unlimited meals to athletes.\n\n\"The food they're now feeding athletes is a huge step forward,\" he said. \"I was a huge advocate of that.\"\n\nIn a critical part of the ruling, Wilken found that television networks \"often seek to acquire the rights to use the names, images and likenesses of the participating student-athletes during the telecast.\"\n\nShe rejected the contention of the NCAA and its TV expert — former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson — that broadcasters \"need not acquire the rights to use student-athletes' names, images, and likenesses and that the primary reason they enter into licensing agreements with event organizers is to gain exclusive access to the facility where the event will occur.\"\n\nTo succeed in the case, the plaintiffs had to show there was a bona fide TV market for their names and images. Absent such a market, they could make no claim that they are being denied compensation for the use of their names and images.\n\nWilken wrote that Pilson's testimony \"is not convincing.\"\n\nShe cited provisions from CBS' 1994 and 1999 NCAA basketball tournament contracts in supporting the plaintiffs' contention. She also cited language from the TV contract for 2007, 2008 and 2009 Bowl Championship Series games, which \"provides that the event organizer will be solely responsible for ensuring that Fox has 'the rights to use the name and likeness, photographs and biographies of all participants, game officials, cheerleaders' and other individuals connected to the game.\"\n\nEqually significant, in examining whether the NCAA's limits on what athletes can receive while playing sports constitute a restraint on competition, Wilken cited the trial testimony not only of the plaintiffs' main economics expert, Roger Noll, but also that of the NCAA's economics expert, Daniel Rubinfeld.\n\n\"Dr. Noll's opinions are consistent with the opinions of the NCAA's own economic expert, … who testified that the NCAA operates as a 'joint venture which imposes restraints' on trade,\" Wilken wrote. \"Dr. Rubinfeld specificallu acknowledged that 'the NCAA does impose a restraint, the restraint we have been discussing in this case.\"\n\nWilken wrote that she \"rejects\" the testimony and theories of another NCAA economic expert, Lauren Stiroh, who had testified that the plaintiffs could not show the athletes were being harmed. \"The evidence …demonstrates that student-athletes themselves are harmed by the price-fixing agreement\" among the schools, Wilken wrote.\n\n\"A lot of this lawsuit seemed to be about fairness,\" Carrier said. \"It didn't seem right that the players' images were used and they were not able to be paid for it at the same time that coaches are making millions of dollars, there are brand new facilities. … Those athletes today will feel like justice is done.\"\n\nContributing: Rachel Axon, George Schroeder", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/08"}]}

Jeff Landry on June 19.\n\nThe law, the first such legislation in the nation, is already being challenged by parents and several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union. They say the measure is unconstitutional and filed a lawsuit against it on Monday.\n\nBut while Louisiana has drawn national attention by passing the law, it’s not the first to attempt it.\n\nOver decades, more than a dozen states have tried similar bills, including Kentucky’s landmark Stone v. Graham case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980. Here are a few examples:\n\nWhich states have tried – or are trying to pass – Ten Commandment bills?\n\nKentucky: 'Durable, permanent copies'\n\n◾ State law passed: June 1978.\n\n◾ What did the law say? A \"durable, permanent copy\" of Ten Commandments \"shall be displayed on a wall in each public elementary and secondary school classroom in the Commonwealth.\"\n\n◾ Reason for the law: A note on copies of the commandments read: \"The secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\"\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Voluntary contributions.\n\n◾ Law status: A Kentucky state trial court and the state supreme court upheld the law. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against it in a 5-4 decision in November 1980.\n\nOklahoma: 'One of the foundations of our nation'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 22.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? All public classrooms in Oklahoma would be required “clearly display a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: \"The Ten Commandments is one of the foundations of our nation,\" said Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, the bill’s sponsor. \"Publicly and proudly displaying them in public school classrooms will serve as a reminder of the ethics of our state and country.\"\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Not specified.\n\n◾ Bill status: Referred to the state's Appropriations and Budget Education Subcommittee on Feb. 6, where it remains.\n\nArizona: 'We have taken the Ten Commandments away from our schools'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 22.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? The measure adds the Ten Commandments to a list of historical documents that “a teacher or administrator in any school in this state may read or post in any school building.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: \"The progressive slide down in our country right now is because we have taken the Ten Commandments away from our schools,\" said bill sponsor Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, during a Feb. 22 Senate floor session.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: Not specified.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies: Not specified.\n\n◾ Bill status: The bill passed the Senate on Feb. 21 and the House on April 2. Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure on April 16.\n\nUtah: 'It is a very historical document'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 15.\n\n◾ What the bill says: As originally filed, the measure would have required schools to post a framed copy or a poster of the Ten Commandments in “a prominent location” in every building.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: “The Ten Commandments, while it is a religious document, is a very historical document in that it colored the way our founders wrote the Constitution, wrote the Declaration (of Independence),” said Rep. Michael Petersen, R-North Logan, the bill’s sponsor.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies: Schools would be required to “accept and display a donation of \"The Ten Commandments\" if a copy is not already on display.” No money was appropriated in the bill.\n\n◾ Bill status: The measure was changed in February. The requirement to post the Ten Commandments was dropped, but the commandments and the Magna Carta were added to a list of historical documents that educators have the option to use in curricula. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed the bill on March 20. It’s scheduled to take effect on July 1.\n\nTexas: 'The importance of a fundamental foundation of America'\n\n◾ Bill passed: April 20, 2023.\n\n◾ What did the bill say? The measure would have required Texas classrooms to display a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments “in a conspicuous place” in every classroom.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: Sponsor Republican state Sen. Phil King, said it would help restore lost religious liberties and remind students “of the importance of a fundamental foundation” of America, reported CNN.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: At least 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Public funds or private donations.\n\n◾ Law status: The Texas House did not vote on the bill before a deadline, in effect killing it.\n\nSouth Carolina: 'Shall display in a conspicuous place'\n\n◾ Bill passed: May 16, 2023.\n\n◾ What did bill law say? Each public elementary, middle school, and secondary school in South Carolina “shall display in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: The measure was sponsored by Republican representatives Thomas Beach, 10th District; Donald McCabe, 96th District; and Joseph White, 40th District.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Public funds or private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? The bill was referred to the House Committee on Education and Public Works where it remains.\n\nMonuments have also been challenged...\n\nOklahoma: 'Symbol of historic significance for Oklahoman and American history'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 30.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? A state senator introduced the bill to return a privately funded, 6-foot-tall, 2,000-pound red granite monument bearing Ten Commandments to the Oklahoma State Capitol “as a symbol of its historic significance for Oklahoman and American history.” The monument, installed in 2012, was ordered removed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 2015 because it was religious in nature and violated the state constitution’s prohibition on using state funds or property to promote religion.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: The bill’s sponsor, Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, said Oklahoma has a strong Christian heritage and it’s important to honor it. Bullard said a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling favoring a high school football coach who prayed on the field after each game would help the bill become law.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: Not applicable.\n\n◾ Who paid for the monument: Privately funded.\n\n◾ Bill status: The measure was not assigned to a committee and was declared dead on March 1.\n\nArkansas: 'An important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system'\n\n◾ Law passed: April 7, 2015.\n\n◾ What did the law say? The measure called for “the placing of a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol,” with design and site selection later determined.\n\n◾ Reason for the law: The Ten Commandments are “an important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system of the United States of America and of the State of Arkansas,” the bill said.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments monument size: The 6-foot-tall granite monument weighed three tons.\n\n◾ Who paid for it? Private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? The monument was placed at the state capitol in June 2017 but was knocked over and broken by a protester in a car a day after installation. A replacement was installed in April 2018.\n\n◾ Law status: A lawsuit challenging the monument on First Amendment grounds of separation of church and state was later filed. A federal judge will decide if the case should be decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court.\n\nNew Mexico: 'A historical perspective'\n\n◾ Monument installed: 2011.\n\n◾ Why? The city council of Bloomfield, New Mexico, approved installing a Ten Commandments monument in front of city hall in 2007. Other monuments, including those for the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Gettysburg Address, were installed later.\n\n◾ Reason: Bloomfield City Manager Eric Strahl said the monuments had nothing to do with religion. “It’s the Ten Commandments from a historical perspective,” he said.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments monument size: The 5-foot-high stone monument weighed 3,400 lbs.\n\n◾ Who paid for it? Private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? A lawsuit was filed against the monument on First Amendment grounds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled in November 2016 that the monument violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and ordered it removed.\n\n◾ Monument status: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October 2017, in effect letting the appeals court ruling stand.\n\nWhere else have Ten Commandments displays been disputed?\n\nOhio, 2019: A middle school in New Philadelphia removed a 1920s-era plaque that contained the Ten Commandments after objections from the Freedom From Religion Foundation on grounds of separation of church and state in 2019.\n\nTennessee: 2004: Rutherford County was sued by the ACLU for displaying the Ten Commandments in the lobby of a county courthouse. A judge ordered their removal, but a county sheriff was allowed to keep them in his office.\n\nMississippi, 2003: A Senate bill that would have allowed the Ten Commandments to be displayed on school district properties across the state was introduced in 2003. It later died in an education committee.\n\nAlabama, 2003: A federal appeals judge ordered the removal of a 2.5-ton Ten Commandment monument from the state's Judicial Building grounds after ruling it violated the Establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIndiana, 2002: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Gov. Frank O'Bannon on the proposed installation of a 7-foot monument bearing the Ten Commandments on statehouse grounds. That let stand an appeals court decision that prohibited the monument.\n\nContributing: Barbara Hoberock, The Oklahoman\n\nSource: USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Reuters; Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute; supreme.findlaw.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/19/ten-commandments-required-louisiana-classrooms-law/74150508007/", "title": "Ten Commandments to be required in Louisiana classrooms under ...", "text": "Louisiana public schools will now be required to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom, following a new law signed on Wednesday by Republican Gov.

Jeff Landry signed it last month. They argued the requirement was unconstitutional and violated Supreme Court precedent that upheld separation of church and state.\n\nThe defendants – Louisiana State Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, members of the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, and five school boards – agreed to hold off on placing Ten Commandments posters in classrooms before Nov. 15. The listed state education officials will also not \"promulgate advice, rules, or regulations regarding proper implementation of the challenged statute\" until then, the agreement filed in U.S. District Court for Middle District of Louisiana said.\n\nBut Louisiana Attorney General spokesperson Lester Duhé told USA TODAY the Jan. 1 deadline for all schools to hang the posters still applies. He added the defendants agreed to the delayed implementation to allow time for the trial and decision.\n\nLouisiana's new law, drafted by Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton and signed by Landry, also a Republican, mandates a poster-sized display of the religious rules in “large, easily readable font” for kindergarten classrooms up to state-funded universities.\n\nOn Friday, Horton told the USA Today Network: \"I'm confident we will prevail in court.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John deGravelles's order said he will set a hearing Sept. 30 with a ruling expected by mid-November.\n\nLouisiana Ten Commandments law draws national spotlight\n\nThe new law has drawn intense national interest and attention, including from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who voiced his support last month both in a social media post and during a campaign speech.\n\n“Has anyone read the ‘Thou shalt not steal’? I mean, has anybody read this incredible stuff? It’s just incredible,” Trump said at the Faith & Freedom Coalition Conference. “They don’t want it to go up. It’s a crazy world.’’\n\nBut others say the mandated displays will negatively impact students.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments displays required under state law will create an unwelcoming and oppressive school environment for children, like ours, who don’t believe in the state’s official version of scripture,\" the Rev.

More than a dozen states have attempted similar bills over decades.\n\nIn 1978, Kentucky lawmakers passed a bill requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public elementary and secondary school classroom. A Kentucky state trial court and the state supreme court upheld the law, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against it in a 5-4 decision in November 1980.\n\nIn Arizona, a bill was introduced earlier this year that would have added the Ten Commandments to a list of historical documents that “a teacher or administrator in any school in this state may read or post in any school building.” The bill passed the state Senate on Feb. 21 and the House on April 2. Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure on April 16, writing: \"Not only do I have serious concerns about the constitutionality of this legislation, it is also unnecessary.\"\n\nContributing: George Petras, Savannah Kuchar and Darren Samuelsohn, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/20/louisiana-ten-commandments-poster-classrooms-trump/74159730007/", "title": "Ten Commandments in Louisiana schools is fine – as long as they ...", "text": "Louisiana’s governor signed a law requiring a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom in the state, something I’m completely fine with as long as those posters say, in large font along the top: “The Ten Commandments, Most of Which Donald Trump Has Violated.”\n\nThat seems fair, and I would be comfortable with students of any age walking into a classroom and receiving a daily lesson on the meaning of hypocrisy.\n\nThe Republicans who pushed for this law, which makes Louisiana the only state to mandate Ten Commandments posters in schools, seem laser-focused on history and accuracy. They describe the commandments as “a historical document.” And after signing the legislation, Gov. Jeff Landry said: “If you want to respect the rule of law, you’ve got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses.”\n\nOkey doke. Let’s go with that. Because respecting the rule of law matters. And if we’re respecting the rule of law, I’m sure Gov. Landry would agree it would be educational malfeasance not to inform Louisiana students that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and former president – a man Landry himself has enthusiastically endorsed – has broken a slew of the laws outlined on their classroom poster.\n\nAny 10 Commandments poster should note the ones Trump violated\n\nThe law requires that the Ten Commandments posters be “at least eleven inches by fourteen inches,” and that the “text of the Ten Commandments shall be the central focus of the poster or framed document” and be “printed in a large, easily readable font.”\n\nAnd again, that’s all completely fine with me, as long as there are notes on the poster or on an accompanying poster that detail the ways Trump has violated certain commandments.\n\nTrump's violent speech:Trump, MAGA supporters' violent rhetoric isn't a glitch. It's a feature.\n\nFor example, per the language mandated by the state of Louisiana: “Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.” Trump has previously dropped “g--damn” in his rally speeches.\n\nAfter the then-president dropped a couple of GD bombs in 2019, Trump supporter and evangelical adviser Rev. Robert Jeffress of Texas told The Washington Post: “I certainly do not condone taking the Lord’s name in vain. There is a whole commandment dedicated to prohibiting that. I think it’s very offensive to use the Lord’s name in vain.”\n\nTrump isn't exactly poster boy for church-going or adultery-avoiding\n\nNext up on the commandments poster is: “Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.”\n\nTrump rarely goes to church, and on this Easter Sunday he posted this decidedly non-holy screed on social media: “HAPPY EASTER TO ALL, INCLUDING CROOKED AND CORRUPT PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES THAT ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO INTERFERE WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2024, AND PUT ME IN PRISON, INCLUDING THOSE MANY PEOPLE THAT I COMPLETELY & TOTALLY DESPISE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY AMERICA, A NOW FAILING NATION, LIKE ‘DERANGED’ JACK SMITH, WHO IS EVIL AND ‘SICK.’”\n\nThe “Thou shalt not commit adultery” line on the classroom poster will require a substantial asterisk, as Trump was recently convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair.\n\nTrump has a lengthy history of rumored dalliances that go along with his three marriages. And the infamous Access Hollywood tape, recorded a few months after he married his current wife, Melania, caught him commenting on a nearby actress: “I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful – I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.”\n\nNow Trump is apparently Jesus?Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus. Which Bible is she reading?\n\nTrump Ten Commandments definitely don't say a thing about stealing\n\nLouisiana students who look up from their desks and see “Thou shalt not steal” in large, easily readable font should certainly know that their governor’s pick to be president of the United States was, in 2019, ordered to pay $2 million in damages for using money from his own charity to pay off business debts and buy a painting of himself.\n\nHe has also been indicted for allegedly stealing classified documents, something thou should definitely not do.\n\nAnd then there’s this foundational rule Landry and Louisiana’s Republican lawmakers rightly believe all students, regardless of faith, apparently, should abide: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.”\n\nPut more succinctly: Don’t lie.\n\nIf students of the Bayou State who gaze upon their government-mandated Ten Commandments poster are going to see that warning to “not bear false witness,” it is only fair that every remaining square inch of every classroom wall be devoted to detailing the multitudinous lies Trump told throughout his one-term presidency and the entire 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nMaybe a photo of Trump will cancel out the 10 Commandments poster\n\nThe ACLU has said that it will sue Louisiana over the Ten Commandments law, writing on social media: “Public schools are not Sunday schools.”\n\nThat’s true. But I feel like we can avoid the courts if Louisiana simply abides by my idea of Trump-splaining to all students how often the avatar of the Republican Party violates those sacrosanct rules.\n\nEither that or each classroom should also have a poster-sized picture of Trump. That would likely cause the Ten Commandments posters to burst into flames.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, June 20th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, Louisiana becomes the first state to require the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms, plus, how some lawmakers are introducing a slew of bills honoring Donald Trump. And we look at how hundreds of public officials in swing states have undermined or cast out on elections.\n\n♦\n\nLouisiana Public schools will now be required to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom following a new law signed yesterday by Republican Governor Jeff Landry. It's the first state to take such action and Louisiana's legislation mandates a poster-sized display of the religious rules in large, easily readable font for kindergarten classrooms up to state-funded universities starting in 2025. In the Christian and Jewish faiths, God revealed the Ten Commandments to the Hebrew prophet Moses. Civil rights group ACLU and its Louisiana chapter, along with Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religious Foundation announced they would file a lawsuit to challenge the law requiring the commandments be displayed.\n\nMeanwhile, other measures would authorize the hiring of chaplains in school, restrict teachers from mentioning sexual orientation or gender identity, and prevent schools from using a transgender student's preferred name or pronouns unless granted permission by parents. The governor also signed bills that would expand tutoring for underperforming students, help improve math skills, and place fewer curriculum mandates on teachers.\n\n♦\n\nRepublicans have introduced a flurry of bills to honor former President Donald Trump in the heat of this year's presidential campaign. I spoke with Dan Morrison, a deputy editor in USA TODAY's Washington bureau for more. Dan, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDan, let's just start here. You wrote about several bills that Republicans are pushing to honor former President Donald Trump. I want to start with the $500 bill, interesting stuff here. How did GOP lawmakers want to involve Trump on this?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nWell, Paul Gosar, who's a firebrand Republican from Arizona and a firm supporter of the former president, has put forward a bill to reissue the $500 bill, which hasn't been in circulation for nearly 80 years, and to boot former President William McKinley from the $500 bill and place Donald Trump on there.\n\nHe acknowledges the symbolic nature of this bill and says what he really wants to do is draw attention to inflation in the US under the Biden administration, and this is his way of doing so. Others might say he's also doing it to draw Trump's attention to his own fealty.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd, Dan, there are also efforts to get Trump the Congressional Gold Medal. Can you just remind us what is this medal and why do some Republicans argue Trump deserves it?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThe Gold Medal is just that, a gold medal that the US Congress can bestow onto eminences of different kinds. The hook here is his foreign policy successes while in office, the key one being mentioned by the representative from Florida who proposed it being the Abraham Accords, which was a number of peace agreements between Israel and different Arab states.\n\nIt's another way of members of Congress trying to bring Trump to the fore in what's proving to be a very hot election year. That's an effort by a Paulina Luna of Florida to have the former president receive this absolutely bipartisan prize that is usually awarded to non-controversial eminences by the US Congress.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd we're also hearing about a push to try and rename a major US airport after Trump. What do we know here, Dan?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nDulles International Airport, it's a major airport in the Washington DC area named for a former Secretary of State, there's been a push to make that the Donald Trump International Airport. Like these other proposals, it's bound to fail, but it raises the proposer's profile in Trump world and maybe helps feed the constituents back home, something to chew on.\n\nAirports are hard to rename. Ronald Reagan didn't get an airport named after him until nearly 10 years after he left office, and he was a very popular president who won two elections by very wide margins.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you mentioned, Dan, these gestures do seem largely symbolic. I am curious what the greater significance is here and what lawmakers functionally are aiming to get out of these pushes for these bills?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThe congressional record is thick with symbolic measures, symbolic bills, symbolic resolutions. There are 435 members of Congress and they all have people back home they want to recognize. They have veterans, they have local service organizations that they want to talk up and get them entered into the record.\n\nWhat's different here is that Donald Trump's a former president and he's a candidate for president and he's a convicted felon. And all of that's happening at once in this supercharged atmosphere in which he remains the absolute undisputed kingpin of the Republican Party. And so according to a former Republican member of Congress, this is a good way to catch his eye and let him know that you're thinking of him and supporting him.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd finally, are we hearing from Democrats at all in response to this flurry of bills?\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nFutile symbolism goes both ways. After the proposal to rename Dulles International Airport, the Democrats put forward a proposal to rename a federal prison near Miami for Donald Trump, as a sort of jab at the three remaining criminal indictments he faces in addition to his conviction on fraud charges in New York.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Dan Morrison is an editor in the Washington bureau. Thanks for your time, Dan.\n\nDan Morrison:\n\nThanks for having me. Take care.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. missed a deadline last night to meet criteria set by CNN to participate in this year's first presidential debate. Conditions included appearing on enough state ballots to potentially win the presidency and also garnering at least 15% of voter support in four separate national polls. Kennedy had received at least 15% and only three accepted polls to date, and by CNN's count had qualified for the ballot in just six states, not enough to win the presidency.\n\nKennedy had argued the TV network's standards were being applied unfairly. His campaign asked that the Federal Election Commission take action and keep CNN, President Joe Biden, and former President Donald Trump from holding the June 27th debate unless it makes changes. CNN previously said only Biden and Trump had met its conditions to take part ahead of last night's midnight deadline.\n\n♦\n\nMore than 300 public officials in five swing states have undermined or cast doubt on elections. I spoke with USA TODAY Democracy Reporter Erin Mansfield to learn more. Erin, thanks for hopping on.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, let's just start here, what is this new study and what did it find as it pertains to these officials and elections?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nAn organization called Public Wise, they advocate on a representative democracy, they're a little bit left-leaning. They created an index that they call Election Threat. They also use the term \"election denier.\" And basically they looked at people who may have cast doubt on the 2020 election, maybe they cast doubt on 2022. Maybe they have a role where they certify votes and they voted against it, although a lot of these people are state lawmakers who signed on to legislation that the organization says would be anti-Democratic would alter an election outcome.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So you mentioned this a bit, but who exactly are these officials and are there any names or positions that stood out to you?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThere are officials 334 in five swing states, all the big swing states except Nevada. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Wisconsin, over 300 of them. They range from the lieutenant governor of Georgia all the way down to some local officials in Detroit and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThey all have varying amounts of power over elections. There are these canvassing boards in Michigan where one of the members, who's a Republican in the Detroit area, says he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election. Well, that man is going to need to vote to certify the 2024 election, so that's something that this group says they're sounding the alarm on.\n\nThere are two folks in North Carolina in the Charlotte area who voted against certifying a separate election. Now certifying an election is very much just an administrative sign-off. \"Hey, we had 354 votes and then we did our count and we had to count the provisional and we got one more. Now let's certify it.\" And that's it. But prior to 2020, it had really never been a controversial process the way it is now.\n\nAnd so what you have here are folks who served as fake electors. The lieutenant governor in Georgia was a fake elector in that state for Donald Trump. One of the folks on the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which elections for that state, was a fake elector in 2020. So what you have are a lot of people with doubts about whether it's the 2020 election or various elections, and they're in positions of power to influence elections.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAre officials mentioned in this study responding at all to it?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nI reached out to anyone we mentioned and I was not able to get a response. In general, I would say the Republican Party, they have put what they call election integrity front and center on their agenda this year. It's a big thing, you hear Trump talk about it. The local Republican Party in North Carolina, where those two folks I mentioned are located, said it's something that ensures the people's will is accurately reflected. And some people have qualified what they've said in other interviews, but unfortunately, no, they didn't talk to me. I always wish they would.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin, for folks wondering what's the big deal here, how worrying is this really for this fall's election?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nWe at USA TODAY, we've been monitoring all kinds of changes that are happening to voting processes and election law because what happened in 2020 was really unprecedented. We're watching to see what might happen in 2024. And what we're definitely seeing and what the study really proves is that you have people in influential election roles in influential states who are casting some of the same kind of doubts you might've heard from members of Congress or the former president.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin Mansfield covers democracy for USA TODAY. Thanks as always, Erin.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nResearchers have discovered a rare genetic trait that could delay the onset of Alzheimer's in people who face an overwhelming risk of developing the mind-robbing disease. A study published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that 27 people from an extended Columbian family who carried a genetic variant called Christchurch, developed Alzheimer's disease several years later than expected. The findings build on early research in 2019 from a unique family predisposed to pass on the disease. The researchers found that a woman who had the same genetic trait delayed the onset of Alzheimer's by about three decades. Scientists from Mass General Brigham believed the evidence could be used to develop an Alzheimer's drug that replicates the protective effects of the Christchurch genetic variant. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nMeteorologists warned yesterday that an ongoing heat wave scorching parts of the country is expected to intensify in the coming days, potentially breaking records and impacting more than 135 million people. According to AccuWeather, from the Ohio Valley, to the Mid-Atlantic, to New England, temperatures will reach the 90s and some places could see temperatures into the triple digits. That includes in areas not used to extreme heat like parts of Maine. Meanwhile, daytime temperatures around Pittsburgh are expected to feel like 110 degrees through Saturday. Elsewhere, an enormous storm system sweeping across the Gulf of Mexico strengthened yesterday into tropical storm Alberto, the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n♦\n\nToday is the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, marking the precise moment when the sun is at its highest point in the sky each year and the day with the most daylight. It's also the earliest summer solstice since 1796 when George Washington was president. For our friends in the Southern Hemisphere, it's the opposite. Today is the winter solstice.\n\n♦\n\nGene editing is allowing for scientists to develop breakthrough treatments for some of our most challenging diseases.

Louisiana leaders directed schools to display the Ten Commandments. Texas leaders proposed a curriculum that incorporates biblical lessons.\n\nAuthorities in these Republican-led states are confidently taking on constitutional protections that bar religious instruction from public education. School administrators and civil rights advocates are pushing back, saying these mandates violate students' rights.\n\nIn states where evangelical Christians make up a sizeable portion of constituents, incorporating Bible teachings into the curriculum has gained traction, said Ira C. Lupu, a professor at George Washington University School of Law who has written on religion in the First Amendment.\n\nDuring this moment in American history, a legal challenge to one of these measures in the U.S. Supreme Court could land differently than in other eras., Lupu said. The new policies, he said, have a better shot at prevailing before the court's conservative majority.\n\nNone of these mandates have advanced to that stage yet. Parents in Louisiana sued in June, challenging the policy requiring schools to display the Ten Commandments. But the case remains at the trial court level.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and Ryan Walters, the superintendent of education in Oklahoma, say they are prepared to take on legal challenges from people who disagree with them. Walters told USA TODAY he believes the Supreme Court will uphold the mandate requiring religious education if someone sues and a case makes it there. He credits former President Donald Trump with being outspoken and building support for the movement during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\"The support from Trump has given us this opportunity,\" Walters said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nLeaders in other Republican-run states have contacted Walters about Oklahoma's plan, he said, which he considers a modern-day \"blueprint\" for codifying the teaching of the Bible in public schools.\n\nStories of social justice and action across the nation. Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nWhat began campaign to bring religion into schools?\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in two separate cases in the 1960s that school-sponsored prayer and religious teaching in school violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which says the federal government cannot make laws governing the \"establishment of religion\" or prohibiting \"the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has interpreted that to mean that public schools \"may not provide religious instruction\" in a devotional manner or \"prescribe prayers to be recited by students or by school authorities.\"\n\nIf educators teach about religion as an academic subject, they must promote religious liberty and respect all religious views, including the views of those who don't believe, the federal agency says.\n\nCourt cases challenging the use of the Bible, Ten Commandments and religious materials in classrooms have continued to crop up in the years since.\n\nOne of the most influential rulings came in 1971 when the Supreme Court ruled in Lemon v. Kurtzman that constitutional protections requiring the separation of church and state apply to public schools.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger said laws about bringing religion into schools needed to pass a three-part test:\n\n◾ They must \"have a secular legislative purpose.\"\n\n◾ Their \"principal or primary effect must be one that neither promotes nor inhibits religion.\"\n\n◾ They must not foster “excessive government entanglement with religion.”\n\n\"Schools have repeatedly violated these criteria, resulting in a steady stream of litigation,\" wrote Jill Heinrich, a professor of education at Cornell College, in an article for the school.\n\nOver the last several decades, more than a dozen states tried to implement laws requiring the Ten Commandments in schools.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1980 in Stone v. Graham that a Kentucky law requiring schools to display the Ten Commandments was unconstitutional because it violated the Lemon v. Kurtzman test.\n\nSince then, Arizona, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah have proposed measures requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms at schools.\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the Arizona bill mandating displays of the Ten Commandments. Utah made it optional for schools to post them. A proposal in Oklahoma to make the displays optional died earlier this year when it wasn’t heard by a state House subcommittee.\n\nThe groundswell to make the Bible and the Ten Commandments a mainstay at public schools represents a shift, said Lupu, the George Washington University constitutional scholar. He views it as evangelical Christians taking advantage of an opening before a conservative majority on the high court.\n\nWhat's happening in Oklahoma schools?\n\nAt a state board of education meeting on June 27, Walters gave a directive to school leaders in Oklahoma: \"Every teacher and every classroom in the state will have a Bible in the classroom and will be teaching from the Bible in the classroom.\"\n\nAt least 14 Oklahoma districts and the state teachers union rebuked Walters' directive to incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into classes. They sent letters to parents saying they didn't plan to change the curriculum or teach the Bible despite the new requirements.\n\nThe Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office said state law already allows the Bible to be taught in classrooms, and districts have the right to choose whether they'll teach it this fall.\n\nThe Center for Education Law issued a memorandum to Oklahoma school districts calling Walters’ mandate invalid under state law, citing it as a local control issue.\n\nBut Walters says opting out is not an option.\n\n\"They will teach it because they don’t get to choose what they teach,\" he told USA TODAY. Walters said at a recent school board meeting he would hold accountable any districts that refused to comply.\n\nPeople suing the state over Walters' directive could hit roadblocks because the mandate's instructions on how the Bible should be taught are not uniform, Lupu said. This means educators have lots of latitude to interpret what it means to \"teach about the Bible.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union contends the government shouldn't be investing in Bibles. The organization said it was joining other civil rights groups in calling for Oklahoma officials to hand over records related to the mandate, including documentation showing how the state plans to pay for copies of the Bible.\n\n“Courts have repeatedly ruled that it is unconstitutional for public schools to coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise,'\" Megan Lambert, ACLU of Oklahoma Legal Director, said in the news release. \"Oklahoma children have the right to attend public school and to access the full range of school services without having government-sponsored religion imposed on them.\"\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, among the groups requesting the records, has been working to keep public institutions, including schools, secular for decades.\n\nPatrick Elliott, the nonprofit's legal director, believes a \"significant effort to push religion on other people's children in schools\" stems from a wave of \"Christian nationalism.\"\n\n\"All students are welcome at schools and when there are state efforts to really get them to believe in a certain brand of Christianity, that coerces students into religious practices and inhibits their religious liberties,\" he said.\n\nAt least 8 large Oklahoma districts:Rebuke superintendent's order to teach Bible\n\nTen Commandments in Louisiana schools\n\nThe dispute is different in Louisiana because the order issued to schools was specific and uniform: Every classroom must display the Ten Commandments.\n\nWhen Landry, the governor, signed the Louisiana bill in June he quipped that he was prepared to respond if anyone had any concerns.\n\n“I’m going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,” Landry said in June. “And I can’t wait to be sued.”\n\nLouisiana parents and civil liberties groups went on to sue the state, saying that requiring the Ten Commandments violates the First Amendment.\n\n\"Permanently posting the Ten Commandments in every Louisiana public-school classroom – rendering them unavoidable – unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state’s favored religious scripture,\" the complaint says.\n\nIn response, Louisiana has agreed to delay posting the Ten Commandments in public schools until at least November.

Other times it’s weirdly specific.\n\nThe latter is especially true for a bill marinating in the Indiana legislature right now.\n\nSenate Bill 373 pushes for an additional “resource” to be added to every public and charter school classroom in the state.\n\nNo, not more books. Don’t be silly. Instead, it calls for a framed homage to the national motto of the United States: “In God We Trust.”\n\nThe bill requires a kind of collage that features the motto as well as “accurate” representations of both the U.S. and Indiana state flags. And it leaves zero room for artistic interpretation.\n\nThe posters must be at least 11 inches by 17 inches. The flags have to be placed under the motto and be at least 5 inches by 5. They are not allowed to dwarf the motto, which itself must be at least 4 inches high by 15 inches wide.\n\nThe posters must be “durable,” the bill reads, and placed not only in every classroom, but also in the school library.\n\nAs of press time, there was no word on what fonts were acceptable or whether glitter was allowed.\n\nBut the posters are just the start in Sen. Dennis Kruse’s bill. It wants schools to offer “religions of the world” survey courses (taught in a “secular manner”) and goes out of its way to push for classes on the Bible.\n\nAnd if those classes aren’t good enough, parents could send their kids to a religious school for as much as two hours a week for elective credit. Schools could also decide to squeeze in lessons on creationism.\n\nIt’s part of a nationwide effort to inject religion into public schools. Similar bills exist in several states, and legislation in Mississippi would even slap The Ten Commandments next to the In God We Trust posters.\n\nComparable legislation has already passed in – where else? – Florida.\n\nBut does any of this have a solid chance of becoming law in our state? Probably not, said Katie Blair, director of advocacy for the Indiana chapter of the ACLU.\n\nShe said it’s the kind of bill Indiana legislators draft every year: mostly symbolic chum for their political base.\n\n“I’m hopeful our legislators would see this for what it is,” she said, “which is a blatantly unconstitutional bill.”\n\nThe legal history of this stuff, however, is murkier than you would think.\n\nThe Supreme Court case Edwards v. Aguillard nixed creationism in public schools, so that’s likely out. But Aronow v. United States found that “In God We Trust” is more “spiritual” than religious – just like your annoying friend Jenny.\n\nEither way, the bill’s biggest obstacle isn’t the First Amendment. It’s time.\n\nThe legislature has much bigger problems. Lawmakers have to draft a two-year budget, mull hate crimes legislation and still find time to reject medical marijuana for the 203rd year in a row.\n\nBut lawmakers can learn a valuable lesson from SB 373. If they brought the same kind of weird attention to detail to every piece of legislation, maybe we wouldn’t have as many problems.\n\nMore:Marijuana, machine guns: 4 Indiana bills that aren't boring | Webb\n\nMore:Gibson Southern to advise coaches, personnel to not participate in student prayers\n\nMore:New Year's Day shooting suspect pleads guilty to felony murder, other charges\n\nContact columnist Jon Webb at jon.webb@courierpress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2024/07/07/letters-to-the-editor-for-sunday-july-7-2024/74279589007/", "title": "Letters to the editor for Sunday, July 7, 2024", "text": "Letter writers\n\nGannett\n\nLetters to the editor should be 250 words or less.

This bold assertion was allegedly said by King Louis XIV in 1655. This claim of absolute power was eventually unacceptable in France and other 17th and 18th century monarchies. Over time people around the globe got fed up with the idea of despots ruling with unfettered power. We chose independence from the overreach of King George III of England. Our Founders wanted instead a competent and trustworthy person, a person committed to our Constitution, not someone who thinks he’s so special that he’s above the law, immune from laws that apply to the rest of us.Our Supreme Court, three of whom were appointed by Trump, has decided that he, while president, can get away with just about any crime, past or future. His lawyers can and will excuse any Trumpian transgression as an official, not private, act. Forget about the cases pending against him: his role in the insurrection, the document case, and even the Georgia election interference case. They’ll never be tried. His lawyers will also try to get his NY conviction thrown out. It’s like his criminal behavior inexplicably never happened.Our right-wing court has crafted a decision that will facilitate a path forward for a vengeful and unrestrained Trump. Their decision and his executive overreach will put our democracy in peril.\n\nKevin McNally, Bonita Springs\n\nVote no on Amendment 4\n\nDo Florida voters know how dangerous Amendment 4 will be for women?\n\nAs a state constitutional amendment, it will supersede every current and future Florida statute and regulation protecting women's health, safety and informed consent, except the law requiring notification of a minor's parents. Furthermore, its text is so full of ambiguities that numerous, time-consuming lawsuits will certainly follow.\n\nIt reads: \"Amendment to Limit Government Interference with Abortion. No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient's health, as determined by the patient's healthcare provider.\"\n\n\"No law\" means NO abortion-facility safety or hygiene protections. \"No law\" means NO requirement for informed consent. \"No law\" means NO parental consent before a minor's abortion.\n\n\"As determined by the patient's healthcare provider\" can mean anyone in healthcare, not just physicians. Florida licenses several types of healthcare providers, including podiatrists, dental hygienists, dietitians, even athletic trainers.\n\nThe three female justices on Florida's Supreme Court disagreed with the four male justices who approved Amendment 4 for the November ballot. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Renatha Francis said Amendment 4's \"multiple undefined terms ... invite protracted litigation and, thus, limitless interference by the judicial branch of government. This is exactly what happened after Roe.\"\n\nIs this really what Florida voters want for women, including those who will come from other states for their abortions?\n\nIf broader abortion availability here is the goal, Amendment 4 is not the way to reach it.\n\nVote NO on Amendment 4.\n\nPatricia Bucalo, Naples\n\nWomen’s rights under attack\n\nJustice Thomas, in his concurring opinion in the Dobbs case stated: “In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents including Griswold.” After discarding nearly a half century of pro choice, Thomas opened the door to targeting the right to use contraception, which was recognized by the Supreme Court in Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965. Missouri, and Louisiana are now considering laws which will inhibit birth-control. The future Trump administration is looking at enforcing the Comstock Act which has been on the books since 1873 and which prohibited birth control. So two of women’s rights are under attack. A third safeguard for women is now being viewed for attack.\n\nRepublicans in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Texas have now taken on the cause of eliminating no-fault divorce. Right-wing opponents of no-fault divorce have noted that women, especially educated, self-supporting women, file for divorce more often than men and that no-fault divorce means men can’t fight it. In states that approved no-fault divorce, domestic violence rates dropped about 30%, the number of women killed by an intimate partner fell by 10%. No-fault divorces were a sea change for women: they were tied to decreases in domestic abuse and female suicide. States which passed these unilateral divorce laws saw total female suicide decline by around 20%. The reason for the declines was twofold: abused women (and men) could more easily divorce their abusers, and potential abusers knew that they were more likely to be left by their partners, and that kept the abuse in the potential versus the actual mode.\n\nThe impact of these changes will be dramatic. It will curtail the education of women, it will eliminate employment opportunities, it will drive women back to a life of servitude.\n\nWomen must vote blue in this upcoming election or they will lose it all.\n\nSally Lam, Naples\n\nDark phenomenon\n\nI am one of millions of people in this country who are living in a state of dread, dread of more violence and violent rhetoric, dread of more incessant misinformation and dread that this country will never be able to find its way back to sanity. I even have conversations in the grocery store with strangers about this dark phenomenon, because we are all showing this anxiety in our daily lives and in how we are treating each other.\n\nToday, my only concern and question is for the New York Times and other publications, who quite quickly insisted that the president step aside, due to an undesirable debate performance, but to date no entity has suggested the same of our former president. Mr. Trump consistently lied through the entire debacle. His lies were loud and venomous and filled with large quantities of misinformation. For most of us watching the debate, we were well aware of his bizarre lies, but the moderators never once corrected him. And for those who may have no opinion yet, they may have believed the drivel of lies that came out of his mouth.\n\nMy question to everyone is: would you rather have a president who is simply not a good debater but who knows his stuff and has done a good job or would you rather have a serial liar, who does not understand government at all and does not care to?\n\nSarah Wilmarth, Fort Myers\n\nJudicial appointments\n\nWith their recent Supreme Court immunity decision, one has to wonder if two judges had recused themselves (Alito and Thomas), the outcome may have been different. Those two conservative judges should have taken themselves out due to their greed in office and their spouse’s actions which they said had no bearing on their ability to hand down unbiased decisions. Any husband that says their wives have no effect on their decision-making is either lying or being subject to browbeating or both. This is just another of many instances where Supreme justice appointments matter when the wrong person gets elected. The abolition of Roe and now the immunity decision are perfect examples of the importance of overly conservative appointments. The next president probably will have the opportunity to name two or three judges. If you-know-who gets in, we’re toast.\n\nDon’t let it happen.\n\nGlenn Chenot, Cape Coral\n\nChoice is clear\n\nOne person believes in the rule of law so much so that he won't pardon his own son, the other tries continuously to overthrow the government. I know who I'm voting for.\n\nClayton Jones, Naples\n\nPresidential immunity\n\nMonday’s Supreme Court ruling granting Trump immunity for official acts, essentially means there are no limits on actions taken by the president of the United States, any president. The pundits are in a tizzy. The focus has been on whether this decision prevents the current court cases considering the indictments against Trump from going forward or dismisses the current 34 felony counts verdict. As of this writing, sentencing in the N.Y. criminal conviction has been delayed and the other cases are in question. “News” anchors and strategists are concerned about what will happen if Trump is reelected, citing his statement about being a dictator for a day, the retribution he has promised, the implications of Project 2025 and the list goes on. But here is something I haven’t heard anyone mention. Joe Biden is still the president. He is the president until January 2025. That’s over six months. This court decision allows him to exercise unlimited power. Think of the possibilities. Fortunately for all of us, President Biden has stated he does not want that power, doesn’t need it and shouldn't have it. Hopefully this court decision will be the tipping point that brings enough of us together to prevent someone who wants absolute power from becoming president. If we don’t, this may be the last free election of our lifetime.\n\nSusan Kaercher Meyers, Naples\n\nMoral courage required\n\nThe Supreme Court’s attack was akin to Japan’s horrific attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, which destroyed our Navy in Hawaii. Importantly, it awakened the American people to reality of that war and enabled President Roosevelt to unite and mobilize America and ultimately to win WW II. Even Japan’s Hirohito feared losing the war immediately after the attack because of awakening of the American giant at Pearl Harbor.\n\nAs at Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941, the Supreme Court declared war by launching the quintessential attack on the American people and our democracy. That attack is potentially worse than Hirohito’s attack at Pearl Harbor because, if we lack the moral courage to defeat SCOTUS, an autocratic dictatorship will become permanent. Now, can we unite, forget the relatively trivial basis for differences (abortion, inflation, immigration, federal debt, slavery) and have the moral courage required to save our Constitution/democracy?\n\nThe world was in tatters as is our system of laws and accountability of Trump for his crimes. Hitler had invaded Europe, Russia and North Africa and was raining bombs on London. Mussolini had invaded the Balkans and Hirohito invaded South China Sea countries including China.\n\nOnly SCOTUS can reverse its ruling. Thus, the House of Representatives must address this crisis by using its emergency powers of impeachment and removal of the MAGA members of the Supreme Court. Importantly, have decent law-abiding Americans the moral courage (like JFK) to rise up and defeat Trump’s MAGAs in November elections at the county, state and federal levels?\n\nWilliam A. Pettinger, Bonita Springs\n\nUnimpressed by Bidens\n\nDemocrats admit Joe Biden was terrible in the recent debate. They admit he mumbled, lost his train of thought, looked bewildered at times so many have called for him to step down. The next day when he ranted and raved he was reading from a teleprompter. He looked and sounded ridiculous. Some Dem’s said he had a bad debate but should stay in office based on his successful record of the past three years. No sarcasm here but what success has he, his administration had in the past three years? Editors and readers please enlighten me.\n\nWhat I see, hear and experience is a terrible inflation, high prices of key consumer items, an open border, increase in crime and homelessness, a horrible drug problem in America, the Afghan debacle, wars throughout the world, Iran getting stronger, China not in check, etc. Everything mentioned does not equate to success in my opinion. I know Joe will blame Trump for today's problems, but please, it's time to accept what you are responsible for!\n\nI get it that many voters can’t stand Trump. There are days I swallow hard to like him but you can’t convince me Joe’s tenure is filled with success stories. Also, they both lied, stretched the truth on stage. In my humble opinion Joe and Jill do not want four more years for the betterment of America. They want four more years for their wellbeing. Joe would be lost out of politics and Jill loves living in the White House, flying on America One and appearing on the cover of magazines. Four more years for J & J would be disaster for America.\n\nBob Shea, Naples\n\nRoberts’ Rules of Disorder\n\nOne of the most nonsensical features — and there are many — of the ruling of the Supreme Court last Monday granting virtually complete immunity to former President Trump and his successors, too, is the provision forbidding use of any evidence relating to “official” presidential conduct, which is lawful, in the prosecution of impermissible “unofficial” or so-called private misbehavior.\n\nThe exclusion of such evidence, regardless of the “motives” or “purpose” of the presidential conduct, is mandated in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts. But that barrier blinds jurors in trials from seeing the context in which the alleged wrongful action occurred and, hence, impairs prosecution and conviction of criminality.\n\nUnder the Roberts’ reasoning, a surveillance video showing the driving of a get-away car in a bank robbery case could not be used to prosecute the group engaged in the heist if the vehicle operator was properly licensed and obeying all traffic laws.\n\nOr, the prosecution of a firearm murder case could not use evidence of the prior purchase of the weapon by the accused offender if the acquisition of the gun complied with the law.\n\nSimply put, the rationale of the Trump immunity case would prohibit introduction of evidence comprised of lawful action in a prosecution for unlawful conduct relating to the legal behavior.\n\nUnlike the well-known parliamentary rules for conducting a meeting, known as Robert’s Rules of Order, the immunity decision should be termed Roberts’ Rules of Disorder.\n\nIt might be surmised that the chief justice could not have meant that, but the logical extension is unassailable.Indeed, there’s much about the decision that cannot seem to mean what it says or implies.\n\nBut it does, creating a dangerous decision that, as Justice Neil Gorsuch observed at the oral argument, is “one for the ages.”\n\nThat reasoning is not likely to age very well.\n\nMarshall H. Tanick, Naples\n\nLeft distracts from real issue\n\nThe Left is now suggesting that if Trump is elected, he will kill his political opponents because of the recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. This is just wild accusations to divert from the disaster of Biden during the debate. During the Trump presidency, Trump was impeached twice for a phone call and a speech. This is a far cry from killing a political opponent. This is just a typical tactic of the Left. Avoid the issue (Biden's mental state), divert to another subject (presidential immunity) and then attack (making the outrageous suggestion that Trump would kill his political opponents). The Left always plays the game this way because they know that actually talking about the issues is a losing proposition for them.\n\nRon Wobbeking, Naples\n\nReligion in schools\n\nA classroom is not a church. A teacher is not a preacher. Students are not a congregation. If one religion is permitted in school, all faiths must be permitted (unless a student is enrolled in a privately funded religious school). If displaying the Judeo / Christian Ten Commandments is allowed in Florida public schools, the door opens for the Five Pillars of Islam, the Five Precepts of Buddhism, the Rastafarian Commandments, the Dharma of Hinduism, the Five Principles of Shinto, the Diasporic Religion of Haitian Vodou, to mention but a few of the 6,000+ religions practiced in the USA. Theology (the study of world religions) would be an eye-opening course, but it is a branch of social studies. Social studies is on the chopping block across Florida schools.\n\nOverburdened schoolteachers feel the pressure to bring students up to reading level while cutting interesting science, arts, and history curricula and disenfranchising students. Fear for students' futures that are based on incomplete and erroneous coursework and ignores the pleas of marginalized students for representation, drags down morale and erodes staffing, and for what? To pass along the intricacies of faith traditions that should be the responsibility of parents and faith leaders? Our founding families who demanded the separation of church from state and vice versa must be rolling over in their graves.\n\nKaryn Edison, Fort Myers\n\nTwo flawed candidates\n\nLast Thursday’s debate was very concerning. If it was a perfect world, we would have two better choices. Unfortunately, that is not the case. We have two flawed candidates.\n\nWe saw Biden, the longtime public servant, having a difficult time in gathering his thoughts and an even more difficult time in using a low, wispy voice to communicate. His stutter was visible to all. Biden has many accomplishments throughout his career. Many historians believe that he will go down in history having an enviable record of bipartisan legislative accomplishments during his time as president. His administration has focused on: COVID recovery, job creation, protecting rights, and getting relief for the middle class, and foreign relations.\n\nThe other candidate, Trump, lied through the entire debate. Many things he claimed as his accomplishments are actually accomplishments of the Obama or Biden administrations. (CNN fact checker found 30+ lies). Trump also has challenges in putting together a sentence and a complete thought. The fact that he repeatedly lies means that real facts are not important to him. Trump’s sole legislative accomplishment was the tax cut for corporations and the rich. This is an individual who does not exist in reality but in lies and conspiracies. He has the view that others are “crooked” since he projects things he would do on others. Trump‘s actions on Jan 6th and the fake elector conspiracy, and his other actions to hold onto power broke his oath of office to protect our laws. These actions should disqualify him from ever holding office again.\n\nJoAnn Stehr, Sanibel\n\n'Common Sense'\n\nWords written and verbalized have a way of reaching the mind and heart to bring good change.\n\nWith colonies in the Americas under British rule and occupation in 1776 there was written by Thomas Paine who emigrated from England to Philadelphia some years before, a text, a pamphlet titled “Common Sense.”\n\nThis pamphlet read by thousands of colonists caused public support and the leaders in the colonies to declare independence. The pamphlet became a spark for the revolution. The text was published six months before the Declaration of Independence. From my research: internet and the book “Common Sense” some main points were: Britain would rule for their own benefit, and not America’s benefit, there was unfair taxation, British military were occupying and causing conflict, ideologies, politics, economics causing problems in colonial environments. Britain’s ruler, King George lll was far from America. America would avoid European conflict by being free and distanced. America’s independence would benefit the world! Independence is a natural right.\n\nThus, the Declaration of Independence approved July 4th, 1776 (signed August 02, 1776). Many leaders of that time signed the Declaration, and the purpose was to state the separation of the thirteen colonies from Great Britain’s rule. The beginning of the declaration is the Preamble which brings light to Equality, innate unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. It is recognized that governments have their power and authority from those who are governed. Thus, \"We the People…” from the Constitution of the United States (1787).\n\nYes, I believe what is written is common sense, now we must have the common sense to understand what it says and honor respectfully, independence. Our country is a leader for the voice of the people, justice, safety, friendship, liberty, and freedom by democracy!\n\nEllen L.

We are hopelessly hooked, whether your tastes run more “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” or “Special Ops: Lioness.” Streaming services nabbed a record 38.7% of our viewing time in July, according to Nielsen.\n\nStreamers beware:It's not just Netflix and Disney. A password sharing crackdown is coming.\n\nNow streaming services are betting that we will either pay up or switch to cheaper plans with commercials that – not coincidentally – make more money for them.\n\nDon’t despair just yet. These tips and tricks can help you whittle your streaming budget.\n\nSubscribe to fewer streaming services\n\nMore than half of American households say they subscribe to four or more streaming services, a Consumer Reports survey found in February. Nearly a quarter of households – 22% – subscribe to eight or more, according to Parks Associates.\n\nNearly half of us – 42% – have forgotten all about a streaming subscription that we are paying for but no longer watch, a recent C+R Research survey concluded.\n\nMake a complete list of all the streaming services you subscribe to, then treat them like Idris Elba treats armed thugs in “Hijack”: Eliminate every single one that is not giving you “Ted Lasso” vibes.\n\nGet into the habit of taking stock of your streaming services each month to see if they are all still worth paying for, experts advise. And, keep your eyes peeled on your email account and credit card statement for price increases.\n\nTry cheaper streaming plans with commercials\n\nIf you don’t mind commercials, ad-supported plans are always cheaper. Instead of paying $15.49 to watch Netflix without commercials, you can pay $7 a month and sit through some ads.\n\nSame goes for Hulu. Disney said it will raise the monthly tab for Hulu without commercials to $18 from $15 in October, but you can subscribe for $8 to Hulu with commercials. Parks Associates Projects the number of households using ad-supported streaming services will increase to 52 million in 2027.\n\nChurn, baby, churn\n\nWatch one or two services at a time, binge away and then cancel and subscribe to a couple of new streaming services like you’re the take-no-prisoners billionaire Bobby Axelrod on “Billions.”\n\nYou can keep track of your favorite shows on JustWatch or Reelgood and sign up again when new seasons begin. The streaming industry calls all this hopping around “churn,” and 36% of streaming customers do it, according to a Parks Associates study.\n\n“If you're diligent and mindful of your spending, you can hop from service to service to find the content you're seeking on a monthly basis,” said Eric Sorensen, director of streaming video tracker with Parks Associates.\n\nHunt for streaming deals\n\nYou may be eligible for free or discounted streaming subscriptions that are bundled with your other services. For example, many mobile carriers offer discounts on streaming services or give them away with some plans.\n\n“One thing you can do is to check the benefits included with a subscription service you may already be paying for,” said Clark Howard, founder of Clark.com and host of the Clark Howard Podcast.\n\nGreenblatt, who travels extensively for his job, has an American Express Platinum card that gives him a free Walmart+ subscription. Because he’s a Walmart+ subscriber, he gets Paramount+ at no extra charge.\n\nStreaming services also make limited-time offers. Look out for those discounts particularly around Black Friday. And then there are services like Rakuten that can connect you with cash-back offers.\n\nCheck out free streaming options\n\nThey may not have the slick smarts of “The Lincoln Lawyer,” but there's plenty to watch on free streaming services with commercials like Freevee, which is owned by Amazon, Pluto TV and Tubi.\n\nHoward says ad-supported free streaming services are a fast-growing area. “Pluto and Tubi are two of the major ones. Even some of the paid streaming services have free offshoots. For example, Sling has Freestream. Even TV manufacturers are in this now. Samsung and LG both have a free streaming service. Roku has the Roku Channel,” he said.\n\nShare passwords and accounts (while you still can)\n\nThe industry is starting to crack down (we’re looking at you, Netflix and Disney), but you can still share passwords on other services. So set up multiple profiles for family members, like Bumpy Johnson racking up heroin deals with Italian crime families in “Godfather of Harlem.”\n\n“Counting on password sharing to continue is not a great bet,” Greenblatt cautioned. “Password sharing restrictions are almost certainly going to be enforced globally soon because of the revenue streamers are losing.”\n\nFree trials are your new best friend\n\nThere are fewer offers out there, but a lot of streaming services have free trials where you can try out the service for seven days.\n\nHook up an old-school antenna\n\nIf you’re really looking to shrink your streaming bill, get an indoor antenna and feast on ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC plus PBS, Telemundo, and loads of digital subchannels. You could also switch to cable TV alternatives that stream over the internet such as Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV.

Since the merger was formally completed on June 14, AT&T has raised prices for its offerings, including a $5 price hike for each of its DirecTV Now streaming plans.\n\nStarting July 26 for new customers, DirecTV's new starting price is $40 a month for some 60 channels. The reason? To bring \"the cost of this service in line with the market,” AT&T said.\n\nThe increase follows AT&T's introduction, a week after its Time Warner merger closed, of an Unlimited & More “unlimited” wireless plan. At $70 a month, the plan costs $5 more than the basic unlimited plan that already was in place.\n\nAT&T is offering more features on this new plan – it included a free bundle of the new WatchTV streaming service that AT&T announced on the same day. Wireless consumers could also stick with the older plan.\n\nWatchTV is an example of a “skinny bundle,” with a roster of more than 30 live streaming channels – including some Time Warner properties such as CNN and TNT – and more than 15,000 TV shows and movies on demand. It costs $15 monthly as a standalone plan, but the truth is not every AT&T wireless customer will have any interest in the new streaming service.\n\nWith rival bundles available from the likes of Sony PlayStation Vue and Dish Networks’ Sling TV – and maybe if reports prove true, eventually from Apple – we may well be entering an intense competitive period not of price cuts but of \"my bundle is richer than your bundle.\" Sling TV currently starts at $25 a month for 30 channels, and PlayStation Vue starts at $39.99 for around 50 channels. Both companies have just announced price increases.\n\nMore:No one said cutting the cord would be easy\n\nMore:Fresh off Time Warner merger, AT&T launches WatchTV streaming service, new unlimited plans\n\nYou may not even notice one other price change on your wireless bill, but for AT&T it adds up to big savings that may help it offset the cost of the merger.\n\nAs spotted by BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk, AT&T increased its monthly “administrative fee” twice during its most recent quarter, with a June hike to $1.99 that is up from 76 cents in just three months. The cost was just 61 cents when it was introduced in 2013, Piecyk says.\n\nThe fee, which is tacked onto “post-paid” cellphone bills as well as tablets and smart watches, could lift AT&T’s wireless revenues by $970 million, which Piecyk writes in a note to investors, “comes in handy” for AT&T, “given that it just closed the Time Warner acquisition, which increased net debt by over $60 billion.”\n\nAT&T says that “This is a standard administrative fee across the wireless industry, which helps cover costs we incur for items like cell site maintenance and interconnection between carriers.\"\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/05/23/t-mobile-price-hike/73818353007/", "title": "T-Mobile is hiking prices on legacy plans: What to know", "text": "T-Mobile customers holding on to their legacy plans can expect to see higher bills come June.\n\n\"For the first time in nearly a decade, in response to rising costs and inflation, we’re making small adjustments to some of our oldest rate plan prices,\" explained the T-Mobile website. \"Beginning June 5, the rate of your voice plan will increase by $5.00/line per month.\"\n\nT-Mobile declined to specify what specific plans are included in the pricing change.\n\nThe website claimed that the provider still offers the \"best value in wireless\" even with the adjustments, saying its customers save \"an average of approximately 20%\" versus some competitors, for comparable services.\n\nCustomers were advised that services, benefits and promotional pricing will remain the same and the additional charges will automatically be added to bills after June 15.\n\nMore ways to save: Visit USA TODAY's coupons page for deals from thousands of vendors\n\n\"T-Mobile is committed to offering the best value in postpaid wireless with low prices and a differentiated, best-in-class 5G network – and we have no intention of ever changing that,\" T-Mobile said in a statement to USA TODAY on Thursday. \"The majority of our customers are not included but the fraction who are heard from us yesterday.\"\n\nLandlines going extinct:Phone companies want to eliminate traditional landlines.

They’re doing what’s best for their bottom line,” said streaming media analyst Dan Rayburn.\n\nFrom Reviewed:Bundle Netflix and Max for 41% off with this deal\n\nOther bundles forming\n\nPartnerships are already common across streaming services. Paramount+ has partnerships with Walmart+ and Delta Air Lines, Peacock has partnered with Instacart and mobile plans like T-Mobile and Cricket Wireless offer various streaming deals.\n\nWhat’s unique about Verizon’s bundle is that it’s among the first to offer two competing streaming services bundled together.\n\nThe Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle has been available since 2019, but all three companies are owned at least in part by Disney. Paramount Global also used to offer a Paramount+ and Showtime bundle before combining the two into Paramount+ with Showtime. And then there are offerings like Amazon Prime and Apple One, which offer a mix of streaming services, music and gaming from one provider.\n\n“We've heard a lot about bundling over the last couple of years, but we haven't seen real bundling,” Rayburn told USA TODAY. Verizon’s offering is “not (Netflix and Max) working with one another. It's a mobile carrier getting together and bundling. That’s a very different type of bundling.”\n\nRayburn said he doesn’t expect to see any “real” bundling between streaming rivals any time soon, largely because figuring out which company owns the customer data would be a headache to sort through.\n\n“When you're doing it through Verizon, it's completely different because Verizon is simply saying, ‘Sign up through us.' But then you have to go use a separate app to actually view the content,” he said. “Can you imagine Netflix saying to Disney, 'Everyone can sign up for your service through our payment system?' That's not going to happen.”\n\nIt’s unclear if any partnerships down the road – including a potential Apple TV+ and Paramount+ bundle – would also have an intermediary involved. Paramount declined to comment on The Wall Street Journal’s reporting, and Apple did not respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nAnd while these sorts of bundles are meant to increase subscriber retention, Rayburn is skeptical about how effective this will prove to be.\n\n\"I think we will see companies start to experiment with the bundling of competing services and analyze the data to evaluate the impact it has on their balance sheet,\" he said. \"However, there is no guarantee that bundling will cause more users to sign up and fewer users to churn.\"\n\nWhile streaming companies tend not to share data on customer retention, Disney CEO Bob Iger said during an earnings call last month that \"we found that where we bundled, we lower churn.\"\n\nThe case for bundling services\n\nDespite the uncertainty, some industry experts say more bundling and consolidation among streaming services is inevitable.\n\n“We've got a lot of studios that are trying to launch their own standalone platforms. And not all of those platforms are going to be successful,” said Michael Smith, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nJohn Malone, who is known in the industry as the “cable cowboy” and serves on the board of directors for Warner Bros. Discovery, told CNBC last month that the idea of bundling has become more critical as media companies try to make their direct-to-consumer offerings more profitable. (The recent flurry of price hikes and crackdowns on password sharing have been other methods to try to squeeze out more money from streaming.)\n\nBundling \"could certainly happen if one was focused on one type of demographic and the other, another type of demographic,” Malone told CNBC. “A Disney+ together with Max might be a pretty decent combination. You might also see sports-related or focused bundles.”\n\nIn September, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said conversations around bundling has been ramping up in recent months, citing Max’s two-month experiment offering content from AMC+ earlier this year.\n\n“I think one of the things that we're going to see, as we look into the future, is bundling,” Zaslav said, adding that it should help “create more value and create a better consumer experience.”\n\nWhat streaming bundles mean for consumers\n\nBundled services in theory can make streaming more consumer-friendly, according to Smith; no more wasting mental energy trying to remember which of your services has the sitcom “30 Rock” if your streaming is all under one roof, he said.\n\nBut bundling could also hike up streaming costs since a bundled service tends to have a higher price tag than a standalone subscription. Research shows that the average consumer already spends more than $200 on subscriptions every month, according to a 2022 survey commissioned by market research firm C+R Research.\n\n“It's good news for consumers, in terms of things getting easier to find. And it's good news for producers in terms of they'll have more market power and more loyalty,” Smith said. “Whether that turns out to be bad news for consumers because they end up with higher prices is yet to be determined.”\n\nThe high cost of subscription binges:How businesses get rich off you forgetting to cancel\n\nVerizon bundling offerings\n\nStarting Dec. 7, the ad-supported tiers from Netflix and Max (formerly HBO Max) can be bundled for Verizon customers on the Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan for $10 per month, according to a news release from Verizon.\n\nAlone, the ad-supported tiers from Netflix and Max cost $6.99 and $9.99 per month, respectively.\n\nVerizon myPlan customers can also have access to a Disney bundle, which includes Disney+ with no ads, Hulu with ads, and ESPN+ with ads.\n\nA Verizon spokesperson declined to comment on how many customers are eligible for the new bundle deal or how much money Netflix and Max are set to make per subscriber.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/06/03/spotify-price-increase/73955364007/", "title": "Spotify price increase: See if your subscription plan will change", "text": "Spotify Premium users will soon see an increase in their monthly bill, the music streaming company announced Monday.\n\n\"Over the next month, subscribers in the U.S. will receive an email explaining what this update means for their subscription,\" said in a blog post released by Spotify.\n\nThe company said the hike is part of occasional price updates that allow the brand to \"continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience.\"\n\nMusic streaming:It’s been 25 years since Napster launched and changed the music industry forever\n\nSpotify price changes\n\nFor users in the U.S., prices will change as follows:\n\nIndividual plan: $11.99, up from $10.99.\n\nDuo plan: $16.99, up from $14.99.\n\nFamily plan: $19.99, up from $16.99.\n\nStudent plan will remain the same at $5.99.\n\nThis is the second such increase Spotify has made in a year, following pricing changes in July.\n\nIn 2023, Spotify increased the price of the Individual plan up from $9.99 to $10.99, the Duo plan from $12.99 to $14.99, the Family plan from $15.99 to $16.99 and the Student from $4.99 to $5.99.\n\nThe company said at the time that the changes reflected the evolution of \"the market landscape\" and would allow the service to \"keep innovating.\"\n\nLooking for reliable local streaming options?

(The 2020 charge had been $49.99 monthly.)\n\nIt's still cheaper than most cable packages, which top $100 monthly, and YouTube, which boasts of over 2 million subscribers, has an advantage in no additional equipment and hidden fees, which cable is notorious for. But the price hike was such a cable-like move that many consumers cried foul. YouTube justified the decision by announcing new channels to the lineup, including MTV and Comedy Central. Many consumers said they didn't want the new channels – just leave the pricing as is, please.\n\n$$$$$:Cutting the cord: What now, after YouTube TV's price increase?\n\nPhotography:Google Photos app gets refresh look, new features\n\nEnter Sling TV. While YouTube TV is now the most expensive offering for streaming cable and local channels, Sling is far and away the cheapest, starting at $30 monthly. And Sling went out of its way this week to let those furious YouTube customers know that there will be no price hikes from Sling, through at least August 2021. (If you sign up for service by Aug. 1, 2020.)\n\nSo we decided to dive in and take a good look, again, at Sling, as a savings of $35 monthly is a lot of money, nearly $400 yearly. How much are you missing out by not having YouTube TV? How's the interface? How's the lineup?\n\nShort answer: Sling TV isn't as good as YouTube. But it does the job. I cut the cord for a reason. Not just to save money, but because I didn't want to pay through the nose to get channels I never watched. And the streaming experience was better.\n\nStart watching on the TV, finish on the phone, tablet or computer. A less cumbersome DVR that's a one-click setup. And since YouTube is owned by Google and has followed my every move, it knows my tastes and could make some good recommendations.\n\nNeed WiFi? Park in front of the library\n\nBut you know what? For that extra $35 extra a month, I don't need Google's recommendations. I can figure out what to watch, thanks.\n\nSling's lineup isn't as robust as YouTube's, with 50 channels to the 90 from YouTube. If you're a sports fan, there are way more regional sporting networks you may crave on YouTube.\n\nSling does have some sports as well, along with ESPN, but you have to be careful when you order. There's the \"Blue\" package, which I signed up for, and doesn't have the ESPN channels. For them, you'll need the \"Orange\" package. Both are $30 separately or $45 for the combo.\n\nLike YouTube, Sling lets you sort the channels to only display your favorites, use a program guide to find stuff to watch, or just watch the shows you've recorded. (I paid an extra $5 for the DVR service.) The TV interface, which I watched via Apple TV's streaming box, is interchangeable with the mobile app or viewing on your computer.\n\nSling's program guide is superior to YouTube's in that it can show you the lineup for seven days at a glance, while YouTube's is only day and date. YouTube says it's updated the guide to 7 days at a glance, but in our tests this week, nothing has changed.\n\nSling is at a major disadvantage over both YouTube and rivals Hulu with Live TV and AT&T Now (both $55 monthly) in offering local channels and networks. In Los Angeles, where I live, I was able to pick up the local NBC and Fox stations, but Sling says they're not available in every market.\n\n(Philo, another streaming option, is actually the lowest priced of all, at $20 monthly, boasting of 60 entertainment channels, but is missing many networks, including sports, news and local TV.)\n\nTo those of you who would miss having CBS, NBC, Fox and ABC in your lineup, Sling recommends just connecting an antenna. That could work, but you might have some reception issues.\n\nI've got another solution.\n\nCBS All-Access has the complete CBS lineup and costs $5.99 monthly. NBC's new streamer, Peacock, launching July 15th, will have much of the NBC lineup, but if shows are missing, you can sign up for a premium version at $4.99 monthly. And for your ABC and Fox fix, the stand-alone Hulu streaming service has those shows (along with NBC's) for $5.99 monthly. Total cost: $48 and if you'd like to add cloud DVR (and you will) another $5 will get you to $53.\n\nThat's $12 less monthly than YouTube TV or a savings of $144 yearly.\n\nIt's a more complicated way to go about it, but it's one option.\n\nThe better one, of course, is to vote with your wallet and cancel YouTube TV. If we don't fight back against the price increases, and this nasty TV habit of throwing all these channels at us that we don't want, prices will only keep up going more.\n\nIn making the announcement, YouTube actually made it easy for fans to show their disgust for the move, by including the link to cancel or pause the subscription.\n\nAre you with me TV fans?\n\nIn other tech news this week\n\nFacebook. Over 700 brands, including Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Unilever, joined the bandwagon to pause their advertising on Facebook, in protest over the social network's stance regarding hate speech. The #StopHateforProfit campaign – launched June 17 by civil rights groups including the NAACP, Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League – comes as corporate America grapples with racial inequality following the death of George Floyd while in police custody. Meanwhile, have Facebook fatigue? We offered some alternatives choices in a recent column, including MeWe, Cake and that old standby, LinkedIn.\n\nSocial networks got more proactive about trying to curb hate speech. Amazon-owned Twitch suspended the official Donald Trump channel – launched in October 2019 – for violating its rules against hate speech, while website Reddit banned a group devoted to Trump. Meanwhile, Facebook has removed a network of accounts, groups and pages on Facebook and Instagram connected to the “boogaloo” anti-government movement that encourages violence in the United States and YouTube said it banned six channels for violating its policies, including those of white supremacists David Duke and Richard Spencer.\n\nApple closed down 28% of its retail stores in response to the pandemic. By late in the week, some 77 stores that had reopened are now temporarily closed again. Other stores throughout the country are only open for pickup of online orders and by appointment for \"in-store Genius Support.\" The new temporary closures include 15 in California, another 10 in Texas, five of Georgia's six locations, four of Nevada's five stores and two more in Florida.\n\nThis week's Talking Tech podcasts\n\nMeet the new no. 1 app: Trivia Royale\n\nMeet MeWe, the \"anti\" Facebook\n\nI weigh in: my favorite of the Facebook alternatives\n\nYouTube's 30% price hike\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, where I'm @jeffersongraham", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/04"}]}

He expects it will enhance the zoo from an in-state favorite into a regional magnet. No timetable is set for the rain forest's completion, with fund-raising now in planning stages.\n\nThe massive blueprint for the zoo's future marks its rebound from last summer's low point.\n\nIn less than two weeks, a tree fell on the Monkey House and another tree crushed the commissary.\n\nThe commissary has been rebuilt, but Peacock announced Thursday that the Monkey House, under evaluation since its July damage, has been deemed too severely damaged to be saved.\n\nThe tree falls created the worst natural disaster in the zoo's 109-year-history, said Bill Montgomery, executive director of the nonprofit Delaware Zoological Society, which supports the zoo.\n\nHe and others used hand nets and pet carriers to rescue 24 tiny monkeys and a baby toucan from the crushed building as staff and volunteers wept at the sight.\n\nLater that summer, the crew put wet towels over their faces after a smoky dryer fire forced them to evacuate the monkeys from another building used to house them before out-of-state emergency placements through an inter-zoo pact.\n\nWith those woes in the past, he said Thursday, \"we're building the zoo's future now.... We've got a lot we're doing in a short period of time.\"\n\nMontgomery said there is no facility like the planned rain forest between Baltimore and Buffalo, New York. Along with the shorter-term projects, he said, the expansion is expected to significantly grow the zoo's yearly attendance from the current 80,000.\n\nThe monkeys that survived the tree-fall unhurt – almost all returned from other zoos – ultimately will live in the rain forest, along with the toucan and other animals now in the zoo and to be acquired.\n\nIn coming years, Peacock said, a jaguar will star as the rain forest's \"marquee animal.\"\n\nAn area for special events, meetings and parties will overlook the habitat, he said.\n\nConstruction is to start in days on a short-term habitat for the popular monkeys, so they can return to exhibition this summer.\n\nThe raccoon-like baby panda sisters – born at the Detroit Zoo and placed here for future breeding – will be introduced to the public this summer with a party for their first birthday.\n\nGov. Jack Markell on Thursday unveiled the sign on their new habitat, shrouded during their quarantine. They arrived at the zoo Wednesday night after animal keepers Laura Martin and Leah Newman flew to Detroit and drove them back after meeting their parents and keepers there.\n\nMarkell got a brief peek at them. \"They're really cute,\" he said with a smile. \"I think people are going to love to have the opportunity to see red pandas right here in Delaware.\"\n\nAlso unveiled was Eagle Ridge, a home for two bald eagles – a baby-feathered one that can't fly after its wing was broken in a Pennsylvania tornado last year, and a mature one disabled by lead poisoning from ingested hunting shot and fishing weights.\n\nEagle Ridge, designed by zoo board member/architect Robert A. Grove, will include the otter pool and add accessibility to the one zoo area that is not yet wheelchair-friendly.\n\nDuring a hard-hat tour of the roofless Monkey House – said to date from the Depression era with later changes – Peacock said it had more damage after the tree. Its water was off, but a sprinkler system last winter flooded the shell, he said.\n\nOptions for its site soon will be shown for public comment, said Delaware State Parks Director Ray Bivens.\n\nPossibilities include rebuilding the Monkey House for office space with more surface parking, creating a plaza from its salvaged bricks with signs to honor the building and zoo history, and rebuilding the Monkey House and/or adjoining education center for office and program space over expanded parking.\n\nContact robin brown at (302) 324-2856 or rbrown@delawareonline.com.

One day last fall, he said, the zoo closed to the public and went on a hunt through storage areas and offices and cleaned out 53 tons of \"accumulated unused items. Forty tons of that was recyclable.\"\n\nAmy Shearer, chief of the marketing office at the zoo, said much of the material that could be recycled from that purge found another use in a different part of the zoo. \"We wanted to push the idea that everything in your world can have a second use,\" she said. \"That included stuff in our own closets,\" Shearer said.\n\nWhile the two gorilla projects are larger-than-life, other creatures, like some of the 34 neon-colored animals crafted by the Cracking Art Group of Milan, Italy, also are mammoth in comparison to their actual size.\n\nTwo fuchsia squatting rabbits, placed outside the McNeil Avian Center, are sure to get more attention than a bronze life-sized statue of a pair of penguins, whose beaks and feet have been rubbed shiny over decades by hands of visitors.\n\nOther animals in the Italian group's displays include a bright yellow bird, three blue snails, eight green frogs, and a dozen orange meerkats, all standing in the pose most associated with this animal who lives on the African plains. The name chosen by the artists, Cracking, refers to the process that transforms petroleum into naphtha, the basis of plastic, which can take up to 2,000 years to break down in landfills and the ocean, according to environmentalists.\n\nPhiladelphia artist Leo Sewell, who has a studio within biking distance of the zoo, carried a life-sized replica of a duck, crafted from metal objects to the unveiling of the new temporary art.\n\n\"It's the only thing I have that would fit in my backpack,\" said Sewell as he walked along the zoo's paths searching for his exhibition piece, a 175-pound white rhinoceros made of hammered silver dinnerware.\n\n\"I grew up near a dump. I played with junk all my life,\" said Sewell, who said his favorite part of the rhino was the tail, made of long-handled serving forks.\n\n\"This pachyderm is dressed for dinner,\" proclaims an instructional pillar adjacent to the rhino's spot outside the small mammal house.\n\n\"I worked from a little plastic model,\" said Sewell, who continues to collect out-of-fashion silver platters from trash heaps, church rummage sales and friends.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"the horns are made from silver drinking cups and I think a salt shaker or two.\"\n\nThere will probably be a toss-up for children's favorites between the rhino and a 5-foot-long pink reptile, with bright white teeth, that lies in a cage in the avian center. That reptile, referred to by zoo officials as both an alligator and a crocodile, is made from 200 pounds of chewing gum. Definitely unchewed, reported the Zoo's publicity office.\n\nCindy Adams Dunn, acting secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, said she hopes young visitors \"have an oh-wow moment\" when they examine the displays.\n\n\"That moment can change a child's relationship to nature, get children out of the rut of being in front of a screen for seven hours a day,\" she said.\n\nIf you go\n\nThe Philadelphia Zoo is at 34th and Girard streets in North Philadelphia.\n\nAdmission through Oct. 31 is $20 for adults and children 12 or older, $18 for children between 2 and 11.

Journal News\n\nNEW YORK — The Rockefeller Christmas tree is in place; the pop-up shops are open at the Bryant Park Winter Village and The Radio City Rockettes have kicked off their annual Christmas Spectacular. It's definitely the holidays in Manhattan.\n\nThere's nothing quite like a dose of holiday magic that comes from ogling the decorated windows at some of the city's most famous department stores, featuring snow-capped pine trees, twinkling lights and seasonal music.\n\nGo behind the scenes of Macy's holiday windows\n\nLord & Taylor opened its doors for a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to put together the biggest show of the year at the iconic department store for the millions of visitors from around the world who file past, day and night, during the season. The store's windows on Fifth Avenue were unveiled to the public Nov. 10.\n\n“It’s New York City at holiday time when it becomes the most fabulous place in the world,\" says Roe Palermo, divisional vice president of store visuals for Lord & Taylor.\n\n\"And it's our job to give them a treat.”\n\nThe theme this year at the company's Fifth Avenue flagship store is \"Enchanted Forest.\"\n\nThe store's five windows are decorated with scenes depicting the whimsical side of the season and include 34 hand-sculpted animals, over 9,000 feet of garland, foliage and twinkling lights.\n\n\"It's really more like a play or a set,\" says Palermo.\n\nThis app helps earn extra cash for the holidays\n\nThe eye-catching animated scenes include bunnies ice-skating on a forest pond; a sleeping fox family with dancing raccoons trying to wake them with a feather. Attention to detail in all the windows includes everything from the expertly coiffed long-lashed bears to the handmade mice costumes for the dozen mice dressed in one window.\n\n\"We dress each one so they have a personality,\" says Palermo.\n\nThe storybook theme, a mix of traditional scenes and animated digital technology, will keep kids intrigued and the music piped in will keep everyone in the holiday mood.\n\n\"The window exterior is the full experience for our customers,\" Palermo says.\n\nLord & Taylor is the oldest department store in the United States and one of Manhattan's original landmarks. The store unveiled its very first animated holiday windows in 1937.\n\nThe Fifth Avenue building is 102 years old and has a unique hydraulic system that allows the window displays to be raised from the basement to street-level on Fifth Avenue. \"It raises like a freight elevator; it was used for horse and buggies,\" says Palermo.\n\nIt takes nine months for the design team to create the holiday window displays at a budget they won't disclose. It then takes six months to build the sets off-site and three weeks prior to opening to re-assemble the sets in-house.\n\nEight people on the design team, along with a crew of more than 25 people working on the animated window exteriors round out the holiday window team.\n\nThe store estimates over 1.5 million people will stop to look at the windows during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season, between November and January. The windows will be up until Jan. 5.\n\n”That’s what the windows are all about,” says Palermo. “You walk by and smile when you see this scene.\"\n\nThe Miracle on 34th Street\n\nAt Macy's on 34th Street, creating the perfect holiday windows dates back to the 1870s. The Herald Square holiday tradition includes the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, celebrating it's 90th anniversary this year, and the elaborate windows that have crowds lining up to take a peek.\n\n\"The holiday windows are one of the most important traditions,\" says Roya Sullivan, national director of window presentations.\n\n\"It’s our gift to the city. I can’t tell you how many people write me saying they are going to come to bring their kids and grandkids to experience the windows.\"\n\nThis year's theme, carried through six windows at the Herald Square flagship, is \"Believing the Magic.\"\n\nSanta takes center stage in the first window in a communication center focusing on how he receives Christmas wishes from children around the world. Browsers will see two interactive windows: an LED tree made of 1,000 crystal pieces and a mix of traditional and modern touches of Christmas.\n\nAnother interactive window, with pinball buttons on the glass, is a measuring game where the temperature of the glass measures how much you love the holidays. Another features elves and depicts the magical feeling before Santa goes to deliver his gifts.\n\nSullivan estimates 15,000 people per hour walk by the storied windows.\n\n\"It's quite special; only a handful of people in the world do this,\" she says. \"It's part of our DNA.\"\n\nFinding 'Love' at Henri Bendel\n\nAt Henri Bendel, the holiday display features artist James Goldcrown’s \"Love Wall,\" a four-story display of bleeding hearts overlaying Henri Bendel’s legendary façade. \"From Bendel With Love\" mixes Nouveau and modern street art, with the centerpiece of the holiday display the store's iconic two-story tree topped off with 10 larger than life ornaments – giant versions of the ornaments for sale in the store.\n\nBendel's creative director Pina Ferlisi was a fan of Goldcrown's work.“Having been a fan of his work for quite some time, we wanted our store to reflect a message of love and togetherness during the holidays, and we thought James’ mural would serve as the perfect reminder to spread the love this season.”\n\nMost windows open this week and next and remain up until early January.\n\n\"Our focus is always about storytelling this season and not merchandise,\" says Roya Sullivan of Macy's. \"We are super proud that we’ve continued this tradition.\"\n\nRoe Palermo of Lord & Taylor says: \"They can expect to have a really good time, smile, feel like a kid again and enjoy with their family.\"\n\nHoliday Windows Schedule\n\nLord & Taylor: 'Enchanted Forest'\n\nWhen: Open now through Jan. 5\n\nWhere: 424 Fifth Ave., New York\n\nInfo: 212-391-3344, visit5thavenue.com/lord-taylor/\n\nMacy's Herald Square: 'Believe in Magic'\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m. Nov. 18 through Jan. 2\n\nWhere: 151 W. 34th St.\n\nInfo: 212-695-4400, visitmacysusa.com/visitor-center/macy%E2%80%99s-herald-square\n\nSak's Fifth Avenue: 'Land of 1000 Delights'\n\nIn addition to the store's six animated windows on Fifth Avenue, check out “Candy Couture” dresses in the windows on 49th and 50th Streets.

Usually, there's not much to see: Lines of rowhouses. One or two abandoned, boarded-up properties. A few cars. Some trash, dumped illegally. A giant black panther.\n\nWait. What?!\n\nWas that a panther? Lying in wait, as if preparing to pounce?\n\nIt was. It is.\n\n\"Invincible Cat,\" by husband-and-wife artists Don Kennell and Lisa Adler, is 15,000 pounds of what used to be car hoods (56 of them, to be exact). And it's keeping watch on this vacant lot tucked inside a neighborhood along the Hi-Speedline not only to entertain riders, but also to call attention to a serious problem plaguing the City of Camden: illegal dumping and pollution.\n\nThe 36-foot long, 8-foot tall sculpture is one of six installations as part of A New View Camden, funded by a $1 million Bloomberg Philanthropies grant to highlight the issue of illegal dumping, and to beautify Camden for both outsiders and the people who call the city home.\n\nMore:Camden urban farming collective offers oases in a food desert\n\nArtists converged on Camden this week from all over the country. Locally, photographer Erik James Montgomery and artisan Tom Marchetty, of Pennsauken and Collingswood respectively, contributed their talents as well.\n\nThe pandemic-delayed project, which was initially set to launch last spring, was officially unveiled Thursday to coincide with Earth Day.\n\nOn Tuesday, artists and apprentices were all over the city installing the massive works in preparation for the unveiling.\n\nWe visited four of those sites, and spoke with artists and others about what the installations are, what they mean, and what they hope people will take away from seeing them.\n\nInvincible Cat\n\n1489 Pershing Street\n\nAdler and Kennell met years ago while both were studying at Rutgers University; their first child was born in New Brunswick, she said. The couple now live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but Kennell's first public artwork came in 1994 in Camden and their giant car-hood animal creations have also been on display at the Philadelphia Zoo, Adler said.\n\nAs they assembled the tail and paw to the body and head of the big cat (it was trucked here from Santa Fe), Adler, wearing a shirt with a feline silhouette pattern, said with a mischievous smile that they chose a panther because \"cats are sexy, let's just say it!\"\n\n\"The scale is meant to surprise,\" she said. \"It's meant to be theatrical, so people can interact with it and think about this space. Space makes certain things possible, so we create these spaces and when they don't serve the purposes we want, how can we change that?\"\n\nShe's hoping people will come to this space, tucked away and little thought-about by those who don't live here, that commuters riding the train might have their interest piqued enough to explore a ride-through place, to take a selfie and bring back an understanding that these aren't places to dump trash, but rather places where people walk, where children play, where families live.\n\n\"Public art should be here, for these people,\" she said.\n\nBio-Informatic Digester\n\nOrchard and Chestnut streets\n\nLaRodge Johnson lives on Line Street near Cooper University Hospital, but the apprentice artist helping with the Bio-Infomatic Digester, a massive white installation of trash buckets, mealworms (you read that right) and PVC pipe boasts a proud family history in Camden.\n\nHer grandmother, who worked for Cooper and for Campbell's Soup, was one of the first Black women to buy her own home in Camden, she said. And Johnson, a student at Camden County College plans to study at Rutgers after receiving her associate's degree, is hoping installations like the one she's helping to build will build something else: a sense of pride in Camden.\n\n\"Living in Camden sometimes almost gives you a depressive sense,\" she said. \"You look around and see all the trash, the violence, the drugs, but art — art is uplifting.\"\n\nThe digester, explained Mitchell Joachim, an architect and designer who was trained at MIT, Harvard and Columbia, takes waste — Styrofoam, specifically — and turns it into mulch as it's eaten and digested by mealworms. Those mealworms eventually become beetles that can be eaten by a variety of species including raccoons, skunks, moles and shrews, creating a cycle of nourishment from a material that if left alone can take hundreds of years to decompose.\n\n\"We are long past the crisis point to stop climate weirding,\" said Joachim. \"And there are a lot of ways to do it.\" Paraphrasing President John F. Kennedy, he said, \"If our problems are man-made, man can and should solve them.\"\n\nKris Kolluri, CEO of Cooper's Ferry Partnership, which oversaw A New View Camden, noted the site has its own history: It was once the home of the Reliable Tire Company; in 2011, the abandoned factory caught fire and the site was left derelict for years afterward.\n\n\"That cost $1 million to clean up,\" Kolluri recalled, \"but people riding PATCO (40,000 a day pre-pandemic and, officials hope, post-pandemic as well) will see this instead.\"\n\nTurntable\n\n801 Delaware Ave. (Cooper Poynt Waterfront Park)\n\nMost people remember Cooper Poynt Waterfront Park as the former site of Riverfront State Prison. And while that institution is not missed by residents who'd opposed its presence from the planning stages to the day it was razed, few know the site's more distant history.\n\nArchitects Amanda Schachter and Alexander Levi, though, researched the site and found that it once was a ferry point and there used to be a large sandbar, Smith Island or Windmill Island, a short way into the then-shallow, muddy Delaware River where 18th- and 19th-century residents would go to carouse and drink.\n\nThe New York City pair, Schachter said, do a lot of art installations highlighting waterways and she believes access to water is a fundamental right for city residents everywhere.\n\n\"When you cut off access to a waterway, whether it's with a highway or a prison, you're cutting people off from a natural resource. And then the city can't breathe.\"\n\nTheir installation, \"Turntable,\" uses plastic water bottles to form an outer dome, and a more recent item frequently used — and unfortunately often carelessly discarded: disposable face masks.\n\nShe admitted the pair originally planned a more colorful inner layer, but the pandemic changed that as they began seeing the familiar blue-and-white medical masks left behind everywhere: \"Just like water bottles we hold in our hands, these are something we wear on our faces that are now part of our daily lives.\"\n\nNearby, Marchetty installed two picnic pods he created from metals and wood he salvaged in Camden, as well as a two-seat pod made from wheelbarrows he found.\n\nSchachter said she was initially puzzled by the seats, as they face away from the river and the installation. But then it occurred to her that was by design: \"It's the perfect selfie spot, and we want people to interact with this. It's a perfect complement.\"\n\nShe's also pleased the installation boasts not only the sweeping river, Philadelphia skyline and Benjamin Franklin Bridge views; it's also next to a playground.\n\n\"Kids find fun in anything, and we saw a kid and invited him in, and immediately he started spinning around. It was really great to see how a child reacts to something abstract like this, and made it fun.\"\n\nMechan 11: The Collector\n\n1599 East State St.\n\nPeople who'd normally whiz by in their cars stopped to gawk, talk and photograph the giant robot sculpted from steel along State Street, right across from a former landfill-turned-park in progress in Cramer Hill.\n\nBefore they took time for a quick interview, in fact, Jason Hutchinson and Tyler Fuqua stopped to chat and take a selfie with Diamond Thomas, a podcast and radio personality from North Camden, and Shirley Irizarry of Parents for Great Camden Schools.\n\nHutchinson and Fuqua assembled the robot using trash they'd salvaged, including a tub, tires and bucket from the wooded area next to the Centennial Village Apartments, where the Mechan 11 statue stands guard.\n\n\"It's legit Camden trash,\" said Fuqua, a Portland, Oregon, artist. Slung over the robot's right shoulder is a bag full of easily recognizable and oft-discarded items: a hot water heater, a milk crate, a water cooler jug and yes, a kitchen sink.\n\nThis robot has a heart, too, designed by a Creative Arts Morgan Village Academy student as part of a contest. That's not the only contest, either: Fuqua's Instagram page (@tyfu) has a coloring page featuring Mechan 11 as well.\n\nTold that the apartment complex is home to a lot of young families with children, Hutchinson smiled.\n\n\"People came over to the gate to see what we were doing,\" he said. \"A woman said she loved it, so we asked her to please look after it and she said she would. I hope they do, and I hope they like it and it becomes like a mascot for them.\"\n\nA New View is \"really an opportunity to reclaim the land and the environment, and change the perception of the city,\" Kolluri said. The temporary installations, he hopes, will have a long-lasting impact, not just in putting the problem of illegal dumping in the spotlight, but also in reshaping Camden residents' feelings about their city.\n\n\"People riding PATCO come from Collingswood and Lindenwold, and one of the first things they usually see is trash,\" said Meishka Mitchell, who along with her Cooper's Ferry colleague Vedra Chandler worked on the project.\n\n\"This will change their perceptions. They'll see something new, but hopefully it will also entice them to visit, to develop a new relationship with Camden. So much of what people think of Camden comes from news reports they saw 20 years ago. But that's not what Camden is today — there are great things happening here now.\"\n\nPhaedra Trethan has been a reporter and editor in South Jersey since 2007 and has covered Camden since 2015.

Brumfield\n\nSpecial to The News Leader\n\nRichmond shut down May 29, 1890 as 50,000 residents mingled with an estimated 50,000 visitors to witness the unveiling of the Robert E. Lee Monument beside a tobacco field owned by William C. Allen on the western outskirts of town.\n\nThe Lee Monument was certainly the most eagerly anticipated memorial to the Confederate “Lost Cause” but not the first. Richmond’s original memorial was a 90-ft high stone pyramid in Hollywood Cemetery dedicated in November, 1869. In October, 1875 several English donors funded a Stonewall Jackson monument at Capitol Square.\n\nSince General Lee was firmly opposed to placing statues to confederate leaders, fundraising for his memorial did not begin until after his death in October, 1870. A group of Richmond women formed the Ladies Lee Monument Association, and began soliciting churches not just in Richmond but all over the South.\n\nAt the same time, Lt. General Jubal Early organized the Soldiers Lee Monument Association and in 1874 held a competitive exhibition of scale models, to which the ladies (and their much-needed funds) were invited. None of the models, however, were “worthy of the object.”\n\nDuring reconstruction fundraising was all but nonexistent, therefore on March 20, 1877, the ladies turned a huge sum of $14,993 over to the Governor, Treasurer and Auditor of Virginia for safekeeping. In 1887, when the monument was becoming a reality, the Ladies Association again solicited proposals and offered a $2,000 first prize. With the submissions displayed in a giant hall in Washington D.C., the awards committee awarded first and second prize to “Mr. Niehaus of Ohio and Mr. Ezekial of Richmond.”\n\nHowever, hidden among the submissions was another work by a French sculptor named Jean Antonin Mercié that while showing a “misconception of General Lee’s character,” was considered a work of genius. Subsequent models provided by Mercié led to a final contract with a Board of Managers led by Gov. Fitzhugh Lee.\n\nThe cornerstone of the massive pedestal, designed by Pujot, a French architect, was laid in October, 1887. It has a copper time capsule containing newspapers, confederate money, a muster role of Virginia sharpshooters, and numerous other memorabilia. An exterior bronze nameplate said only “Lee.”\n\nOn May 4, 1890 the cast statue arrived in five pieces at the Elba train station on Broad Street from New Jersey. According to the May 8, 1890 Richmond Dispatch, over 300 feet of rope was attached to the wagons carrying the pieces and over 10,000 people showed up to pull the pieces to the pedestal while lively strains of “Dixie” roused them to a fever pitch. Upon arrival the ropes were cut up for mementos.\n\nThree days and nights of torrential rain failed to dampen the enthusiasm of Richmonders, and as the big day approached the anticipation and hero worship became nothing short of fanatical. The entire city was draped in confederate flags and rebel decorations. Veterans, soldiers and citizens from every southern state gathered to fervently honor their unrivaled hero, and every hotel and rooming house was packed past capacity.\n\nThe parade started at 12 noon and was four miles in length. At the draped monument, with mud slopping over shoetops, Gen. Early introduced Col. Archer Anderson, who delivered a rambling oration that began “A people carves its own in the monuments of its great men.”\n\nAt the conclusion, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston pulled a rope and dropped the veil. “A great cheer rose from thousands of throats,” gushed writer A. Christian Asbury. “Cannons boomed and muskets roared. Many of the old soldiers wept as they looked upon their honored and beloved commander on Traveller.”\n\nThe black-owned Richmond Planet newspaper and northern media, however, were heavily critical of the Lee Monument and especially the slavish passion surrounding it. “This glorification of States Rights Doctrine – the right of secession, and the honoring of men who represented that cause…will ultimately result in handing down to generations unborn a legacy of treason and blood…” wrote the Planet. New York Commander George Hussey, protesting his regiment’s presence at the event, presciently wrote that “the erection of permanent monuments to the late Confederate belligerents … tends to perpetuate and justify to future generations a rebellion that was causeless, unnecessary and reckless …and we believe all official recognition of such monuments to be officially inconsistent, in bad faith to the constitution of the land, illegal, and should be enjoined by State or national authority.”\n\nDale Brumfield can be reached at dalebrumfield@protonmail.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/business/cheetos-statue-alberta-canada-trnd/index.html", "title": "Canadian hamlet unveils 17-foot Cheeto dust statue | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe bright orange, sticky residue that Cheetos leave on your fingertips has now been immortalized – by a 17-foot statue in Alberta, Canada.\n\nThe Cheetos brand erected the statue of a hand holding a massive Cheeto, complete with orange fingertips, in Cheadle, Alberta. The community was chosen because of its name’s similarity to “cheetle,” the company’s official name for Cheeto dust, according to a news release from Cheetos.\n\n“Cheetos fans have always known that the delicious, cheesy dust on their fingertips is an unmistakably delicious part of the Cheetos experience, but now it officially has a name: Cheetle,” said Lisa Allie, the senior marketing director at PepsiCo Foods Canada, which distributes Cheetos in the country.\n\n“We’re excited to be celebrating Cheetle and Canadians’ cheesy, Cheetle-dusted fingertips on such a grand scale and in such a uniquely mischievous way.”\n\nThe statue stands almost 17 feet tall.\n\nBut the unique piece of art won’t stay in Cheadle forever, according to the news release.

Phil Murphy's goal of legalizing recreational marijuana for adults.\n\nThe Honig Act would revamp nearly every aspect of the medical marijuana process, from qualifying for the program to purchasing cannabis.\n\nThe new actions don't impact other parts of the bill.\n\nAt an unrelated news conference in Hackensack, Murphy said the expansion would show compassion to thousands of people. When he took office, he said, there were about 17,000 people enrolled in the medical marijuana program. Now there are about 47,000.\n\n“It will mean an enormous difference for patients,” Murphy said. “We have a demand-supply imbalance.”\n\nMore:NJ marijuana black market: 13 arrested in police bust of Jersey City 'pop-up' event\n\nMore:I spent a night in the NJ marijuana black market. The illegal weed business is booming.\n\nThe announcement ran into immediate opposition from the two Democratic leaders of the Legislature. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester, said the Honig bill leaves it to an oversight board to decide the proper number of facilities to serve the demand.\n\n\"The governor shouldn’t be ignoring what is a good plan and he shouldn’t be ignoring the agreement he has with the Legislature,\" said Sweeney, who is feuding with Murphy, a fellow Democrat, on a number of fronts. \"That’s a bad practice and is becoming a bad habit of his.”\n\nIn response, a spokeswoman for Murphy said \"there was no agreement on the bill as currently written.\"\n\n“Patients cannot continue to wait for access to life-changing medical treatment, and today’s announcement is an important step toward ensuring sustainable and affordable access,\" Alyana Alfaro said in an email. \"The Department of Health is overseeing the expansion of the Medicinal Marijuana Program to ensure that it is done responsibly and in a way that puts the needs of patients first.\"\n\nSweeney was not alone. Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, D-Middlesex, said he was \"disappointed\" by Murphy's action.\n\n\"For over a year, the Legislature has worked tirelessly with this administration in an effort to create a responsible and accessible medicinal cannabis market,\" Coughlin said in a statement. \"The Legislature understands the obstacles many suffering from critical and chronic illnesses are facing and will undoubtedly remain committed to move forward with legislation that will expand access to medical cannabis in a safe, accessible, and regulated market.\"\n\nNew Jersey legalized medical marijuana nearly 10 years ago under Gov. Jon Corzine. The program was rolled out slowly by Corzine's successor, Gov. Chris Christie, leaving some patients needing to drive an hour to the nearest dispensary.\n\nWhen Murphy took office, the state had five Alternative Treatment Centers, which grow, manufacture and sell marijuana. One more has opened since then. And another six were approved last year by the Health Department, but have yet to open.\n\nMORE: NJ tax fight: Does Phil Murphy have another shot at the millionaire's tax?\n\nMORE: Murphy seeks resignation of board members in charge of tax incentives\n\nThe Murphy administration also has expanded the illnesses and conditions, including anxiety and migraines, that qualify for marijuana treatment. Murphy said about 3,000 people are joining the program each month.\n\nTo keep up with the demand, the Murphy administration said Monday it will seek applications for up to 24 cultivators, 30 manufacturers and 54 dispensaries — a sign that the medical marijuana chain will no longer need to be confined to a single location.\n\nThe operators would be spread statewide: 38 in northern New Jersey, 38 in the central region and 32 in the southern region.\n\nAnd their sizes would range from 5,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet, giving small businesses a chance to compete with larger operators, officials said.\n\nThe department said applications will be available beginning July 1 and will be due Aug. 15. It will host a webinar on July 16 to answer questions.\n\nThe expansion of the medical marijuana program could help the industry create an infrastructure to support recreational marijuana, if it is legalized down the road.\n\n\"There’s going to be a concern in licensing a medical dispensary, (with towns asking,) 'Is this going to become an adult use?'” said Paul Josephson, an attorney with Duane Morris in Cherry Hill, who represents the New Jersey Cannabis Industry Association.\n\n\"Municipalities will be able to control that,\" he said. \"You're still going to have to convince the town and the community to accept recreational sales.”\n\nWeed wars\n\nWhat’s going on with New Jersey’s push toward legal weed?

The gear is meant to protect them and make the mounts stand out if they have to push through and disperse a massive, rowdy crowd.\n\nThe horses, both Tennessee Walking Horses, face the biggest assignment of their careers: Policing the NFL draft in Detroit on Thursday and again on Saturday.

At no point did the crowd rival the sardine-esque packing of fans who came out Thursday for Big Sean. But by the time the draft resumed, standing fans − the vast majority wearing Lions gear − crammed in to the available space in front of the draft stage.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the crowd tonight is 230,000, within 100,000 of the draft's record attendance.\n\n—Dave Boucher\n\n'Primetime' vibe in Motor City\n\nBeing drafted was great, but it's what came after that really had new Detroit Lions cornerback Terrion Arnold feeling his emotions.\n\n\"Just to hear them chanting my name last night, I’ve always dreamed of moments like that as a kid,\" Arnold said at his introductory news conference Friday. \"I’ve considered myself like a fan favorite. I’ve always wanted the rep that, when they show up to games on Mondays, Thursdays or Sundays, I just get the name that, 'I don’t know what’s going to happen today, but I feel like Terrion is going to do something incredible.'\"\n\nOne of the last players in the green room Thursday, Arnold was greeted with thunderous cheers from an estimated crowd of 275,000 when the hometown Lions traded up five spots to take him with the 24th pick in the draft.\n\nCheck out the full story here.\n\n—Dave Birkett\n\nMax capacity reached\n\nThe NFL draft is pausing entry for visitors because maximum crowd capacity has been reached, according to an alert just before 6:45 p.m. Friday.\n\nVisitors who can't get in are advised to visit Grand Circus Park or other Draft in the D viewing parties.\n\nCapacity was reached Thursday as well, prompting officials to close the event to additional attendees. The Thursday alert came shortly before 7 p.m., and the closure led to frustration from some fans who were turned away. Attendance for the first day, however, was a record setter at 275,000 people.\n\n—Eric D.

Kellen Kaniecki should have been in Canada.\n\nBut for these die-hard fans of the Detroit Lions and the NFL, it was no choice at all: They had to be in the Motor City on a sunny Friday to experience the 2024 NFL draft.\n\n“Being part of the NFL draft here in Detroit, especially after the season we just had here, the energy in this entire town is just amazing. So, I didn't want to miss out on this,” Wilson said.\n\nWilson, 27, of West Bend, Wisconsin, was slated to walk to get her degree in manufacturing engineering from Michigan Technological University. But the NFL draft felt more important for the lifelong Lions fan, who attended the festivities in a blue graduation cap with the words ”skipped graduation for the draft.\"\n\nThe wardrobe choice did not go unnoticed: She ran into NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday, who congratulated her when he saw her mortarboard.\n\nShe wasn't the only one to make the trek from Up North. Jayden Pascual is from Saginaw, but the 19-year-old freshman at Michigan Tech asked his dad to make the roughly seven-hour trip early to pick him from school so he and his brother Jeamy Pascual could make it to the draft on Friday.\n\n\"I kind of finished my last exam (Wednesday night) and just threw all my stuff in bags, packed it up and was like, 'all right, let's go, draft time!\" Jayden said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n—Dave Boucher, Dana Afana, Nushrat Rahman and Phoebe Wall Howard\n\nFastest access is at Jefferson and Randolph\n\nFolks trying to get into the draft area are being advised that they can save time getting inside by going to Entry 1 at Jefferson and Randolph.

Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain, where young people have played; weddings and engagements have been held, and now NFL draft memories in Detroit have been made.\n\n—Christina Hall\n\nOut-of-towners warm to Detroit\n\nSignificant time, effort and money went into spiffing up downtown Detroit to look its best for the hundreds of thousands of visitors dropping in for the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nAnd some early reviews are now in.\n\nFor many of the event's out-of-state visitors, the city of Detroit — still less than a decade out of bankruptcy — exceeded their expectations for liveliness, hospitality, restaurants and development activity, as well as general friendliness, according to numerous on-the-street interviews Friday.\n\n\"It’s much better than the reputation,\" said Garnet McDonald, 56, who was visiting from outside Toronto.\n\nMcDonald was last in Detroit about seven years ago, when downtown Detroit was already on the rebound path. But he said there seems to be even more businesses around now, as well as more stuff to do.\n\n“It seems more vibrant,\" said McDonald, who attended the draft with his 25-year-old son, Evan, both donning New York Jets jerseys. \"The biggest takeaway for me is just the friendliness of the people. Every storefront, every Uber driver, everybody we’ve experienced has been great.”\n\nMiami residents Pedro and Zaida Mesa were on their first-ever visit to Detroit. They said they felt safe in downtown, really enjoyed strolling the RiverWalk and had had great dining experiences at Central Kitchen + Bar, Niki's Pizza and The Hudson Cafe.\n\n\"We didn’t think it was going to be so good,\" Pedro Mesa, 56, said. \"Not only for the sports, but the city has been great.”\n\n— JC Reindl\n\nLearn a life-saving skill at draft\n\nFootball fans can learn how to perform compression- or hands-only CPR at the NFL draft.\n\nAt an American Heart Association tent along the Detroit River hundreds have stopped by for some training, said Jim Myers, CPR manager for the Southwest U.S. who was helping out with the training Friday afternoon.\n\n“They can save a life with just their hands and calling 911,” he said\n\nBuffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin’s cardiac arrest on the field during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals last year prompted the heart association to partner with the NFL. Hamlin is scheduled to join Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Saturday for a bill signing and press conference in Detroit to support measures to prevent sudden cardiac death among youth athletes in Michigan, according to the heart association.\n\n“We are building our nation of lifesavers,” said Yolana Wakefield-Wilson, the heart association’s community CPR manager for the Midwest.\n\nDuring the training in the tent, children and adults have been practicing CPR on dummies, pressing their hands down to the tune of “Staying Alive” by the Bee Gees. It's a song commonly used in CPR trainings to demonstrate the rhythm of compressions.\n\n—Clara Hendrickson and Paul Egan\n\nSanders on tap\n\nDetroit Lions legend Barry Sanders, now retired, took to X (formerly Twitter) just now to showcase his suds-pouring skills at the draft in downtown Detroit.\n\nThe NFL superstar had a rockier road with a local brewing company nearly four years ago. The Free Press reported in December 2020 that \"Sanders threatened legal action for his likeness appearing on the can when it was announced in November.\" Eastern Market Brewing Co. pulled the cans and re-released beer, “Same Old Lager,” without the Sanders' likeness.\n\n—Phoebe Wall Howard and Matthew Dolan\n\nStores outside Detroit also seeing boost from draft\n\nKatie Clouse, head cashier at Dunham’s Sports in Fort Gratiot Township, said shoppers from across the Blue Water Bridge in Sarnia, Canada and throughout the area were stopping to pick up Detroit Lions T-shirts, sweatshirts, jerseys and ballcaps on Thursday and Friday. A few stopped on their way to the NFL Draft activity in Detroit, which is an hour from the store on I-94.\n\n“We had somebody who tried to get in yesterday and it was sold out,” Clouse said Friday. “She bought a T-shirt and a hat and said she planned to try and go again today. I just told her, ‘Good luck!’”\n\n-Phoebe Wall Howard\n\nDraft featured Wheelchair Football All Star game\n\nJason Rainey, a Flint native, led a team of Army veterans to a 20-6 victory over Navy and Marine veterans Friday morning.\n\nHe did it from his wheelchair.\n\nThe first ever USA Wheelchair Football League (USAWFL) All Star game took place at Huntington Place as part of the events during the NFL draft.\n\n“People think they’re coming out here, they hear wheelchair football they think it’s just you know, a bunch of people pushing slow, they can barely move their chairs. It’s not like that at all, we got actual athletes out here,” Rainey said. “They still are competitive, they want to play sports, they just do it from a chair.”\n\nRainey, who played quarterback for the Army All Star team, now resides in Fort Worth. He became disabled while on tour where he was shot in the foot. Rainey discovered adaptive sports through basketball. When he heard the USAWFL was being created, he couldn’t wait to play the sport he loves.\n\nRainey is slated announce the second-round pick for the Dallas Cowboys at tonight’s continuation of the NFL Draft.Prior to the game starting, there were a few activities for visitors to check out, including throwing drills that tested accuracy, range and targeting skills. In all of the activities, participants were required to sit and use only their upper body strength.\n\nSeong-Hee Westlake, 35 of Ann Arbor, is the director of technology and innovation for the University of Michigan’s Adaptive and Inclusive Sports Experience. Westlake participated in the accuracy throwing challenge and said it reminded her of Quidditch, the sport from the Harry Potter franchise.\n\n“It’s harder than you think it is,” Westlake noted that sitting made it harder to twist her waist.“It’s a level playing field once you’re sitting down,” she said. “If you’re a chair user, you know how to use your core strength.”\n\nAs the game began, players yelled for the ball against the clanking of chairs crashing into one another – even.“Go Army!” yelled Victoria Smith, 66 of Detroit, who wore an army green sweatshirt. Friday was the first time she saw the sport in person.\n\n“I love it,” Smith said.\n\n-Eric Guzman\n\nLions great Billy Sims signs autographs on Woodward\n\nFormer Lions running back and 1978 Heisman Trophy winner Billy Sims stood at the corner of Woodward Avenue and State Street signing autographs for fans Friday. Under a red tent labeled “Billy Sims Barbecue,” he signed small collector Oklahoma Sooners helmets.\n\nChicago Bears fan Patrick Kovacs, 53 of Ohio, stumbled upon the signing stand and was excited to snag an autograph.\n\n“I grew up watching him on TV. One of my favorite players back in the day. I love the old time running backs,” he said of Sims. He plans to add the signed helmet to his collection of football memorabilia.\n\nAs a lifelong football fan, Kovacs said he’s loved the draft. It’s like Christmas for devotees of the sport.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nDad takes son out of school to enjoy NFL draft Experience\n\nBryan Ciesielski, 47, of Port Huron, who works in quality control for manufacturing, took his son Beckett out of his 6th grade classes so they could make a day together at the NFL draft in Detroit. They’re staying with friends in a condo next to Little Caesars Arena on Woodward Avenue, just a 10-minute walk to the action downtown.\n\nBeckett, 11, wore a Lions Aidan Hutchinson jersey and found the last Jared Goff jersey on a quick shopping spree in Dunham’s in Port Huron. “This is my first time,” Beckett said. “It’s just, like, an experience!”\n\nHis father, pulling a LaPorta jersey off the rack, said, “I think, years from now, he’s going to look back on this and say, ‘Wow, I went to the draft in Detroit. How cool is that?’ We never pull him out of school for anything, so I think that tells you something right there, how big of a deal this is.”\n\nCiesielski said he planned to go down on the first day of the draft until the NFL app alerted him that access had been capped because the crowd was reaching capacity. “It’s pretty good communication,” he said, showing the messages on his mobile phone.\n\n“We’ve been to a Lions game, but it was years ago, before the Lions were good,” he said. “This is gonna be a new experience for us … We’re going to be cheering on the team and looking for who else the Lions can pick up in the draft. Go Lions! Let’s go!”\n\n-Phoebe Wall Howard\n\nYou have a chance to wear Barry Sanders' varsity jacket\n\nThe blue varsity jacket Barry Sanders wore on the draft stage Thursday is for sale, but it will take a little bit of luck if you want one of your own.\n\nOnly 144 jackets were made, according to a news release, which features Sanders’ nickname 'Big Bad Barry' on the right sleeve, Sanders' No. 20 on the front and the Detroit Lions' helmet logo on either side. The back replicates Sanders' Detroit Lions football jersey.\n\nThe jacket was designed in collaboration with Sanders by the apparel brand HOMAGE and the clothing manufacturer Starter.\n\nThe jackets costs $425 and consumers have to enter the raffle for a chance to purchase a jacket online. The raffle closes at 5 p.m. Tuesday. The people who are selected to purchase a jacket will be chosen later on Tuesday, at which time their credit cards will be charged and the jackets will be shipped.\n\n-Adrienne Roberts\n\nDraft marks a homecoming for some Lions fans\n\nFriends Art Walker, 55, and Joel Ewing, 48, both born and raised in Detroit, showed up to the NFL draft Friday to represent their hometown. Walker, who moved to Georgia a year ago to soak in warmer temperatures, said the draft being in his hometown means a lot to him.\n\n“It means a lot to bring the city up. Not that we've been down. It just gets everybody to get a better perspective of Detroit, because a lot of people got a different perception about Detroit. There’s a lot of things here to do. It’s a great place,” Walker said.\n\nEwing said he's a decades-long fan who has followed Lions legend Billy Sims, who was signing autographs downtown Friday.\n\n“They could have chosen any city to rep this draft, but Detroit has built up wonderfully. It’s a great place to come, great place to visit. Don’t listen to the media, those days are long gone. Welcome to Detroit,” Ewing said.\n\n-Dana Afana\n\nAppearance by Lions stars wows crowd\n\nJust after 2 p.m. Friday, a pair of elite Detroit Lions garnered chants and cheers at the NFL Draft Experience in Hart Plaza.\n\nRunning back Jahmyr Gibbs, a first-round pick last year, and star wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown made their way through the crowd on golf carts. Fans waved and cheered, while several chased after the carts.\n\nSt. Brown, who recently signed a massive contract extension, was swarmed when he briefly stopped to let a few fans take selfies.\n\nEven though it was a brief encounter, the Lions faithful roared for both guys.\n\n-Dave Boucher\n\nFans wait in line for giant Lions helmet\n\nMore than 50 eager fans lined up to take a picture with an oversized Lions helmet — a much longer wait than any of the other team helmets.\n\nBut Jeffry Savage, 67 of Southfield, wasn’t in Honolulu blue. Instead, he was decked out in a red and white New York Giants jersey.\n\n“I’ve been a Giants fan since I was a teenager,” said Savage, who is originally from New York.\n\nHe said he was in line for the Detroit helmet because his wife is a Lions fan.\n\n“The whole experience has been wonderful,” he said. “The city of Detroit is beautiful and whoever is not here, they’ve missed something spectacular.”\n\nAllan Van Ess, who was also in line to take a picture with the helmet, drove to Detroit from Grand Rapids with his partner.\n\nVan Ess, who grew up a Lions fan because of his dad, was dressed as a Lion — mane, fur, paws and all.\n\n“We can’t wait for the season to start,” he said.\n\n-Nushrat Rahman\n\nTips for avoiding long food lines\n\nFor a lower key NFL draft experience, downtown Detroit parks offer football fans a variety of food options, vendor booths and games. Not to mention some great DJs blasting some very danceable funk.\n\nSmall business vendors at the parks sold a variety of merchandise such as jewelry and candles.\n\nWhile food lines at Hart Plaza grew long Thursday night, causing long waits for meals, the food trucks and stands selling lemonade, Bundt cakes, lobster rolls and more.\n\nThere was no line for some booze at the bar at Grand Circus Park. And a Meijer-sponsored giant cornhole and football throwing games had no wait.\n\nOther “Draft Day in the D” locations include:\n\nCapitol Park\n\nBeacon Park\n\nParadise Valley Beatrice Buck Park\n\nWoodward Avenue between State and Witherell streets\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nScooters in high demand in downtown Detroit\n\nJust as the NFL draft crowd broke an attendance record Thursday, Lime said Friday the NFL's big event is also shattering ridership records for its shared e-scooters.\n\nThe company said it scaled up its fleet and deployed extra staff ahead of the draft and set up a tent downtown to help fans, according to a release.\n\nLime said riders set many records this week including:\n\nShattering the single day ridership record by an increase of 45% with 6,033 rides Thursday.\n\nSetting a single day record for gross bookings Thursday.\n\nShowing an Increase in scooter demand of 358% compared to last week.\n\nA ridership increased 665% compared to Wednesday.\n\nThe company said it recently was selected by the city to be a long-term transportation partner. Since its launch in Detroit in 2018, the company has had 335,000 riders who have taken 1.2 million rides, per the release.\n\nThe Free Press is checking with other e-scooter companies that operate downtown.\n\n-Christina Hall.\n\nQR codes not always scanned, but they are required\n\nMany fans have noticed the QR codes they received for the NFL Draft experience didn't get scanned when they entered the venue Thursday. But that doesn't mean the codes are not needed, officials say.\n\n“To expedite entry into the venue,” according to the NFL, “we did not scan OnePass QR code, but OnePass is still required to access all of the games and attractions inside Draft Experience presented by Rocket Mortgage.“\n\nThose who want to attend the NFL Draft Experience register for free entry by downloading the NFL OnePass app or going to NFL.com/DraftAccess. Adults can register up to five children to get into the event.You'd use the same QR code during all three days. But it's important to understand that the event is \"first come first serve and subject to capacity limits,\" according to the NFL.\n\n-Susan Tompor\n\nSkipping graduation for NFL draft\n\nKayla Wilson should be walking across the stage to get her master's degree today. Instead, she’s at the NFL draft in Detroit.\n\nThe lifelong Lions fan — in a blue graduation cap with the words ”skipped graduation for the draft” — said the experience was something she and her mom, as season ticket holders, were looking forward to since the draft was announced.\n\nWilson, 27, of West Bend, Wisconsin, was slated to be presented with her degree in manufacturing engineering from Michigan Technological University, but the NFL draft felt more important.\n\nMore:I spent the day at the 2024 NFL draft: What I discovered\n\n“I want to be with family and nothing's better than the one pride,” she said.\n\nWilson grew up in Center Line, Michigan and moved to Wisconsin in 2019. Still, the Lions pride runs deep.\n\n“Being part of the NFL draft here in Detroit, especially after the season we just had here, the energy in this entire town is just amazing. So, I didn't want to miss out on this,” Wilson said.\n\nHer mom has been coming downtown to watch the countdown of the NFL draft clock. The highlight of her draft experience, Wilson said, was running into NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday, when he saw her graduation cap and congratulated her.\n\nIn her Barry Sanders jersey and graduation cap, Wilson was all smiles on day two of the NFL draft, as the sun beamed, and fans walked around Spirit Plaza.\n\n“I've been through the bad years and the good years and it's just showing that tenacity that we've had … then last year, watching the team grow, the energy just kept building and building and building and it was just amazing to watch,” Wilson said.\n\n-Nushrat Rahman\n\nLions fans celebrate first draft pick\n\nAt the start of another sunny spring day in Detroit for the NFL draft, longtime Lions fans celebrated their team’s Thursday night pick and remarked on how unusual it feels to enter a season with their team transformed.\n\nTaniya Luckett, 26, of Detroit, said she’s rooted for the Lions her entire life.\n\n“Because I was born here,” she said at Hart Plaza, \"it’s second nature.”\n\nShe said she was excited to see the Lions pick Terrion Arnold in the first round last night. The Lions needed a cornerback, she said.\n\n“Our defense was like our biggest liability last season,” she said. “It feels weird because you’re so used to them being terrible.\"\n\nDenise McQueen, of Southfield, also celebrated the Lions’ first pick. A season ticket holder of about 40 years, she is still in awe of what happened last season.\n\n“Talk about incredible. It was incredible. It was great,” she said. “Last year was the best season ever.”\n\nShe said she’s trying to moderate her expectations moving forward. At least that’s what she’s telling others.\n\n“I’m not getting my hopes up. I’m not getting too excited. I’m saying that, but I am,” she said.\n\n-Clara Hendrickson\n\nFans are out in force again Friday morning\n\nAfter Thursday night's record attendance, NFL fans appeared to be turning out in strong numbers again Friday, heading to the NFL Draft Experience before actual draft selections resume Friday evening.\n\nShortly before noon, there were already more patrons waiting to get on the QLINE at the Ferry Street platform than the streetcar could accommodate.\n\n-Anjanette Delgado\n\nCelebrate the Lions' epic season withthe Detroit Free Press' new commemorative book: “From Grit to Glory: The Epic Story of the Detroit Lions’ 2023 Renaissance.\" Order now atLions.PictorialBook.com!\n\nFollow the Detroit Free Press on Instagram (@detroitfreepress), TikTok (@detroitfreepress), YouTube (@DetroitFreePress), Twitter/X (@freep), and LinkedIn, and like us on Facebook (@detroitfreepress).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/26"}]}

Executive Director Suzanne Thurman identified it as a pilot whale but has been unavailable to provide further information. Coast TV reports the whale has since died.\n\nRobin Emerick, of Cumberland, Maryland, and her daughter, Katrina Cooper, of Frostburg, Maryland, have a camper in Ocean View and visit Delaware Seashore regularly. They were on the north beach near the inlet Monday.\n\nThe first sign of the whale was a fin sticking out of shallow waters next to the jetty, the 43-year-old Cooper said, and around 12:30 p.m. it got stuck between some rocks.\n\n\"A man ran in and was able to get it upright, but it just kept swimming into the rocks,\" Cooper said. \"Another younger man jumped in and physically pulled the whale out into the water.\"\n\nMore:Lucky dog rescued from tree overhanging the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal Sunday\n\nThe people who got close to the whale told her there were large cuts down its back, she said.

Emerick's video shows Thurman and beachgoers working together to lift the whale into a vehicle. It was about 6 or 7 feet long, according to Cooper.\n\nIn May, a 50-foot fin whale beached itself and died at Delaware Seashore.

The excitement surrounding U.S. President Joe Biden as he withdrew from the presidential race at his home near Rehoboth Beach has died down, and there's been no major crime reported by police in the beach towns for a few weeks.\n\nWhat has been reported are marine wildlife sightings. Keep your eyes on the water while you're lying on the beach, even if your beach time may be limited this weekend as Hurricane-turned-Tropical-Storm Debby's remnants impact the area.\n\nThe White House announced late Wednesday that Joe and Jill Biden will return to Rehoboth Thursday night. Usually, they stick to their home in North Shores, but if they go out, there will be impacts to the area.\n\nRead on to find out for all you need to know about this weekend at the Delaware beaches.\n\nWeather\n\nBefore you declare your vacation ruined, keep in mind, this is an early forecast that will likely change. Storms often come and go quickly, with good beach time in between.\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting an 80% chance of rain Thursday and Thursday night, and a 70% chance Friday and Friday night.\n\nSaturday is expected to be partly sunny, but with a 60% chance of rain.\n\nAs a consolation, Sunday's looking like a good beach day, sunny with only a 30% chance of rain.\n\nMore:Belhaven Hotel plan, set to transform Rehoboth Beach boardwalk, approved with conditions\n\nWildlife\n\nDolphins are a common sight from the shores of the Delaware beaches; their fins often breach the water as they swim along the coast, and occasionally, you'll see them jump.\n\nAt this time are year, there are jellyfish, of course, and beachgoers will see a variety shorebirds and crabs. If you've never been present for a tourist's first time seeing a horseshoe crab (or 100, as is more likely), I highly recommend it.\n\nYet, there's so many more magnificent creatures that exist just below the surface of the oceans and bays, and at this time of year, they remind us.\n\nRelated:Enjoying the warm water? So are the jellyfish. Types you'll see and what to do if stung\n\nLast week, a juvenile harbor seal was seen resting on the beach by Cape Shores in Lewes. That's unusual — seals are usually only in Delaware waters in the winter months.\n\nOn Monday, the Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute, a local nonprofit that handles marine strandings, responded to Delaware Seashore State Park for a beached pilot whale. They transported it from the scene but it did not survive, reports say.\n\nIn June, paddleboarders in Bethany Beach had a once-in-a-lifetime encounter with a humpback whale, and in May, a fin whale beached and died in Delaware Seashore State Park.\n\nIf you come across a stranded marine animal, report it to MERR at 302-228-5029.\n\nAnd a reminder: The Point at Cape Henlopen is closed at this time of year for nesting shorebirds. It's roped off, but people often disregard the signs and those coming in by boat may be unaware. You can still spot brown pelicans, American oystercatchers and piping plovers from the open portion of the beach.\n\nThings to do\n\nThe good news is that there is plenty to do in the area when weather prohibits going to the beach.\n\nHere are a few things off the top of this reporter's head.\n\nThere's also a myriad of live entertainment to take in. In addition to the free concerts most Delaware beach towns host all summer long, here are the major events this weekend:\n\nThe 2024 Zap World Championships of Skimboarding will take place Friday, Saturday and Sunday starting at 9 a.m. on Dewey Beach at McKinley Street. alleyoopskim.com.\n\nThe Great Kaplan will perform nightly at Dickens Parlour Theatre in Ocean View through Sunday. dickensparlourtheatre.com.\n\nGrace Potter will play Wednesday, Alabama will play Thursday and Preservation Hall Jazz Band will play Saturday at Freeman Arts Pavilion in Selbyville, all at 7 p.m. freemanarts.org.\n\nClear Space Theatre Company in Rehoboth Beach will present \"Jersey Boys\" Wednesday and Thursday and \"Rock of Ages\" Friday and Saturday, all at 7:30 p.m. clearspacetheatre.org.\n\nThe Amish Outlaws will play Paradise Grill in Long Neck at 8 p.m. Saturday. paradisegrillde.com\n\nTaking Back Sunday will play the Bottle and Cork in Dewey Beach at 8 p.m. Sunday. bottleandcork.com.\n\nMore:Lucky dog rescued from tree overhanging the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal Sunday\n\nAlso this week is the inaugural Inland Bays Oyster Week, with activities nearly every day and, on Saturday, the first-ever Delaware Seafood Festival in Millsboro. Visit delawareseafoodfestival.com for details.\n\nWith the weather forecast this weekend, make sure events are still proceeding as planned before heading out.\n\nBiden's back\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday night that Joe and Jill Biden will be in Wilmington Thursday evening and then head to Rehoboth, with their arrival planned for 9:10 p.m. How long they'll stay has not yet been indicated.\n\nBased on the 30 minutes they're scheduled to get Rehoboth from Wilmington, the President and First Lady will travel by helicopter. Marine One lands in the parking lot of Gordon's Pond in Cape Henlopen State Park, right around the corner from the Bidens' North Shores home. The park closes at sunset so there will be no impact to the public.\n\nIf you're hoping to catch a glimpse of the President, your chances are pretty limited. The Secret Service blocks off roads surrounding his home.\n\nMore:Joe Biden makes historic decision in 'Nation's Summer Capital,' Rehoboth Beach\n\nIf Biden is still in town Saturday, it's likely he'll attend the 5:30 p.m. mass at St. Edmond's Roman Catholic Church on King Charles Avenue. Otherwise, he has biked the Gordon's Pond trail numerous times since becoming president. He's gone to the beach and out to eat a few times, and once, he went to the movies.\n\nIf the Bidens do go out, they will of course be accompanied by a Secret Service motorcade.

In an ocean filled with predators and scavengers, as well as the sun beating down on hot days, it can often be a challenge to get good enough tissue and fluid samples to figure out what happened.\n\nWhen MERR experts can do a full necropsy of the animal, which is akin to an autopsy, the carcass is then composted, Thurman said. In other cases, especially when something like a whale washes ashore and is too heavy to be relocated, it will be buried safely on the beach so it can take a new place in the beach ecosystem and food web.\n\nThurman said she was able to gather some samples from an adult striped dolphin that recently washed ashore at Middlesex Beach, between Bethany and South Bethany beaches.\n\n“That’s more unusual,” she said of seeing a striped dolphin. The last time Thurman saw a striped dolphin wash ashore in Delaware was in 2002, when five were stranded at the Indian River Inlet during a strong snow storm, she said.\n\nThe 12 dead dolphins MERR has responded to so far this year included eight bottlenose dolphins, three harbor porpoises, one common dolphin and one striped dolphin. Some were found along Delaware Bay beaches in the area of Bowers Beach and Slaughter Beach in late April while others were found along the ocean beaches.\n\nA 13th dolphin could have been added to the list when it washed ashore in Lewes on Sunday, but MERR experts didn’t get a chance to check it out because beachgoers pushed it back into the water, Thurman said.\n\nMore:Are dolphins fish or mammals? Both\n\nMore:Site helps scientists track dolphins in Chesapeake Bay\n\nPeople certainly mean well,” she said, urging people to never touch a dead or stranded marine animal. “If an animal is stranding onshore, it means something is wrong with it and it needs assistance. The average person isn’t going to be trained to look for certain things that can give clues about the overall health of an animal.”\n\nIt’s also against the law to interact with protected marine mammals. That’s why people need to keep their distance, while in the water or on land, for their own safety and the safety of the animals.\n\n“They’re certainly out there living their lives and frolicking,” Thurman said. It may sound fun to swim with dolphins, but in the wild and at this time of year, mothers are nursing their calves and just a nudge from a 1,000-pound expert swimmer can mean bad news for the even the most skilled water-lover.\n\nIf a dolphin calf is struggling in the water, that’s a good sign that sharks also may be present. Anyone who spots a marine mammal or sea turtle stranded or in distress should keep their distance and call MERR’s 24-hour hotline at 302-228-5029.\n\nThurman said it’s quite common to see calves in the area in May and June. Bottlenose dolphins, one of the most common species along the Delaware coast, usually give birth to one calf at a time and are known to nurse them for three to six years.\n\nWhile deceased dolphins are sad news, the numbers are not out of the ordinary. This time last year, Thurman was concerned about an uptick in bottlenose dolphin strandings. Thirteen had washed ashore in a matter of a few weeks. No definitive common denominators were discovered, she said.\n\nThe most notable issue with dolphins stranding in Delaware was between 2013 and 2015, when a disease called Morbillivirus sparked an unusual mortality event among bottlenoses. During that event, more than 1,600 of them stranded along the East Coast from New York to Florida. Delaware saw 74 of those during that two-year span, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nMore:Two dead whales spotted off Virginia shore\n\nMore:When a dead whale raised more than a stink\n\nWhile it will be hard to say what happened to the dolphins found so far this year, it is likely a combination of natural causes and interactions with fisheries activities. Three adult dolphins found at the bay beaches did show signs of getting caught in fishing line, Thurman said.\n\nDelaware sees an annual average of about 17 strandings a year. Last year there were 21, she said.\n\nBut Delaware is not alone in dealing with these.\n\nEarlier this month in Florida, two dolphins stranded on the beach with their bellies full of trash. One, a male bottlenose dolphin, had eaten a 24-inch-long plastic shower hose, nozzle and all. The other, a female rough-toothed calf, was found to have two plastic bags and a balloon fragment in her stomach, according to the Fort Myers News-Press.\n\nPlastics pollution in the ocean will be the focus of MERR’s celebration of World Oceans Day on June 8. It will include a beach cleaning and guest speakers offering insight on how individuals can reduce their own footprint.

Here’s a look at each:\n\nStriped dolphin: This common species likes both inshore and offshore waters, where they are very active and can be seen breaching the water’s surface – sometimes jumping as high as 23 feet. They like to eat fish, squid and shrimp and male adults can reach 9 feet in length and 350 pounds.\n\nAtlantic bottlenose dolphin: This common species also likes shallower and deeper waters, where they are highly active, powerful swimmers. They also enjoy snacking on fish, squid and shrimp and can reach more than 12 feet in length and 1,400 pounds.\n\nAtlantic white-sided dolphin: This common species surfaces inshore and offshore waters every 10 to 15 seconds to breath, and are very social animals. They like to eat fish, squid and shrimp and can reach about 8 feet in length and weigh over 400 pounds.\n\nCommon dolphin: The common dolphin is – that’s right – common in Delaware waters, both deep and closer to shore. They are often found in large groups and some can be seen surfacing together. They eat fish and squid and can reach up to 8 feet in length and about 245 pounds as adults.\n\nRisso's dolphin: Also known as the gray or monk dolphin, this is another common species in inshore and offshore warm waters. They like to eat fish and squid and are one of the larger species, reaching up to 12.5 feet in length and weighing up to 1,100 pounds.\n\nAtlantic spotted dolphin: This sociable species is common in warm and tropical waters, where they feast on fish, squid and invertebrates. They can reach up to 7.5 feet in length and weigh up to 310 pounds.\n\nRough-toothed dolphin: This species is not seen breaching as strongly as other dolphin species and tends to stick to deeper, offshore waters. Found in warm and tropical waters around the world, they eat fish and squid and can reach up to 8.5 feet in length and weigh up to 330 pounds.Harbor porpoise: Technically not a dolphin, this common species of marine mammal likes cooler waters and are considered one of the smallest marine mammals. They eat fish, squid and shrimp and can reach just over 6 feet in length and about 145 pounds as adults.\n\nSource: MERR and NOAA\n\nHave an idea for a story about ocean life?

The OSV is currently closed at the 21.8 KM mark to allow the whale to be safely dealt with. At this time there are no obvious signs to the cause of death.\"\n\nAccording to officials, park service staff at Assateague Island National Seashore immediately contacted the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Stranding Response Program. The department is the lead agency for stranding response in the state of Maryland. It also consults with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and partners with other agencies such as the National Aquarium and Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\"As a land manger, Assateague Island National Seashore is responsible for carcass retrieval and ultimately, disposal. A necropsy is planned for Tuesday, 1/17 by staff from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources Stranding Response Program and the National Aquarium.\"\n\nStaff at Assateague Island National Seashore will use heavy equipment to move the whale to the upper part of the beach.

The carcass will smell for a while, but previous experience shows that the smell will not be a problem more than 50 yards or so from the actual location. All marine mammals, alive or dead, are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and collection of any parts is prohibited,\" said the social media post in a warning to the public.\n\nWhat might be killing whales along the East Coast?\n\nThis is far from the only recent instance of dead whales washing ashore as cases like an orca being found in Florida have caused many to speculate on the causes of death.\n\nCases from as close as North Carolina and as far north as New Jersey have also added to the debate the culprit might be offshore wind development and sonar use.\n\nStudies conducted by naval and other vessels in 2022 have found that while sonar is barely audible to humans, whales perceive it as a loud noise from which they escape — often to their peril. Among the most susceptible to fleeing noise are orcas, right, humpback, sperm, long-finned pilot and northern bottle-nosed whales.\n\nLast Friday, New Jersey and New York lawmakers at local, state and federal levels called for a temporary pause in ocean floor preparation work for offshore wind farms in New Jersey and New York after another dead whale washed ashore in the region.\n\nEnvironmental groups on those states decried the move as \"premature and unfounded\" despite the decision to pause development gaining traction among lawmakers. One of the seven whales found off the coast of New York and New Jersey in a little more than a month had apparently been struck by a vessel, according to the Marine Mammal Stranding Center.\n\nRIGHT WHALES:'Going to be tough': Fishermen sound off on expanded speed limits to protect right whales\n\nOn the Eastern Shore, the National Marine Fisheries Service, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, proposed a federal rule in October 2022 that would expand the current 10 knot speed restrictions along the East Coast on boats 65 feet and longer to include all boats 35 feet and longer to ensure safe passage for endangered right whales.\n\nState officials still warn that public notify the proper authorities in cases of a sea life washing ashore.\n\nDepending on whether you are in Maryland or Virginia, reports can be made with the Maryland Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Stranding Response Program at 1-800-628-9944 or the Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center Stranding Response Program at 757-385-7575.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/09/03/lewes-mobile-home-residents-still-dealing-septic-tank-leaks/5679437001/", "title": "Lewes mobile home residents still dealing with septic tank leaks", "text": "Almost two months after the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control ordered Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park in Lewes to fix septic systems that were continuously leaking raw sewage, it appears no substantial changes have been made at the park.\n\nThe department issued the park's owner a notice of violation on July 8, ordering them to pump septic systems frequently, submit pumping records, and, within 30 days, submit a detailed plan to connect to the Lewes sewer system.\n\nWhen asked for an update Aug. 13, spokeswoman Nikki Lavoie said only that the department continues to focus on Donovan Smith.\n\nWhen asked Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 whether the park had met the requirements of the notice of violation, such as to submit a plan in 30 days, she did not have an answer.\n\nSEPTIC LEAKS: Residents fear for safety, health\n\nIn the meantime, the septic tank in resident Joyce Horney’s yard overflowed Aug. 29, spraying sewage into the air, according to Horney and neighbors.\n\n“I don’t go over there, I don’t let my dog go over there,” she said. \"I'm not comfortable in my own yard.\"\n\nHorney only moved in to her Donovan Smith mobile home earlier this year and said no one informed her of the state of the septic systems.\n\n\"I live in fear of it backing up into my home,\" she said. \"I put toilet paper in a bag instead of flushing it. I have to watch when I use the washer and take a shower. I don't know if it's getting in the groundwater.\"\n\nA DNREC employee came to document the spill, Horney said.\n\nWhat's the hold up?\n\nDonovan Smith is considered the pilot project for Delaware’s Clean Water for Underserved Communities initiative, which leverages state funding to improve waste and drinking water systems in low-income communities.\n\nSo park co-owner Kenneth Burnham could be off the hook when it comes to paying over $2 million to connect the park to the Lewes sewer system – but his bank has to agree to it first.\n\nWhat’s preventing work from beginning, according to Lavoie, is Burnham’s inability to obtain subordination agreements from Wells Fargo.\n\nSubordination agreements establish the order in which multiple debts must be paid.\n\n'IT SMELLS LIKE AN OUTHOUSE:' Septic issues plague Lewes street\n\nBurnham obtained a lawyer to assist him with the agreements, Lavoie said, “because of DNREC’s increased enforcement pressure and warnings of legal action.”\n\nBurnham has not responded to repeated calls and emails.\n\nHe operates many business entities, including KDM Development or KDM Acquisitions. Including Donovan Smith, KDM owns six mobile home parks in Delaware, all in Sussex County, according to the company website.\n\nDonovan Smith is the only one to have faced enforcement action from DNREC within the past decade, but not the only one with wastewater problems.\n\n\"Complaints and inspections have led to conditions in some of these mobile home communities at times that have been raised to the owners and corrected without a violation notice,\" said another department spokesman, Michael Globetti.\n\nWhen asked for an update on Donovan Smith, Lavoie said the department “continues to focus” on the park, “both to address the septic issues in real time and connect the park to Lewes sewer.\"\n\nLEWES:Estimated 7,500+ gallons of sewage enters Lewes-Rehoboth Canal after multiple major clogs\n\nOther efforts\n\nIn the meantime, others doing what they can to force Burnham into compliance.\n\nSussex County Councilman Mark Schaeffer, whose district Donovan Smith lies in, has been vocal about how DNREC has handled the matter.\n\n\"DNREC has refused for the past 13 years to enforce the laws of the state and require the property owner to provide... a sewage system that works,” he said. “I strongly believe that if this was happening at the local country club, it would’ve been solved yesterday.”\n\nSussex County spokesman Chip Guy said the county is withholding new placement permits for homes in manufactured housing communities with known state wastewater violations, such as Donovan Smith.\n\nThe park lies in the legislative districts of Rep. Steve Smyk (R-Milton) and Sen. Ernie Lopez (R-Lewes).\n\n“As an executive branch agency, DNREC answers directly to the governor,\" Smyk said. \"If they are failing to discharge their responsibility towards the residents of the Donovan Smith Mobile Home Park, the governor needs to intercede on their behalf.\"\n\nLEWES:Whale that beached at Cape Henlopen State Park had significant parasitic infections\n\nDelaware Manufactured Home Owners Association President William Kinnick said what’s happening at Donovan Smith is a common problem in low-income communities.\n\n“When they put these homes in decades ago, the systems were only meant to work for like 10 years.

Extension Service coordinators in Colbert and Lauderdale counties said yields will depend on where the cornfields are located. The TimesDaily reported that farmers have been out in the fields harvesting for several weeks while the weather has been dry. Colbert County Extension Coordinator Danny McWilliams said that elevators are full – a sign of a good year with high yields. McWilliams said farmers are reporting yields of 170 to 200 bushels per acre. Dealona Bozeman, the grain originator at the Alabama Farmers Coop in Florence, said some farmers are nearing 300 bushels per acre.\n\nAlaska\n\nUtqiagvik: Residents of a northern Alaska community are set to vote on whether to impose the state’s first tax on most sodas and other sweetened drinks. The Anchorage Daily News reported Sunday that voters in Utqiagvik are scheduled to vote Tuesday on the proposed tax on drinks sold in the city. The proposed ordinance would impose a 1-cent tax per 1 ounce of soda, energy drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages sold in the community at the state’s northern tip. Officials said the tax on a 12-ounce can of soda would be 12 cents. A bottle holding 20 ounces would be taxed 20 cents. Officials said the tax does not cover 100% fruit or vegetable juices, milk products, medicinal drinks, baby formula, weight-loss drinks, or alcohol.\n\nArizona\n\nYuma: University of Arizona scientists are embarking on a multiyear study of the Yuma region in the wake of last year’s E. coli outbreak. The group will be partnering with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, state agriculture officials and local growers to look at the environment and practices in the nation’s “winter vegetable capital.” The University of Arizona announced the effort in a release. Researchers with the UofA Cooperative Extension hope to come away with recommendations for growers. They will collect samples of water, sediment and animal fecal matter. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a 2018 outbreak linked to romaine lettuce was responsible for five deaths and the sickening of 200 others. The lettuce was traced to Yuma. Investigators said the bacteria spread through tainted irrigation water.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock Motorists will pay more to put fuel in their vehicles when new sales taxes go into effect to help maintain roads and highways. Legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson in March will raise $95 million for highway funding and raises fuel taxes in the state for the first time in 20 years. The increase goes into effect on Tuesday. The gas tax will rise by 3 cents to 24.5 cents a gallon and the tax on diesel fuel will increase 6 cents to 28.5 cents per gallon. The new law also taps into at least $35 million in expected revenue from casinos voters approved last year and imposes an additional registration fee on electric and hybrid vehicles. The fee for electric vehicles will increase by $200.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: A Southern California resident has been hospitalized after being stung by bees more than 100 times. The Desert Sun reported Saturday that the person was transported to a hospital after being stung in Banning. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the person was stung around 12:25 p.m. Saturday in the city about 23 miles west of Palm Springs. Authorities said another person had a small number of stings and refused treatment by responders at the scene about 1 mile north of Interstate 10. The second victim drove to the hospital. Neither of the victims was identified and their medical conditions were not known Saturday.\n\nColorado\n\nEstes Park:Wildlife officials are warning people to keep their distance from elk during their mating season after a bull charged people, knocked a woman down and repeatedly butted her with its antlers. A video on 9News.com showed the elk running toward people and knocking the woman down Thursday near the visitor center in Estes Park near Rocky Mountain National Park. The woman escaped after public works employee Brian Berg drove a pickup on the sidewalk and got between her and the elk. The elk then rammed the front of the truck. A spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Jason Clay, told KDVR-TV that bull elks aggressively fight over their breeding rights. He said people need to give elk space even in developed areas and let them move away on their own.\n\nConnecticut\n\nSouthbury: Officials said a hiker who was knocked to the ground by a black bear has been treated for nonlife-threatening injuries. Connecticut Environmental Conservation Police said a 38-year-old Newtown man was knocked down by a black bear while hiking near Lake Zoar on Saturday. The man was able to get away, and the bear took off into the woods. The man was taken to Danbury Hospital and has since been released. Environmental police have not been able to find the bear. Wildlife biologists have set up a trap in the area. Department of Energy and Environmental Protection officials are encouraging the public to keep their distance if they see a bear.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: County Executive Matt Meyer was the featured speaker at an event Friday during which dozens of county police officers showed up to protest over ongoing contract negotiations between the government and the local police union. The county police’s contract expired in March, and negotiations have been underway for nearly a year. The negotiations are at loggerheads over health care costs. Friday was at least the second time police officers roasted Meyer in public. In July, his face was put on a giant inflatable rat outside the county’s ice cream festival by picketing police. Jonathan Yard, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5, has said the county has offered contract deals that would result in an overall loss of health care benefits for officers and higher health care costs. Meyer has said every officer was offered a raise. New Castle County employs more than 300 police officers, and the department is one of the most expensive facets of local government.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents voiced their concerns about living conditions at a Southeast D.C. apartment complex on Friday night, WUSA-TV reported. For years, tenants of the Congress Park apartment complex in D.C.’s Congress Heights neighborhood have complained about mold and rodent droppings in their housing units. D.C. Councilmember Trayon White held a meeting at the Malcolm X Opportunity Center to listen to concerns about the state of the housing complex. The councilmember was joined by representatives of the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs and the D.C. Office of the Attorney General as well. White admitted the residents’ concerns in Congress Park must be addressed quickly. But, tenants did not get a lot of answers from Congress Park’s property owner and manager Friday night. D.C. tax records show a group named “Southeast Washington Development Associates LP” owns Congress Park, but they did not appear to be at the meeting. The property manager, Edgewood Management of Gaithersburg, Maryland, also appeared to be absent at the meeting. WUSA-TV emailed the company to request a comment regarding the complaints residents have made about upkeep at Congress Park.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: Wearing gloves to ward off teeth and claws, firefighters gingerly extricated a cat from the engine compartment of a Mercedes-Benz on Friday morning. The feline rescue happened at a home on Las Palmas Drive, in a neighborhood north of La Cita Country Club. The gray cat, Suba Mae, escaped injury, Titusville Fire Battalion Chief Greg Sutton said. “The owner states that she believes the cat got out an open door last night,” Sutton said. “The cat’s not an outdoor cat. And when she went out looking, she heard the cat meowing under the car.” After being alerted by Suba Mae’s meows, his owner called an emergency dispatcher for help. “As we tried to get the cat from underneath (the vehicle), it moved further and became kind of stuck. That’s when we had to open the hood and get in that way to get the cat out,” Sutton said.”It’s something different every day. Most people think cats are getting stuck in trees — and I think we’ve had as many in cars as we’ve had in the trees,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A Georgia-based church group has returned sacred land in Ohio to the Wyandotte Nation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the United Methodist Church Global Ministries transferred the deed during a Sept. 21 ceremony and procession. The land had been held in trust for 176 years by the ministries group, based in Atlanta. The land – about 3 acres – includes a stone church that dates to 1824 and a cemetery in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. The chief of the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma, Billy Friend, called the land transfer “monumental.” He said students, tribal members and elders have visited the site to have a connection to their ancestral land and history. The Wyandotte Nation includes more than 6,600 tribal citizens. Most live in Oklahoma.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An attorney representing a group of Hawaii residents opposed to development in an Oahu beach park said he plans to seek a court injunction against the project. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Sunday that Tim Vandeveer has filed a lawsuit and expects to take further legal action against development within Waimanalo Bay Beach Park. About 140 demonstrators opposing the development gathered Saturday at the park’s woodland area known as Sherwood Forest, which covers 74 acres. A city spokesman said Honolulu wants to clear a plot to build a multipurpose field, playground and 11-stall parking lot on the site. The official said the $1.43 million project is a compromise from the city’s 2012 plan to develop a $32 million sports complex and 470-stall parking lot.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials from Idaho and Taiwan have signed a two-year, $576 million deal calling for Taiwan flour mills to buy Idaho wheat. The Idaho Press reported the deal calls for the purchase of 1.8 million metric tons of wheat. Kuo-Shu Fan, director general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, said Taiwan is Idaho’s second-largest agricultural export destination and Idaho is Taiwan’s sixth-largest export destination. Gov. Brad Little said he will lead his first official trade mission as governor in October to Taiwan’s capital, Taipei. He said the Taiwan Flour Mills Association has brought delegations to Idaho since 1970. The volume of wheat that Taiwan mills will purchase over the next two years is comparable to the amount purchased over the past two years.\n\nIllinois\n\nTinley Park: Two Chicago-area nonprofit organizations have collaborated to build handmade beds for underprivileged children and are looking for more volunteers. David King, president of the Oak Forest chapter of Sleep in Heavenly Peace, said that he and volunteers have built about 100 beds for children in need since he took over the group in March. Steve Vick, vice president of Tinley Park Lions Club, told the Daily Southtown the group decided to partner with King’s organization and help them with constructing beds to mark their 70th anniversary. King noted that Schillings in Mokena donated the lumber for building the beds. But other resources, such as pillows and comforters, were purchased. Vick said their group is always looking for new members. He noted they meet on the third Tuesday of each month.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Officials said work could be completed in November on a project for allowing the move of a restored World War II naval vessel to a more prominent location along the Ohio River in downtown Evansville. Crews are now building a visitors center and barges so the LST 325 troop landing ship can move to the former site of the Tropicana Evansville casino boat. Evansville Port Authority chairman Pat Wathen told the Evansville Courier & Press that the $3.6 million project is on track and within budget after high initial construction bids delayed work. The ship took part in the 1944 D-Day landings in France and has been based in Evansville since 2005. LST 325 board member Chris Donahue said the ship’s move is planned for April.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Rev. William Joensen has been ordained as the 10th bishop to lead the Roman Catholic Diocese of Des Moines. The Des Moines Register reported that more than 1,500 parishioners witnessed the ordination Friday at St. Francis of Assisi Church in West Des Moines, the diocese’s largest. Pope Francis selected Joensen, 59, an Iowa native, to replace former Bishop Richard Pates, who retired after holding the role for more than a decade. In his inaugural address, Joensen addressed young people, saying that “some of the church’s actions in the past merit reproach” and that reproach of that by younger parishioners was to be expected. But he implored them to “be open to the wisdom passed down from generation to generation.”\n\nKansas\n\nEmporia: Emporia State University students who are too exhausted to get home can now find beds on campus. The university is installing two sleeping pods designed by a San Diego-based company. The soundproof rooms are slightly wider than a twin bed, with a nightstand and a charging station. Curtains and window blinds provide privacy. University spokeswoman Gwen Larson said students often are seen napping in public places such as chairs or with their head on a table. She said the sleep pods are safer places for better sleep. One pod was installed recently in the campus library and another will be installed at Memorial Union. The Kansas City Star reported students stationed near each pod will check students in and ensure that only one student at a time is using the sleeping pod.\n\nKentucky\n\nWurtland: An overnight fire in a barn has killed thousands of animals including 3,000 quails. News outlets reported the fire broke out at Bonzo Farm early Saturday. A press release from Greenup Volunteer Fire Department said multiple fire departments responded to the blaze, which involved several barns. Raceland Police said besides the quails, 1,000 chukars and 100 chickens were also killed in the blaze. Neighbor Kayla Wilburn said she could feel the heat from the fire at her home and the flames were about 80 feet in the air. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Bonzo Farm was purchased by the Bonzo family around 1906. Wilburn said the barn was a symbol in the community.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBelle Chasse: The federal government is giving a Louisiana parish a $4 million grant to help improve the water infrastructure. In a news release, the Department of Commerce says the money is being given to Plaquemines Parish to protect businesses from natural disasters. The grant from the Department’s Economic Development Administration will go toward construction of a new raw water intake pump station for the Belle Chasse Water Treatment Plant. The money comes from a specific federal program designed to help pay for disaster relief and recovery as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as wildfires and other natural disasters. The grant must be matched with more than $1 million in local money.\n\nMaine\n\nEast Machias: An environmental group said it will release thousands of salmon into a river next month as part of an effort to help grow the population of the species. The Downeast Salmon Federation said about 250,000 juvenile Atlantic salmon will be released into the East Machias River. The project is part of the International Year of the Salmon effort that is taking place in different countries. The Atlantic salmon is a focus of conservation in Maine because it’s listed under the Endangered Species Act in the United States. The fish were once plentiful in U.S. rivers, but populations plummeted because of dams, overfishing and pollution. They now return to only a handful of rivers in Maine, including the Penobscot River, numbering usually in the hundreds.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore:An Assateague Island horse died over the weekend after being struck by an official park vehicle, according to a National Park Service news release. The incident occurred Sunday morning when a chestnut mare known as Connie’s Girl was standing on the curve of Bayberry Drive in the predawn hours. Officials said a park vehicle struck the horse’s hindquarter before first light. The park employee was not injured in the collision, according to the release, and the incident remains under investigation. Connie’s Girl was born in April 2018 to mare Ms. Macky, with the likely sire being Yankee. The National Park Service said her band frequented the developed area and campground of Assateague Island National Seashore and Assateague Island State Park. Connie’s Girl is the 34th Assateague Island horse to be hit by a car and killed since 1982, the park said, with another 17 injured in vehicle collisions.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: Crews are beginning the task of restoring service to the approximately 150 homes and businesses whose gas service was disconnected after a leak. Columbia Gas said Saturday all residents displaced by the leak can now return to their homes. Technicians will begin going door-to-door to perform safety checks and relight gas appliances. The city is still reeling from a destructive series of gas explosions and fires a year ago. The company said Friday’s leak was an isolated incident in the street and there was no impact to customers’ homes.\n\nMichigan\n\nSouthfield: Oakland County health officials are confirming two new cases of rabies in skunks found in Southfield and Troy. The confirmations follow a report last week that a skunk’s carcass also found in Southfield, just north of Detroit, tested positive for rabies. In March, officials said a skunk in Rochester Hills was confirmed to have rabies. Rochester Hills is northeast of Southfield. Residents are urged to stay away from skunks, bats, raccoons, foxes, and stray cats and dogs.

The police department said in a Facebook post Saturday that investigators suspect in some cases people thought they were using cocaine but it’s possible fentanyl or another drug was mixed in. KARE-TV reported that the six overdoses happened over a 21/ 2 -hour period. The incidents prompted police to issue an alert to remind the public people can’t be prosecuted for seeking help for someone who overdoses.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: Agriculture experts said most of this year’s corn crop in Mississippi is in fair-to-good condition. The Mississippi State University Extension Service said in a news release that the state’s farmers planted 35% more acres in corn this year compared to 2018. Corn planting was delayed by two to three weeks because of heavy rains during the spring. The extension service said when corn can’t be planted at the usual time, farmers often switch to soybeans. But, this year’s market outlook was stronger for corn. The news release said the state’s corn harvest was slow in August because of a later-maturing crop, but it has gone quickly in September. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated most of Mississippi’s corn crop is in fair-to-good condition. Just 7% is considered excellent, and 12% is either poor or very poor.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Wheel, a 200-foot-tall Ferris wheel, opened Monday at Union Station, where a new aquarium complex is expected to open in December. The Ferris wheel lights up with 1.6 million LED lights. It includes 42 climate-controlled gondolas that can hold up to eight people each. Rides last about 15 minutes and cost $15 for adults and $10 for children. The redevelopment of the former train station complex also includes an 18-hole mini-golf course, a carousel and an old-fashioned soda fountain. Union Station for years housed a shopping mall. But its popularity waned, prompting redevelopment into an aquarium and other attractions.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A semi hauling a trailer full of roping steers caught fire on Interstate 94 in southern Montana, but none of the cattle was injured. The Montana Highway Patrol told The Billings Gazette the driver was able to safely remove all 103 head of cattle. Area residents, some of them on horseback, helped keep them off the road until someone volunteered the use of a nearby pen. The cattle had been loaded in Billings on Monday morning and had traveled about 85 miles when another motorist spotted the fire in the front axle and got the driver to pull over near Hysham. The fire eventually melted part of the trailer. Trooper Richard Drake said the motorist used a fire extinguisher while the driver unloaded the steers, which are used in rodeo competitions.\n\nNebraska\n\nLouisville: The Youth Hunter Education Challenge scheduled for Oct. 13 at Platte River State Park offers competitors a chance to hone their shooting skills and learn more about wildlife, survival skills and hunter responsibility.

Officials said a glass door was kicked in Friday night, papers were strewn inside the office and a coffee-maker was missing. Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael J. McDonald said he hoped that those responsible were apprehended “before they commit any other acts of violence …” McDonald said he suspected that “leftist activists” were behind the break-in, but Clark County Republican Party Chair Dave Sajdak he didn’t think the break-in was politically motivated.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As the fall hunting season gets underway, the New Hampshire Food Bank is again collecting donated deer and moose meat for distribution to more than 425 food pantries, soup kitchens and other facilities. Last year, the Hunt for the Hungry program took in more than 2,000 pounds of meat. Hunters who participate in the program must process the meat and have it stamped by a USDA approved butcher. Bruce Wilson, the food bank’s director of operations, said such donations fill a big need. He said venison is especially popular. The food bank is not accepting bear, fowl or wild game birds. Deer season for archers began earlier this month; the season for firearms starts in November. Moose hunting season starts in October.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: A lightning strike caused power to go out in several Atlantic City casinos for several hours early Sunday. Atlantic City Electric told the Press of Atlantic City a power line was struck shortly after 1 a.m., leaving about 9,400 customers without power. The city’s fire department said it responded to calls from Bally’s Atlantic City, Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, Ocean Casino Resort and Resorts Casino Hotel where patrons were stuck in elevators. Staff at Harrah’s were able to get a person out of a stuck elevator. Gamblers went on social media to describe walking through darkened casino floors. They were unlikely to lose money from slot machines because of the outage. The machines use battery-operated, uninterruptible power supplies. Loyalty program cards also record all play.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Authorities said bronze shoes at a veterans’ memorial meant to those who served in the U.S. war on terror have been stolen. New Mexico Veterans Memorial Foundation vice president James Lehner said the bronze shoes were stolen Friday night. Michael Burd with the New Mexico Veterans Memorial Board of Directors said the five pairs of bronze shoes are worth thousands of dollars.

University of North Carolina Interim President Bill Roper said in a statement that Gerlach was placed on leave “in light of reports from this past weekend.” Gerlach said in a statement on Sunday that he went to a local pub with two adult male acquaintances on Sept. 25. The statement said videos and photos shared on social media show him “interacting with college-aged young adults and taking selfies.” The agenda for a special phone meeting of the UNC Board of Governors on Tuesday includes a closed meeting to discuss an executive personnel matter. It’s not clear if that discussion concerns Gerlach, who was appointed in April.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: Sara Medalen, who helps grade school students struggling with reading and arithmetic, has been named the North Dakota Teacher of the Year for 2020. Medalen is a reading and math interventionist at Minot’s Sunnyside Elementary School. Medalen also started programs to encourage reading, leadership development, and physical fitness. Gov.

Baesler and Burgum will hold a celebration for Medalen in mid-October.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: The Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority board of directors voted to rename Toledo Express Airport after Toledo native and retired NASA flight director Eugene Kranz. The Blade in Toledo reported the board has joined the Toledo City Council in voting to name the facility the Eugene F. Kranz Toledo Express Airport. Kranz, a former fighter pilot, had a 34-year career with NASA and was flight director for the Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 moon missions. Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said he casually mentioned the name change before broaching the subject on a radio station in June and the idea gained traction. The Federal Aviation Administration must approve officially renaming the airport before the change could be made.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Thousands of people visited a $132 million park in downtown Oklahoma City where a weekend grand-opening included a free concert by Grammy-winning rockers Kings of Leon. City officials said 28,000 people attended the show at Scissortail Park, which opened to the public Friday. More visitors streamed through Saturday to try out exercises classes and sample food trucks. The park that will eventually cover 70 acres includes a lake, performance stages and trails. It’s also home to a clone of the “Survivor Tree” that lived through the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. The clone will be transplanted to replace the original American elm once it dies.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Authorities said a train derailed north of Salem early Sunday, breaking a utility pole that resulted in power outages and causing a small fire. Michael Williams, a spokesman for Portland and Western Railroad, said by email that there were no injuries and no hazardous materials were involved. He said the cause is under investigation. He said the incident involved the first eight cars of a 29-car train and occurred at Hopmere. Of the eight cars, he said three carried wood pulp, three carried potassium sulfate and two were empty lumber cars. Fire officials in a release said a small, smoldering fire started in the brush as a result of the downed lines and was extinguished.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBloomsburg: Authorities said three people were injured in a helicopter crash at a state fair. WNEP-TV reported a pilot and two passengers were in the helicopter when it crashed Saturday about 7:30 p.m. in the parking lot of the fairground. The fair was filled with people at the time of the crash. No one was injured on the ground. The three people aboard the helicopter were taken to a hospital. Bloomsburg police said the pilot’s condition was first listed as critical but has been upgraded to stable. The two passengers had minor injuries. Police said the helicopter would take fairgoers for a short ride. The crash bent the framing and shattered the windows of several vehicles in the parking lot. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The Aquidneck Island Planning Commission has scheduled a forum Wednesday to discuss coyote habits and how humans affect their population size in Newport, Middletown and Portsmouth. Coyote researcher Numi Mitchell of the Narragansett Bay Coyote Study will deliver a presentation on coyotes, followed by a panel discussion. The Newport Daily News reported the forum is an installment in the Smart Island Series, which is aimed at confronting issues the entire island faces. John Shea, executive director of the planning commission, said“What happens in one part of the island generally affects us all.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nEdisto Beach: Biologists will perform necropsies on one whale that died and three that were euthanized after becoming stranded on a beach. Lowcountry Marine Mammal Network Director Lauren Rust told WCSC-TV the whales were found Saturday morning on Edisto Beach, but it was not clear how long they had been there. Marine biologist Peyton Sasnett, who went to the beach, said they appeared to be pilot whales. Rust said pilot whales are usually at least 100 miles offshore, “so when you see them come this close to shore, it’s definitely alarming.” Getting results of the necropsies could take a few week weeks. Rust said tests will determine whether the whales suffered internal injuries, a viral infection or fell ill because of human factors like consuming plastic in the ocean.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Oglala Sioux Tribal Council has banned the sale, possession and use of e-cigarettes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in light of the nationwide outbreak of vaping-related illnesses. The tribal council approved the new ordinance banning e-cigarettes during its meeting last week. The maximum penalty for violating the new ban is either a fine of $250 or a sentence of 30 days in jail, according to the ordinance. Tribal President Julian Bear Runner applauded the council’s “bold action” last week in reaction to the deaths that have occurred nationwide because of vaping-related illnesses. Bear Runner also called for further action on tobacco regulation on the reservation. There have been six cases of vaping-related illness in South Dakota and 805 cases total in the United States. Twelve deaths have been confirmed in 10 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTennessee\n\nKingston: The Tennessee Department of Health said testing by the Tennessee Valley Authority and state regulators ruled out the presence of coal ash – a toxic stew of chemicals, heavy metals and radioactive material – in the top 3 inches of dirt underneath the grass-covered soccer fields at the Swan Pond Sports Complex in Roane County. That same testing revealed the presence in the dirt of most of the ingredients in coal ash, though at levels considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. The health department report showed the dirt is particularly rich in two coal ash ingredients – arsenic and chromium – but also at levels considered safe by the EPA and typical of soil throughout Tennessee. The TVA said the report – made public earlier this month – proves the soccer fields and recreation areas are safe for the public.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: A boil-water notice has been issued for the border city of Laredo because of low chlorine levels in the municipal drinking water supply. Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz on Saturday night announced the boil-water notice for the city of about 260,000. He said routine testing of Laredo’s drinking water found the city failed to maintain acceptable disinfection levels in parts of the system. Saenz said there’s no water shortage in Laredo but the chlorine issue means a potential health risk. The mayor had no timetable when the boil-water notice, issued as a precaution, will be lifted. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality required Laredo to notify all customers to boil their water until further notice. The notice applies to all consumption, including for cooking, personal washing and brushing teeth.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: ATVs will be allowed on certain roads in the five national parks in Utah under a new rule from the National Park Service that went through without public comment. The Salt Lake Tribune reported the agency informed park administrators last week in a memo about a policy change that allows ATVs on main access roads and back roads. It puts the national parks in compliance with a state law passed in 2008 that allows any “street-legal” vehicle on state and county roads. The rule takes effect Nov. 1 and only applies to national parks in Utah. Agency spokeswoman Vanessa Lacayo said ATVs still can’t go off-road wherever they want. Off-highway vehicle advocacy groups pushed U.S. government officials to make the change. Conservation groups criticized a rule they said will worsen traffic and parking in parks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Rev. Shannon MacVean-Brown has become the first black bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont. A consecration ceremony was held Saturday for MacVean-Brown. She said her priority will be welcoming people of all backgrounds and ages. MacVean-Brown was raised in Detroit and most recently worked in Indiana. She said she has experienced feeling isolated as a black woman. Now she strives for inclusivity in the church. The Episcopal Church of Vermont has more than 6,100 parishioners in 45 congregations across the state. MacVean-Brown succeeds Bishop Thomas Ely, who served for 18 years and is retiring.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Transportation officials are seeking public input of a study of Virginia’s 179 miles of the Interstate 95 corridor. The Commonwealth Transportation Board has initiated a study to develop a plan to identify key problem areas along the corridor, between the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria and the North Carolina border. Feedback provided by communities, industries and others will be considered as team members continue study of the corridor and prepare a draft plan report in the fall. The board plans to report to the General Assembly in January. A series of meetings will focus on potential safety and congestion solutions along the corridor. The first meeting will be held in Fredericksburg on Oct. 9, following by one in Richmond on Oct. 15 and one in Woodbridge on Oct. 17.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: A ban on single-use plastic bags is set to go into effect in Everett as part of an effort to encourage the use of recyclable bags. The Everett Herald reported shoppers in Everett will have to purchase paper or thicker-plastic bag for 5 cents each from cashiers as the ban on single-use bags took effect Monday. Officials said the ban also applies to restaurants and carry-out orders, with an exception for bags used to prevent spillage. Officials said dry cleaning and newspaper sacks are permitted under the new ordinance. Employees at a Safeway store in Everett said they have already run out of the thin, plastic bags and switched to paper bags. The store said it will sell reusable bags for $1 each.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeckley: A festival that celebrates West Virginia’s Rocket Boys has ended its two-decade run. Author and former NASA engineer Homer Hickam told news outlets that the Rocket Boys Festival, which ended Saturday in Beckley, was the last one. The festival had moved to Beckley in 2012 after it was held since 1999 in Coalwood in McDowell County. The festival celebrated the three years from 1957 to 1960 when Hickam and his friends launched rockets while in high school. They eventually won a national science fair. Hickam’s novel, “Rocket Boys,” is about those experiences and growing up in Coalwood. The book was adapted into the 1999 movie “October Sky.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nSuperior: Husky Energy said it has been given approval to rebuild its oil refinery after an explosion and a series of fires last year injured 36 people and required much of the city to evacuate. Husky, which does business as Superior Refining Company in Wisconsin, said it will start the $400 million plan immediately with the goal of resuming partial operations in 2021. Wisconsin Public Radio reported that residents and tribal leaders expressed frustration over Husky’s plans to continue using the highly toxic chemical hydrogen fluoride as part of its refining process. The city’s evacuation was largely because of the presence of hydrogen fluoride, which can be hazardous to human health. The tank containing the chemical wasn’t damaged by the explosion, which was caused by a hole in a valve. The mayors of Superior and adjacent Duluth, Minnesota, also called on Husky Energy to remove hydrogen fluoride from its operations. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources approved the permit. Earlier this year, Company CEO Rob Symonds told Wisconsin Public Radio that company officials explored using alternatives to hydrogen fluoride, but there is no better option. The company has said it plans to make safety improvements to the existing alkylation unit, including a rapid acid transfer system to capture any hydrofluoric acid in case of a release.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The Laramie Boomerang reported Friday that Joint Education Committee legislatures voted unanimously Thursday to have the Legislative Service Office draft a bill limiting the amount of Hathaway Scholarship funds used for University of Wyoming graduate school. Officials said 70 students used $270,000 worth of need-based funds to pay for school during the 2017-2018 academic year and the amount is expected to increase in coming years. Officials said a proposed bill recommends allowing funds to be used when paying directly for tuition and fees instead of including books, room and board and other expenses. Officials said another bill would allow students to petition for a funding increase based on maintaining a high grade-point average.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/17/saving-whales-manson-murder-house-news-around-states/39695071/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville:The law that allows Sunday alcohol sales from retail stores in the city with valid state-issued liquor licenses goes into effect Aug. 1. Sales will be allowed with no time constraints. The city council approved the move during the board’s Tuesday night meeting. The ordinance passed 6-0-1, with District 3 Councilwoman Denise Brown abstaining. She serves as executive director of the Autauga Interfaith Care Center, a nondenominational charity. Last year, the council approved off-premises Sunday sales in the Elmore County portion of Prattville, after the Elmore County Commission got Legislative approval to allow the sales.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Residents of rural parts of the state will be hit with rising energy costs after a statewide funding change. The state’s Energy Desk reported that the Legislature annually transfers money from state accounts into the Constitutional Budget Reserve. Officials say a $1 billion energy account used to offset costs for rural communities is included in the transfer known as “the sweep.” Lawmakers for the past 28 years have returned the funds, until this year, when they voted not to replenish the large savings account. Companies say homeowners’ bills could increase from an average of $80 up to thousands of dollars per month.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The city’s Catholic leadership is planning to meet with local government officials about where the city can temporarily house migrants seeking asylum. The organization and county officials have a tentative agreement to move migrant families to unused portions of a Pima County juvenile detention center. Critics are opposed to placing migrants in any detention facility. Bishop Edward Weisenburger has said the hope is that migrants will feel safe and welcome as long as they are getting care.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The federal government says it will allocate an additional $7 million in funding over the next 10 years to expand internet access in rural areas of the state. The Federal Communications Commission announced Monday that the funds will provide broadband access to nearly 4,000 more rural homes and businesses. In May and June, the FCC authorized a total of $40.8 million in funding. About 15,000 more rural homes and businesses will be connected to the internet when the project is complete. The FCC says it will authorize more funding in the coming months. Providers will begin receiving money from the FCC this month.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: One of the houses where followers of Charles Manson committed notorious murders in 1969 is for sale. The home in the hilly Los Feliz district is where Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain the night after actress Sharon Tate and four others were murdered by Manson followers in Benedict Canyon. Redfin listing agent Robert Giambalvo tells the Los Angeles Times the two-bedroom home is priced at $1.98 million. The house has changed hands several times since 1969 and last sold in 1998.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Freight trains up to 3 miles long have been coming through the city with increasing frequency since January, according to a memo to City Council from traffic engineer Joe Olson. The “mega” trains, as Olson calls them, are in addition to regular train traffic on the BNSF Railway tracks that parallel College Avenue through much of the city. Typical trains are about a mile long. The biggest impact of a mega train is on traffic. Instead of blocking an intersection 3 to 4 minutes, like most trains, a mega train might take 15 minutes or more to pass through an intersection. Traffic backs up farther than usual and takes longer to recover. The most noticeable impacts are where the BNSF tracks cross College Avenue near Cherry Street, Olson’s memo noted. But impacts are felt all along the line, with several major east-west intersections blocked at the same time.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city is activating cooling centers for the public as it issues an excessive heat and humidity alert for the next several days. Mayor Toni Harp will start the alert at noon Wednesday while cooling centers will be open throughout the weekend and next week until further notice to provide relief from the excessive heat and humidity. Some of the cooling centers include libraries like the New Haven Public Library and the Fair Haven Branch Library. Public pools, senior centers, homeless shelters and city parks with “Splash pads,” which can be used for cooling off, will also be open.\n\nDelaware\n\nHarrington:When you’re expecting about 300,000 people for your 100th birthday party, you have to be creative when it comes to a birthday cake. That’s why the Delaware State Fair bought 30,000 packages of Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets, which will be doled out each night to some festivalgoers as part of the fair’s centennial celebration. The 100th annual Delaware State Fair kicks off Thursday with a one-day adult admission price of $5, followed by nine more days of midway rides, decadent carnival foods, livestock competitions and entertainment ranging from Grammy Award winners to a demolition derby. General admission is $9 for adults all other days, $4 for children 6-12, and free for kids 5 and younger. More details are available online.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The leader of the D.C. Council is accused of trading roles and responsibilities to other council members in exchange for backing. The Washington Post reports Chair Phil Mendelson is accused of using the quid pro quo to pass a no-bid sports betting and lottery contract and block harsh penalties for a member accused of ethics violations. The allegations highlight the growing divide between the council’s older, moderate and mostly black leaders and more recently elected members, who are mostly white and younger than 50.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The Sunshine State is the top producer of watermelon in the United States, according to the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, which says Florida farmers sold 800 million pounds of watermelon last year. The largest growers are near Immokalee, Belle Glade, Arcadia and the Suwannee Valley, which produces a third of the state’s watermelon crop.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSt. Simons Island: A state biologist says beachgoers in Georgia helped keep about 30 pilot whales from stranding themselves on the shore. Clay George with the state Department of Natural Resources says the whales showed up Tuesday afternoon off the beach at St. Simons Island. Three whales beached themselves and died. But George says onlookers helped authorities wade into the water to prevent most of the whales from reaching the shore. George said harbor pilots spotted the whales in the nearby shipping channel, where he hoped they would follow the tide out to sea. George says the whales were likely confused as they usually stay more than 100 miles offshore. The American Cetacean Society says pilot whales are often involved in mass strandings partly because of their social nature.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Astronomers have indefinitely stopped looking through 13 existing telescopes at the summit of Mauna Kea while protesters block the road downslope to prevent the construction of a giant new observatory. Dozens of researchers around the world won’t be able to gather data and study the skies as a result. East Asian Observatory Deputy Director Jessica Dempsey says observations won’t resume until telescope staff have consistent access to the summit. The announcement came after Native Hawaiian protesters blocked the base of the road for a second day Tuesday. They oppose the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope out of concern it will harm an area some Native Hawaiians consider sacred. The new telescope is expected to be one of the world’s most advanced when it’s built.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a rewrite of the state’s 50-year-old mining law. Republican Gov. Brad Little and other members of the Idaho Land Board voted Tuesday to adopt rules intended to give mining companies the financial leeway to mine but also avoid leaving taxpayers paying for cleanup costs if a mining company goes bankrupt. The rules take effect immediately and come ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline set by the Legislature earlier this year. The Idaho Department of Lands plans to continue working on additional changes to the rules with public comments and bring them before lawmakers for their approval in the 2020 legislative session.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials with the Shedd Aquarium say a Beluga whale calf born less than two weeks ago is male. The aquarium’s animal care team confirmed the calf’s sex during a recent health exam. The baby whale and its mother are under 24-hour observation as the calf continues to grow and nurse. Aquarium officials say the data collected from the observation is shared with others who study wild beluga whale populations. The 38-year-old beluga, Mauyak, delivered earlier this month. Her calf was the first beluga calf at the lakefront aquarium in seven years.\n\nIndiana\n\nMichigan City: Witnesses say a toddler was rescued in Lake Michigan after he drifted away from his family on an inflatable duck. Dave Benjamin tells WBBM-TV that a boater finally grabbed the boy after the duck flipped over Monday, off Washington Beach in Michigan City. Benjamin tried to reach the boy on a paddleboard. He says there was a feeling of “exhaustion and high anxiety” as the child’s inflatable was carried away by the wind. The boy’s mother couldn’t immediately reach him.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Officials say expansion by a Dubuque-based insurance broker is expected to bring more than 25 jobs to the city. The Telegraph Herald reports that Cottingham & Butler announced Monday that it will begin operating this fall in leased space that’s under construction. Cottingham & Butler’s Andy Butler says company officials have considered new locations as a way to accommodate current and future employees who live outside Dubuque. Cottingham & Butler employs 950 workers across 19 locations. About 650 work in the Dubuque area.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Attorney General Derek Schmidt says the U.S. Supreme Court’s fall docket includes three state cases, the first time that has happened in modern state history. Schmidt’s office will represent the state in all three cases. The first case to be heard this fall involves an appeal filed in a capital murder case filed by James Kraig Kahler, who killed four relatives in Burlingame in November 2009. Kahler argues Kansas law unconstitutionally prevented him from using an insanity defense. A second case arises from an identity theft case out of Johnson County and the third involves a Douglas County traffic stop. The Kansas Supreme Court overturned convictions in the last two cases, and the state is appealing.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State officials say a company that specializes in CBD oil extraction and distillation plans to build a $6 million-plus manufacturing plant in Boyle County. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office says the venture will create up to 34 full-time jobs over a decade. State officials say the announcement by International Farmaceutical Extracts is the latest sign that Kentucky’s hemp industry is flourishing. Officials say the company plans to buy an existing facility in Danville for the operation. At full capacity, the plant will use hemp flowers from about 15,000 acres of local farms.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:The state continues to sink with no help in sight, according to the latest National Geodetic Survey conducted with the help of Louisiana State University. New Orleans has fallen almost 6 inches since the first survey was conducted in 1989, but other cities farther north are also sinking. Alexandria dropped almost 2 inches during the past 30 years. Cliff Mugnier, LSU’s Chief of Geodesy, says the primary reason for the sinking is the levee system preventing the Mississippi River from flooding and depositing silt and sediment to replenish lost ground, although other factors like depleted groundwater aquifers can also contribute.\n\nMaine\n\nMadawaska: The state Forest Service is going to deploy wasps to help beat back an invasive pest species that can do damage to trees in the state. The service says the tiny, nonstinging wasps will be released Thursday to help control the emerald ash borer infestation in the state. It says the wasps feed in or on the borers by attacking their larvae under the bark of trees and parasitizing eggs on the surface of bark. The wasps will be released in Aroostook County in far northern Maine. The forest service says three species of wasps are being used in the pest control effort. The borer was located in Aroostook and York counties, at opposite ends of the state, in 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State regulators have scheduled two public comment hearings on a request by Washington Gas Light Company to increase its gas service rates by nearly $36 million. The Public Service Commission announced Monday it has scheduled a July 29 hearing in Rockville. It also announced an Aug. 6 public hearing in Largo. The PSC says that of the nearly $36 million rate-increase request, about $5 million is being collected through a system improvement surcharge. The Washington Gas application says a typical residential heating bill would increase by about 5%.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A power outage caused major problems on a Boston subway line. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said in a tweet that there was “power problem” on the Blue Line at about 8 a.m. Wednesday near the Government Center station. It said shuttle buses were replacing service between the Maverick and Bowdoin stations. A spokesman says three trains were on the track at the time. One was at a station, and another was moved back to a station so passengers could disembark. A third train was just outside the Government Center stop and 200 passengers were safely evacuated. The cause of the power problem is under investigation.\n\nMichigan\n\nSault Ste. Marie: A Native American tribe is receiving $2 million in federal funds to help build a manufacturing and warehouse facility. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the grant Tuesday for the tribe of Chippewa Indians. It will be matched with $350,000 in local funding. Officials say the Upper Peninsula tribe will own the 20,000-square-foot center. It will serve existing tribal manufacturers and entrepreneurs while helping attract new industries and business opportunities.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: Former U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman says all visible traces of cancer have been removed from his lung during a seven-hour surgery at Mayo Clinic. Coleman posted on his Facebook page that the cancer “was more invasive than seen in earlier scans.” Coleman praised his team of doctors who said the surgery was challenging because of scar tissue from earlier radiation. Last August, Coleman learned that the throat and neck cancer he began battling in 2015 had spread to his lungs and was at the most advanced stage. Coleman underwent chemotherapy and intensive radiation and said the tumor was gone. A follow-up scan recently showed the cancer had returned. In Monday’s surgery, doctors planned to remove about a quarter of his lung, cutting the organ’s capacity by 15% to 20%.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Police say they have confiscated several baggies filled with marijuana-infused snacks at a “dispensary party.” News outlets report police arrested five people for possession of ecstasy and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Spokesman Sam Brown told outlets Tuesday that authorities were tipped off about the party, which is typical in states where marijuana is legal. The edibles included rice crispy treats and brownies worth about $3,000. A gun, bong and other paraphernalia were also confiscated.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Bayer is closing its crop science division headquarters in North Carolina and moving 500 jobs to the St. Louis area. Gov. Mike Parson announced the move Tuesday in his Capitol office. Lisa Safarian, Bayer’s commercial operations-North America president, says the German pharmaceutical and life sciences company is closing its crop science division headquarters in the Raleigh area and moving to the St. Louis suburb of Creve Coeur. Bayer will get more than $44 million in economic development incentives from the state if it meets job and investment promises. The company has agreed to $164 million in capital investments. It also pledged to keep 4,400 jobs in Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Nurses working for a state hospital system have voted to unionize. The Flathead Beacon reports nurses at Kalispell Regional Healthcare facilities voted last Thursday and Friday to set up a collective bargaining unit. The approximately 650 nurses in the system are being represented by the Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW. The union says the new members will elect a bargaining committee that will survey members on their priorities for the contract negotiation. Hospital President and CEO Craig Lambrecht says in a statement that he was disappointed by the vote, but Kalispell Regional Healthcare will work with its employees during the bargaining process.\n\nNebraska\n\nChadron: A local chiropractor and a former high school track standout won top honors in the World Championship Buffalo Chip Throw contest during the 43rd annual Fur Trade Days celebration. Station KCSR reports that 35-year-old Eric Landen won the men’s title Saturday by tossing a piece of dried buffalo dung nearly 146 feet.

No injuries were reported.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s only VA medical center is scaling back the hours of its clinic and urging veterans to use a network of private urgent care facilities across the state. The move to shift away from an around-the-clock clinic in Manchester starting Aug. 30 comes as Veterans Affairs presses for the use of urgent care clinics nationwide. Eligible veterans can now use nine urgent care clinics that the VA contracts with in the state. The VA medical center will continue to offer a clinic at 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. seven days a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Milford: Swimming has been banned at another state lake because of the presence of a harmful algal bloom. State environmental officials on Tuesday closed swimming areas on Greenwood Lake, which stretches about nine miles between West Milford and Orange County in New York. The directive says people should avoid making contact with the lake’s water, but notes that boating is still allowed on the waterway. Officials say bacteria in the algae bloom can cause a skin rash, and people who consume the water can suffer abdominal pain, headaches, vomiting and other issues. It’s not clear how long the directive will remain in effect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials are warning horse owners to take precautions to keep their animals from contracting a virus that causes blister-like sores on the mouths of infected animals. The state livestock board says vesicular stomatitis cases have been confirmed in Valencia, Sandoval, Los Alamos and Santa Fe counties. State Veterinarian Ralph Zimmerman says officials aren’t ordering the cancellation of any events at this point, but they’re circulating a list of recommendations for fair and rodeo organizers and individual owners. That includes checking for sores, using fly spray and not sharing grooming equipment. There’s no specific treatment and there are no licensed vaccines for the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nQuogue: Police on Long Island are searching for a bald eagle that was stolen from a wildlife refuge. Police say the approximately 35-year-old male bald eagle was removed from its enclosure at the Quogue Wildlife Refuge sometime early Tuesday morning. Police say the eagle was sent to the facility in Suffolk County by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1988 after being injured. Its right wing is partially amputated and it is unable to fly. Officials say possession of a bald eagle, which is a federally protected species, is a federal offense punishable by fines and jail time. Anyone with information is asked to call the Quogue Village police department at 631-653-4791.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: An employee at a Valvoline Instant Oil Change has been fired, the company said, after creating a racist invoice that referred to the customer as Pocahontas. A photographed invoice circulating on social media lists the customer’s name as “poka honas” and the address as Raccoon Trail, a street that does not exist in Asheville. The date of the invoice is not visible, though the original Facebook post was published July 15. The customer’s identity is not publicly known. She is a person of color, according to the Facebook user who posted about the incident. The customer was not immediately available for a request for comment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials say oil production in North Dakota held steady this spring. The state’s wells produced 1.39 million barrels of crude per day in May, just 800 per day more than in April. Despite the steady May numbers, North Dakota’s oil production is near the record set in January. And, the high level is creating some transportation challenges. Statewide, companies are flaring off 19% of all gas produced, higher than the 12% target.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Mosquitoes in the Greater Cincinnati area have tested positive for West Nile virus and officials are urging people to take precautions. The West Nile virus affects the central nervous system. It can be passed from mosquitoes to humans. Mosquitoes with the virus were recently trapped on Union Cemetery Road in Symmes Township, according to Hamilton County Public Health. Officials will be conducting surveillance activities in the area where the mosquitoes were collected. Staff will be looking for areas of standing water, applying larvicide and making sure swimming pools are operating properly. Health officials advise all Hamilton County residents drain all sources of water, including buckets, flowerpots, wading pools, birdbaths and pet bowls. They also suggest adding mosquito larvicide to areas of standing water that cannot be drained.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt says the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved disaster assistance for 41 counties as a result of spring flooding and severe weather in the state. The storms produced historic flooding throughout the northern half of the state and spawned a tornado that struck near Tulsa International Airport on May 21. Stitt announced the approval Tuesday, saying it makes federal funding available for cities, counties, rural electric cooperatives and the state to repair infrastructure and other costs associated with the storm response. Stitt said damage estimates from the storms stand at $22 million.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A pilot was treated and released from a hospital after crashing his plane Tuesday afternoon while attempting an emergency landing in a grassy field east of the city. Eugene Mitchell, 73, of Portland told deputies he experienced mechanical issues which led to the plane catching fire midflight while traveling from the Albany area to the Aurora Airport. Mitchell, an experienced pilot, suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. He was the only occupant of the plane, according to Sgt. Jeremy Landers with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Traffic Safety Board were notified of the crash.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An animal rescue group says someone strapped firecrackers to a cat’s front left paw with rubber bands and set them off, causing such severe injuries that the animal’s leg had to be amputated. Humane Animal Rescue says on its Facebook page that two good Samaritans brought the cat in over the weekend after finding it limping on the mangled and bloody leg. Based on how the wound had begun healing, officials at the rescue say the injury likely happened on the Fourth of July. Jamie Wilson, a director at the rescue, says there was barely any paw left and veterinarians determined the best course of action would be to remove the leg. The cat, who staffers have named Pickles, is on the mend and will be up for adoption soon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The City Council on Monday unanimously approved a resolution that would add $4 million to the schools’ budget to pay for 17 line items, including sports, teaching assistants, custodians, textbooks, and after-school programs. Sports were among several cuts the school committee made last month when it approved a $174 million budget. City Council President Steven Merolla said “enough with holding kids hostage.” The district has three high schools and nearly 20 schools total.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The first contracts for construction of a major African American history museum in South Carolina have been awarded. The City Council unanimously approved spending $60 million on the contracts for the museum being built on Charleston’s waterfront on the site where thousands of slaves first landed in the United States. The International African American Museum has raised more than $90 million from governments and private entities. It plans to open in 2021.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A slight uptick in heartworm disease among area pets raised a red flag last month with a national nonprofit that tracks parasites in pets and people. The city’s heartworm rate itself is small – just four heartworm cases reported in June – but the increase from May’s rate of just one case was enough to put Sioux Falls at the top of a list kept by the Companion Animal Parasite Council. The Oregon-based nonprofit uses data from two national veterinarian labs to track the prevalence of animal parasites in cats and dogs, and Sioux Falls ranked first in its “Top Ten Cities for Heartworm Disease.” The July report was released this week by the group, with Sioux Falls ranking first, followed by Rockford, Illinois; Cedar Rapids, Iowa and seven other communities across the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Department of Agriculture is warning homeowners about rhododendron plants infected with a pathogen that can kill a number of different plants, shrubs and trees. The department says anyone who has purchased a rhododendron from Walmart or Rural King since April should monitor the plants for leaf spots and dying branches or limbs. The warning comes after the U.S. Agriculture Department detected Phytophthora ramorum in rhododendron plants at a Dickson County store. The infected plants were part of a shipment that originated from nurseries in Washington state and Canada. The department is working to trace the plants, which were sent to 18 states.\n\nTexas\n\nMineral Wells: City leaders are abandoning a proposal that would have essentially banned abortions in their community. Mayor Christopher Perricone says he proposed making his town a “sanctuary city for the unborn” after the town of Waskom became the first in Texas to do so. But at a meeting Tuesday in Mineral Wells, about 50 miles west of Dallas, city leaders voted 5-2 to take no action at the recommendation of the city’s legal staff. The Star-Telegram reported that earlier Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas sent a letter to Mineral Wells council members warning that its proposal was unconstitutional. There are no abortion clinics in either Waskom or Mineral Wells, so the measures are largely symbolic.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A federal appeals court has upheld a ruling that found voting districts in San Juan County were racially gerrymandered and violated the rights of Navajo voters. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver handed down the opinion Tuesday in the case that resulted in the election of the first majority-Navajo commission in San Juan County, which overlaps with the Navajo Nation. Republican commissioner Bruce Adams says in a statement he’s disappointed by the ruling. He says the new districts unfairly carve up the county’s largest city of Blanding, and he had hoped for a new solution. The opinion comes after U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby found in 2016 that the voting maps packed Democratic-leaning Navajo voters into just one of three districts in the sprawling county located near the Arizona border.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State Public Safety Commissioner Tom Anderson is resigning at the end of the month. The office of Republican Gov. Phil Scott says Anderson is leaving July 31 to join his wife, who is working in Washington. Anderson took the job at Public Safety in January 2017, after Scott took office. Scott says Anderson has worked on a number of the governor’s priorities, including enhancing school safety, reducing supply of narcotics as part of the state’s response to the opioid epidemic and streamlining the permitting and licensure process, while upholding public safety standards.\n\nVirginia\n\nCraigsville:Craigsville Elementary School will not be closing soon, officials say. Rumors spread Tuesday that the elementary school might shutter in the next couple years, but Assistant Superintendent Doug Shifflett told The News Leader on Wednesday that wasn’t true. Shifflett directed The News Leader to Superintendent Eric Bond for comment, but Bond was out of town this week and unavailable for comment. Augusta County School Board member Nick Collins also said the rumor was not true to the best of his knowledge when reached by phone Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Hunters employed by the state have killed a radio-collared wolf that was preying on livestock in the Kettle River range of Ferry County. The adult male member of the OPT wolf pack was killed last Saturday after the pack was found to be repeatedly killing livestock. The Department of Fish and Wildlife has now entered an evaluation period to determine if killing the wolf will change the pack’s behavior. If it does not, the state can authorize the killing of more wolves in the pack. Conservation groups have complained that the state is too quick to kill wolves at the behest of ranchers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: The federal government is suing a state mental health and substance abuse facility for the homeless, citing failures to provide documentation and numerous unanswered communications. The Gazette-Mail reports a lawsuit filed recently in federal court shows attorneys with U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart’s office want ownership of Integrated Community Services’ property returned to U.S. Health and Human Services. The nonprofit was given the land in 2006, mandating it give updates about its health services. The lawsuit accuses ICS officials of not filing annual reports that prove property use and not being reachable by HHS officials.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay:Bar patrons can leave their vehicles parked overnight to avoid driving home drunk under a new initiative approved Tuesday by the City Council. The council voted unanimously to green-light the program, dubbed “Safe Park,” which will allow people to override overnight parking restrictions and leave their vehicles parked on city streets until the next day. Street parking in Green Bay is otherwise prohibited between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. “Safe Park” aims to prevent people from getting behind the wheel while intoxicated. The program was spearheaded by the Brown County Tavern League. To use “Safe Park,” people can obtain a voucher from a bartender to hang on their vehicle’s rearview mirror. Only bars that are Tavern League members can participate.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Wildlife watchers say a grizzly bear cub that was lingering alone near a mountain pass in the western part of the state has reunited with its mother. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports the mother bear and cub, nicknamed Felicia and Pepper, were spotted together near Togwotee Pass on Tuesday. Onlookers had feared the cub was possibly orphaned after its mother wasn’t spotted with it. Cubs are not likely to survive on their own. Wildlife photographer Tom Mangelsen, who has been following the pair, previously said the mother and cub might have simply lost track of each other. Photographer Jack Bayles says the mother accepted the cub back and the cub has tried to nurse.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/01/pooch-hit-car-goes-ride-manatee-rescued-unusual-toilet-paper-roller-news-around-states/40525603/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: Selma University is holding an event Saturday to raise money that’s needed to pay off a more than $785,000 debt to the federal government. The school is trying to raise $2 million total. Any proceeds will also go to improve the campus, restore the school’s athletics program and establish an endowment fund. President Alvin Cleveland said the private school wasn’t recertified for the Federal Student Financial Assistance Program because of inadequate paperwork and incomplete files, so it’s being required to pay back financial aid. Selma University is affiliated with the Alabama State Missionary Baptist Convention. Another small, church-affiliated school in Selma, Concordia College, closed last year amid declining enrollment and financial problems.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: An accidental release of a smelly nontoxic chemical commonly added to propane and natural gas to give them a fragrance that can be detected caused multiple people to report a gas leak in downtown Fairbanks. The city said there was no gas leak or fire hazard. The owner of C&R Pipe and Steel Inc., Dennis Wilfer, said the chemical was mixed with water inside an unmarked cylinder that had been dropped off at his business for recycling. As workers sorted the metal, mercaptan leaked out, releasing a foul odor that moved north into downtown Fairbanks. City officials said the Fairbanks Fire Department responded to reports of a possible gas leak. The city confirms there was no gas leak or fire hazard.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Republic reported that the new downtown nightclub Track Club has closed less than a month after opening, according to a statement posted to its Facebook page on Wednesday afternoon. The post notified fans of the immediate closure and included instructions for what to do if you bought tickets for an upcoming show at the venue. Track Club was a collaboration between Phoenix developer Charles “Chuckie” Duff, Relentless Beats music promoter Thomas Turner and Rattle and Rum cocktail master Damon Scott. Duff, known for his adaptive reuse projects around Phoenix, oversaw the development and remodeling of DeSoto Central Market, transforming the space into a music venue complete with a full stage and multiple bars. Turner took the reigns for the music, scheduling EDM DJs to perform at the new nightclub. Scott designed cocktails for inside the music venue and more complex craft drinks for the outer bar area. The partners did not respond to request for comment before publication.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:The city will continue to levy 2.0 mills on real estate and personal property, the City Council decided Monday night. Council members on Oct. 17 voted to keep the city’s general millage at 2.0 mills for next year, but then later that meeting expressed an interest in revisiting the topic. The city’s millage rate was one of three topics scheduled to be discussed at Monday night’s meeting. All cities in Baxter County – and most in the state of Arkansas – levy a millage against real estate and personal property. That millage is collected by the county tax collector’s office when residents pay their property taxes and goes toward that city’s General Fund for various city expenses. During Monday night’s meeting, council member Jennifer Baker made the motion to raise the millage. The city is struggling with how to pay for a 23% increase in its health insurance premium. The city will need an additional $400,000 in 2020 to cover the rise in its health insurance.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLake Elsinore:A small earthquake rattled the Lake Elsinore area on Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake struck at 2:44 a.m. with a magnitude of 3.0 at a depth of 5.6 miles. Its epicenter was 6.5 miles west-northwest of Lake Elsinore and about 7 miles northwest of Lakeland Village, according to data from the USGS.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Most school districts in the Denver and Colorado Springs area canceled classes Wednesday, a day after many of them sent home students early because of snow. The weather shut down a stretch of Interstate 70 east of Denver International Airport but it reopened early Wednesday. The snowy weather has been accompanied by cold temperatures. Denver broke a record for the lowest maximum temperature for Tuesday by reaching 18 degrees.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: A New England aquarium beloved for its beluga whales is hoping to get five more of the marine mammals as part of a research project. Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut is home to the largest outdoor beluga whale habitat in the country. Three of the whales live in the habitat. The aquarium said it’s awaiting approval from the federal government for the transfer of five belugas that were born at a facility in Canada. Stephen Coan, president of Sea Research Foundation, said the whales would become part of a research program designed to increase general knowledge about the species and inform conservation efforts. The foundation operates the aquarium. Belugas are white whales that can weigh up to 3,500 pounds. Some of their populations are considered endangered.\n\nDelaware\n\nSlaughter Beach: Officials said three homes near the coast were heavily damaged in an accidental fire. News outlets reported the State Fire Marshal’s Office said an outdoor generator sparked the flames that burned the houses Wednesday afternoon in Slaughter Beach. Delaware Assistant State Fire Marshal Michael Chionchio said the damage is estimated at $800,000. No injuries were reported. The town doesn’t have fire hydrants. Mayor Harry Ward said 11 fire companies responded to help douse the flames. The fire happened on the same street where flames erupted on Christmas night in 2017 and destroyed at least two homes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The U.S. Air Force sent a letter to Balfour-Beatty Communities, one of the private companies that manage military housing, to demand an improvement plan, WUSA-TV reported. The letter follows up on issues WUSA-TV has been reporting on for months. Military families told the station they have been living with mold, lead paint and maintenance issues, which create safety concerns. The Air Force is requiring Balfour-Beatty to submit a comprehensive improvement plan by the end of the year. The letter goes on to detail the consequences if the Air Force does not see “prompt and substantial improvement.” WUSA-TV contacted a spokesperson for Balfour-Beatty Communities, which has its headquarters in Philadelphia, who said, “The company is redoubling its efforts to address the issues raised in the letter. We are committed to ensuring that the housing we provide to all of our residents is of a high standard. We are taking a number of steps to address maintenance concerns, including hiring specialists to provide additional oversight, training our people on best customer service practices, and hiring more maintenance and quality control experts. Balfour Beatty Communities is working directly with Air Force representatives to ensure their expectations are met.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A Bengal tiger has died at Busch Gardens after getting into an “atypical altercation” with its brother. The park announced Bala’s death in a statement Tuesday. Officials said a necropsy was being completed. Siblings Bala and Bhutan had lived in the park since 2007. Park spokeswoman Rebecca Romzek said Bhutan isn’t being treated for injuries, but they are closely checking him. The Tampa Bay Times reported eight tigers live at Busch Gardens and they rotate on and off in the park’s Jungala habitat where visitors can see them. Bala was known as the “redhead” of the park’s tigers. She had a strawberry white/blonde coloration, which is caused by a gene mutation that makes the tiger’s striping paler than usual.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Wildlife officials used a bulldozer to help rescue a manatee that got stuck in sand near Savannah. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources said the manatee was navigating a manmade shortcut between rivers near Savannah on Oct. 1 when it got stranded at low tide. That’s because the cut is being filled by the Army Corps of Engineers to create wetlands. The state agency posted a video online that showed wildlife workers keeping the manatee wet until a bulldozer plowed a trench that allowed river water to reach the animal. Workers then rolled the manatee onto a stretcher and guided it to deeper water. Manatees are protected as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They pass through Georgia waters on their way to Florida for the winter.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Federal geologists are examining samples of water from a growing pond in a Hawaii volcano’s crater. Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory used a drone to collect water samples from a growing lake in Kilauea volcano’s crater, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. They will test the water’s chemistry to find out more about its origin and how much it is interacting with volcanic gases that come from deep magma. Geologists confirmed the presence of the water in the bottom of Halemaumau crater this summer. It is the first time in recorded history that water has appeared in the crater. Kilauea had a major eruption last year that caused the collapse of the crater to below the water table. Patricia Nadeau, a research geologist with HVO, said there has always been groundwater near the Kilauea summit but it had never reached the surface. Besides confirming that the water is not rain pooling in the crater, its composition can also tell researchers more about what’s happening deep underground where the volcano’s magma is.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal lawsuit challenging Idaho’s ballot initiative process as unconstitutional because it requires signatures from multiple legislative districts has been dismissed. Chief U.S. District Court Judge David C. Nye ruled Tuesday that Ryan Isbelle lacked standing to bring the lawsuit but didn’t rule on the merits of the case. Nye said Isbelle lacked standing because he hadn’t tried to get an initiative on the ballot. Nye didn’t rule on Isbelle’s claim that Idaho’s initiative rules violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. Isbelle argued that an Idaho law passed in 2013 requiring signatures from 6% of registered voters in 18 legislative districts was unconstitutional. Before 2013, ballot initiatives required signatures from 6% of statewide registered voters. Isbelle argued the change unconstitutionally gave more weight to signatures in some districts.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: It was a real dog of a ceremony this week during a swearing-in at the state’s attorney’s office in Chicago. The newly sworn-in worker is a Labrador retriever named Hatty. The 2-year-old will ease the strain of criminal proceedings on young children and those with mental-health issues who have been victims of assault. She will handle up to 200 cases annually. Hatty is the office’s first emotional-support dog and was trained partly by inmates. Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx presided over Tuesday’s swearing-in. Hatty stood on her hind legs over a table and placed her paw across a law book as an oath was administered.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:State officials are suspending work requirements for low-income residents who receive their health insurance through Medicaid while a federal lawsuit challenging the plan is sorted out. The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said it won’t be enforcing rules that require those not qualifying for exemptions to report 20 hours a month of work or related activity or face coverage loss after Dec. 31. The move comes after a lawsuit was filed in September against Indiana’s plan. Federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from allowing similar work requirements for Arkansas and Kentucky. Attorneys for Medicaid recipients said Congress intended medical care as the Medicaid program’s goal, and the Trump administration failed to account for potential coverage losses for thousands of people from work requirements.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: Some Iowa State students are pressuring the university administration to take action against people who have scrawled anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi slogans on campus. Dozens of protesters gathered Wednesday afternoon at university President Wendy Wintersteen’s office to push their goal of a zero-tolerance university policy toward racism and anti-Semitism. Protest organizers said “Heil Hitler,” “no trans rights” and anti-Semitic slogans were written in chalk at various places on the campus last week. The Des Moines Register reported that posters and stickers advocating white nationalist viewpoints have been found on campus since 2016. Wintersteen spoke to a couple of the protest organizers and later emailed a statement that said she was proud of the students “for standing up against bigotry and racism.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Topeka Zoo officials said a 30-year-old Malayan sun bear was euthanized after suffering from several age-related medical conditions. The female bear, called Cup Cake, was euthanized Monday. She and a bear called Ho Ho came to the zoo in 2017 after their exhibit at a previous zoo was closed for construction. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said both bears were elderly when they arrived in Topeka and zoo officials anticipated they would not live long. He said they were kept in an area with keepers who specialized in working with geriatric animals. Cup Cake began limping on Saturday and her hind legs were useless by Sunday. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported the decision was made to euthanize Cup Cake when she developed head tremors Monday morning.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Distillers’ Association said distilleries filled more than 2.1 million barrels of bourbon in 2018. The state’s inventory of aging spirits reached 9.1 million barrels, mostly bourbon. The group said both figures are modern-era records. It’s the highest inventory in the 52 years that records have been kept. It’s also the only time since 1967 that Kentucky distillers filled more than 2 million barrels. The association said the figures came from Kentucky Department of Revenue data. Despite the continuing surge, the group said trade disputes and tariffs pose an industry threat. The association said Kentucky bourbon exports to European Union countries – the industry’s largest market – have plummeted through August, compared to the same time last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A Louisiana appeals court has overruled a judge who said prosecutors could not use the word “rape” during a man’s rape trial. In a ruling filed Wednesday, Judge Ben Willard in New Orleans granted a defense request to bar prosecutors and prosecution witnesses from using the word rape in an ongoing trial. Prosecutors appealed, noting the defendant faces multiple charges, including first-degree rape. A three-judge panel of Louisiana’s 4th Circuit Court of Appeal agreed that Willard was wrong to ban the use of the word rape by prosecutors. It’s unknown why attorneys with the New Orleans Public Defenders office made the request. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Willard did not spell out his reasoning in a filing with the appellate court.\n\nMaine\n\nArundel: A report from the Maine Center for Disease Control found PFAS chemical contamination in nearly half the public water supplies tested. The agency had 19 water supplies tested because of their proximity to potential sources of PFAS contamination, such as airports, landfills and paper mills. PFAS chemicals, which are sometimes described as “forever chemicals,” were found in nine of the water supplies. Maine CDC provided its report on Tuesday to a PFAS task force organized by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. PFAS chemicals were found in towns including Arundel, Georgetown and Topsham. Maine CDC’s summary of the findings said a high percentage of water systems declined to take part. A Maine CDC spokesperson said the data is evidence for mandatory monitoring for the chemicals in community water systems.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: A community service agency has come to the rescue of a deaf Maryland woman who faced a nearly $5,000 water bill because she couldn’t hear her toilet running. The Frederick News-Post reported the Frederick Community Action Agency stepped in Tuesday to help cover Denise Sansonese’s bill. Agency Assistant Director of Community Services Brad Peterson said it wants the city to reduce the bill by any amount and will do what’s necessary to take the balance down to zero if that doesn’t happen. Blake Sansonese said his mother went to the city to address the bill but was told there wasn’t an interpreter available to help her. Denise Sansonese said she never saw a letter city left on her door about the bill.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSpringfield: An MGM dealer said the casino has been paying him less than minimum wage and shorting overtime pay. Shawn Connors, of Uncasville, Connecticut, filed a complaint Monday in U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, alleging that he is entitled to more than the wage MGM Springfield has been paying. The Boston Globe reported Connors began working at the casino last summer, shortly before it opened. Connors said he should be paid more than the approximately $5 per hour rate he has been paid because he also receives tips. He added MGM never notified him that he would earn such a low basic wage, as is required by law. The lawsuit also claimed the casino underpaid tipped employees who worked overtime. An MGM spokesman said they have received the filing and will “respond accordingly.”\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: State environmental regulators are promising faster reviews of applications to protect homes or structures threatened by rising Great Lakes levels. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said Wednesday it will expedite permits for actions such as placing rocks or building seawalls to prevent erosion. Director Liesl Clark said permit consideration requires a balance between protecting property and safeguarding environmental features such as dunes, shorelines and bluffs. She said excessive or poorly designed shoreline protection structures can disrupt natural processes and damage neighboring properties. It usually takes 60 to 90 days to process shoreline permits. EGLE said it will act much faster where homes or infrastructure are at risk. The number of shoreline protection permits granted has risen sharply in recent years. In many cases, permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also are required for placing materials along the water.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBemidji: A plan to dispose of deer carcasses during Minnesota’s upcoming rifle hunting season is unraveling over a waste hauler’s fears of spreading chronic wasting disease. The state placed special dumpsters in parts of central and southeastern Minnesota where the fatal deer brain disease has been found. The plan was to use the containers to safely dispose of potentially infected deer carcasses. But Waste Management will not accept deer carcasses infected with chronic wasting or that have the potential of being infected. With Minnesota’s rifle season about to start, officials are worried hunters will toss bones onto the land where the disease can spread to other deer. Officials of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources told state lawmakers Tuesday that Waste Management does not want to be held liable if the infectious material that causes chronic wasting spreads into the wild, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Waste Management spokeswoman Julie Ketchum told the Associated Press that the waste disposal company will handle any deer carcasses already in the dumpsters. But Waste Management is concerned about the prions, a misshaped protein that causes the disease in deer and elk and remains infectious in the environment for years, Ketchum said. The DNR has had difficulty convincing landfills to take potentially infected deer, MPR reported. Chronic wasting is still rare in Minnesota, but its potential spread is a worry for state conservation officials who oversee Minnesota’s $1 billion annual deer-hunting industry.\n\nMississippi\n\nGulfport: Construction will begin next year for a veterans’ nursing home near the Gulf Coast. The 100-bed facility will be in the Tradition development north of Gulfport. News outlets reported that the executive director of the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board, Stacey Pickering, spoke at a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday. He said the state has 189,000 veterans and 26% of them live in the three coastal counties. The closest veterans’ home to the coast is in Collins, about 2 hours away. Pickering said the state Legislature agreed to provide $16 million to go with a federal grant of $29.3 million to build the center.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it has signed a lease for permanent office space at a building in downtown Kansas City for two of its research agencies. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a news release Thursday that signing the lease is an important next step for the agencies’ efficiency, effectiveness and service to customers. The USDA announced plans in June to move roughly 550 employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture by the end of September to the Kansas City area. The announcement of the new office space comes amid charges from a federal employees union that the move has left them critically understaffed, saying it will take years to hire replacements for the highly specialized positions.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: With snow on the ground in Montana, fire agencies from across the state are sending 20 engines and 72 firefighters to California to help battle wildfires there. Gov. Steve Bullock approved sending crews as part of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact. About 18 agencies are sending personnel and equipment for 14-day deployments. Flathead County Fire Services Manager Lincoln Chute and Helena firefighter Owen Koeppen said the work will allow Montana firefighters to gain experience, knowledge and skills they can use at home. Helena Assistant Fire Chief Mike Chambers said six firefighters are going to California and the rest of the department will fill in and maybe work some overtime to cover shifts. Blazes fanned by strong winds are burning in northern and southern California, destroying homes and threatening others, forcing thousands of people to evacuate\n\nNebraska\n\nMaxwell: The Nebraska State Patrol said troopers have seized 91 pounds of marijuana found in a sport utility vehicle during a traffic stop on Interstate 80 near Maxwell. The patrol said the stop happened Tuesday night when the driver of the SUV was pulled over on suspicion of having an obscured license plate. During the stop, a police drug dog indicated the presence of drugs in the vehicle, and a search turned up the marijuana, which was concealed in bags in the SUV’s cargo area. The 36-year-old driver and 61-year-old passenger, both from Kansas City, Missouri, were arrested, as was a 34-year-old passenger from Mexico, on suspicion of various drug violations.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Conservationists are suing the Trump administration to try to block mining exploration in Nevada they said would wipe out the only known population of a desert wildflower. The Center for Biological Diversity filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this month to list Tiehm’s buckwheat as an endangered species. The new lawsuit accuses the Bureau of Land Management of illegally dividing the mining operations into two separate projects so as to bypass its own regulations requiring a formal environmental review and public comment on any land disturbances larger than 5 acres. BLM lists one of the exploration projects as 4.98 acres and the other as 4.04 acres in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County about 120 miles southeast of Reno, where a lithium and boron mine is planned. Bureau spokesman Rudy Evenson said the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation. But he said it “takes the protection of this species seriously and is committed to the deliberate process to ensure it is protected.” The delicate wildflower – typically about 2 feet tall with white to cream to yellow blooms – plays an integral role in the desert ecosystem by stabilizing soils and dispersing seeds, the lawsuit said. The estimated 20,000 to 43,000 individual plants that remain are found only in specific soil conditions on 21 acres spread across 3 square miles of Nevada in a narrow elevation band between 5,960 and 6,200 feet, according to the petition filed Oct. 7 seeking protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A watchdog report based on a review of child fatalities called on New Hampshire’s child protection agency to address systemic problems, including an outdated filing system, strained relationships with other agencies and internal biases among staff members. The Office of the Child Advocate was created in 2017 as part of a larger effort to reform the state’s Division of Children, Youth and Families. It released a report this week based on a monthslong review of six cases that focused not on the actions of particular individuals, but rather the environment in which they occurred. Child Advocate Moira O’Neill said the goal is to shift from “blame and shame” to system accountability. DCYF officials noted the report raises several long-standing issues that are already are being addressed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Transportation Security Administration agents at Newark Liberty Airport uncovered a more decorative than deadly item when they checked a passenger’s carry-on. Agents on Tuesday thought there was a gun in the bag when they put it through the X-ray machine. However, a closer inspection revealed a gun-shaped toilet paper roller. The realistic replica gun was designed to spin paper instead of bullets. Travelers are not permitted to bring real or replica firearms through security checkpoints. TSA said it gave the man the option to place it in a checked bag, hand it off to a companion or surrender it. He decided to give it to the TSA.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHolloman Air Force Base: The Air Force said a pilot successfully ejected from an F-16 before the fighter crashed in southern New Mexico during a training flight. Holloman Air Force Base officials said the F-16 assigned to the 49th Wing at the base crashed Tuesday night about 80 miles southeast of the base. Officials said in a statement that the pilot was taken to a hospital for treatment, but it did not provide information on any injuries to the pilot, whose identity was not released. The statement said a board of officers will investigate the crash and that its cause wasn’t determined immediately.\n\nNew York\n\nRotterdam: A dog hit by a car in upstate New York rode for 45 minutes wedged between the broken bumper and the grille before the driver realized she was carrying an injured passenger. Coco the Shiba inu was being treated for a fractured elbow after being struck Monday morning in Albany. Rotterdam Police Lt. Jeffrey Collins said the driver knew she hit something and noticed the car’s damage but didn’t see the dog at first. She drove about 15 miles to Rotterdam before hearing noises and stopping to recheck her car’s front end. She called 911 after she saw the dog gazing from below the license plate. A Schenectady veterinary clinic worker told WNYT-TV that 16-pound Coco “fit perfectly” in the space behind the bumper and was lucky to be alive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A gleaming abstract sculpture that’s lit from within will be the centerpiece of a new park honoring the contributions of African Americans to North Carolina that has been in the planning stages for more than a decade. The state Historical Commission approved the new design for Freedom Park on Wednesday. The park will be located on a 1-acre site between the state legislature and the Governor’s Mansion in Raleigh. Inspirational quotes from African Americans from North Carolina will be engraved on walls along walkways that lead to the 48-foot-tall Beacon of Freedom sculpture. Plans for the park began in 2002, and an architect was chosen in 2004. But the Great Recession dampened fundraising, and supporters learned that potential donors found the design’s focus on slavery too depressing, board member Reginald Hodges said Wednesday. The design includes no monuments; the walls carry no quotes from people outside North Carolina. The walls will be made of precast concrete and tinted to resemble the red clay of North Carolina, said architect Michael Stevenson of Perkins and Will. One quote located in a prominent place comes from John H. Wheeler, president of Mechanics & Farmers Bank from 1952 to 1978 and a founder of the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs: “The battle for freedom begins every morning.” A groundbreaking for the park is planned for December. Stevenson estimated that completing it will take about a year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Water Commission has unveiled a new interactive mapping tool that provides information on potential flooding in the state. State risk map coordinator Laura Horner said the map shows where flooding might occur and to what extent it could happen in various scenarios. The Bismarck Tribune reported that the North Dakota Risk Assessment Mapservice was on display Wednesday at the Bismarck Event Center. The tool is intended to help people make informed decisions about flood protection and provide resources to community leaders who want to keep citizens safe. It uses base-level engineering that combines elevation data with advancements in modeling technology. The state partnered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the project.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringfield: The 178th Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard is set to get its first female commander. Col. Kimberly Fitzgerald is scheduled to assume duties as commander of the 178th Wing from Col. Gregg Hesterman during a ceremony Sunday at the Springfield Air National Guard Base. Fitzgerald is currently the vice commander of the 178th Wing. She has 26 years of service including a total of more than 4,000 flight hours as a KC-135 navigator, a KC-135 pilot, MQ-1 Predator pilot, and MQ-9 Reaper pilot. She transferred to the 178th Wing in 2011 and served as the 162nd Flying Squadron commander and Mission Support Group commander before taking on the role of vice commander. Hesterman will serve as the director of staff for the Ohio National Guard.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma judge on Wednesday rejected an attempt by a Democratic state lawmaker and gun safety advocates to block a new law that will allow most people in the state to carry a firearm in public without a background check or training. Oklahoma County District Judge Don Andrews rejected a request by Oklahoma City Democratic Rep. Jason Lowe for a preliminary injunction that would have stopped the “permitless carry” law from taking effect on Friday. Lowe’s attorney, Melanie Rughani, argued that the bill violated the state’s constitutional single-subject rule that requires bills to deal with only one topic. But the judge said Rughani failed to prove that the law taking effect would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. Lowe promised to appeal the judge’s ruling to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. According to the National Rifle Association, at least 14 states have approved some version of permitless carry.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Wildland firefighters worked to contain blazes across Western Oregon as windy conditions and low humidity gripped the state. KVAL reported strong east winds caused wildfire danger levels to climb, the Coos Forest Protective Association said Wednesday. The agency said southwestern Oregon is experiencing a similar weather pattern as California, where multiple fires have destroyed homes and forced thousands to evacuate. The Coos Forest Protective Association responded to four fires since Sunday, one of which the agency said was power-line related. Firefighters in Lane County have brought two fires that started Tuesday under control. Firefighters also contained a small blaze near Eagle Point on Tuesday. Firefighters continue to work a small fire in Josephine County that started Saturday. Fire crews are also working to control two somewhat larger fires in northwest Oregon east of Molalla and near Detroit. No injuries have been reported and no structures have been reported destroyed.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A proposal to allow hunting on three Sundays a year in Pennsylvania is on its way to the state Senate for a final vote. The House voted 144-54 on Wednesday for the bill that would also require a landowner’s written permission. The bill would permit Sunday hunting one day during rifle deer season, one during statewide archery deer season and a third day the Game Commission would select. It also would make it easier for wardens to enforce the anti-trespassing law.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Public utilities regulators said a natural gas outage that affected more than 7,000 customers during a particularly cold spell last winter was caused by low pressure in a pipeline. The 74-page Division of Public Utilities and Carriers report released Wednesday blamed the low pressure on high demand for gas driven by low temperatures; failure of a power system at a liquefied natural gas storage and vaporization facility in Providence; and a malfunctioning valve at a meter station in Weymouth, Massachusetts. The agency said it will oppose any efforts by National Grid to recover the $25 million in costs related to the outage from ratepayers. Thousands of residents of Newport and Middletown went without gas or heat for nearly a week last January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJoint Base Charleston: Melania Trump and Karen Pence traveled to South Carolina on Wednesday to get briefings about some of the military’s emergency preparedness and humanitarian efforts in a state where both are often needed because of active hurricane seasons. During a few hours in and around Joint Base Charleston, where several branches of the military have operations, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence were updated by a handful of agencies, whose officials described how they mobilize federal resources before and after natural disasters. That often means natural disasters in South Carolina, where the coast was evacuated earlier this year as Hurricane Dorian swirled in the Atlantic Ocean. Skirting the Carolina coast just after Labor Day, Dorian’s high winds and rain spun off tornadoes that peeled away roofs and flipped recreational vehicles. Earlier, at an elementary school just off the base, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence also met with fifth-grade students participating in the Red Cross Pillowcase Project, which helps children mentally and physically prepare for natural disasters. Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence have previously toured military installations together, including North Carolina’s Fort Bragg earlier this year. To close out their South Carolina trip, both women made remarks to several hundred service members and their families on the base, thanking them for serving the country. Mrs. Pence reminded the crowd of the importance of military spouses and families, and Mrs. Trump focused on heralding the strength of the U.S. military.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Authorities have been staking out a cornfield in northern Sioux Falls for more than 24 hours, waiting out a loose, recluse moose that has taken shelter in the field near 60th Street North and Marion Road. \"He kind of disappeared on us. We think he's napping,\" said Julie DeJong, the animal control supervisor. Animal Control responded to the report around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. Game, Fish and Parks and South Dakota Highway Patrol also are involved in the situation. There were also reports of a moose in Hartford over the weekend, DeJong said, though she didn't know if this was the same moose. Authorities will continue to monitor the cornfield until the moose comes out, DeJong said. When he does come out, the moose will either wander out of town and authorities will leave it alone or, if it moves closer to Sioux Falls, authorities will try to contain him, sedate him and move him outside of the city. There have been two other instances of a moose on the loose in the Sioux Falls area within recent years. The two were weeks apart in fall 2016 when a female and then a male wandered into Brandon and the Sioux Falls area. October and November are part of the mating season for moose. The moose could have come from northern Minnesota or from North Dakota, DeJong said. For now, the moose is taking its time, likely eating corn in the field, as authorities wait it out, DeJong said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Country star and Grammy winner Marty Stuart will be the celebrity guest on the annual CSX Santa Train, which visits towns in Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia in November to hand out gifts for families. The holiday train, which has run every year since 1942, makes a dozen stops in three states, starting in Shelby, Kentucky, and ending in Kingsport, Tennessee, on Nov. 23. The train delivers food, toys and winter clothing on the 110-mile trip. Stuart, who was recently prominently featured in Ken Burns’ “Country Music” PBS documentary, has released 18 studio albums. Born in Mississippi, Stuart started his career playing bluegrass with legend Lester Flatt and later in Johnny Cash’s band. He’s also a photographer and is planning to open a music museum in Mississippi.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A woman is accused of spraying blood and urine on security guards and paintings of governors at the state Capitol. According to an affidavit, Amber Lynette Green was arrested Monday after spraying a Texas Department of Public Safety corporal and another employee with “an unknown liquid in a bottle.” Green sprayed the liquid on paintings of governors in the Capitol rotunda before telling the corporal “there was blood and urine in the bottle.” The officer said he could smell urine. The officer tried to arrest Green, but she ran from the Capitol grounds. Department of Public Safety officers arrested her. Green was charged with harassment of a public servant, evading arrest and other counts. She was booked into Travis County Jail. Bail was set at $25,000.\n\nUtah\n\nBrigham City: Officials in a Utah community say they have received “more than a few” complaints about a family’s Halloween display that includes a guillotine chopping off the heads of baby dolls. However, the city attorney for Brigham City, Michael Christiansen, said the display isn’t a public nuisance under the city code even though “it’s distasteful to some.” KUTV-TV reported that In addition to the guillotine, the lawn display also includes a bloody nurse standing over a baby incubator containing angry-looking babies and baby parts. Julie Bawden said her family’s annual Halloween displays are just intended “to be spooky and fun.” Neighbor Claudia Perry said she objects to the display, saying it’s too much. In Perry’s words, “how far are they going to go? And where are we going to stop?”\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Officials said a dam previously deemed a public safety hazard has been demolished. The Dunklee Pond Dam in Rutland came down Wednesday. The Rutland Herald reported that the city and state have been looking at removing the dam since at least 2016. In August, city officials said the structure was one bad rainstorm away from complete failure, which would be compounded by the dam’s massive sediment buildup. Houses downstream were evacuated in early 2017 when erosion from a sudden rainstorm triggered fears it might fail. The Board of Alderman declared it a public safety hazard last year. A no-bid contract for emergency measures was approved last week after a dam retaining wall shifted 3 ½ inches following an Oct. 17 storm.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The Virginian-Pilot reported Thursday that a juvenile humpback whale washed up dead on the north end of Virginia Beach. The spot is along the Atlantic Ocean and just south of the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The whale might have been the same animal that someone spotted floating near the bay’s mouth earlier in the week. Alexander Costidis of the Virginia Aquarium said the whale was “pretty decomposed.” He said the whale was tossed around in the waves so much that there wasn’t much left inside the animal to test for a cause of death. But he said that a ship strike was unlikely. The mammal was 26 feet long and was probably between 1 and 3 years old.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court said in a split decision that the state cannot be held at fault for an accident that caused the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River to collapse in 2013. A truck carrying an oversized load struck the overhead support beams of the bridge, causing the structure to fall into the water. No one was killed, but three people in two vehicles plunged into the water. The state sued the Canadian trucking company, Mullen Trucking 2005 Ltd. The company countersued, saying the state was partially at fault and should have to pay some of the damages. Mullen Trucking said the state was negligent in issuing a permit for the load and in maintaining the bridge. In a 5-4 decision, the court Thursday pointed to a state law that said vehicle owners or operators must exercise due care in making sure their vehicles can pass under a structure, and that the state can’t be held liable for damages caused by an overheight vehicle. The dissenting justices said the state could not be found liable under that law, but that it still could be at fault if it failed to properly maintain the bridge.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: Regulators said a state-record chain pickerel was caught in Preston County. The Division of Natural Resources said in a news release that Matt Born of Reedsville used an in-line spinner to catch the fish Oct. 13 at Upper Deckers Lake. The fish measured a record 27.87 inches, besting the record of 27.75-inches caught by Steven Demma at Tuckahoe Lake in 2001. The chain pickerel is a member of the pike family.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A large storm system moving through the Midwest delivered some early season snow to much of Wisconsin. As much as 6 inches of snow was expected in the southern part of the state. Forecasters expected lesser amounts elsewhere, including near Lake Michigan. The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory Thursday from northeastern Wisconsin to southern counties. Falling snow slowed the morning commute. In Milwaukee County, the interstate system was slick. Temperatures Thursday night were expected to drop to the 20s.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Wildlife managers have authorized 375 permits for this year’s elk hunt at Grand Teton National Park, which begins Saturday. They will allow hunting in an area mainly east of U.S. Highway 89 in the southeast part of Grand Teton in western Wyoming. Hunting in two different portions of the hunt area will end on Nov. 25 and Dec. 8. Hunting typically isn’t allowed in national parks but the 1950 law authorizing Grand Teton allows elk hunting in the park. Park officials call the hunt an “elk reduction program” intended to cull animals in the Jackson elk herd. Hunters must abide by several rules that often don’t apply outside the park. They include requirements to carry bear spray and use nonlead ammunition", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/31/tuskegee-monument-sugar-water-potato-problems-news-around-states/118486586/", "title": "Tuskegee monument, sugar water: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which began in a high school auditorium in 1972, is undergoing a $1.6million renovation in advance of its 50th season. Located in east Montgomery, the theater is upgrading an entrance lobby and enclosing an outdoor area. It also is adding restrooms, constructing a new gift shop and making other additions. While the theater received $1.18 million in federal pandemic aid as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, spokeswoman Layne Holley said the renovations will not use that money, and officials have yet to decide how to use the funding. Indoor shows are scheduled to resume Nov. 27 with a production of “Cinderella.” Executive director Todd Schmidt said the theater has survived the pandemic and made plans for a return in part because of strong community backing. “We had to reduce our staff and our overhead,” Schmidt said. “It’s been a tough time, but luckily we’ve had great support.” Initially staged at Anniston High School, the company relocated to Montgomery and is housed in a theater constructed in 1985.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives has postponed its annual convention because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state, officials said in a statement. The convention has traditionally been the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the state. It had been scheduled for Oct. 21-23 but is now delayed until mid-December in Anchorage, the organization said in a statement. Organizers said they will continue planning for an in-person convention at the Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage with a virtual option. However, the statement said the board will make a decision by mid-October on whether to maintain the in-person part. Organizers encouraged Alaskans to get vaccinated and wear masks so the convention can be held. One notable celebration this year will be the observation of the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act was the largest land settlement in the nation’s history when President Richard Nixon signed it into law Dec. 18, 1971, and settled Indigenous land claims in Alaska. “Postponing until December provides us an opportunity to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of ANCSA, but it all hinges on everyone’s willingness and ability to get vaccinated,” said Sealaska chairman and Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Joe Nelson.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A tribe that didn’t sign a revised gambling compact with the state earlier this year has filed a lawsuit alleging that a new law is unconstitutional and left some rural tribes in the cold by excluding them from negotiations hamming out the legislation. The suit filed by the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe on Thursday asks the court to prevent the Department of Gaming from issuing sportsbook licenses and allowing sports betting. The lawsuit said the state presented the tribe with an amended compact “as a non-negotiable, ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ proposition.” The lawmaker who sponsored the gambling legislation defended it as fair and equitable. The legislation signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last spring expands the types of gambling allowed at tribal casinos, lets tribes and pro sports teams take bets on sport evenings, and licenses six operators to sign up players for betting on fantasy virtual games. A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for next Friday on the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has scheduled the retrial of a former state senator on bribery and fraud charges for the first week of October. Court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, show U.S. District Judge Judge Price Marshall on Friday scheduled the trial for Gilbert Baker, a Republican former senator and one-time state GOP chairman, to begin Oct. 4. A federal jury earlier this month acquitted Baker of conspiracy in the case in which he allegedly conspired to bribe an ex-judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The jury, however, deadlocked on charges of bribery and wire fraud against Baker, and prosecutors on Thursday filed notice of their intent to retry those counts. Baker was accused of conspiring with former state Judge Michael Maggio, who admitted to accepting campaign donations from a nursing home operator, then reducing a judgment against that company by $4.2 million. Michael Morton, the nursing home operator, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Maggio was sentenced in 2015 to 10 years in prison.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBlythe: California farmers near the Arizona border with the oldest rights to Colorado River water will reap $38million over three years to not plant some of their fields and leave extra water in the rapidly declining Lake Mead reservoir. Located roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, growers near the city of Blythe in Riverside County have first priority to the river water. They hold rights that stretch back to 1877, superseding 40 million customers in eight states who also depend on it. But with continued drought and overuse, a first-ever shortage in the river system was declared in recent weeks by federal authorities, triggering cuts to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico’s supplies next year. In response, farmers who control the Palo Verde Irrigation District voted unanimously this month to agree to cancel planting some of their crops for three years. They will be paid about $925 per acre this year via federal drought response funds and water ratepayers in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, with 2% increases each year after that. Bart Fisher, a PVID trustee whose family owns the 11,500-acre Fisher Ranch, said he and others were acting not because they want the money but because they want to help others and try to guarantee continued water supply for all.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s secretary of state filed a lawsuit Monday to remove a rural county’s election clerk who is accused of allowing a security breach of the county’s voting equipment that is currently being investigated by the FBI. The lawsuit filed in Mesa County district court by Secretary of State Jena Griswold seeks to formally remove Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters as the designated election official. The suit also calls for the appointment of former Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace Peters and Sheila Reiner, former Mesa county clerk and recorder, to serve as the elections supervisor for the county’s upcoming November elections. The Board of County Commissioners praised the changes in a statement Monday, saying Mesa County will have “arguably the most secure and transparent election system in the United States.” Peters has claimed that the investigation led by Griswold – who is a Democrat – is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado. Griswold said initial investigation findings show images of election management software used by the county’s elections equipment were obtained by conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs. Griswold’s office also said it believes one of the images was taken from a secure room.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools around the state looking to upgrade aging ventilation systems to improve air quality and help fight the airborne spread of the coronavirus may find themselves short on funds, even with federal pandemic aid. The Connecticut Mirror reports a state policy restricts aid for heating, air conditioning and air quality control projects. The policy could be reviewed again by legislators, but likely not before the 2022 General Assembly session in February. “There are some districts that haven’t touched their schools in 40 years,” said Kostantinos Diamantis, the state’s budget director who also has overseen the state’s school construction program for the past six years. “The local level needs to belly up to the bar. The cities have an obligation to maintain those buildings.” Connecticut reimburses communities for between 10% and 71% of new construction and large renovation projects designed to last 20 years or longer, the Mirror reports. But the cost of smaller projects such as replacing or upgrading a heating and ventilation system must be absorbed by the town. For the town of Coventry, which wants to replace ventilators in its middle and high schools and make roof repairs, that would mean a bill of more than $2 million even after unused federal pandemic aid is applied.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Preliminary necropsy results show that a young fin whale that beached itself and died at Cape Henlopen State Park last week was riddled with parasites. “There was a lot going on,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. Measured by MERR to be 57 feet long, the whale first showed up in Lewes on Thursday, stuck on a sandbar in the Harbor of Refuge. It was able to free itself when the tide came in, but a short time later it beached itself again on the oceanside of The Point. Around noon Aug. 27, after many onlookers had come to catch a glimpse of its tail flapping in the surf, and just moments after Virginia Aquarium representatives had arrived to provide palliative care and possible euthanasia, the whale stopped breathing, according to a MERR Facebook post. The whale had to be cut into several pieces to move it out of the water for necropsy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dozens of people marched to the White House on Sunday calling for support of Afghan women. Organized by the nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership, the group is calling on President Joe Biden and other U.S. leaders to prioritize the evacuation of women out of Afghanistan and to help permanently protect women’s rights inside the country following the crisis inside the country and the Taliban takeover, WUSA-TV reports. Protesters wore shirts and held signs emblazoned with “I stand with Afghan women” as they marched from the Vital Voices headquarters on 16th Street through Black Lives Matter Plaza and to Lafayette Square, eventually gathering in front of the White House. The deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens from Afghanistan is Tuesday. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that for those U.S. citizens seeking immediately to leave Afghanistan by the looming deadline, “we have the capacity to have 300 Americans, which is roughly the number we think are remaining, come to the airport and get on planes in the time that is remaining.”\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Sugar growers are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over proposed reservoir water levels they say will be far too low. The federal lawsuits filed last week by Florida Crystals’ Okeelanta Corp., U.S. Sugar and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative say the current Corps plan won’t supply enough water for their fields. “Farmers need a secure supply of water, and all farmers need certainty as we plan and manage our planting schedules and crop rotation,” said Jaime Vega, vice president of agriculture at Florida Crystals. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps’ work, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. The project in question is the Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir intended to cleanse tainted water so more can flow south as crucially needed toward Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. In the lawsuits, Sugar Growers say the still-under-construction reservoir should be kept at higher water levels than what is currently envisioned in a Corps of Engineers plan. Everglades restoration advocates say the growers are simply putting their priorities ahead of others.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta Black Pride organizers say the annual celebration will happen Labor Day weekend as planned with some precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. The larger Atlanta Pride festival and parade planned for October were canceled Wednesday because of concerns about the pandemic. But leaders of Atlanta Black Pride, which celebrates the African American LGBTQ community, say they plan to go forward, with fewer indoor gatherings, while encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Amber Moore, COO and vice president of Atlanta Black Pride, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus testing will be offered. The celebration, marking its 25th anniversary this year, is to feature events around the city. In addition to parties, that includes a fashion show, a session on empowering women, an awards ceremony for the transgender community, a virtual film festival and a health expo. Vaughn Alvarez, who is helping to promote some of the events at Piedmont Park, told the newspaper that Atlanta rapper and radio host Da Brat and fiancee Jesseca “Judy” Dupart, CEO of Kaleidoscope Hair Products, will be honored for “bravery and courage with their love story.” The two star in “Brat loves Judy” on WE-TV.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A county affordable housing committee has voted to recommend approval of a rental project on Lanai, where no new affordable homes have been built in 30 years. The Hokuao 201H Housing Project, proposed by billionaire Larry Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai, includes the development of 150 two-bedroom rental homes on former pineapple fields. About half of the units will be market-rate priced. The project will be developed under the state’s fast-track approval process for affordable housing. The Maui County Council’s Affordable Housing Committee voted 8-0 to recommend giving the project the green light after multiple meetings packed with public testimony and hours of discussion over concern about the project’s number of market-rate homes, The Maui News reports. Council Chairwoman Alice Lee said the project is “desperately needed.” Pulama Lanai had sought an exemption for sidewalks in the future subdivision, saying including them would cost about $2 million. Sharon Thom, senior vice president of development and construction for Pulama Lanai, said the sidewalks would change the “look and feel” of Lanai City. But Committee Chairman Gabe Johnson argued to include sidewalks, saying the county needs to advocate for pedestrian safety and accessibility.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: The hot, dry, smoky growing season has left some potato farmers bracing for a poor crop. Randy Hardy, of Oakley, told the Idaho State Journal that his harvest will likely be the worst of his career. Statewide, spud farmers conducting test digs or early harvests are uprooting plants supporting no tubers. Where there are potatoes, there are fewer than normal, and most of the tubers are undersized and misshapen. “I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve got an agronomist who works with me on potatoes, and he’s been doing it for over 20 years, and he said he’s never seen a worse crop than this,” said Hardy, who raises spuds for the fresh market and is chairman of the board of Sun Valley Potatoes. Hardy isn’t scheduled to harvest until Sept. 20, and he’s hoping the extra time will allow his tubers to add a bit more bulk. United Potato Growers of Idaho asked growers to submit results from Aug. 1 test digs and will gather follow-up data in person during harvest. Hardy said the average number of tubers in the test digs was down 30% from last year. Weight was also down substantially, he said. Many fields lacked deep soil moisture when the potatoes were planted. Then the state was hit with record-high heat in June, contributing to fewer potatoes growing beneath each plant, and smoke-filled air from Western wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: From a waterpark resort to a public school, seven finalists have been named in a design competition to repurpose a much-maligned state government building downtown. State officials are trying to sell the James R. Thompson Center, which was designed by famed architect Helmet Jahn. They say the 17-story curved-glass structure that opened in 1985 is inefficient and requires hundreds of millions of dollars worth of repairs and updates to keep it running. The building houses offices for the governor and employees of state agencies, who are scheduled to move next year to another building on the city’s Near West Side. Illinois officials are seeking bids for a developer and have not committed to any preservation ideas. Officials have said they want to sell the building by February 2022. Architecture buffs have pushed for preservation, an effort that’s been renewed in the wake of Jahn’s death in May. The finalists were named last week. A group of design and preservation experts picked the finalists from 59 entries. A winner will be chosen Sept. 14.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A coalition of voting rights groups is sponsoring a contest for Hoosiers to draw new maps for congressional and legislative election districts. The group All IN for Democracy said the contest is aimed at finding “fair” proposed election maps to present to legislators before they vote in late September on the once-a-decade redistricting based on population shifts from the U.S. census. Voting rights activists have complained that the GOP-dominated Legislature isn’t involving the public enough in the redistricting work and that partisan gerrymandering has helped Indiana Republicans gain outsized power in state government. The organization is providing an online site where residents can compile maps based on the 2020 census data. Proposals submitted by Sept. 13 will be judged, with the winning map for Indiana’s nine congressional districts getting $1,000, with $2,000 for the best districts for the 50 Indiana Senate seats and $3,000 for the fairest map of the 100 Indiana House districts. The group said its judging will be based on how well the maps keep communities of interest together, maintain whole cities and counties in the same district, and maximize the number of politically competitive districts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Black applicants are 2.6 times more likely to be denied a conventional home loan than similarly qualified white applicants in the Des Moines/West Des Moines metro, according to an analysis of 2019 data by The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom. Des Moines has the fifth-greatest likelihood of denial for Black applicants out of 71 U.S. metro areas that The Markup found had statistically significant disparities in home loan approvals. The newsroom found that nationally, mortgage lenders are 80% more likely to reject Black applicants; 70% more likely to deny Native American applicants; 50% more likely to turn down Asian/Pacific Islander applicants; and 40% more likely to reject Latino applicants. For its analysis, The Markup examined more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications, accounting for 17 independent variables, including debt-to-income ratio and combined loan-to-value ratio. It did not take into account credit scores, which are not publicly available through Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. John Sorensen, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, said in a statement that while the organization “firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market,” the data used by The Markup doesn’t give a full picture as to why these disparities exist.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of the biggest gun dealers in south-central Kansas is the city of Wichita, but it actually received less than half the proceeds from the sales because it works with several online companies to auction off the firearms. Since a new state law allowing the gun sales was passed in 2015, Wichita has sold 2,082 guns that were seized during crimes for which the criminal cases were complete. The city generated $196,000 on the gun sales that went into a fund that pays for miscellaneous police equipment. But The Wichita Eagle learned the city received less than half of the $425,000 in total sales generated because the companies that handle the sales take a significant chunk of the proceeds. The city contracts with Propertyroom.com, which sells the guns through a partnership with a major gun retailer that operates an online auction site. The city finance director said officials last took proposals for the gun contract two years ago and got no better offer. Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who wrote the law, said it’s no different from police departments selling off other seized property, and any gun purchases require background checks. Former Rep. Jim Ward, who also used to work as a city prosecutor, said he knows it’s impossible to keep all the guns off the street, but he never wanted the government in the gun business.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An instructional assistant at an eastern Kentucky elementary school died from COVID-19 as the fast-spreading delta variant has sparked coronavirus outbreaks in several school districts. Heather Antle, an aide at Lee County Elementary, died Sunday. Antle was an involved member of the school community who “brought great joy to the students and staff that she worked with,” Lee County Superintendent Sarah Wasson said in a statement posted to social media. The Lee County district canceled in-person classes until Sept. 7 in response to coronavirus cases among students and teachers. Virus outbreaks have caused disruptions since the school year began. Several other districts have shut down classes for multiple days due to outbreaks. Gov. Andy Beshear, while expressing condolences to Antle’s family, urged Kentuckians to get vaccinated and wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread in schools. “There was a time when some argued COVID did not spread in schools,” the governor said on social media. “That time should be over. ... We must do everything in our power to prevent the spread of this virus in our schools, and vaccinations and masks are our greatest tools. Let’s do what’s right for our teachers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A couple who met in a gross anatomy class as Tulane University undergraduates have given Tulane Medical School $5 million for an endowed professorship. Drs. Philip and Cheryl Leone, of Naples, Florida, are now retired pathologists and current members of the School of Medicine Board of Governors, a university news release said Wednesday. Their endowment will support a medical school professor who will also hold a joint appointment in another school or unit and will focus on areas such as public health, immunology, parasitology or anthropology, the university said. The Leones have worked in both academia and private practice. “Tulane University has played a major role in our lives and the lives of our family members,” Phil Leone said. “Our son graduated from Tulane, and Cheryl’s siblings earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university.” “Endowing a Presidential Chair with an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic study allows us to contribute to the university in these challenging times,” Cheryl Leone said. “We hope our gift will strengthen the medical school and help train future physicians who can significantly advance the field of medicine.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: More than 125 boats participated in a weekend protest against plans for an aquaculture operation in waters near Acadia National Park. Commercial and recreational vessels comprised the “Save the Bay” flotilla that motored around Frenchman Bay on Sunday. Some people on land also participated by holding signs stating their opposition. American Aquafarms has proposed raising 66 million pounds of Atlantic salmon annually at a pair of 15-pen sites off the coast of Gouldsboro in Frenchman Bay. The company didn’t immediately return a telephone message. Ted O’Meara of Frenchman’s Bay United likened the scope of the project to ”some huge hog farm from the Midwest and plucking it right in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts of Maine.” He said that “our first goal is to stop this project, and our second goal is to look at changing some of the rules that allow people like this to think they can just come here and plug something like this down in our waters.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The first new Catholic school built in the city in roughly 60 years opened its doors Monday to hundreds of youngsters, who entered the gleaming new building with a mix of enthusiasm and first-day-back jitters. The state-of-the-art Mother Mary Lange Catholic School was built on the site where a notoriously rough public housing high-rise once stood. In a U.S. city steeped in Catholicism like few others, the new 65,000-square-foot building near downtown Baltimore is somewhat of an anomaly in the national education landscape as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the shuttering of many Catholic schools. It’s named after Mother Mary Elizabeth Lange, a Haitian American who started a Catholic school for Black children in 1828 – the first U.S. Catholic school for African American youth. She co-founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore in 1829. The Vatican is reviewing Lange for possible canonization. Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori said the new school, which goes from preschool to eighth grade, is not only a benefit to the students and their families but also an asset to the surrounding neighborhood. The school’s playing fields and gym will be accessible, as appropriate, to the city community. “They say a rising tide lifts all boats. And I think the opening of this school has put a spring in the step of all of our Catholic educators,” Lori said in a phone interview.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A public marker to remember the enslaved Africans forced to journey across the ocean to toil in the Americas was formally dedicated Sunday on the downtown waterfront. The Middle Passage Port Marker was installed last October at the end of Long Wharf looking out onto Boston Harbor. It is meant to acknowledge Boston’s history of slavery and honor the Africans who were forced into the the trans-Atlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. The Sunday ceremony included remarks from Michael Creasey, superintendent of the National Parks of Boston, and officials from the downtown Museum of African American History. Names of enslaved members of Boston’s oldest churches were read aloud, and there was a traditional balafon performance by Balla Kouyate as well as a land acknowledgement statement delivered by Elizabeth Solomon, a member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag. Millions of Africans were sold in the Caribbean and in American cities such as Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, from 1619 to 1865, according to event organizers. Native Americans from local tribes, including the Massachusett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc, were also enslaved after being taken as prisoners of war, the organizations said.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A monument dedicated to Tuskegee Airmen who died in Michigan during World War II training was unveiled Saturday near the international Blue Water Bridge. Michigan served as an advanced training ground for many graduates of the Tuskegee University pilot training program in Alabama. Surviving Tuskegee airmen and their descendants attended the event in Port Huron, part of a three-day celebration that recognized the accomplishments of America’s first Black military pilots. Fifteen Tuskegee airmen were killed while training in Michigan, including five pilots lost in Lake Huron and one in the St. Clair River, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Wreckages from two planes have been found in the river and the lake. In 2014, the remains of a P-39 aircraft were found in Lake Huron, 70 years after it crashed. The body of 2nd Lt. Frank Moody washed ashore a few months after the April 1944 crash. A dive team spent a week in Lake Huron in 2015 surveying the wreckage. The plane’s wing, landing gear, engine block, tail, propeller, cockpit door, instrument panel, .50-caliber machine guns and ammunition are being restored and will become an exhibit sponsored by the National Tuskegee Airmen Museum in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A write-in campaign for a prehistoric giant beaver that weighed more than 200 pounds has secured it a spot on a list of possible candidates for state fossil. The write-in campaign has been so successful that the beaver, or Castoroides ohioensis, is now in the lead among possible state-fossil candidates proposed by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The fossil, found in St. Paul, dates back to the Pleistocene epoch and is estimated to be anywhere from 2.58 million years to 10,150 years old, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. Minnesota is one of just seven states without a state fossil, said Alex Hastings, the Phillip W. Fitzpatrick Chair of Paleontology at the Science Museum of Minnesota, who is leading an effort to designate one. Hastings put together a list of eight candidates – representing different creatures, different parts of the state and different geologic times – for consideration. As of last Tuesday, more than 2,100 people had voted, he said. The entry for Castoroides ohioensis notes that it had “buck teeth and aquatic lifestyle” and “was the size of a small bear,” according to officials with the St. Paul museum. It almost became Minnesota’s state fossil back in 1988, but the measure failed in the Legislature. Voting ends Oct. 1, after which legislators will get involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nYazoo City: A white father and son have each been sentenced to four years in prison for convictions related to chasing and shooting at two Black teenagers who were riding all-terrain vehicles on a country road. Some of the charges were prosecuted as hate crimes, which strengthened the punishment. Wade Oscar Twiner, 49, of Yazoo City, and his son, Lane Irvine Twiner, 23, of Jackson, were sentenced Friday in Yazoo County. Jurors on Wednesday convicted each man of two counts of simple assault and one count of malicious mischief. The district attorney’s office said the penalty for each simple assault conviction was increased because the men’s actions were deemed hate crimes under Mississippi law, which allows stronger penalties for crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin or gender. The men were arrested after the Sept. 27 chase in rural Yazoo County. The two teenagers were not injured, but they told investigators they were frightened for their lives. The teenagers were riding ATVs on a country road close to Wade Twiner’s home, said Chief Deputy Joseph Head of the Yazoo County Sheriff’s Office. The father and son got in a pickup and chased the teens, firing several shots and bumping into one of the ATVs with the truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officials face a tall order to get all the state’s nursing home workers vaccinated because fewer than half of them have received the shots. By that metric, Missouri’s 48% ranks third-lowest in the nation, trailed only by Florida and Louisiana, both at 47%. Yet some 82% of Missouri’s nursing home residents have been vaccinated, which is just behind the national average of 83%. That worries residents like Michael Williams, who has diabetes and is on kidney dialysis at the Crestwood Health Care Center in St. Louis. “It’s fine if they (staff) don’t want to take it, but then don’t work around us. We all have underlying conditions here,” Williams told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They are out in the casino, and they are rolling the dice, but the sad thing about it is it’s other people’s lives they are playing with.” Some workers have already quit rather than face a mandate. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said it would require nursing home staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments – revenue on which nearly all skilled nursing facilities depend. But details of that plan still haven’t been released. Data analyzed by the Post-Dispatch shows 20 facilities statewide had staff vaccination rates of 20% or less as of Aug. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University has announced a $101 million donation to its College of Nursing, believed to be the largest donation ever given to a college of nursing in the United States, school officials said. The donation, announced Monday, comes from Mark and Robyn Jones, founders of Goosehead Insurance, based in Westlake, Texas. “It is hard to put into words how moved and excited all of us are at Montana State University by the generosity of the Joneses, who are helping to address some of the most critical health care disparity issues in Montana, particularly in the state’s rural areas,” MSU President Waded Cruzado said in a statement. The money will be used to fund new facilities and state-of-the-art simulation labs at MSU College of Nursing campuses in Bozeman, Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell and Missoula. The donation will also create five faculty professorships, helping MSU attract top faculty talent as the nation faces a nursing faculty shortage. MSU’s College of Nursing will also create an endowed scholarship fund and a nurse midwifery program for doctoral-level nurses to provide maternal health in rural and remote communities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The bones of the city’s next outdoor performance space have risen in the Gene Leahy Mall downtown. Metal arches that will one day form a performance pavilion have gone up in the mall in recent weeks, part of a $400 million public-private renovation of the mall, Heartland of America Park and Lewis & Clark Landing. When the pavilion is finished – likely sometime next spring – three white arches cascading in size will cover a stage. The Omaha World-Herald reports the space will be used for all manner of performances, from concerts, symphony performances and music festivals to movie nights and dance competitions. “It’s exciting seeing it start to come out of the ground,” said Katie Bassett, vice president of parks for the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, which is managing the park renovations for the city. Stretching out from the pavilion to the west will be a 42,000-square-foot green lawn that will be able to host thousands of people for shows and offer a recreation space the rest of the time. Officials say the venue will be reminiscent of the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which has a similar arch-shaped covering over the stage. At night, the pavilion will be lit from underneath to create a glow effect, which Bassett said will offer “an iconic” addition to Omaha’s downtown.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The nation’s fifth-largest school system has begun using ultraviolet light as a classroom germ-killer in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19. “This doesn’t have any chemicals. It’s just light,” said Grant Morgan, chief executive and co-founder of Utah biosafety startup R-Zero, during a demonstration of the disinfection system at an elementary school in suburban Henderson. The blue-light-emitting tower can disinfect a 1,000-square-foot indoor space in seven minutes, destroying more than 99.99% of surface and airborne pathogens, Morgan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It is designed to be used while a space is unoccupied but has no lingering effects when people enter a room after treatment, he said. The Clark County School District bought one Arc unit for each of its 372 campuses using $7.4 million in federal coronavirus relief money to cover the $20,000 per-unit cost, the Review-Journal said. The district has more than 310,000 students. Classes began Aug. 9.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is asking employees who have not yet returned to campus to keep working remotely until Oct. 4. The previous plan was for workers to return at the start of September, but the college is adjusting its plans as COVID-19 cases increase regionally and nationally, said Scott Bemis, chief human resources officer. Many of those who have already returned “can continue to work on-site,” Bemis said in an email to the community Friday. He said the date is being pushed back a month “to help slow the increase in the density of people on campus, with the goal of interrupting COVID-19 transmission wherever possible.” Bemis also said that weekly coronavirus surveillance testing will be conducted for vaccinated employees, instead of every 30 days. Unvaccinated employees who are coming to campus are still required to test twice a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: About half a million residents stand to lose a $300 federal unemployment benefit when it expires Saturday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday during a COVID-19 news conference that it would cost the state more than $1 billion a month to pick up the unemployment insurance tab from the federal government. “The proper way to extend federal UI benefits is through federal action, not a patchwork of state ones,” he said. “The reality is that continuing the $300-per-week benefit through state resources would be cost-prohibitive.” The expiration will affect about 500,000 people, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. Federal jobless aid was first approved in 2020 when COVID-19 outbreak hit, sending jobless to record highs amid pandemic-related shutdowns. The state has administered $33.7 billion directly to 1.6 million residents since the start of the pandemic, the governor said. The lion’s share – $25 billion – has come from the federal government. To those unemployed residents affected by the expiration of the federal benefit, Murphy pointed to the state’s minimum wage, which will rise to $13 an hour in the new year from $12. He also pointed to the state’s paid sick and family leave programs, along with other social safety net aids.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, on Saturday night in her home state. Haaland wore a dress designed and sewn by her sister, said Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. The ceremony incorporated elements honoring her Native American ancestry. The former New Mexico congresswoman is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. According to Schwartz, guests had to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend and wear masks per U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New Mexico guidelines. But pictures on social media that show some people, including Haaland, not wearing masks indoors the whole time have drawn criticism. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A “sequence of failures” in the city’s subway system following a brief power outage disrupted half of the system for several hours and stranded hundreds of passengers, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hochul said in a statement that a Metropolitan Transportation Authority review of Sunday night’s subway breakdown “uncovered a sequence of failures that resulted in some backup systems not providing power as designed last night, including an additional failure to quickly diagnose the underlying cause.” The unprecedented breakdown affected more than 80 trains on the subway system’s numbered lines plus the L train from shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday to about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Hochul said at an earlier news conference. The restoration of service was delayed because passengers on two of the stuck trains walked out onto the tracks by themselves rather than waiting for rescuers from agencies including the police and fire departments to help them, Hochul said. “We never, ever want riders to do that,” she said. “It is dangerous, and it caused a delay in the restoration of power.” Speaking outside a lower Manhattan subway system, Hochul promised a thorough investigation. “Let me be very clear,” she said. “Last night was unacceptable.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: State environmental regulators say a plant that for years discharged so-called forever chemicals into the air and water is not currently in compliance with its air permit. In its letter to Chemours, the Department of Environmental Quality warned that it is preparing an enforcement action against the company’s Fayetteville Works plant in Bladen County, which has been exceeding its GenX air pollution limits for much of 2021. Officials said the company could be facing up to a $25,000 fine per day. In a statement, Chemours said the site experienced a temporary increase in air emissions this year from one of its carbon adsorption units. “The issue was quickly resolved when the carbon was replaced in this unit, and emissions returned to their usual low levels,” the statement said. “However, the data results from that one emissions sampling caused an exceedance of the site’s calculated 12-month rolling air emission allowance.” Chemours, a spinoff of DuPont Co., plans to take corrective action to fix the issue in the long term, according to its statement. GenX, a type of PFAS, has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new quarterly report from North Dakota State University says the state’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has slowed a bit. The outlook predicts declines in the gross state product, which is the measurement of the state’s output, labor force participation, and total wages and salaries. “The overall economic outlook for the state had been improving amidst the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the most recent data shows a state economy that is at risk of declining economic growth and a shrinking labor force,” said NDSU economics professor Jeremy Jackson, director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise. Total wages and salaries are expected to hold steady with a slight decline in the third quarter of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The labor force is predicted to decline in the third quarter, with that trend continuing into next year. The unemployment rate is projected to have a slight increase in the third quarter and then return to its declining trend. North Dakota’s gross state product grew 1.8% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, but gross state product is forecast to decline heading into 2022. Despite the forecast decline, the model predicts relative stability in total tax collections.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Supporters of a proposal to legalize marijuana got the green light Monday to collect signatures to place the measure before state lawmakers. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol’s proposed statute was approved as a single issue by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The group will soon begin collecting the 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters needed to submit the proposed law to the Legislature. If the Legislature doesn’t pass or passes an amended version of the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to put the proposal before voters, likely in November 2022. The proposal would allow adults age 21 and older to buy, grow, possess and consume marijuana. Proceeds of a 10% tax on marijuana would go to education, addiction treatment and municipalities with marijuana businesses. Municipalities could limit or ban marijuana businesses within their borders. Ohio’s medical marijuana businesses, several of which are backing the plan, could automatically get licenses for the recreational side. The bill establishes 40 new cultivation licenses and 50 additional dispensary licenses for economically and socially disadvantaged “social equity” applicants. Additional licenses could be granted two years later.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Hospitals are again overwhelmed as the spread of COVID-19 is surging through the state, but this time, they’re facing the wave with even further strain on health care workers. The state has dealt with a nursing shortage for at least two decades, Oklahoma nursing leaders said. But the pandemic has worsened it, with the stresses driving some burned-out nurses out of the industry or to other states, amid greater demands on the health care system. “The pandemic has brought on some extra stresses that we had no way of predicting, and that has impacted our retention rates enormously,” said Shelly Wells, president of the Oklahoma Nurses Association. “For example, I don’t think that humans were meant to see as much death as our nurses have seen, personally, in the last 16 months.” A nurse working in a hospital in normal times might expect to care for a dying patient once a week, Wells said. “These patients are dying much more frequently,” she said. “There’s no family support, so the nurses are having to double as family and offer that support” on top of caring for the patients themselves. And it can be especially troubling to care for someone your age or younger “that you know is probably not going to live,” said Elain Richardson, regional chief nursing officer with SSM Health St. Anthony.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Record-low numbers of steelhead are returning to the Columbia River this year, prompting conservationists and anglers alike to call for a halt to recreational fishing for the sea-run fish. As of last week, just 29,000 steelhead passed the Bonneville Dam since July 1 – the fewest ever recorded, less than half the average of the past five years, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups sent a letter to the Oregon, Washington and Idaho agencies that manage fish and wildlife requesting an immediate closure of recreational steelhead fisheries on the Columbia River, the Lower Snake River and their tributaries. “This is a really, really dire year for steelhead – especially wild steelhead – in the Columbia River Basin,” said Rob Kirschner, legal and policy director for The Conservation Angler, which advocates for protection and restoration of wild fish in the Pacific Northwest and Kamchatka, Russia. “We are trying to protect every eligible spawner,” he said. “Every one of these fish counts.” Steelhead on the Columbia and Snake rivers are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Their population has been devastated by habitat destruction, including construction of hydroelectric dams, as well as overfishing and climate change. High water temperatures have also been detrimental.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hundreds of thousands of residents will lose federal pandemic unemployment benefits after this week, including an extra $300 per week, an extra 13 weeks of benefits and coverage for the self-employed. Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that there are sources of help for people who need it once their jobless aid runs out, including federal rental assistance through counties, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary cash-assistance for low-income families. In the first week of August, roughly 640,000 people were receiving the extra $300, according to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry. About 388,000 of them were in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for freelancers or the self-employed, and almost 175,000 were receiving an extra 13 weeks of assistance through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. About 78,000 people were receiving benefits through the state’s regular 26-week unemployment compensation program, which will continue running, but without the extra $300 federal benefit on top. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by President Joe Biden in March, extended those federal benefits and set them to expire after this week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee’s chief of staff, who is under scrutiny for whether he used his political clout to push through a development approval on some wetlands owned by his family, has stepped down, the governor’s office announced Monday. Anthony Silva maintains he did nothing wrong in the approval process, but the issue had become a distraction, the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Tony and I reached a mutual agreement that it is in the best interest of the administration for him to retire from state government effective immediately,” the statement said. “Right now, his situation is a distraction from the critical work we have ahead. I appreciate that Tony understands the need to remove the distraction to ensure we can continue serving Rhode Islanders effectively.” Silva once had an agreement to purchase the property in Cumberland – where McKee was once mayor and Silva was police chief. After the state Department of Environmental Management issued the necessary approvals, the property was purchased by Silva’s son, Ross. Town officials as well as neighbors oppose building on the land, saying developing it would exacerbate flooding problems in the area, and were concerned that Silva and his family got preferential treatment from the state environmental agency.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state has the Department of Motor Vehicles changing how it gives road tests for driver’s licenses. The agency started requiring masks for both new drivers and examiners Wednesday. As of Monday, it is again requiring appointments for driving tests, and on Sept. 7 the department will go back to how it handled testing at the start of the pandemic, with the examiner outside the car, the DMV said in a statement. The modified skills test evaluates the same abilities as the regular test, with the examiner scoring the test from outside, the DMV said. The agency is encouraging but not requiring masks inside its branches. Officials also said many basic services, like driver’s license renewal, can be done online.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s political boundaries set a framework Monday that will allow them to speed through the once-in-a-decade process on a tight schedule this year. The two committees responsible for drawing the new legislative districts began their work in earnest Monday after the U.S. Census Bureau released detailed data earlier this month. Lawmakers only have about 10 weeks to propose districts before a special session of the Legislature convenes Nov. 8. The Census Bureau’s data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re in for a very compact and a very intense schedule over the next two months to get all this accomplished,” Republican Sen. Jim Bolin told the committees, which met jointly Monday. Republican lawmakers cited the shortened process in setting two parameters that will guide their work: keeping new legislative districts between a lower threshold of 24,066 residents and an upper threshold of 26,600 people, and restricting access to the Legislature’s map-drawing software to committee members only. Legislative research staff said they were worried their work would get bogged down if the general public were allowed to propose maps through its software and said people could create their own proposals with other open-source applications.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Cummins Falls State Park has been named state park of the year. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures, the department said in a news release Thursday. The 306-acre park in middle Tennessee used social media to inform people of river conditions, scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs, held day camps for children and school programs, and hosted a weekly home-school group, officials said. Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants, planted native species, built two greenhouses, and grown and processed sorghum, officials said. Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee. It is one of several state parks honored with a 2021 Award of Excellence at a recent park management conference at Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Black arts community is pushing to create a cultural center at the music venue Kenny Dorham’s Backyard, amid broader work for equity in the city’s cultural arts programs and historic preservation in East Austin. “Everybody says the words equity, sustainability. But it turns out, if there’s no intention, no action behind it, it means nothing,” City Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison told a diverse crowd of arts supporters in July as they gathered to celebrate the return of Black contemporary dance company Ballet Afrique to East Austin. “We have so much work to do to make this a truly equitable and truly inclusive city that lives up to our progressive reputation.” In 2019, the city contracted with an outside consultant, MJR Partners, to conduct a review of city-allocated cultural arts and heritage funding. An interim report released in June outlines strategies to achieve greater equity, as well as some of the challenges the city will face. The report notes that “traditional and white-led institutions struggle to accept that historic inequities exist in the city.” “I think the city is really trying,” said Carl Settles, director of the nonprofit E4 Youth, which aims to build bridges between underprivileged area youths and Austin’s creative and tech industries.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Two recently married Utah women were found dead from gunshot wounds after reports of a “weirdo camping near them” and a four-day search in Moab, about an hour away from Arches National Park. On Wednesday, 38-year-old Crystal Turner and 24-year-old Kylen Schulte were found by a family friend in the South Mesa area of La Sal Loop Road, where they had been camping. Schulte and Turner went missing Aug. 14, four days before they were found dead from gunshot wounds, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Schulte’s father had posted on Facebook that they hadn’t been to work, hadn’t called, were not in the hospital and were not in jail. “Kylen and Crystal told close friends that there was a weirdo camping near them that was freaking them out !!! And that they should move campsites. Now they have been missing for over 4 days and nights!” Sean-Paul Schulte posted. The couple’s bodies were transported to the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds, the Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The city is planning to erect a monument to the state’s first known black sheriff and chief of police. The city of Vergennes is planning to unveil and dedicate the monument to former Sheriff Stephen Bates on Oct. 3. Bates was first elected sheriff and chief of police in Vergennes in 1879. Bates had been formerly enslaved in Virginia. He gained his freedom and served Union soldiers during the Civil War. He first came to Vergennes in 1866 with Vermont U.S. Rep. Frederick E. Woodbridge. Bates served as sheriff of Vergennes for 25 years. He raised a family in the city before his death in 1907, and some of his descendants will be attending the event. A local team of historians and others spent the past year researching Bates’ life and rediscovering his story in Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Virginia Republicans that seeks to remove him from the ballot in this year’s closely watched race for governor over an alleged paperwork error. In a filing Friday evening, attorneys for the former governor now running for a second term against GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin said the suit was based on a “legal lie” and would effectively invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes cast in the Democratic primary. The complaint filed last week by the Republican Party of Virginia against state election officials argued that McAuliffe should be disqualified from running in the November general election because of the omission of his signature on an official form declaring his candidacy. McAuliffe argued in his filing that nothing in Virginia code requires a candidate to sign the declaration of candidacy. Further, the filing said: “Even if there were a technical defect with the declaration of candidacy – and there is not – it would provide no basis for removing McAuliffe’s name from the general election ballot and preventing Virginia’s voters from choosing him as their next Governor. The declaration of candidacy is a prerequisite for placement on the ballot in the primary election, not the general election, and the primary election has already concluded.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Hundreds of people gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccine mandate. Announced in early August, Inslee’s order requires most state workers, health care workers and school employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or face losing their jobs. Inslee has said getting people vaccinated is essential for getting Washington past the pandemic. Organizers of the rally Saturday warned that a large segment of state workers, including many firefighters, sanitation workers and bus drivers, won’t get the vaccine – as much as 30% to 40% statewide, they said. It wasn’t clear what that estimate was based on. “If the Governor refuses to rescind his mandate, it will mean that multiple areas of the state will be severely reduced or shut down completely,” Tyler Miller, of the group Liberty, At All Hazards, said in a news release. “The Governor is unnecessarily threatening the genuine safety and well-being of the citizens of Washington if he forces his mandate to stand.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk defended the need for the mandate. “Employees are losing their lives to COVID. Hospitals are filling up. Communities are stressed by the pandemic’s impacts. The safest and most effective way to get beyond these tragic circumstances is vaccination,” Faulk said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who landscape for wildlife use can have their land designated a “wild yard.” The program already has 300 members around the state and is operated through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to create more natural habitat for wildlife around the state. “It’s such a wonderful program to get involved in,” Rebecca Linger, who owns a certified wild yard, said in a news release from the agency. “And you get the added benefit of creating an environment around your house where you can enjoy seeing wildlife coming and going. It really is delightful.” Jim Fregonara, a wildlife biologist with the division, said landowners who apply, provide a habitat plan and demonstrate that their property meets the needs of native wildlife will be added to a register of wild yards. They also receive a certificate for participating in the program and a sign post to display in the yard. “We want to encourage private citizens, whether they have a little bit of property or own a lot of land, to help wildlife thrive by providing them with food, water, shelter and space,” Fregonara said.

Tony Evers said Monday. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have criticized the vetting process and warned about terrorists being allowed into the country. After a tour of the Wisconsin base last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned whether the refugees at Fort McCoy had been fully vetted and called White House assurances about the process “lipstick on a pig.” Evers also toured the base last week and met with refugees. He said Republicans criticizing the vetting of those refugees are “vastly uninformed.” “Or they like to raise that specter of maybe some of those little kids I saw at Fort McCoy are terrorists, or maybe those adults that I saw at Fort McCoy who were working hand in hand with our soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan, somehow they are terrorists even though they’ve been vetted four or five or six times even before they left Afghanistan,” Evers said. “To me, it’s dog whistle crap, and we don’t need any of that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Donations are pouring in for the widow and unborn child of a U.S. Marine killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. Rylee McCollum, 20, was among 13 service members killed by a suicide bomb attack Thursday at the Kabul airport. The troops were providing security as the airport was overwhelmed with people trying to leave the country amid the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover. McCollum was from Bondurant and expecting his first child in three weeks, according to his family. Almost $687,000 had been raised through two online fundraising campaigns, one for the child’s future education costs and one for McCollum’s widow, as of Tuesday morning. McCollum was on his first deployment and manning a checkpoint at the airport when the attack happened, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. McCollum attended Jackson Hole High School and competed as a wrestler. He graduated in 2019 from Summit Innovations School in Jackson.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/05/doughnut-hustle-hot-now-chalkbus-blackbeards-remittance-news-around-states/40548501/", "title": "Doughnut hustle not so hot now, 'chalkbus': News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMonroeville: The south Alabama courthouse linked to Harper Lee’s novel “To Kill a Mockingbird” is receiving a preservation grant. The program Partners in Preservation says the old Monroe County Courthouse is receiving $125,000 to repair serious structural problems in a wall. Recipients were announced following an online vote. The 115-year-old former courthouse is now a museum that tells the story of Lee and fellow writer Truman Capote, who were both from Monroeville. Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book used the red-brick structure as the model for a pivotal trial scene in her story of racial injustice. The two-story courtroom was then recreated as a Hollywood set for the 1962 movie based on Lee’s novel. Partners in Preservation is a project of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and American Express.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Leaders of the state Senate majority and minority say Attorney General Kevin Clarkson is violating the state constitution by not defending a law that encourages construction firms to use Alaska workers on state contracts. The Anchorage Daily News reports Senate President Cathy Giessel and Minority Leader Tom Begich, in separate letters, say Clarkson should be defending the law until it’s ruled on by a judge. Clarkson says he took an oath to defend the U.S. and Alaska constitutions. He says local-hire law violates those constitutions, and it makes sense to stop enforcing it. At the time of its passage, Alaska’s local-hire law was believed to be in accordance with the law, and it has remained in force for 30 years. A construction company challenged the law this year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: In this city widely credited as the birthplace of the 1980s Sanctuary Movement – an effort by churches to help refugees from Central America and shield them from deportation – a group of activists is looking to revive that history of aggressively resisting immigration authorities. Voters will decide Tuesday whether to designate Tucson as Arizona’s only sanctuary city, a direct challenge to President Donald Trump and to the anti-illegal immigration law that put a spotlight on the state nearly a decade ago. Many in Tucson are eager to send Trump a message that disapproves of his immigration policies. But even some on the left worry the measure would merely draw the ire of the president and his allies in the Arizona Legislature without improving conditions for migrants.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: North Little Rock has its eyes on the future as the city builds upon its downtown district, but school district officials want to make sure it doesn’t forget the past when it comes to the Ole Main High School building, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The North Little Rock School District recently announced plans to form a task force to provide direction to the Board of Education on how to preserve the historic building that is adjacent to the current high school, which opened in 2015. Board members will suggest one person each for the committee along with three at-large positions and one designated position for the North Little Rock History Commission. The task force will meet and report to the School Board. Board President Tracy Steele said he has already fielded numerous calls from people who want to be on the board.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The start of the commercial Dungeness crab season will likely be delayed by a week to lower the risk of whales getting entangled in fishing lines. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife said opening day of the season may be postponed from Nov. 15 to Nov. 23. The department said the earlier date presents “a significant risk” of whale entanglement. CDFW Director Charlton Bonham said fishing, environmental and management agencies were consulted before making the preliminary decision. The recreational crab season began Saturday. State health officials warned people not to consume the internal organs or guts of crab caught in two coastal areas due to the presence of domoic acid, a naturally occurring toxin that can cause vomiting or diarrhea when consumed.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state legislative committee formed in the wake of a fatal shooting at a suburban school has proposed five bills that legislators hope will make schools safer. The Denver Post reports the interim committee didn’t introduce any bills on controversial topics, such as gun control or arming teachers, during its work following the May 7 attack on STEM School Highlands Ranch. Police, teachers and others told committee members that Colorado has good programs to prevent violence, but they aren’t used consistently statewide. Lawmakers also expressed concern about gaps and duplication in the state’s school safety programs. The committee’s draft bills approved last week for consideration by the 2020 Legislature include bills that would reorganize the Safe2Tell anonymous tip system and create a working group to continue studying school safety.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The leader of a coalition of cities and towns across the state says municipal officials are facing an “environmental crisis” of diseased trees, warning the first significant snowfall this year could bring down hundreds across the state, as well as thousands of tree limbs. Connecticut Conference of Municipalities Executive Director Joe DeLong sent a letter Thursday to Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, seeking additional resources and help dealing with the fallout of trees infested and subsequently weakened by emerald ash borer beetles and gypsy moth caterpillars. Over the weekend, utility crews were restoring power to communities affected by a strong Halloween night storm that left behind numerous downed wires. In Marlborough, local officials say many of the limbs fell on power lines because the trees were too brittle to withstand the high winds.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Beginning early next year, the city’s police officers will be wearing one more piece of equipment: body cameras. At a Newark City Council meeting last week, council members approved a nearly $630,000 request for video equipment, including 60 body cameras. The devices cost about $350,000. The rest of the money will go toward replacing dashboard cameras in Newark patrol vehicles and updating video equipment in interview rooms. The $628,867.77 required for all the equipment, which will be provided by Axon, formerly known as Taser International, will be paid out over five years. Federal and state grants will cover $152,640, while the other $476,227.77 will be paid through Newark’s 2019-2023 Capital Improvements Program.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The mayor and the chair of the D.C. Council have nominated two people to represent the city on the regional transit authority board. The Washington Post reports D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson nominated former federal transportation official Stephanie Gidigbi to serve as one of the district’s two voting members on the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser nominated Lucinda Babers, a deputy mayor for infrastructure. The board spots were vacated when Councilman Jack Evans and Corbett Price resigned their seats after an ethics scandal. Evans resigned this summer after a legal memo saying he knowingly violated board ethics became public. Price later resigned after he lied about the findings of the ethics probe. The full D.C. Council must approve the nominations.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A new report is recommending a new board, inspector general and ethics standards for the scandal-plagued Florida Virtual School. The Orlando Sentinel reports the recommendations released Friday by the Florida Department of Education also say Florida’s public online school needs to implement cybersecurity measures. The school had a data breach last year, and its former general counsel resigned following an investigation by the Sentinel that documented accusations of improper spending and behavior. Gov. Ron DeSantis and state lawmakers ordered a state takeover of the online school, which operates as its own $240 million public school district serving more than 200,000 students. All Florida public high school students are required to take at least one virtual class, and many choose the school as the provider.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A memorial service was held over the weekend to remember the victims of the Atlanta child murders in the 1970s and 1980s. WSB-TV reports dozens of people, including some family members of the victims, gathered for the service Saturday. The string of murders of mostly black boys terrorized the city between 1979 and 1981. The service included the lighting of candles, songs and a procession of hearses. “The pain is still here,” said Catherine Leach, who lost her son Curtis Walker 40 years ago. Wayne Williams was given two life sentences in 1982 for convictions in the deaths of two adults, thought to be among 29 black children and young adults killed. Police blamed him for the other killings but never charged him. There has been a renewed push to reexamine evidence in the case.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An environmental advocacy group has filed a lawsuit against a federal agency for what it says is a failure to protect habitat for 14 endangered species on Hawaii island. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the Center for Biological Diversity says the failure to designate critical habitat for the plants and animals in a timely manner is a violation of the Endangered Species Act. The lawsuit names Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as defendants. The national organization says the Fish and Wildlife Service listed 15 plant and animal species in Hawaii as endangered in October 2013. The lawsuit says the agency was required under the act to designate critical habitat but has only done so for one of the protected species.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: About 35,000 Idaho residents have signed up for Medicaid under expanded coverage in the first few days it has been offered. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said Monday that’s more than a third of the estimated 91,000 people who are eligible. The agency started taking applications Friday. Idaho voters authorized Medicaid expansion last year with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote, but lawmakers earlier this year added restrictions requiring five waivers. Federal officials have yet to approve any of the waivers, but enrollment is proceeding with coverage starting Jan. 1. The expansion provides Medicaid to people earning up to a maximum of 138% of the federal poverty level. That maximum is about $17,000 a year for one person and $35,500 for a family of four.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: Officials at Bradley University are marking the first phase of a $100 million new business and engineering building. The (Peoria) Journal Star reports university officials dedicated the building in a Friday ceremony attended by hundreds. Officials say the building’s design will allow students to better collaborate with an open atrium and wide hallways. Crews are still putting the final touches on the 270,000-square-foot Business and Engineering Convergence Center as faculty and staff move in. Classes will start within a few weeks. The building will have 200 offices, dozens of classrooms and more than 40 specialized labs. Work is yet to begin on the second phase, which will include the building’s final wing and require demolition of the old engineer building.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A state legislative panel is recommending that Indiana’s legal age for buying cigarettes be raised from 18 to 21. The Legislature’s public health study committee approved the recommendation last week after hearing testimony recently on the change that has failed to advance among lawmakers for several years. The Journal Gazette reports the proposed age change would cover both traditional and electronic cigarettes. Committee chairman Sen. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso says he doesn’t expect action until at least the 2021 legislative session, when a new state budget is considered, because Indiana cigarette tax revenue could decline with the change. Sen. Vaneta Becker of Evansville countered that the state might see a loss in tax revenue initially but will save on long-term health expenses.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa has developed a temporary card to allow students who lack other forms of identification to vote in Tuesday’s election. The card was created at the nudging of student government organizers committed to making voting more accessible to students in the wake of changes to the Iowa Code in 2017 requiring IDs at the polls. Student government collaborators are hopeful this week’s combined city-school election will serve as a test run for the temporary IDs, leading up to the 2020 presidential election. According to the Iowa secretary of state’s office, unregistered residents can vote on the day of an election by showing proof of residency and a school-issued photo ID – but that ID must include an expiration date. The UI’s standard student ID card does not include one, but the temporary cards do: Nov. 6, just one day after the election.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Abortion opponents pushing for a constitutional amendment to ban the procedure in the state are meeting resistance from other anti-abortion groups. Two legislative committees have recommended that lawmakers consider the issue during the 2020 legislative session. The recommendations come as lawmakers try to determine how to respond to a Kansas Supreme Court ruling that the state’s constitution guarantees a right to abortion. Kansas News Service reports that at a hearing last week, some advocates pushed for a “personhood amendment” that would ban all abortions in Kansas. But some of the state’s largest anti-abortion groups say the personhood amendment is not practical. Anti-abortion legislators have generally deferred to Kansans for Life on abortion policy issues for more than two decades. That group argues that an incremental approach builds public support for greater restrictions.\n\nKentucky\n\nGrand Rivers: Officials say they’ve installed a riverbed bubbler and sound system in a lake as an experimental and environmentally friendly way to keep an invasive fish from spreading. The Paducah Sun reports federal, state and local officials are holding an event Friday to showcase the deployment of the bio-acoustic fish fence at Barkley Dam in western Kentucky. It will be evaluated over the course of the next three years, although officials hope to see some preliminary results next year. Several agencies in Kentucky and Tennessee are combining funding, technology or staff to help stop the spread of Asian carp. Lyon County Judge-Executive Wade White says if the bio-acoustic systems proves effective, it will likely be used in other places to deter the spread of the fish.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: A volunteer search-and-rescue group says it has changed its name to avoid confusion with a similarly named organization whose leader is accused of taking money from a fundraiser meant for children. The director of Pinnacle Search and Rescue, formerly known as Cajun Navy 2016, told KADN-TV it sped up its name change when the president of a separate group called America’s Cajun Navy was charged with fraud two weeks ago. News outlets report the change also comes as its own president, Jon Bridgers, faces fraud charges after a homeowner said he agreed to do contracting work on a house but never finished. Pinnacle Search and Rescue director Ben Husser said some were confusing the two organizations. Both groups include private boat owners who assist rescue operations.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Gun control advocates say they plan to keep pushing for tighter gun controls in Maine, despite the failure of a flurry of proposals to move forward during the coming legislative session. Democrats proposed several changes to the state’s gun laws for the session that begins in January, but the Legislative Council rejected most of them and tabled one. Proposals need the council’s approval to move on to legislative committees and the full Statehouse. Members of the Maine chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America say the proposals would’ve protected children from potential school shootings and gun accidents in the home. Republican Sen. Jeffrey Timberlake, who sits on the council, said the proposals didn’t rise to the level of emergency legislation, which is the purpose of the session.\n\nMaryland\n\nGermantown: A decision by a county executive to ban a police station from displaying a “thin blue line” flag is drawing criticism from Gov. Larry Hogan. The wooden flag was a gift from a local resident in recognition of National First Responders Day. It was to be displayed in the 5th District Station. News outlets report that Democratic Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said the flag provides a symbol of “support” to some but is a symbol of “dismissiveness” to others. The “thin blue line” flag has been labeled by some as a response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Hogan, a Republican, said in a series of tweets Sunday that he was “offended and disgusted” that Elrich had prohibited officers from displaying the flag.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: A marine biologist is reporting a sharp rise in number of sunfish stranded on Cape Cod beaches. The unusual-looking migratory fish, which can grow to nearly 9 feet long and weigh thousands of pounds, can be found in mid- to late summer off the state’s coast. Marine biologist Carol “Krill” Carson tells the Cape Cod Times that a couple dozen or more are usually found stranded on beaches annually. So far, about 130 have been stranded this year. Carson says this year is “out of control,” noting the stranding season starts in mid-August and runs through ecember. She has a network of about 30 volunteers who assist her in returning the fish to the sea or taking tissue samples if it’s dead. The sunfish is capable of long migrations to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the winter.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state is lowering or eliminating fees assessed on people who register to use marijuana for medical reasons. The Marijuana Regulatory Agency announced last week that new rules are in effect. The application fee for a two-year registry card is now $40, down from $60. A $10 fee to update, replace, add or remove a caregiver has been eliminated. Caregivers, who supply patients with marijuana, will no longer have to pay a $25 background check processing fee. Marijuana Regulatory Agency Executive Director Andrew Brisbo says the state has worked hard to streamline the process for cardholders, not only lowering costs but also making it easier for patients to apply for and receive their cards.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An enterprising college student who drove to Iowa every weekend to buy hundreds of Krispy Kreme doughnuts that he then sold to his own customers in the Twin Cities area has been warned by the confectionary giant to stop. There have been no Krispy Kreme stores in Minnesota for 11 years. Jayson Gonzalez, 21, of Champlin, Minnesota, would drive 270 miles to a Krispy Kreme store in Clive, Iowa, pack his car with up to 100 boxes of a dozen doughnuts, then drive back north. He charged $17 to $20 per box and said some of his customers spent nearly $100 each time. Gonzalez said he did not receive a discount from the store in Iowa. But less than a week after the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported on his money-making scheme, Gonzalez received a phone call from Krispy Kreme’s Nebraska office telling him to stop. In a statement Sunday night, Krispy Kreme said it’s looking into the matter.\n\nMississippi\n\nGlendora: Men carrying a white nationalist flag were caught on security cameras trying to film in front of a new memorial to lynching victim Emmett Till. Patrick Weems, executive director of the Emmett Till Memorial Commission, says cameras captured the incident Saturday. Security footage from the commission shows the men, one carrying a neo-Confederate group flag, filming at the site. They are seeing running away when a security alarm sounds. Weems says he believes they were filming a propaganda video. Till was 14 when he was beaten and killed in 1955 after he whistled at a white woman. The memorial is at the site where Till’s body was pulled from a river. A bulletproof memorial to Till was dedicated Oct. 19 after the first three markers were vandalized.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A program that helps young men reach their full potential is earning accolades from southeast Missouri leaders and members of the Legislature’s Black Caucus. The Southeast Missourian reports the Honorable Young Men Club provides mentoring for students in the Cape Girardeau School District, but its organizers hope to expand elsewhere. The program was begun in 2016 by four former Southeast Missouri State University football players, including one now with the Baltimore Ravens, Aaron Adeoye. The other three recently hosted a gathering to show the benefits of the program. The event was organized by former Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder. Co-founders say students who participate in the program have better grades, higher attendance and fewer suspensions than their peers.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that Montana outpaces neighboring Wyoming when it comes to recreation economies. The Billings Gazette reports that based on data from 2017, the analysis puts Montana’s total outdoor recreation value at $2.3 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in Wyoming. This is the first national report to drill into state-by-state recreation economies. Rachel VandeVoort, director of the Montana office of Outdoors Recreation, said the state-by-state analysis is helpful in making decisions, such as investing in habitat, protecting public or private lands, or contributing funding to new opportunities. University of Wyoming economics professor Rob Godby attributes the disparity between the two states to Montana’s larger population and more urban areas, which means more businesses catering to hunters, anglers, skiers and bikers.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Salvation Army’s annual Tree of Lights campaign is set to get underway in the area this week with the annual lighting of metal Christmas trees in front of American National Bank branches in central Omaha and in Council Bluffs, Iowa. In Omaha, hundreds are expected to gather Friday for the lighting of a 75-foot tall, 2-ton metal tree with more than 60,000 LED lights and 600 lit snowflakes, topped by a 6-foot star. The event features live music, food, reindeer and other Christmas-themed offerings. Across the Missouri River, the Salvation Army will also light a Christmas tree atop the American National Bank branch in Council Bluffs and serve refreshments. The lighting ceremonies kick off the Salvation Army’s red kettle bell-ringing drive.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A new commander has been chosen to lead Nevada’s 152nd Airlift Wing, also known as the “High Rollers.” Col. Jacob Hammons, an F-16 pilot from Las Vegas, replaced Reno native Col. Eric Wade during a change-of-command ceremony Saturday at the Nevada Air National Guard base. “(I’m) excited, ready to get going,” Hammons said. The 152nd Airlift Wing includes 1,016 airmen, most of whom serve one weekend a month and two weeks each year as traditional guardsmen in a reserve force that supports the federal government overseas, according to the Nevada Air National Guard. The unit provides tactical airlift worldwide and expeditionary combat support. It also operates the U.S. Forest Service’s Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System, which transforms cargo aircraft into firefighting air tankers.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fifth graders across the state are heading to the polls this week to elect the next “Kid Governor.” This is the second year the state has participated in a national civics program aimed at encouraging civic engagement by teaching students about the history of voting rights, the qualities of good leaders and the mechanics of campaigns. More than 450 students in six New Hampshire schools participated last year, selecting Lola Giannelli, of Nashua, as their first Kid Governor. She has spent the past year promoting efforts to protect animals from abuse. The seven candidates hoping to succeed her have platforms that include topics such as bullying, underage tobacco use, and college and career awareness. Voting started Monday and ends Nov. 12.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nearly a third of the state’s lawmakers also work in other government jobs with payments that not only increase their pensions but also raise ethical questions about whom they serve when they cast votes in the Legislature, an investigation finds. The 37 lawmakers holding more than one government job or contract racked up nearly $2.7 million in additional taxpayer income beyond their $49,000-a-year Statehouse salaries, the investigation found. Due to quirks in state law, longtime lawmakers can still pad their pensions even though a series of reforms in the past decade limited the plump payout for newer legislators. Good-government groups say so-called double-dipping creates an increased risk of conflict, potential favoritism and a drain on public dollars.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: Members of this arid state’s congressional delegation are looking for ways to combat water scarcity here and across the West. U.S. Sen. Tom Udall is blaming climate change for growing water scarcity, worrying that New Mexico snowpacks are getting smaller and unable to adequately feed the Rio Grande and the rest of the state’s groundwater supplies. He and other lawmakers last week introduced the Western Water Security Act of 2019. They say the goal is to strengthen New Mexico’s water infrastructure and focus efforts on conservation and the restoration of water supplies throughout the West. The latest federal drought map shows a big pocket of moderate to severe drought over the Four Corners region, where New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah meet.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s police commissioner is retiring after three years, and a top deputy will succeed him as the leader of the nation’s largest police department, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. James O’Neill, 61, moved the police department away from controversial “broken windows” policies and oversaw continuing drops in crime. He will remain on the job until next month, when he leaves for a job in the private sector. Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea, a 28-year department member who started as a patrolman in the south Bronx, will be the new commissioner. Shea rose to prominence as the department’s statistical guru, and de Blasio said he is “one of the best-prepared incoming police commissioners this city has ever seen.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A treasure hunter who accuses the state of misusing his images from Blackbeard’s flagship says he’ll ask for 10 times the damages he originally sought, now that a court ruling has come down in his favor. John Masters of Intersal Inc. says he plans to seek $140 million in damages from North Carolina following the ruling Friday from the state Supreme Court that the case must return to Business Court. He said an expert witness had put Intersal’s losses from the state’s use of more than 2,000 images and more than 200 minutes of film at $129 million. He’s seeking another $11 million for losses over a permit that the state denied him, which would have allowed Intersal to search for a Spanish ship. Almost a quarter-century ago, Masters’ father discovered the wreckage of the Queen Anne’s Revenge, which ran aground in Beaufort, in what was then the colony of North Carolina, in 1718.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife officials say the number of tags issued for the upcoming deer hunt is up by about 10,000. The Game and Fish Department says about 67,500 deer tags have been issued. Wildlife division chief Jeb Williams says the deer population is trending up in western North Dakota, while the eastern part of the state has been slower from the rough winters of 2009, 2010 and 2011. The Bismarck Tribune reports Williams says there are fewer acres idled under the federal Conservation Reserve Program than a dozen years ago, which means less habitat. In 2018, 64% of tag holders harvested a deer, a little below the department’s benchmark of 70%. The season opens at noon Friday and ends Nov. 24.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame will honor 20 veterans at this year’s annual induction ceremony. Members of the 2019 class will be inducted Thursday at the Radiant Life Church in the Columbus suburb of Dublin. Gov. Mike DeWine and Deborah Ashenhurst, director of the Ohio Department of Veterans Services, will honor the class with medals. Officials say the public is invited to the 10 a.m. ceremony. Former Gov. George Voinovich established the Hall of Fame in 1992 to recognize outstanding professional achievement, service to the community and selfless acts of veterans following their military service. Honorees include astronauts, volunteers, community leaders, veteran advocates and former government officials, among others. The 2019 class joins 875 Ohio veterans inducted since the Hall of Fame was created.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 400 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across the state Monday as part of what officials say is the largest single-day mass commutation in U.S. history. Monday’s release of inmates, all with convictions for low-level drug and property crimes, resulted from a bill signed by new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. The bill retroactively applied misdemeanor sentences for simple drug possession and low-level property crimes that state voters approved in 2016. Stitt has made reducing Oklahoma’s highest-in-the-nation incarceration rate one of his top priorities and has appointed reform-minded members to the state’s Pardon and Parole Board. The board last week considered 814 cases and recommended 527 inmates for commutation. However, 65 are being held on detainers, leaving about 462 inmates to be released Monday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A timber investment firm is selling more than 3,000 acres along the Columbia River that has been used to grow poplar trees. The Capital Press reports Greenwood Resources had used the land to grow poplar trees for the U.S. paper industry, but experts say international competition and a low profit margin have made that difficult. Poplar plantations arose due to steep logging declines on federal land in the Pacific Northwest as paper companies worried about acquiring sufficient wood chips to run their plants. But that shortage never materialized, and efforts to grow larger poplar trees for use in furniture construction were stymied by competition from alder wood. Alder trees grow naturally in Pacific Northwest forests and don’t need to be grown on plantations, making them cheaper.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: After four years of testing, the Pennsylvania Turnpike says it plans to move ahead with a $129 million project to become a completely cashless toll system in two years, eliminating hundreds of toll-collecting and auditing positions along the way. Turnpike CEO Mark Compton told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last week that “the goal is to have the system completely cashless by the fall off 2021.” Toll booths will still be at some exit ramps until 2026 to record E-ZPass signals or photograph license plates so bills can be mailed to drivers. The jobs of the 600 remaining toll collectors and toll auditors will be eliminated, but officials say they will have the opportunity to move into other turnpike jobs or to take classes at the turnpike’s expense.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gun safety advocates want the state’s family court judges to require more domestic abusers to surrender their firearms. A report released Monday shows 34% of domestic abusers are being ordered to surrender their weapons in final orders of protection. That’s an increase from 5% before a 2017 state law regarding firearm surrenders took effect. In cases where a defendant is ordered to surrender firearms, 36% filed an affidavit – as required under the law – to prove they no longer have the weapons. The report was compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. Besides court files, it relies on observations of trained volunteers who monitored 289 domestic violence protection order cases between October 2018 and May 2019. Some judges disagree about how the law should be interpreted.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: State authorities are looking into the finances of Emanuel AME Church, which received millions in donations after a racist attack left nine worshippers at a Bible study dead in 2015. The Post and Courier reports State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Tommy Crosby confirmed the investigation last week but declined to elaborate. The church’s former secretary, Althea Latham, says she spoke to SLED agents recently about the handling of those donations. Latham has long contended that her contract wasn’t renewed less than two months after the shooting because she questioned processing and transparency surrounding the money that was coming in. Church leaders have said her contract simply wasn’t renewed. Latham hopes accountability will resolve lingering suspicions over the donations.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Feeding South Dakota is launching its yearly Thanksgiving Meal Drive as the nonprofit aims to help thousands of families who couldn’t otherwise afford the holiday. Givers who are looking for a way to help can donate food or money to Feeding South Dakota through Nov. 23. The nonprofit hopes to distribute 3,400 turkeys and meals to families across South Dakota on the Saturday before the holiday. Donors Greg and Pam Sands will match any online financial donations up to $15,000. A $20 gift is enough to pay for a turkey dinner for a family of four, according to Feeding South Dakota. People can make financial donations online or by phone at 605-335-0364, ext. 126.\n\nTennessee\n\nAshland City: Neal Ryder was growing produce in part to make his own baby food for 3-month-old son Griffin when he grew a whopping 22.6-pound sweet potato. Ryder says he didn’t realize a sweet potato could grow that big and didn’t consider himself a record-setter “by any means,” but he might have done just that. Guinness World Records shows that the heaviest sweet potato in the world was grown in Spain in 2004. It weighed 81 pounds and 9 ounces, according to Guinness World Records and the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth. Though Ryder’s sweet potato is a fraction of the world record, it could make Tennessee history. Last year, an East Tennessee woman grew a sweet potato that rang in at nearly 14 pounds. News reports from that time claimed it was a record.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: The mesquite, an iconic tree in the Lone Star State, provides a blessing and a curse, the San Antonio Express-News reports. Ranch manager Farron Sultemeier notes its beans provide late summer feed for cattle and wildlife. But it spreads ridiculously fast and is almost unstoppably invasive. Texas mesquites also produce thorns sharp enough to injure livestock and puncture a car tire. And they grow so gnarly and twisted, the wood is virtually useless for anything other than imparting a bold smokiness to meat – a signature of Texas barbecue. But that soon may change with two new, improved varieties developed by California-based Altman Plants. These experimental trees grow erect, spineless and fast, while still being able to survive and thrive in the harsh, semi-arid climate of South Texas. Altman Plants recently shipped about 150 of its two experimental hybrids – dubbed Mojave and Sonoran – from California to the San Antonio nursery where they’ll be propagated. Specimens should be available for purchase within a year.\n\nUtah\n\nAmerican Fork: A VW bus painted like a black chalkboard is inspiring creative drawings and bringing people together in this city. No matter where he parks the “chalkbus,” owner Jonathan Sherman says he comes back to find great new art adorning the sides. The Daily Herald reports that the story behind the bus inspired a documentary by college students at Utah Valley University. Sherman also lets bands cram into the bus to play music while he drives around town. Sherman, a licensed marriage and family therapist, says the bus seems to provide something people are missing by connecting them. He takes it each year to the Out of Darkness Suicide Prevention Walk in Salt Lake City and lets people draw on it there.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: A private boarding school in New Hampshire has made a bid to buy a closed Vermont college. The Bennington Banner reports the head of Oliverian School in Pike, New Hampshire, and the board chairman of the former Southern Vermont College confirm the private school has offered $4.9 million for the 371-acre campus and buildings in Bennington. “We feel that our students and faculty would thrive here,” says Will Laughlin, head of Oliverian School. Southern Vermont College officials said the closure last spring after graduation was due to a decline in enrollment and related debt issues that face other small colleges in the Northeast. According to Oliverian School’s website, it’s an alternative college preparatory boarding school for adolescents who have not thrived in traditional settings.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Catholic congregation of religious women that serves the elderly is leaving the state after 145 years. It’s the seventh time in six years that the congregation has pulled out across the country because fewer women are joining the order. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports Little Sisters of the Poor has about 30 locations in the U.S. and others in more than 30 countries. Its mission is to serve the elderly in nursing homes around the world. It came to the Richmond region in 1874. The order announced last week that it would be leaving St. Joseph’s Home in Henrico County. The 11 sisters who are leaving don’t yet know yet where they’ll go. But they could be sent to any home in the world that’s run by the religious order.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State officials are notifying voters of a registration error that could affect about 1,000 people attempting to cast a ballot in the state election scheduled for Tuesday. The Seattle Times reports officials have contacted voters by phone and email after detecting a problem with voter registrations submitted through Washington’s health plan website. The website provides a voter registration option for people enrolling in health or dental coverage and transmits the information to the Secretary of State’s Office. Officials say the Washington Health Benefit Exchange underwent a system upgrade in August that caused some voter registration information to be transmitted to the wrong account in the state system. Officials say the Secretary of State’s Office discovered the registration error last week and fixed the problem by Thursday evening.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A wildlife official says a monthlong series of fall tours to see elk drew visitors from eight other states. Chief Logan State Park naturalist Lauren Cole told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that 227 people went on the sold-out tours in September and October. The elk were at the nearby Tomlin Wildlife Management Area and were imported from Kentucky and Arizona. They’re part of a Division of Natural Resources effort to restore the species to the state. Cole says elk were seen on 19 of the 20 tours. She attributed the one tour where elk weren’t seen to a group of hunters who were pursuing raccoons with dogs. Cole says visitors also saw deer, wild turkeys, rabbits and a black bear. The tours also were offered last year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison is using rolling robots to deliver food. The school entered into a contact with Starship Technologies this summer to get access to a fleet of 30 robots that resemble coolers on wheels. The robots can navigate sidewalks autonomously, although human controllers can take over at a moment’s notice. Students and faculty can order food from several university restaurants through a Starship app on their phones and watch the robots’ progress as they travel to their address. Users will get an alert when the robot arrives. Each delivery will cost $1.99. That money will go to Starship Technologies. The robots began deliveries Monday on the campus’ north side. University officials hope to expand service campuswide once the robots have mapped the entire area.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon says he is open to the state pursuing a nuclear waste storage facility, though he doesn’t personally believe it’s the best industry for Wyoming. Gordon told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle’s editorial board last week that if a good reason can be found for such an industry in Wyoming, and it has adequate safeguards, he’s not going to stand in its way. The governor says he will wait to see what the Legislature finds in its studies of the idea before making a decision. This week in Casper, the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Interim Committee will consider a bill authorizing the governor to negotiate with the U.S. Energy Department to store spent nuclear fuel rods within the state.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/05"}]}

A recent housing assessment commissioned by the Delaware State Housing Authority found developers are capable of building homes to meet much of the demand. However, the report emphasized a known crisis: a severe shortage of affordable housing, especially for those with the lowest incomes.\n\nFor example, the median selling price of single-family homes in the First State increased from $370,000 in June to $375,000 in July. Condominiums and townhomes experienced a 5.6% increase, jumping from a median of $286,000 in June to $302,000 in July.\n\nThe matter is even more pronounced in Wilmington where the per capita income is $33,567 compared with the state's per capita income of $42,571. Amid the housing shortage, the city has around 1,400 vacant units that could be potentially restored for housing. However, renovating these homes, although believed to be a cost-effective option, can be as expensive as buying a new home in Delaware.\n\nCreating affordable, safe housing has long been a challenge in the city, but for over 100 years, one institution has attempted to tackle the issue.\n\nIn the 1930s, William Bancroft founded Woodlawn Trustees to buy land and develop affordable housing in Wilmington. The nonprofit later formed the Todmorden Foundation in 2014 to continue its mission to create affordable housing in the city. These nonprofits are renovating 20 housing units in Wilmington's Eastside neighborhood to make them available for the economically disadvantaged.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal met with Richard Przywara, president and CEO of Woodlawn Trustees, at a few of these properties to explore the factors that contribute to the high costs associated with the development of affordable housing.\n\nSince COVID pandemic, just buying a vacant unit can cost $40K-$70K\n\nThe inflated cost of renovating vacant houses is immediately evident in the purchase price, according to Przywara. In the past, he said, neglected residential properties in Wilmington could be bought for $15,000 to $30,000. Since the onset of the pandemic, the market values of property in Wilmington have experienced a significant increase, and this trend has also extended to the costs of vacant homes.\n\nPrzywara said you can now expect to pay $40,000 to $70,000 for these types of properties.\n\nOnce acquired, it is necessary to clear the interior of the house before proceeding with any renovations. While it is typically assumed that no one is residing in the homes that Woodlawn Trustees and the Todmorden Foundation are renovating, there may be instances where they are still occupied.\n\nPrzywara sends a staffer to check for any squatters before entering homes to begin work. If any are found, they will be asked to vacate the premises, kindly — as in alignment with the organizations' Quaker values. In some cases, when a family is discovered residing in one of the homes, the nonprofit will cover the expense of relocating them to another property.\n\nAny rodent or roach infestation and cleanup from previous residents are also an expense to factor in.\n\nThe increased costs of materials apply to every address\n\nBoth Przywara and Richard Dyton, a contractor who works with Woodlawn Trustees and the Todmorden Foundation, said it's important to realize that certain expenses related to renovating a residential building are fixed and cannot be avoided irrespective of whether the property is a rowhome on Wilmington's Eastside or an estate home in Greenville.\n\nThe developers said due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the supply chain, the costs of house-building materials, including lumber, plumbing, electrical components and paint, have significantly increased. \"If you had a material list of $20,000 pre-COVID, it's now at least 50, maybe $60,000 just for material costs,” Dyton said.\n\nThe cost of labor, as well as the expense of replacing all electrical wiring, plumbing fixtures and the heating system in a home, can easily add up to nearly $40,000, regardless of the home's size, Dyton explained.\n\nCosts before demolition and construction work begin\n\nIn the early 1900s, when many homes in Wilmington were built, there were few building codes in place. Today, when remodeling changes exceed $25,000, strict regulations must be followed.\n\nTo obtain a building permit for construction work on structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing modifications exceeding this amount or on commercial roofing projects, it is necessary to obtain approval from the city based on an architectural plan. Przywara said the services of an architect or engineer can cost between $8,000 and $10,000.\n\nThe architect or engineer will assess the building's structures and major systems to identify which ones need to be updated to meet modern codes. In certain cases, the installation of a sprinkler system may be necessary. According to Dyton, the cost of sprinkler systems can reach up to $70,000.\n\n\"Sometimes you get into a unit and you're like, 'What did I get into? I thought I was at $150,000 and now I'm at $225,000,'\" Przywara said.\n\nAfter the building permit approval, the focus shifts to actual renovation. According to Przywara and Dyton, it is essential to prioritize the repair of the roof to ensure the stability and security of the entire structure beneath it.\n\nMany homes on Eastside were built during the 1930s and 1940s with brick. Some are in such a state of severe disrepair that the mortar has begun to crumble. Pointing out the damage along the roofline of one rowhome on Bennett Street, Przywara said correcting the brickwork there would cost an estimated $10,000 to $15,000 not to mention the possibility of having to fix a neighboring roof.\n\n\"All of these roofs are connected. One building having a problem on the roof can actually affect the neighbor,\" Przywara said. Brickwork aside, according to Dyton, if there is no need for sub-roof repair, a new roof will cost around $12,000. However, if sub-roof repair is necessary, the cost can range from $15,000 to $22,000.\n\nLead paint remediation is a given in older homes\n\nThe remediation of lead paint hazards in older homes also has to be addressed. To do this, Przywara said that all paint, wallpaper, and drywall would need to be removed. The threat of lead contamination extends to the paint or lead-filled caulk on windows necessitating the replacement of all existing windows instead of simply painting over them. Evaluating the condition of existing wood frames to determine if any repairs or replacements are required, will also affect costs.\n\nIf interior framing of the house is necessary, an additional $25,000 to $30,000 will need to be allocated. Between framing and essential mechanicals, expenditures are around $70,000.\n\nIt's important to note that these estimates do not cover other significant expenses such as drywalling, flooring options or counter and cabinet selections. These factors can further increase the overall cost of the construction or renovation project.\n\nContact reporter Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.

Jack Walsh, D-Pike Creek, as the primary sponsor, and seeks to allow Delawareans 21 years of age and older to purchase alcoholic beverages from a restaurant, tavern, taproom, brewpub or other entity with a valid on-premises license through third-party delivery services like DoorDash and UberEats.\n\nAside from allowances for alcohol delivery, SB 166 adds that “the acts of a licensed consumer delivery permittee or delivery driver are not attributable to the retailer.”\n\nDoorDash recently released data showing that Dashers, delivery drivers employed by the company, earn nearly 20% more on deliveries with alcohol on average compared with deliveries without alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe company also reports that the number of total merchants selling alcohol on DoorDash marketplace in the country increased by 37% in the past year.\n\nSB 166 was passed by an 18 to 3 vote in the Senate on March 21. From there, it moved to the House Economic Development/Banking/Insurance & Commerce Committee, where it passed on April 23, and later moved out of the House Appropriations Committee on June 12.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 25, the Delaware House of Representatives approved SB 166 by a vote of 34 to 2.\n\n“This bill is a great step forward for Delaware’s economy. By expanding opportunities for Dashers to earn and merchants to grow their business, safe alcohol delivery will bring considerable benefits to consumers and small businesses across Delaware — benefits already recognized in 32 other states that allow for alcohol delivery by platforms like DoorDash,” said Chad Horrell, DoorDash’s senior manager of government relations in Delaware. “We look forward to working closely with policymakers to ensure everyone will be able to safely enjoy the best that Delaware has to offer with responsible alcohol delivery.”\n\nWine shipment news:Delaware is 1 of 3 states barring wine shipments.

For every homebuyer who passes, Wilkinson said, there are plenty of others waiting to swipe it off the market almost as quickly as it can be listed.\n\n“Not everybody gambles,” Wilkinson said. “Not everybody sky dives. Everybody’s different. There are always people that are risk-takers and others that are not.”\n\nIn coastal Delaware, such gamblers abound. A new analysis shows that between 2010 and 2017 more than 700 homes – worth roughly $500 million – were built on land that’s projected to be inundated at least once a year on average by 2050 unless pricey measures are taken to keep the water away.\n\nStatewide, roughly 7,500 houses face such risks – 10 percent of which are less than a decade old. While that threat exists nearly anywhere in America with a coastal view, it is more heavily concentrated in Delaware, the analysis found.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic is a hotspot for sea-level rise and coastal construction, spurred in part by rebuilding following Hurricane Sandy and gradual recovery from the Great Recession of 2008. The only two counties among 24 coastal states with more new houses in such vulnerable areas than Sussex County are in southern New Jersey— Ocean and Cape May counties.\n\nRELATED:See if your home will be regularly flooded in 30 years\n\nThe News Journal produced this story in partnership with Climate Central, a Princeton, New Jersey-based nonprofit that researches and reports facts about climate change.\n\nClimate Central performed the analysis of future risks of flooding by combining scientific projections with data from real estate listing company Zillow. Parts of Kent and New Castle counties were also found to face risks.\n\nIn Sussex County, dozens of vulnerable houses have been built in Lewes, a town bordered by expansive marshland and tributaries to the north and Cape Henlopen State Park and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Neighborhoods found to be most at risk in the Lewes area included Lewes Beach and Cape Shores.\n\nThe Lewes that Wilkinson sells to her clients today has evolved from its earliest days as a Dutch trading post into a hub for menhaden fishing into now a quaint, historic town known for its charm, quiet beaches and multi-million-dollar waterfront homes.\n\nEven in those earliest of days, settlers without access to the Weather Channel knew it best to build on higher ground. So much of Lewes is surrounded by water that more than 50 percent of the land within city limits has been set aside as open space, a place to absorb incoming flood waters and rising seas, said City Mayor Ted Becker.\n\n“The people who come here in the summer time or on a beautiful day, when the canal is in its banks and everything is gorgeous, they never think about the idea that [a recent] Saturday at the high tide, the water was across Savannah Road and up over the sidewalk in front of the Beacon Motel,” he said. “Now, we could have much worse. People are more sensitive to it, but habits are hard to change.”\n\nWhen the late Thomas Orr bought his new bride one of the first homes on Lewes Beach in the late 1940s, people in town thought the couple was “wacky” to want to deal with all that sand, said Carol Orr.\n\nBut after 71 years of watching the sun rise over the bay – and a few instances of needing to flee to higher ground for their safety – Orr said she would not have chosen anywhere else to raise a son and grow old.\n\nBut as she has watched other homes be built on the beach over the years – some at ground level and greater risk of inundation – Orr said she would wonder how people could take the risk of living so close to the water for granted.\n\n“How can you be so stupid?” she asked.\n\nSeas are rising faster as heat-trapping pollution is released from fossil fuels, farming and forest losses, driving up air and ocean temperatures, melting ice into seas and expanding ocean waters.\n\nEfforts to reduce emissions could lessen future impacts, but won't undo the damage already done, which will continue to push up sea levels for decades to come.\n\nNatural geological processes and groundwater pumping are accelerating local sea-level rise along the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nWater levels have risen more than a foot during the past century at the site of a federal tide gauge in Lewes. The new analysis examined the likely impacts of a little more than a foot of additional sea level rise here by 2050.\n\nLast year was the second-warmest year on record in Delaware, and the warming temperatures are fueling violent storms that produce storm surges and heavy rain.\n\nEven as risks become more apparent, they’re having little impact on coastal building and buying. Southern Delaware real estate agents told The News Journal earlier this year the coastal real estate market is the best they have seen in a decade.\n\nWith more homes exposed to rising seas – which are climbing in the country’s lowest-lying state at a rate nearly twice the global average – why do people keep building and buying in the same places scientists say will face the greatest risks in coming decades?\n\nFor those willing to take the risk, the answer may be quite simple: Because they can.\n\nThe impact of a drenching nightmare\n\nWilkinson works with both modestly and high-priced homes in southern Delaware. Most recently, she sold a $4 million beach house to a Delaware couple who had worked abroad and are now ready to retire on the water.\n\nThe previous owners, after paying off the mortgage, had foregone flood insurance because they thought it was a waste of money. The house sits well above the 100-year floodplain, she said.\n\nLewes is one of more than a dozen communities in Delaware with locally required freeboard, additional elevation that towns can require to keep a structure above modeled flood waters from a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.\n\nIn Lewes, homes must be built at least 18 inches above that base. At least one Delaware beach town requires an additional 3 feet above the minimum.\n\nFor those newer coastal homes like that $4 million one located in a private beachside neighborhood called Cape Shores, strict federal, state and local regulations on building elevations and flood insurance requirements can potentially mean more protections from rising floodwaters, Wilkinson said.\n\n“There are enough people that want this and will spend the money,\" she said. \"And they will take the chance.”\n\nWhen the Union of Concerned Scientists released a similar report this summer, estimating that up to 31,000 people and 24,000 homes in Delaware could see impacts from climate change and rising sea levels by the end of the century, analysts warned that those facing the greatest risks were living in homes worth far less than the state's median home value. Many others were retirees, relying heavily on the value of their homes, the report said.\n\nIn Lewes, about 40 percent of the population is over 65, said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist at the University of Delaware’s Sea Grant program. That could make it more difficult for them to relocate or recover from a natural disaster.\n\n\"You have this population of retirees that are moving toward the coast and in the floodplain, and in a lot of cases, a lot of their personal savings and their life's wealth is tied up in that home,\" Swallow said. \"Do they have the capacity to recover as quickly as someone who is still in the work force?\"\n\nPaul Camenisch, a local custom builder whose three-man company takes jobs only by word of mouth, agreed. A few years ago, they were building a house a few miles to the north along Delaware Bay when a nor’easter hit and they could not get to the site because the road had flooded out.\n\nBut that didn’t change his clients’ minds.\n\n“It’s where we live,” he said. “We live on a peninsula surrounded by water and under the land, it’s water.”\n\nThe Delaware native said it is not his job to tell clients where or what they should build. It is his job to build the home of their dreams, even if it means erecting a home on stilts that could be tough to access if projected sea levels flood the roads leading to it.\n\n“We put it where they tell us to put it,” he said. “We’ve had houses built within fractions of an inch of what the regulation is supposed to be. We’re very diligent in how we build a house. We don’t hide anything.”\n\nCamenisch lives farther inland in Delaware’s most southern, coastal county, close to a river known to overflow and flood downtown Milton, the home of Dogfish Head, during even the mildest nor’easter.\n\nHe is no stranger to rising seas and the impacts of climate change.\n\n“I’ve lived here 50 years and I’ve seen the change,” he said. “Water rises up and goes to places it’s never been before.”\n\nBut as a business owner, he said it doesn't make much sense to turn them down.\n\n“I don’t think we’ve ever heard anybody say, ‘we’re not going to build this house because it’s going to flood,’” he said. “They’re all susceptible. But that’s why they want it. They want to see the water. They want the $1 million house and the $1 million view to go with it.”\n\nAll Camenisch can do is make sure he is following the law and using the most updated techniques and materials available. Because if he doesn’t, another builder will.\n\nRegulating the American Dream\n\nThe draw to live near the water, even if it’s only for part of the year, is not subsiding even though officials along Delaware’s coasts know those waterfront views are changing.\n\nBecause the desire to build homes and condominiums with stunning waterfront views is so strong, it means more people are now in the path of those storms and rising seas than when the Orrs cozied into their beach-front home.\n\nIn Lewes alone, several parcels of land like the Groome Church property on New Road near the Great Marsh are being eyed for new neighborhoods. That could bring hundreds of new residents within stone's throw of floodplains and roads already known to flood at high tide.\n\nDelaware has done a lot of progressive work regarding planning and accounting for the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, over the last decade, said Sea Grant's Swallow. All that planning cannot stop the building driven by a high-demand market, though.\n\n“In Delaware, there’s not enough appreciation that our storms are getting more intense, so when we do have storms there’s potentially more rainfall, there could be more storm surge, and all that gets exacerbated by sea level rise and the fact that we’re continuing to develop in our flood plain,” she said.\n\nPlans and studies may not seem sexy, but evaluating how many rooftops and pavements cover the coastal areas and force storm water into the streets can shape how communities driven by coastal tourism ensure that future visitors can still get to the beach or their homes.\n\nEven owners of houses that are elevated are impacted by flooding. With only three roads in and out of Lewes, Becker said the risk of rising seas is more than an inconvenience. In the face of another Superstorm Sandy or a direct hit from a hurricane, flooded roads could cut residents off from reaching safer, higher ground.\n\n“This is not a unique problem for Lewes,” Becker said. “There’s always more we can do, but we have to create a culture of awareness.”\n\nThe trouble, though, is that many of the people who own homes that will face the greatest risk in coming decades are not around all year. They don’t see what happens when nor’easters trap water inland and wash out the roads, he said.\n\nPeople also may not be assuming all of the risk because that risk is often subsidized through the National Flood Insurance Program, state officials said. As of June 30, the flood insurance program was more than $20 billion in debt while managing more than 5 million policies nationwide, 26,752 of which are in Delaware, according to FEMA spokesman Michael Hart.\n\nBecause it has been so long since Delaware has been hard hit by a major coastal storm, some home owners, buyers and builders may be living a false sense of complacency, Swallow said.\n\n\"I think the day is just around the corner when attitudes are going to change,\" she said.\n\nUnless drastic changes are made to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses, Delaware’s coastline is expected to change dramatically by the time today's toddlers are retired. In a 2012 report, Delaware experts estimated that up to 11 percent of the state’s landmass could be underwater by 2100 if nothing is done to move toward cleaner energy production.\n\n\"Delaware is a smaller piece of what we need to do nationally, which is a smaller piece of what we need to do globally,” said Shawn Garvin, secretary of the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. “Despite the retreat from the federal government, at least for now, on the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Accord, we’re still moving forward in doing our part.\"\n\nNot worth the risk\n\nWilkinson said there are plenty of affluent, well-educated home buyers who have the means to buy right on the beach but are not remotely interested or willing to take the risk of living so close to encroaching waters.\n\n“There are certain people who will mention sea level rise to me and say, ‘I’m not interested in looking there.’ Period,” she said. “And those people won’t look. They won’t ever consider it.”\n\nAmong that group are Brian and Patricia McCarthy, who spent most of their lives overseas working for the Department of State.\n\nWhen it came time to think about retirement, the McCarthys realized that moving around so much meant they did not really have a hometown to return to. They had known of Lewes as a vacation spot, and spent a few years living in the higher part of town while they weighed the risks of building near the water.\n\nInstead of living along the sandy shores of Lewes Beach or Cape Shores, they recently built a home 200 yards outside the 100-year floodplain on a little rise of land. They also elevated the structure 3 feet.\n\n“It wasn’t until we moved in that we realized how much water there is to deal with,” said Patricia, thankful for a generous amount of pervious surface included in the landscaping after an abnormally wet spring and summer.\n\nAcross the street from the McCarthy’s is a small parking area and grassy lot that dips down to the banks of the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal. There, the couple has a boat dock and installed a retaining wall; they’ve seen high tides lap at the front of their parking spots.\n\n“We’re not naïve,” Brian McCarthy said. “But it’s not something I worry about every day. My bigger concern is wind from nor’easters.”\n\nFor those willing to splurge on high-priced homes that are expected to flood by the time the mortgage is paid off, Wilkinson said all it means is one less weekend overlooking the water.\n\n“I think people probably would have that concern anywhere around here, and yes, there is a percentage of people that no matter what, even if they had the money, they’re not buying this stuff,” she said. “But there are enough people that want this and will spend the money. And they will take the chance.”\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Climate Central.

That’s if only moderate measures are taken to address greenhouse gas emissions, which fuel stronger storms and rising seas that will make flooding problems worse.\n\n• Statewide, nearly 7,500 houses face such risks – 10 percent of which are less than a decade old.\n\n• Research and journalism group Climate Central used scientific projections and data from Zillow and found that Delaware ranks No. 5 out of 24 coastal states for the most newly built homes facing this risk.\n\n• Sussex County ranks No. 3 among coastal counties. The only two counties with more new homes built in risk zones are found in nearby New Jersey, where Hurricane Sandy destroyed thousands of houses and buildings.\n\n• Among 24 coastal states, just over 10,000 newly built houses are at risk of flooding regularly shortly after the average mortgage would be paid off if only moderate cuts to pollution are made. Deep cuts would bring that number just under 10,000, while unchecked pollution would bring to the total to a little more than 11,000.\n\n• The numbers are worse for the end of the century. If greenhouse-gas pollution goes unchecked, 2.5 million existing homes – currently worth about $1.33 trillion or 6 percent of the U.S. economy – would be at risk of flooding at least once a year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/07/permit-to-purchase-handgun-bill-approved-by-delaware-house/72869604007/", "title": "'Permit to purchase' handgun bill approved by Delaware House", "text": "After hours of debate, the Delaware House of Representatives approved a bill requiring training and a permit before purchase of a handgun.\n\nHouse representatives spent nearly four hours debating 11 amendments proposed to the legislation, most of which were brought to the floor for the first time Thursday evening after caucusing for over an hour before debate.\n\nRepublican representatives attempted to table the bill given the considerable back-and-forth lawmakers had over the proposed changes, but the move was defeated.\n\nHouse Democrats as recently as December had pledged to approve the bill when the full House reconvened in January, but inclement weather and uncertainty around Gov. John Carney’s rescheduled State of the State address forced the public body to remain flexible and keep schedules open, House Democratic spokesperson Jenevieve Worley had said.\n\nEARLIER:Why Delaware lawmakers failed to vote on 'permit to purchase' in first weeks of session\n\nBecause the House revised the bill, it must now go back to the Senate for a vote, which likely will be added to next week’s Senate session agenda.\n\nCarney also pledged his support for the bill, speaking confidently during Tuesday's State of the State address that it would be passed: \"This year, we’ll take another big step forward and pass the permit to purchase law.\"\n\nThe final vote was 23 to 16. Two members were absent.\n\nWhat does the latest bill do?\n\nThe House made several revisions to the bill that was sent to the legislative body by the Senate last year.\n\nThose who supported the legislation argued the measure would cut down on straw purchases of guns as well as homicides and suicides. Lawmakers who opposed the bill argued the regulations violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and warned that constitutional challenges would be brought against the legislation if passed.\n\nSTRAW PURCHASES:How a pattern of shoplifting ammunition led Delaware to demand Cabela's records\n\nThe bill's sponsor in the House, Rep. Melissa Minor Brown, encouraged lawmakers seeking revisions to the bill to work across the aisle to develop additional legislation, reminding them that \"permit to purchase\" has been in the works since 2019.\n\n\"This legislation has been the product of years of discussions, meetings and collaboration with colleagues in this building, constituents, advocates and stakeholders,\" she said, adding that 123 people die and 577 people are wounded by guns in Delaware in an average year. \"That is the fifth-highest rate of gun violence in the nation.\"\n\nMinor Brown said that Delaware crime data shows that the \"vast majority of crime guns\" are pistols and revolvers, and 83% of our crime guns are handguns. Plus, she said 70% of these crime guns are purchased in Delaware.\n\n\"Senate Bill 2 will drastically reduce these statistics by creating a requirement for a handgun qualifier purchase permit,\" she said. \"The bill would require people to undergo a gun safety training course and apply for a permit to qualify for the purchase of handguns.\"\n\nWhile applicants must shell out money for fingerprinting and the required training, there will be no fee to obtain the permit, according to Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 2.\n\nAmendments passed remove the voucher program that would have provided financial assistance to low-income residents to cover the firearms safety training, which the legislation’s fiscal impact note indicated would cost about $1.7 million annually.\n\nThe amendments to the bill also make technical changes, including language that empowers law enforcement to ensure the surrender of guns purchased under a revoked permit and reiterates that information collected for the permit would be exempt from the state's Freedom of Information Act Law.\n\nPeople who already hold a valid concealed carry permit, qualified law enforcement officers as well as retired police are not required to obtain or present a handgun purchase permit. Other amendments passed Thursday exempt \"certain professionals and individuals\" from the training requirement \"only if the firearm training they undertake as part of their employment meets the requirements for training set forth\" in the bill.\n\nThe majority of the costs associated with the bill are for the staff and technology needed for the implementation and continued operation of the permit program.\n\nThe first year of the program’s implementation is estimated to cost about $2.7 million, for which Carney’s 2025 budget proposal includes nearly $3 million for the implementation.\n\nBy the second year, costs would climb to about $7.8 million annually – a figure that includes the cost of the voucher program. The bill’s fiscal note suggests that the voucher program wouldn’t be rolled out until the second year of its implementation.\n\nWhat if it’s constitutionally challenged?\n\nDelaware Republicans have come out in opposition to the bill, mirroring resistance by gun rights advocates to place restrictions on gun ownership.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Mike Ramone said during a Facebook live recording reacting to Carney’s recent State of the State address that other states that have passed similar bills faced legal pushback.\n\n“If we want to keep creating environments where we’re making our communities safer, why don’t we just make sure the bill is constitutional and not copy a bill that’s similar to Maryland or another state where they’ve already ruled it’s not constitutional?” Ramone said.\n\nA U.S. appeals court last year declared Maryland's licensing requirements for people seeking to buy handguns unconstitutional, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on a 2-1 vote blocked Maryland’s 2013 law that required people to undergo training and background checks before applying for licenses to buy handguns, arguing it violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, according to Reuters.\n\nThe lawsuit was backed and paid for by the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe ruling was cited by several Republican lawmakers during their final remarks before the vote on the legislation was taken, many of them warning that a constitutional challenge would be forthcoming.\n\nDelaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said during the House meeting Thursday that the 4th Circuit’s ruling will be reheard by the full court because the panel of judges that ruled on the case was not representative of the full 4th Circuit.\n\nTwo of the judges on the case were former President Donald Trump appointees, and the third dissented, office spokesman Mat Marshall said. Jennings also noted that the First State falls under the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and so whatever happens in the 4th Circuit has no bearing on Delaware.\n\n\"I am convinced this bill is constitutional and that the appropriate courts will rule that it is constitutional,\" Jennings testified Thursday evening. \"My office is defending all the challenges to gun bills passed by this legislature, and I can tell you that as I stand here tonight, not one of those challenges has been successful.\"\n\nLegal challenges on gun reforms\n\nThe Delaware State Sportsman Association in 2022 filed a lawsuit challenging state legislation that prohibits most people under the age of 21 from purchasing or owning a firearm, arguing it discriminates against a class of people who have a “God-given and constitutionally protected right to defend themselves.”\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge later dismissed that lawsuit. Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III said the suit raised legal issues that don't fall under the purview of the Chancery Court. Delaware gun rights advocates sought a permanent injunction to prevent the state from enforcing the law.\n\nThe association, along with other gun rights advocates, also filed similar suits in the U.S. District Court seeking a preliminary injunction to block legislation that banned assault weapons and high-capacity firearm magazines.\n\nMORE:Federal judge denies Del. gun groups preliminary injunction in assault weapons ban lawsuit\n\nJudge Richard Andrews last March denied the request, writing in his decision that the gun groups “failed to meet their burden” of proving two necessary factors: The likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit over the state's ghost gun ban continues and a suit filed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation challenging Delaware's public nuisance law was dismissed in August.\n\nMarshall defended Delaware’s “permit to purchase” legislation’s constitutionality.\n\n“Permit to purchase laws have been on the books in this country for close to 30 years and, despite the NRA’s frantic efforts, none of Delaware’s gun laws have been overturned in court,” he said. “The leading cause of death for children in this country is not car accidents, not disease, but guns. This bill will help change that. If the gun lobby challenges it, we’ll be proud to defend it, and we’ll win.”\n\nGot a tip? Contact Amanda Fries at afries@delawareonline.com.

To that aim, a career in public service at both the municipal and federal levels has enabled me to advocate for policies that solve many of my state's vulnerabilities. As the current congressman, I have supported legislation that addresses educational and health improvements, water and sewage enhancements, better roads and bridges, and assisting with the financial and health issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are elected? How would you like to resolve those issues?\n\nAgriculture: I want to address the issues within Agriculture: Food Nutrition and Food Security, Consumer Food Costs, Effective Climate Solutions, Supply Chain Issues, and Trade Opportunities. Throughout my entire time in Congress, I have voted in support of all farm issues. This year, I was selected to join the Democratic Minority Leader's Farm Bill Taskforce to help assist in the planning and structuring of this year's Farm Bill, which will address the topics of clean water, infrastructure, and disaster relief efforts.\n\nHealth Care: Adequate funding for rural hospitals, high prescription drug costs, the lack of maternal health resources, and Medicaid Expansion are all urgent issues affecting the nation and the Second Congressional District of Mississippi. As the only member of the Mississippi Congressional Delegation who supports Medicaid Expansion, I am committed to advocating for lower prescription costs, investing in tackling Mississippi's maternal health concerns, and providing resources to encourage students to pursue jobs in healthcare by supporting legislation that will place people over politics.\n\nVeterans: Servicemen and Servicewomen sacrifice their lives every day to protect our country. As an unwavering supporter of our heroes, I will continue to vote for and support initiatives like the PACT Actto expand healthcare benefits for all veterans. Veterans should receive the respect and help they deserve both during their duty and upon their return to civilian life. It is critical that we acknowledge their contributions to our country by upholding our promises to offer comprehensive treatment and assistance.\n\nEducation: All Americans should have the right to receive an education regardless of age, race, or income bracket. My voting record reflects my commitment to lobbying for government financial incentives (funds/allocations) for public schools, boosting grants and loan opportunities for college-bound students, protecting and preserving the history of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities and enhancing workforce training measures. As Congressman for the Second Congressional District of Mississippi, I continue to support initiatives to relieve student loan debt, which has reached a record of $4 million with the help of the Biden-Harris Administration. It is my duty to continue supporting the initiatives essential to providing Mississippians with the education and skills they need for jobs in our state.\n\nFamily: Families everywhere should be able to sustain a healthy living, and parents should be able to provide their children with healthy food options. As the Representative of the Second Congressional District of Mississippi, I support reauthorization of the child tax credit, affordable childcare services, free and reduced lunch, WIC, SNAP, and other federal financial initiatives to aid constituents facing economic hardships.\n\nCivil Rights: Protecting and preserving the stories, experiences, and inventions of Black and brown Americans is imperative. As a proud advocate for fair treatment, equal opportunities, and preserving history, we must work endlessly to create an environment in which all Americans are knowledgeable about the strides of our forefathers. From the essential stories of Civil rights to leading the good fight to eliminate discrimination in Mississippi's higher education system, I remain steadfast in supporting the Biden/Harris initiatives implementing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in federal policymaking.\n\n— Grant McLaughlin, Clarion Ledger\n\nTaylor Turcotte\n\nCity/town of residence: Jackson\n\nAge: 52\n\nOccupation: I own a small advertising agency that focuses on the advertising and marketing needs of small businesses.Education: Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing and a specialty in Pharmaceutical sales from the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nImmediate family (spouse, children, grandchildren): Husband, JeffHave you ever served as an elected official? If so, what role, when and where? I have never run for or served as an elected official.\n\nWhy are you running?Because I live in Jackson and nothing will change no matter what we do at a lower level until Bennie Thompson isn’t the one holding the strings. I’m not seeing any candidates reaching out to voters who have the ability to vote Bennie out because their focus is exclusively on Republicans. I am reaching out to conservatives, both Republican and Democrat. I believe that the values of the everyday average Mississippian who is a conservative Democrat align much more with the values of today’s GOP than the liberal elite of the Democratic Party. And Bennie Thompson is the epitome of a Liberal Democrat elite.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are elected? How would you like to resolve those issues?\n\nCrime in the younger generation because parents can’t control the kids because they walk out the door and the cops can’t control the kids because they all have cellphones with cameras.

I want to clean the place up, put asphalt on the roads, build the pumps, bring in jobs, secure our southern border and make the district a cleaner, safer, better place to live, work and play for all.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are elected? How would you like to resolve those issues?

If so, what role, when and where? Yes, prior to serving the 4th District of Mississippi, I was elected sheriff of Jackson County.\n\nImmediate family: Wife, Suzette Ezell; daughter, Amy, and son-in-law, Coby Dennis; and granddaughter, Sydney.\n\nWhy are you running? I care about this country. I love my country and I love my state of Mississippi. I feel like in my 42 years as a law enforcement officer and chief executive of the sheriff's office and the experience that I have, I can bring with me to Washington so I can better protect and serve the community.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are reelected? How would you like to resolve those issues? We need to continue to hold this administration accountable for the debacle that is going on at the southern border. We need to continue to fight the regulations of the EPA jamming down the businessmen and women of this country. We need to reduce red tape, fight the bureaucrats in Washington and reduce taxes to make a better economy.\n\nCarl Boyanton\n\nCity/town of residence: Diamondhead\n\nAge: 65\n\nOccupation: Produce broker.\n\nEducation: Some college.\n\nHave you ever served as an elected official? If so, what role, when and where? Never served as an elected official.\n\nImmediate family: Wife, Heidi; two daughters, Megan and Melissa.\n\nWhy are you running? Mike Ezell lied to us. He campaigned on not voting for Kevin McCarthy and then voted for him 16 times. He campaigned on cutting spending then voted for the debt ceiling increase of $2 trillion and counting. He voted against Marjorie Taylor Greene's amendment that would reinstate pilots that refused the COVID vaccine. Not Mississippi values.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are elected? How would you like to resolve those issues? The border: I would push to use the budget to make this administration close the border. Republicans voted with Democrats on every budget bill to keep funding the government. They had five to six times last year they could have used the budget to make Biden close the border. The budget: I will push to have us go to zero-base budgeting where everything in the budget has to be reauthorized. This alone could balance our budget. Crime: I would work to support our law enforcement and firefighters by trying to take the money we are wasting on illegal immigrants and find a way to augment their pay. They put their lives on the line for us every day for very little money. Veterans: One of my main focuses will be helping our heroes who are being neglected right now. The VA has to be revamped and the money has to be used on our veterans and not the administration.\n\nMichael McGill\n\nCity/town of residence: Long Beach\n\nAge: 43\n\nOccupation: Retired Army combat veteran\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree in business management\n\nHave you ever served as an elected official? If so, what role, when and where? No.\n\nImmediate family: Girlfriend, Kristen Henry; two sons, Michael and Remington.\n\nWhy are you running? I’m running for Congress, because I want to put our country first. I have had enough after serving 20 years in the military and witnessing countless mistakes. Our community deserves better. It’s time to cut through the nonsense and the red tape and ensure every American has a voice. No more pushing party agendas, no more empty promises. Just a realistic vision for our country.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are elected? Human trafficking; fentanyl epidemic; education; veterans health; mental health; homelessness; affordable health care; insurance costs; and infrastructure.\n\nDemocrat\n\nCraig Raybon\n\nCraig Raybon is the lone Democrat seeking office in the 4th District.

He joined and was an active duty member of the U.S. Army for 21 years, serving three tours in Iraq and receiving the Bronze Star.\n\nA civil rights lawyer, Pinkins received a law degree from Georgetown University before moving back to the Mississippi Delta to advocate \"on behalf of community members in some of Mississippi’s most underserved communities by helping community members navigate the justice system.\"\n\nKey issues Pinkins' campaign is focused on include, criminal justice reform, access to affordable healthcare, education reform throughout Mississippi and the nation, ensuring affordable housing, voter suppression, investing in sustainable energy and economic development for all Mississippians.\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nAge: 72\n\nOccupation: Senior United States Senator of Mississippi\n\nEducation: University of Mississippi University of Mississippi School of Law\n\nImmediate family: (Wife) Gayle Wicker, (Son) McDaniel Wicker, (Daughter) Margaret McPhillips (Daughter) Caroline Sims\n\nHave you ever served as an elected official? Yes, I served in the state Senate on behalf of Lee and Pontotoc counties, and I was also elected to represent Mississippi’s First Congressional District in the House of Representatives.\n\nWhy are you running?\n\nThe radical Biden-Harris agenda has made America weaker and less secure. As the leading Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am fighting to block and push back against as much of the Biden agenda as possible. For example, in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act, I was able to slash funding for the “woke” Biden DEI agenda at the Pentagon, included language ensuring military promotions are based on merit, not race or gender, and passed provisions to improve border security, including the Finish It Act to force the administration to continue border wall construction.\n\nWhat are some of the issues you would like to address if you are elected? How would you like to resolve those issues?\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration is determined to promote policies that make our country weaker on the world stage, making us less secure at home. Our Southern border is a national security threat. The Biden administration has sent an open invitation to illegal immigrants to flood into our country unchecked. In response to Biden’s border crisis, I authored and passed the Finish It Act. This legislation, which is now law, forces the Biden administration to use all remaining border wall materials to finish President Trump’s border wall. That is progress, but there is much more that must be done. We must give the Border Patrol the authority to use the laws that are already on the books to stop the unmanageable and increasing flow of crime and drugs into our country.\n\nWe are also facing multiple threats abroad where we see turmoil in the Middle East, Europe, and the South Pacific. As the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am focused on strengthening our military. In this leadership position, I am focused on building our Navy to deter China and other adversaries. I will continue fighting to modernize our military and protect our defense and shipbuilding jobs here in Mississippi.\n\nGhannon Burton\n\nThis will be Ghannon Burton's first time running for elected office. He retired from the Marine Corps in December 2021 after serving 30 years, according to his campaign website.\n\nBurton did not respond to the Clarion Ledger for a request for comment.\n\n\"He finished his career at the Pentagon and retired for many reasons, including; vaccine mandates, the 'wokeness' that he saw politicizing our service members, and the stolen election.

Karnopp blames manure spread by large dairy farms on a ridge next to his property.\n\n“Everything rolls downhill,” said Karnopp, 67, a retired over-the-road truck driver. He lives in dairy-intensive Kewaunee County, where cattle exceed people by about 5 to 1.\n\n“I’m very disgusted,\" he said. \"If we could only turn back the clock.”\n\nTurning it back even five years would take Karnopp to a time when Wisconsin boasted more than 10,000 farms – most of them small, family operations passed down for generations.\n\nSince then, a drawn-out assault of low milk prices has pummeled America's Dairyland. More than 2,700 Wisconsin dairy farms have gone out of business. Many more face tough decisions this winter as a poor fall harvest has led to soaring prices for cattle feed.\n\nDairy in distress:Americans love soda, fancy water and fake milk. Can the dairy industry keep up?\n\nDairy nonprofit pays leaders millions:Meanwhile, the farmers funding it go out of business\n\nDairy marketing:Dairy farmers, animal activists want to know how $900 million was spent\n\nLarge-scale dairy farming, however, is on a different trajectory. Concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, are growing rapidly and taking over an increasing share of the state’s milk production.\n\nOften referred to as industrial or mega-farms, they can house thousands of cows in massive metal buildings. Cows are milked three times a day in an operation that runs around the clock and tankers full of milk head in and out at all hours. Some newer industrial buildings run the length of a half-dozen football fields; farmers have been known to fly drones inside to get a bird's-eye view of their operations.\n\nThe average size of a Wisconsin dairy farm is about 150 cows. Farms qualify as CAFOs when their milk-producing herds reach 700.\n\nSuch large operations are a relatively new phenomenon in Wisconsin.\n\nThe number of these industrial dairy farms in the state has jumped 55% in less than a decade, to 279 farms, Department of Natural Resources figures show. Farms with 500 or more cows had 41% of the state's cow population in 2017, up from 3% in 1997, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nTheir massive milking operations, popularized in California, shatter the traditional model of Wisconsin farms. With so many cattle, they run the risk of contaminating groundwater and overwhelming lakes, rivers and streams with runoff pollution while making it harder for smaller farms to compete.\n\nThe question is whether Wisconsin is suited for dairy farming on a grand scale and whether dairy farming as we have known it has a future.\n\nThe coming decade could tell us.\n\nManure: beneficial and problematic\n\nManure has been a dependable and potent fertilizer for as long as cows have grazed the land.\n\nBut when it runs off a farm field or seeps into groundwater, manure pollutes. Bacteria and nitrates can poison drinking water, and too much phosphorus from manure and fertilizer can supercharge aquatic plant growth and upend water systems, eventually sucking out oxygen.\n\nDairy cows are veritable waste machines; on average they excrete nearly 17 gallons of manure and urine a day. While cities use sewage treatment systems to remove contaminants, most farmers store a mix of manure, urine and water in lagoons and typically spread it across crop fields in spring and fall.\n\nA single farm with 500 cows produces as much daily waste as South Milwaukee, based on Cornell University research.\n\nA 1,000-cow herd? Think of the 42,000 residents of Fond du Lac.\n\nThe largest Wisconsin CAFOs – those with 6,000 cows – generate as much manure and urine as 252,000 people, on par with Madison.\n\nThey are required to have six months of manure storage capacity and their owners must write plans detailing how and where they’ll spread their waste. Smaller farms are not required to use spreading plans. About 37% of the 9 million acres of Wisconsin cropland are covered by such plans, state figures show.\n\n“No question, CAFOs are more regulated,” said Jim VandenBrook, executive director of the Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation Association from 2012 to 2018 and a former state agriculture department regulator. “But we don’t have a handle on whether those practices are being followed because there is so little oversight on spreading.\"\n\nThe most extensive audit of spreading practices in recent years, done in 2017 by the DNR, found that more than a quarter of CAFO inspections turned up some violations of manure application requirements.\n\nIn August 2018, a lethal combination of manure spreading and heavy rains severely damaged miles of the Sheboygan River near Malone in Fond du Lac County. In just one 575-foot section, DNR employees found 40 dead northern pike – some as long as 30 inches, according to agency records. In a small offshoot of the river, scores of dead fish littered the surface where the last remaining oxygen would have been found.\n\nThe DNR alleges that Redtail Ridge Dairy, a large-scale farm, should not have been spreading manure with a rainstorm in the forecast and that the manure ultimately washed into public waters. The case has been referred to the state Justice Department for civil prosecution.\n\nThe farm’s owners, Joseph and Tyler Thome, said they believe other farms in the watershed also bore responsibility for the contamination, according to DNR documents.\n\nGeorge Miller, 71, owns land bordering the Sheboygan River.\n\n“The farms are getting so big and they have only so much room to put their manure on,\" he said. “We don’t like it, but we don’t feel there is much you can do.”\n\nKewaunee County water woes\n\nTucked under Door County, on the shore of Lake Michigan, Kewaunee County is riddled with pockets of shallow soil and fractured bedrock, called karst, that make groundwater more susceptible to contamination.\n\nIt’s also the home of 16 industrial farms – the third-highest amount among Wisconsin counties.\n\n“This model of massive animal incarceration in vulnerable areas is simply not a good model,” said Lee Luft, a county supervisor and one of a group of residents who pushed regulators for more controls on manure spreading in Kewaunee.\n\nThe county’s rivers that flow to Lake Michigan all fail to meet state water quality standards for phosphorus, which can trigger algae blooms that could imperil aquatic life.\n\nIn 2014, citizens and six environmental groups petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to investigate groundwater contamination, claiming the DNR under Republican Gov. Scott Walker had failed to use its regulatory powers over large farms to protect drinking water.\n\nLast year, after a lengthy public airing, the DNR mandated stricter manure spreading limits – the first in years – for a group of eastern Wisconsin counties, including Kewaunee.\n\n“I think in the karst areas, we just can’t continue to do what we are doing,” Davina Bonness, the county’s land and water director, told residents at a public meeting this fall.\n\nDuring spring and fall when manure hauling is the most active, her office fields three to five complaints a day about spreading.\n\nIn September, she said, county staff went door-to-door in a section of Lincoln Township to warn residents not to drink the water. Runoff from an industrial farm after a rain had been draining into sinkholes – a direct conduit to groundwater.\n\nNumerous studies in the county over the years have found widespread evidence of wells contaminated with bacteria.\n\nOne of the most recent – and the most authoritative, using DNA to trace the source of contamination – tied the problem to both cattle and septic systems, according to researchers from the U.S. Agricultural Research Service.\n\nThe same researchers have come to similar conclusions in Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties in an ongoing study in southwestern Wisconsin. Waste from cattle, hogs and humans all turned up in drinking water.\n\n“I think that we need to accept and acknowledge our share of the problem,” said Don Niles, who milks 3,000 cows in Casco in Kewaunee County, a hotbed in the clash over industrial farms.\n\nNiles is a founder of Peninsula Pride Farms, which was formed in 2016 in Kewaunee and southern Door counties and is one of a growing number of farmer-led groups, including CAFOs, that are promoting conservation strategies in watersheds across the state.\n\n“We have to know and come to grips with the problem,\" he said. \"Clearly, we in agriculture are not the whole cause of water contamination. But we are a significant contributor.”\n\nMexican veterinarians recruited by farms:They're lured by animal scientist jobs, but end up milking and cleaning\n\nDairy workers:The industry would collapse without Latino immigrants, many undocumented\n\nTrading partners:How Canada and Mexico are surviving\n\nSitting at his kitchen table, Arlin Karnopp, the retired truck driver from Kewaunee, looks over his well tests. Dating back to 2015, they are a mixed bag. Sometimes the wells met state standards for drinking water; other times, they contained high levels of coliform bacteria and nitrates.\n\nThis year, for the first time in more than four decades on the land, he and his wife, Mary Lou, have contended with brown water flowing from their faucets.\n\nLast February, above-freezing temperatures sent snow and manure-laden soil into his yard, forming a large pond the color of coffee.\n\nThe industrial farm that spread the manure, Hall’s Calf Ranch, took issue with whether manure was in the water, according to DNR documents.\n\nBut agency records show water samples detected ammonia and phosphorus – both markers for manure. On Oct. 1, the DNR issued the farm a notice that it violated state manure handling requirements.\n\nThe irony: Karnopp’s father once owned the land and Karnopp remembers riding in a tractor doing the same chore.\n\n“But not like they do today,” he said. “There’s just so much of it, they don’t know what to do with it.”\n\nLarge-scale farms dominate milk production\n\nMore than half of the milk cows in the U.S. were on dairies with more than 1,000 cows as of 2017, according to the USDA's agricultural census. They accounted for 58% of the nation’s milk. Two decades earlier, those operations had less than 20% of the milk cows, according to USDA data.\n\nOn average, dairy farms with 2,000 or more cows have 12% lower feed costs and 20% lower operating costs – per hundred pounds of milk produced – than farms with 100 or 200 cows. The big farms also produce more milk per cow.\n\n“The large-scale operations are making a lot of milk, and they’re doing it efficiently at low cost. It does put a lot of pressure on some of the smaller, often multigeneration, farms,\" said Ben Laine, a dairy industry analyst with Rabo AgriFinance in St. Louis.\n\nThe largest concentration of big dairy farms was in California and Idaho, followed by Texas, according to U.S. farm census data.\n\nOne survival tactic used by smaller farms has been switching to organic dairying. At times, these farms have gotten twice the rate for their milk, which offsets the higher feed and other operating costs.\n\nEven in that niche, however, industrial farms quickly changed the business model.\n\nA handful of mega-sized dairies in the Southwest now produce more certified organic milk than all of Wisconsin’s 450 organic dairies combined.\n\nThe market is “oversupplied and competition is fierce,” said Adam Warthesen, government relations director for Organic Valley, of La Farge in Vernon County.\n\nCritics contend industrial farms get around rules calling for, among other things, a minimum amount of grazing time for cows in order for the milk to be certified organic.\n\nIt’s unfair competition, said Tom Schaub, an organic dairy farmer with 60 cows on Jewel View Farms, on the bluffs above the Mississippi River in La Crosse County.\n\nAs a result, many farmers have returned to conventional dairy farming, \"not because they didn’t believe in organics, it’s just the economics of it now,\" said Schaub, who is also president of Westby Cooperative Creamery in Westby. \"They have to be able to make their payments and support their farm.”\n\n'Corporate takeover of dairy production'\n\nAs industrial farms take over more of the milk production, they've been recognized for their ability to leverage their size and modernize dairying so that the U.S. can continue to compete in what has become a cutthroat international marketplace.\n\nOperators are managing around-the-clock operations, often with dozens of employees, including professional staff with college degrees in dairy science.\n\nEvery three weeks, a livestock nutritionist with a doctorate degree stops at Don Niles' farm and tweaks feed regimens to boost milk output. “I don’t get that kind of attention with my diet at home,” Niles said.\n\nStill, industrial farms can fail environmentally, sometimes with disastrous results.\n\nIn 2018, the second-largest dairy farm in Oregon folded, leaving behind a mountain of debt and 30 million gallons of manure and wastewater.\n\nThe 13,000-cow operation south of the Columbia River, near Boardman, opened in early 2017 and at one time had a permit for 30,000 animals. In less than two years it accumulated more than 200 environmental violations and nearly $200,000 in fines, the largest amount ever issued against a CAFO by the Oregon Department of Agriculture.\n\nState regulators sued to shut Lost Valley Farm down, saying it posed a threat to drinking water wells by allowing liquid manure to overflow from storage lagoons. Thousands of cattle and the farm were sold at auction.\n\n“If we have anything to say about it, there won’t be a new dairy operation there at all because we're seeking a moratorium on these new big farms until we can make sure we are protecting our water, our air and our family farmers,” said Amy van Saun, an attorney for the Center for Food Safety, an environmental group in Portland.\n\n\"There was definite mismanagement. But the problem with an operation that big is, when even something small goes wrong, it can have a big impact,\" she said.\n\nMost Wisconsin industrial farms are family-owned, although there are outside investors in some operations. Nationwide, it’s unclear whether corporate dairy interests have gained sufficient market strength yet to drive out the most efficient independent milk producers, said John Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri.\n\nBut dairy farmers cannot ignore the lessons of poultry and pork farms, Ikerd said, where small producers were forced out when food companies established their own operations, with thousands of chickens, turkeys and pigs.\n\n“We are now seeing a corporate takeover of dairy production, which is the last bastion of full-time, independent family farms in animal agriculture,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is the harsh reality now confronting smaller independent dairy farmers.”\n\nSome large retail chains are bottling their own milk and contracting directly with farmers to get it. In June 2018, Walmart opened a 250,000-square-foot processing plant near Fort Wayne, Indiana, acquiring milk from 30 farms in Indiana and Michigan. The plant was built to supply milk to hundreds of Walmart stores in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky.\n\nWalmart’s decision to build the plant was backed by millions of dollars in tax incentives from the State of Indiana and local officials seeking about 300 jobs in return.\n\n“This new plant is a perfect example of the kinds of efficiencies Walmart seeks in our supply chain to benefit our customers,” Tony Airoso, senior vice president of sourcing strategy said in a statement.\n\nBut it left about 100 dairy farmers for Dean Foods Co. without a milk buyer when Dean lost that part of Walmart’s business, according to industry analysts. In November, citing a continued decline in milk sales, Dean filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\n\nDean \"had bigger, industrywide issues with the consumption of milk products. But the loss of the Walmart business was just another thing they didn’t need,” said Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nFarms expand for different reasons\n\nIkerd spent much of his career promoting large expansions.\n\n“I supported this process because I thought it was going to make agriculture more efficient and it would be good for farmers and rural communities,\" he said.\n\nThen he changed his mind.\n\n\"It hasn't fed hungry people, it hasn't produced healthy foods and it hasn't supported independent family farms and rural communities,\" he added.\n\nScaling back the size of U.S. dairy farms isn’t the answer, said Tim Trotter, executive director of Wisconsin’s Dairy Business Association.\n\n“Decisions to expand are often made for reasons that have nothing to do with supply or demand,” Trotter said. “For example, a child coming home and wanting to buy into the farm. How would we accommodate these kinds of expansions?\n\nA veterinarian by training, Niles started his Kewaunee County dairy farm in 2001 with a business partner after a stint with agribusiness giant Monsanto Co. in California’s dairy-rich San Joaquin Valley.\n\n“People ask, ‘Why did they let the CAFOs in?’ ” Niles said. “In people’s minds, they think there was a migration of large farms from California or somewhere that came here and took over our dairy industry.”\n\nInstead, some farmers opted to grow to “keep their kids in the business, not milk cows twice a day for 40 years and take some vacations,” he said.\n\nHis partner was John Pagel, owner of 5,000-cow Pagel’s Ponderosa who died in a private plane crash in February 2018 in Indiana with his son-in-law and the pilot.\n\n“Best friend I ever had,” Niles said.\n\nWhen they first met in 1987, Pagel had 74 cows. Today, his family-run dairy churns out a line of cheeses and owns a farm-to-fork restaurant in downtown Green Bay.\n\nStocks swing on Trump tweets:How do you protect your 401(k) from the volatility?\n\nGrocery stores:These are the best ones in every state\n\nDisheartening message\n\nIn the 1970s, Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz famously told farmers to \"get big or get out\" and plant \"fence row to fence row.\" He championed industrial farming.\n\nThis fall at World Dairy Expo in Madison, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue drew sharp criticism for essentially reprising that message specifically to dairy farmers.\n\n“Now what we see, obviously, is economies of scale having happened in America – big get bigger and small go out,” Perdue said. \"With the capital needs and all the environmental regulations and everything else today, to survive milking 40, 50, 60 or even 100 cows – and that's what we've seen.\"\n\nThe message disheartened some family farmers.\n\n“I went to Madison feeling financially scared and emotionally depressed, but hopeful,\" said Paul Adams, who has a 500-cow organic dairy farm near Eleva in Trempealeau County. \"I came home feeling financially scared, emotionally depressed, unwanted and unneeded.\"\n\nBrittany Olson left her Barron County farm at 3 a.m. to make it to Madison for the speech.\n\n“To go through the effort to see the USDA secretary, only for him to say that small farms like ours likely have no future, made me feel like little more than a peasant in a system of modern-day feudalism,” Olson said.\n\nThe mindset that’s been pushed on farmers – to continually grow – is one reason for the overproduction that’s suppressed milk prices and forced people out of business, said Darin Von Ruden, a dairy farmer from Westby in Vernon County and president of Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n\n“We need to look at something that will benefit all of rural America, not just corporate rural America,” he said.\n\nNo 'one-size-fits-all way to farm'\n\nPerdue's message in part reflected the growing political voice that owners of larger farms have cultivated.\n\nOn Nov. 5, the Wisconsin Senate effectively fired Brad Pfaff, the agriculture secretary under Democratic Gov. Tony Evers – a move with no precedent in at least the last half-century. Although Pfaff was personally popular with many farm groups, the agriculture department had proposed rules that could have placed limits on farm expansions.\n\nThe Wisconsin Farmers Union backed the changes.\n\n“We felt very strongly that these modifications were long overdue after the tremendous changes we’ve seen in the agricultural industry and lots of concerns that have been expressed by people in rural communities,” said Kara O’Connor, the government relations director for the Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n\n“We have farms in Wisconsin now that are larger than anyone had ever contemplated in 2006 when this rule was first passed,” she said.\n\nBut representatives of CAFOs fiercely opposed the changes.\n\nCynthia Leitner, president of Wisconsin Dairy Alliance, said it's not fair to demonize big farms. The organization was formed in 2018 to represent CAFOs.\n\n\"There is no one-way, one-size-fits-all way to farm,\" she said.\n\nLeitner acknowledged that a glut of milk in the last five years has been brutal on dairy farmers.\n\nBut at the same time, Wisconsin cheese plants have brought in milk from other states because it was cheaper, even with transportation costs. Those plants could be looking for new suppliers when a $500 million processing facility under construction in St. Johns, Michigan, comes on line in late 2020. It is expected to siphon off much of the milk that has been coming to Wisconsin.\n\n\"The double-edge sword in this case is what happens if we cannot produce enough milk\" to make up for the loss, Leitner said. Her fear is that those Wisconsin processors will expand elsewhere.\n\n\"The fight should not be about big and small (farms). It should be about keeping Wisconsin dairy for future generations,\" she said.\n\nOrganic dairy farmer and Republican state Rep. Travis Tranel of Cuba City said he understands why CAFOs draw different reactions.\n\n\"At the end of the day, they can put a product on the shelf that is just as safe, just as nutritiously sound as anybody, if not more so, at a cheaper price,\" Tranel said.\n\nHe defended industrial farms' overall environmental track record but acknowledged there are unintended economic consequences. As small farms disappear, and local agribusinesses are consolidated, it's \"not good for our rural schools, it's not good for our rural churches, it's not good for our rural communities.\"\n\n'No one should have to go through what we went through'\n\nMany of those who live near industrial farms would argue the consequences go far beyond local spending.\n\nIn Juneau County, a lawsuit filed in November 2018 alleges that Central Sands Dairy, an industrial farm that milks more than 4,100 cows, and Wysocki Produce Farm Inc., a vegetable grower, knew that monitored wells showed high nitrate levels dating back to 2008 but failed to tell neighbors or state authorities.\n\nThe case is still being litigated and involves more than 300 plaintiffs – including a Nekoosa mother who lost a baby at 23 weeks to a severe birth defect.\n\nTim Huffcutt, a spokesman for Central Sands, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He noted, however, that a coalition of three farms, including Central Sands, has agreed to provide bottled water and, as of mid-November, had coordinated the installation of 48 water purification systems to homes with contaminated wells.\n\nNitrate has been associated with a condition called blue baby syndrome, which reduces the amount of oxygen in a baby’s blood.\n\n“They don’t turn blue, but grayish purple,” toxicologist Sarah Yang of the state Department of Health Services told a group of citizens this fall in Amherst at a meeting about high nitrate levels in Portage County.\n\nAccording to Yang, infants, pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, are at the most risk from high nitrates. Some studies suggest it may cause birth defects, thyroid problems and colon cancer.\n\nThe EPA conducted its own groundwater investigation in a 30-square-mile area of Juneau County that included Central Sands in late April and early May 2018. It found that of 200 samples, 130 had nitrate levels higher than the drinking water standard. All were in locations where groundwater flowed from the direction of farm fields. Wisconsin’s nitrate standard in drinking water is 10 parts per million.\n\nA month later, officials in Juneau and Wood counties found that 42% of 104 residential wells exceeded the nitrate drinking water standard.\n\nCelina Stewart, one of the litigants in the lawsuit, has blogged about the anguish of losing a baby. She also has urged the DNR not to renew a five-year permit for Central Sands – something it has not yet done.\n\nIn her comments to the agency, Stewart said her well tests showed nitrate levels ranging from 15 parts per million to more than 40 parts per million and that she was only aware of the lower reading while pregnant.\n\n“No one should have to go through what we went through because of water,\" Stewart wrote. \"We should be able to go to our faucet and turn it on and safely drink water from our well and not worry about getting sick or dying.\"\n\nContributing: Andrew Mollica", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/13/mlk-robot-unemployment-python-bowl-news-around-states/40990839/", "title": "MLK, robot unemployment: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Jefferson County is preserving what’s left of the lockup where officials say Martin Luther King Jr. served his final time behind bars just months before his assassination. County commissioners unanimously approved a resolution Thursday to memorialize and preserve an area on the seventh floor of the county courthouse that used to be a jail. Much of the floor is now used for storage and mechanical equipment. Sheriff Mark Pettway said the civil rights leader was held on the floor in 1967, when he served three days for contempt after losing an appeal on his conviction for demonstrating without a permit years earlier. A small area including two pale-green cells, an isolation chamber, a shower and mechanical equipment are all that remain from the old jail. The county doesn’t know whether King was held in that exact section or another section that has since been removed.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A judge ruled Friday that an effort to recall Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy may proceed, a decision that is expected to be appealed. The decision by Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth in Anchorage followed arguments in the case Friday and came two months after Gail Fenumiai, director of the state Division of Elections, rejected a bid to advance the recall effort. Fenumiai said her decision was based on an opinion from Attorney General Kevin Clarkson that found the reasons listed for recall were “factually and legally deficient.” The Recall Dunleavy group has argued that Clarkson’s analysis was overreaching and that the recall effort should have been allowed to move to a second, signature-gathering phase. Among its claims, the group said Dunleavy violated the law by not appointing a judge within a required time frame, misused state funds for partisan online ads and mailers, and improperly used his veto authority to “attack the judiciary.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Tonto National Forest officials say workers plan to begin installing 4 miles of steel fencing along and near the lower Salt River east of metro Phoenix to prevent wild horses from crossing the Bush Highway and to keep livestock from mingling with the horse herd. Forest officials say the fence work starting Monday is the second phase of a project that saw workers complete installation Friday of 10 miles of barbed wire fencing. That work began in November. Forest Service and state Department of Agriculture officials said previous fences didn’t prevent horses from getting onto the highway, resulting in the deaths of 20 or more horses annually. The Forest Service said the project includes installing 35 gates at designated trails and historically used access points.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Friday said he won’t stay his order reinstating a police officer fired for fatally shooting a black motorist. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox denied the city of Little Rock’s request to stay his order regarding Officer Charles Starks, who was fired over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February. Starks and another officer were attempting a motor vehicle stop at the time. Police commanders fired Starks in May, saying he violated department policy. Fox had previously upheld a city commission’s ruling that Starks violated policy prohibiting officers from voluntarily placing themselves in front of an oncoming vehicle “where deadly force is the probable outcome.” But the judge said a 30-day suspension and reduction to an entry-level officer salary are more appropriate sanctions, and he ordered the city to comply by Jan. 16.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: It was a bad week for robots in the Bay Area. A Silicon Valley company that used robots to make its pizzas closed last week, and three coffee shops in downtown San Francisco that used robots as baristas also shuttered.

The Mountain View startup, which first began delivering pizzas in 2016, said it intends to focus on its food packaging and delivery systems, the Mercury News in San Jose reports. In San Francisco, Cafe X closed three of its coffee shops in the financial district.

The interchange is being redesigned as part of an interstate-widening project. The sculpture will be placed in storage “until a new location can be selected,” according to a city news release. Equinox was created by three Loveland residents – figurative sculptor Jack Kreutzer, structural engineer and artist Doug Rutledge, and artist and philanthropist Doug Erion – and was inspired by the art of Arapaho and Cheyenne Plains Indians. Loveland says it’s the biggest public art project in city history. It cost $225,000.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An agreement reached Friday in a long-running school desegregation case in the capital city will put the district on a path to ending 30 years of litigation, state officials said. The settlement includes new measures to reach diversity goals and allows for judicial oversight to end once the effort is shown to produce opportunities in diverse school settings for all Hartford families. The Sheff v. O’Neill case began in 1989 with a lawsuit challenging racial and economic segregation and inequalities between Hartford schools and suburban schools against then-Gov. William O’Neill. The plaintiffs were black, Latino and white families from Hartford. The case was named after Milo Sheff, one of the main plaintiffs, and his mother, Elizabeth Horton Sheff. In 1996, the state Supreme Court ruled the extreme racial isolation of Hartford students violated the state Constitution.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Seaside Jewish Community celebrated a milestone 23 years in the making this month, the Delaware State News reports. The groundbreaking group began meeting in 1997 when strangers responded to an advertisement in the Cape Gazette newspaper requesting fellowship for a Passover Seder feast to celebrate the beginning of the holiday with fellow Jewish community members. Nearly 100 members responded. By 2006, Seaside Jewish Community had grown to 200 members, prompting them to purchase their current facility after renting it for several years. Fourteen years later, the community had another need based on growth – expansion. They are now about 600 members strong and need more space so their community can continue to thrive. The need for an expansion was demonstrated as community members who attended the Jan. 5 groundbreaking had to sit in an overflow room where the ceremony was streamed live online because the sanctuary was full.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A group in D.C. is extending the fight to decriminalize drugs beyond cannabis to magic mushrooms, WUSA-TV reports. Spokesperson Melissa Lavasani says she suffered with postpartum depression and found relief when she gave the psychedelic substance a try after listening to a Joe Rogan podcast on which mycologist Paul Stamets discussed the benefits and uses of psilocybin mushrooms. She says it made all the difference for her, but the fear didn’t leave her – she was, after all, still using an illegal Schedule I substance. In an effort to alleviate those fears and help others struggling with similar situations, she joined the group Decriminalize Nature DC to bring the fight to politics. The group has submitted a ballot initiative to the D.C. Board of Elections to decide whether it can move forward. A hearing will be held Feb. 12.\n\nFlorida\n\nSunrise: Miami’s upcoming Super Bowl will mean death for dozens of invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades – and wildlife officials say that’s a good thing. The game’s organizing committee is working with the state to promote the Python Bowl, a 10-day contest that began Friday that will give out all-terrain vehicles and cash to the hunters who kill the most and biggest of these non-native snakes. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations. Kristen Sommers, a wildlife impact manager for the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, says officials understand the number of pythons caught during the contest won’t even make a dent in the population, which might exceed 100,000. But the goal is to raise the public’s awareness of the problem.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: A project to repair erosion to the state’s largest public beach is underway east of Savannah. Crews have been pumping sand onto the beach at Tybee Island since early December. Tybee Island City Manager Shawn Gillen told WTOC-TV work is about a week behind schedule, but crews should be done pumping new sand onto the beach around Jan. 20. The state and federal governments are spending $13.8 million to renourish Tybee Island’s beach. The project has been in the works since hurricanes Mathew and Irma pushed damaging storm surge onto the Georgia coast in 2016 and 2017. The repair work includes building a new stretch of dune to help protect beachfront structures from future surge, as well as rebuilding several crossover walkways onto the beach that suffered storm damage.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Air National Guard will start selecting candidates in April for one of four space control squadrons in the country in the Air National Guard, military officials said. The state Air Guard would select 88 military members for the 293rd Space Control Squad based at the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Operations by the new squadron are classified, but its main objective is to protect and defend the nation’s satellite communication systems, Hawaii Air Guard commander Brig. Gen. Ryan Okahara says. The announcement comes after President Donald Trump signed the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act in December funding the military and creating the Space Force, the first new armed service since 1947.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A Clean Water Act lawsuit filed by the Nez Perce Tribe that seeks to force a Canadian gold mining company to acquire permits for pollution discharged from its central Idaho facility will be allowed to continue, a federal judge decided. Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Boise forwarded the lawsuit first filed by the tribe in August against Midas Gold Corp. and its subsidiary, Midas Gold Idaho, The Lewiston Tribune reports. “Midas Gold’s motion to stay the Tribe’s litigation was simply a delay tactic,” Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee chairman Shannon F. Wheeler said. The company is discharging water polluted with arsenic, cyanide, mercury and other heavy metals into streams of the Salmon River, home to several species of fish protected by the Endangered Species Act, Nez Perce Tribal leaders say. The streams also run through traditional territory where tribal members fish, tribe officials say.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: DNA tests to determine if a coyote captured on the city’s North Side is the same animal that attacked a 6-year-old boy will take weeks to complete, a city animal control official said Friday. Kelley Gandurski, executive director of Chicago Animal Care and Control, says the coyote will eventually be relocated outside the city. The agency’s Jenny Schlueter says another coyote was spotted in the same area Thursday night but eluded capture. Animal control officers have continued to search for coyotes in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and downtown. Experts say the majority of cases in which people suspect coyotes turn out to have been attacks by dogs, but Chicago officials remain confident the animal that attacked the boy Wednesday was a coyote. If so, it would be the first confirmed coyote attack on a human in Illinois, according to a wildlife biologist with the Urban Coyote Research Project.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Whitley: A northern Indiana dam that was the scene of a deadly 2017 kayaking accident has been demolished, making the region’s Eel River safer for recreation and removing a barrier to migrating fish. A crew that began demolishing the Collamer Dam on Wednesday finished removing the last of the concrete structure Thursday, said Jerry Sweeten, a retired Manchester University biology professor. The dam’s removal means the Eel River now includes about 95 miles of free-flowing open waterway that will promote both safer recreation and the river’s ecological health, Sweeten said. “This is a remarkable thing, to open up this much of the river,” he told The Journal Gazette. There’s now no barrier to migrating fish, including small-mouth bass and several species of suckers, including the great red horse sucker, which is an endangered species in Indiana, Sweeten said. The river has 52 fish species, 43 of which migrate upstream, he said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State Supreme Court Acting Chief Justice David Wiggins announced Friday that he’s retiring. Wiggins, 69, said he will retire March 13. He was appointed to the court by Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack in 2003. He was named acting chief justice in November after the unexpected death of Chief Justice Mark Cady, who had named Wiggins as his replacement if he were to be unable to act. Wiggins’ departure will give Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds an opportunity to replace one of the two remaining Democratic appointees on the seven-member court. She just received the names of three nominees Thursday to fill Cady’s vacant seat. Wiggins could have served until 2023, when he turns 72, the mandatory retirement age for state judges in Iowa. His current term is to expire in December.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The state’s farmers have seeded an estimated 6.9 million acres into winter wheat, the National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Friday. The state’s winter wheat acreage is equal to the area planted a year earlier, the agency said. Winter wheat is planted in the fall for harvest the following year. Kansas is the nation’s biggest producer. Separately, the agency also reported that about 394 million bushels of wheat are now stored in the state, down 13% from the amount in storage at this time a year ago.\n\nKentucky\n\nCovington: A homeless shelter in northern Kentucky is moving to a bigger facility and will offer more services, officials said. The Northern Kentucky Emergency Shelter in Covington will move to a building on West 13th Street later this year that includes space for a medical clinic, lockers and laundry services. The building can house up to 55 more people in need, says Kim Webb, executive director of the Emergency Shelter of Northern Kentucky. The shelter worked with Kenton County officials and St. Elizabeth Healthcare, which bought the building, to provide services for the homeless in the region. More than 1,500 people experienced homelessness in Boone, Kenton and Cambell counties between July 2018 and June 2019, according to a report from the Northern Kentucky Homelessness Working Group.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Southern University at New Orleans will suspend all of its athletics programs at the end of the academic year, trying to save money and dig itself out of years of financial problems. The Southern University Board of Supervisors approved the move Friday without objection, at the request of SUNO Interim Chancellor James Ammons. “This is one of the most difficult decisions I’ve made as an administrator,” Ammons said. He said while he understands the importance of athletics programs to attracting students and drawing alumni support, the campus must focus on protecting its academic programs rather than continuing to steer money to sports. The historically black public university is on probation by its accrediting agency amid continuing financial woes that have stretched over years as enrollment has fallen.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: A sign welcoming people crossing the bridge into this coastal town has been stolen, police said. In a Facebook post Friday, police said the “Welcome to Kennebunkport” sign posted off the side of the Lanigan Bridge is missing, though it was unclear when it was removed. The bridge is a popular spot for visitors and tourists to take photos, often with the sign in the background, CentralMaine.com reports. The sign, which shows some of town’s skyline, is made of copper and aluminum, but police don’t think it was stolen for scrap. “I believe it’s a trophy sitting in somebody’s living room,” Kennebunkport Police Deputy Chief Kurt Moses told WGME-TV, “and we just want to get the word out that we would like our sign back.” It must have taken some effort to dismantle the sign, as it was secured with several bolts on a railing over the river, the chief said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: This coastal community has playfully invited Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan to vacation there after the couple said they would step back from royal duties. The city tweeted Wednesday that the couple is “welcome to come for a visit any time!” and that “our castles may not be as grand as those back home,” but it’s “a great place for any family looking to take a break from it all.” City officials weren’t available to comment on whether the couple responded to the offer. Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan say they intend to become “financially independent” and to “balance” their time between the U.K. and North America.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is warning international students that federal immigration officials may visit their work sites to verify that their employment is directly related to their studies. School officials sent a memo to faculty Thursday saying the Department of Homeland Security has been making site visits to employers of foreign students in science, technology, engineering and math fields. The school is notifying students separately and telling them what to expect from the visits. MIT spokeswoman Kimberly Allen said the memo was not prompted by any visit to the institute. Immigration officials announced last year that they would begin workplace visits for some students in the federal Optional Practical Training program, which allows those with student visas to take temporary jobs related to their studies. Students in STEM fields can get their visas extended by two years, while others can get one-year extensions.\n\nMichigan\n\nMadison Heights: An industrial site in suburban Detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal Superfund cleanup program, state officials said Friday. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said an evaluation of the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site will be completed this spring. It will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The chrome plating company in Madison Heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minneapolis VA Health Care Center has been cited for failures in connection with the 2018 suicide of a veteran in its care. It’s the second time in 16 months that a federal watchdog has cited the medical center after a suicide. In a report last week, the VA Office of Inspector General found the Minnesota veteran said he wanted to die after he was admitted in spring 2018. A nurse also overheard him telling someone on the telephone that he would die at the hospital. Hours after that call, he attempted suicide and couldn’t be revived. The inspector general found that staff members failed to share the man’s suicidal thoughts with others on the treatment team, which might have prevented his death, the Star Tribune reports. His death came weeks after another veteran killed himself in the center’s parking lot, less than 24 hours after he was discharged from the mental health unit.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant is leaving office Tuesday after serving his limit of two terms. The Republican says he believes the state’s economy is stronger, vulnerable children are better protected, and students are showing stronger academic performance. He also says a recent outburst of violence in Mississippi prisons is not something he would have wanted as part of his legacy. Five inmates were killed, an undisclosed number were injured, and facilities at the State Penitentiary at Parchman were so damaged that the state set an emergency contract to move 375 inmates to a private prison. Bryant’s predecessor, fellow GOP Gov. Haley Barbour, pardoned nearly 200 people as he finished his second term in 2012. People protesting prison conditions last week called on Bryant to release some nonviolent inmates to ease prison crowding, but the onetime deputy sheriff says he will not issue any pardons or commute any sentences and does not think of inmates as victims.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Getting legal representation will take longer for hundreds of criminal defendants in the state’s largest county now that its judicial circuit has instituted a waiting list that supporters say is the only way to reduce the massive caseloads its overworked public defenders have been handling. St. Louis County’s waiting list went into effect Jan. 2 following an order by the county’s presiding judge, Gloria Reno. Her review last fall found that public defenders – lawyers who are assigned to defendants who can’t afford private attorneys – were juggling far more cases than they could logically handle. The list was requested by the St. Louis County public defender office and had the support of Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, who in a November court filing called it “the least-bad alternative available.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: NorthWestern Energy has donated $15,000 to efforts to memorialize Judy Martz, who served as the state’s first female governor and lieutenant governor. The donation for a statue was announced last week by Lisa Perry, NorthWestern Energy’s community relations manager for the Billings division, at the Montana Chamber of Commerce’s 20th annual Business Days at the Capitol luncheon. Martz, 74, died in Butte in Oct. 30, 2017, after a battle with pancreatic cancer. In 2019, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 275, by Sen. Al Olszewski, R-Kalispell. It gives a committee five years to raise funds to put a museum-quality statue or bust in honor of the Republican governor on the Capitol grounds. The committee must raise funds, and the statue design must get approval from the Capitol Grounds Advisory Committee and the Montana Historical Society.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Requests for early ballots can be submitted starting this week, the Nebraska Secretary of State’s office reports. The office said in a news release that the first day to submit applications for an early ballot at county offices is Monday. Counties receiving early voting requests will keep a list of the requests, Secretary of State Bob Evnen said. Those requests will be among the first ballots mailed staring April 6, he said. Nebraska’s primary election this year is May 12. Some counties maintain a permanent early voting list, which allows counties to reach out to voters who have indicated an ongoing preference to vote by mail. Each voter on the list will receive a postcard, which the voter can return indicating he or she would like to receive a ballot by mail.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Two human skulls and two human jawbones were discovered in archival storage boxes by a volunteer, prompting an investigation, Clark County Museum officials say. The 50-year-old museum grew from a collection of items from the Las Vegas Valley’s first female mortician, Anna Roberts Parks, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. This was the first time human remains were found in Parks’ collection, museum registrar Cynthia Sanford says. “She had lots of animal bones and things along those lines, but we’ve never found human remains before,” Sanford says. “She was a mortician, so it seems like that would be kind of a weird line to cross.” A volunteer was going through archival boxes Dec. 5 when the four bones were found, Sanford says. The bones were brought to the Clark County coroner’s office for investigation, officials say.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: Organizers of annual hand-crafted ice castle sculptures in the state opened the popular tourist attraction over the weekend as planned, despite warmer weather. The frozen attraction is located in six places across North America, including in North Woodstock. The castles include LED-lit sculptures, frozen thrones, ice-carved tunnels, slides and fountains. The winter wonderland is built from scratch when the cold conditions allow the ice to sprout from the barren ground. Warming weather is always a threat for the Ice Castles. In years past, some locations occasionally have had to cut their seasons short due to warmer winters. The attraction, which moved last year from neighboring Lincoln, draws tens of thousands of visitors each season.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Hundreds of protesters turned out Saturday as part of an effort to save one of Liberty State Park’s waterfront vistas from a billionaire developer bent on expanding a prestigious golf club into the natural preserve. Chants of “Whose park? Our park” reverberated along the edge of the state park overlooking the Statue of Liberty as demonstrators gathered to fight a proposed three-hole expansion of the exclusive Liberty National Golf Club at Caven Point – a protected peninsula of the adjacent state park in Jersey City – and back a bill before the Legislature that would ban further development in the area. The peninsula is a prime habitat for migrating birds and has marshland and a sandy beach, where fish, crabs, seahorses and other marine life are found in local waters.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A nonpartisan group says targeted mailings that encourage voter registration are going out to 1 in 8 state residents. The nonprofit, Washington-based Voter Participation Center says it will attempt to reach more than 248,000 people in New Mexico by mail in January as part of a new national campaign to reach populations that are statistically underrepresented in elections. The effort seeks to narrow the gap between those eligible to vote and those who are registered to vote – a gap that is especially pronounced among Latinos, says center founder and president Page Gardner. New Mexico has the highest percentage of Latino residents of any state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, estimated at well above 40% of the population. Young adults and single, unmarried women are another focus of the drive intended to increase overall voting.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city will install 100 new security cameras in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in an effort to prevent anti-Semitic attacks, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday. Fear has gripped the city’s Orthodox Jewish community since the the fatal Dec. 10 attack at a kosher grocery store across the Hudson River in Jersey City and the Dec. 29 stabbings at a Hanukkah celebration in suburban Monsey. The new cameras will be installed in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Crown Heights and Borough Park, where Hasidic Jewish residents have reported attacks ranging from someone pulling off a wig or hat to more violent assaults. “An attack on the Jewish community is an attack on all New Yorkers,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. Police officials say anti-Semitic crimes in New York City jumped 21% in 2019 compared with 2018.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The FBI is asking for the public’s help in catching a so-called bad wig bandit who’s been robbing banks in the state. The FBI said in a statement Thursday that the suspect wore a different wig during each heist in the Charlotte area. One wig was blonde. Another was black. The third was red. The FBI says he robbed a BB&T in Huntersville on Dec. 13. He then robbed two banks Jan. 7. The first was a New Horizon Bank in Belmont. The second was a Wells Fargo in Gastonia.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A man who allegedly told a neighbor he had a bomb and indicated he would harm anyone who tried to enter his condominium died after he was shot by tactical officers in an exchange of gunfire, police said. Authorities identified the man Friday as Cody Carnes, 30, of Bismarck. Officers responded to the residence after getting a call from a neighbor about 10 p.m. Thursday. The neighbor reported noisy sawing and hammering coming from Carnes’ residence and said Carnes stated that he had a bomb. Two other calls were made earlier in the evening, including one from a caller who said Carnes stated he had weapons and would use them if anyone tried to enter his home. Another call came from a delivery employee who said Carnes displayed a handgun and said he had several more firearms. West Dakota SWAT officers tried to get the man to surrender, but he refused.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: There’s limited evidence that expanding the electronic monitoring of inmates in the state would reduce the rates at which ex-offenders commit new crimes or that it would enhance public safety, according to a new report. In addition, creating a system that would allow real-time monitoring of inmates in the hopes of placing them near crimes would still do nothing to prevent such crimes from happening, though it could help aid investigators and parole officers, according to the report released last week. Such a system is known as “crime scene correlation technology.” “The daily operations required for such a system are exceedingly complex and would require careful planning and consistent oversight,” according to the report, which was given to a state task force looking at all aspects of supervising inmates upon release. “Additionally, the costs associated with developing and operating such an initiative would be substantial and recurring.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A woman has pleaded guilty to spray-painting racist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic graffiti on Democratic Party offices and other properties in central Oklahoma in 2019. Allison Christine Johnson, 46, of Norman, pleaded guilty Thursday to a felony charge of malicious injury to property, three misdemeanor counts of malicious injury to property, and one misdemeanor count of malicious intimidation or harassment as part of a plea deal. “My actions do not reflect how I really feel,” Johnson told District Judge Michael Tupperman. “It was out of character.” In exchange for her plea, the charges will be dismissed if Johnson completes a mental health program. The graffiti included racial slurs and swatiskas outside the state Democratic Party headquarters in Oklahoma City and a Chickasaw Nation office. Similar graffiti was found at the Cleveland County Democratic Party headquarters and an elementary school in Norman.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Federal authorities suggested the environmental impact of a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal and pipeline in southern Oregon would be minimal, saying the contentious project wouldn’t jeopardize protected species or adversely change their critical habitat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said its review shows that the effects of the proposed Jordan Cove liquefied natural gas terminal and a 230-mile feeder pipeline along Coos Bay would be short-term or on a small scale, dispersed broadly across 250 miles. The biological study done by NOAA scientists reviewed 17 species listed under the Endangered Species Act and their critical habitats, including whales, sea turtles, salmon and other fish species. In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s staff in its final environmental analysis concluded that the contentious project would likely have an adverse affect on wildlife, including 18 federally listed or proposed threatened and endangered species.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Manchester Township: Shiloh Water Authority has started the process to remove fluoride from the township’s water supply. Shiloh is one of the last water companies in York County to add fluoride. According to a database by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the others are Hanover Municipal Water Works, Red Lion Municipal Authority and the West Manheim branch of the York Water Company. Adams County is one of 19 counties in Pennsylvania that does not have a supplier that adds fluoride or purchases fluoridated water. Franklin has three authorities, and Lebanon has two that add fluoride to their community’s water. Chairman James Bentzel says Shiloh started to add fluoride to the water in the mid-1960s. In the past few years, some of its customers requested that the company stop.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A fund has been created to accept donations to support public education in the state. Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green announced Friday that the nonprofit Rhode Island Foundation established the Fund for Rhode Island Public Education to accept donations from individuals, corporations and foundations interested in improving public education statewide. The Rhode Island Foundation will manage and distribute the money according to the education department’s priorities and the donor’s intent. Donors could invest professional learning opportunities for educators, advanced coursework for students and upgrades to school facilities, for example, the department said. The fund launched with a $20,000 commitment from the Rhode Island Commodores, a nonprofit that promotes economic development.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nEastover: Officials at McEntire Joint National Guard Base are warning neighbors that nighttime training scheduled for the next several days may create a lot of noise. The training will run Monday through Thursday at the air base east of Columbia. The South Carolina Air National Guard’s 169th Fighter Wing is hosting jets from the 4th Fighter Wing stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina for the exercise, 169th Fighter Wing commander Col. Akshai Gandhi said. The base in Richland County has a large airfield and provides realistic training for a number of military units, Gandhi said in a statement. Base officials will do everything they can to minimize noise from the nighttime training and appreciate the understanding of their neighbors, Gandhi said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge has ruled that a new state law that requires ballot petition circulators to register and be included in a directory is unconstitutional. The organization SD Voice, a grassroots ballot question committee, filed the lawsuit in federal court. There was a one-day trial in Aberdeen last month. The law required petition circulators to apply with the secretary of state for an identification number, provide personal information and be included in a directory. Attorneys for the state say the law is aimed at preventing fraud. In a written ruling Thursday, Judge Charles Kornmann declared the measure a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new pilot program starts this month with the goal of helping youth in Memphis and Shelby County lead healthier lives. The Craigmont High School Healthy Habits Program is a new curriculum designed to educate ninth graders participating in the school’s Lifetime Wellness classes about the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. The comprehensive program will present a three-component approach that details the 8-5-2-1-0 (8 hours or more of sleep, 5 fruits and vegetables, 2 hours or less of screen time, 1 hour or more of physical activity, and 0 sugary drinks every day) recipe that incorporates proper nutrition and adequate exercise into daily activities. Students in the program will also participate in FitnessGram, an evidence-based fitness evaluation program.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Shriners Hospital for Children in the Texas Medical Center will close in 2021 to consolidate area care at its larger Galveston hospital. The decision, made last fall, was driven by a desire to build one premier hospital, according to the Houston Chronicle. It was not based on financial concerns. Though the closure will end Shriners’ 100-year presence in Houston, it will mean all four specialty care departments – acute burns, orthopedic conditions, spinal injuries, and cleft lip and palate abnormalities – will be provided in Galveston. “This will make more efficient use of resources and enable us to provide our patients who need more than one type of care to receive it all in one place,” said Mel Bower, director of marketing at the Shriners national offices in Tampa. “It makes more strategic sense.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Rare salt formations have been documented for the first time on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, and they could yield insights about salt structures found on Mars before they disappear for good. They’re showing up now in part because water levels at the largest natural lake west of the Mississippi have been lowered by drought and water diversion, exposing more shoreline. That means there are more places where water can bubble up to the surface from warm, sulfate-rich springs. When it hits the cold air, a mineral called Glauber’s salt, or mirabilite, separates out. The tiny crystals have built up over the past several months, eventually creating flat terraces stacked atop one another like the travertine rimstone and dam terraces at Yellowstone’s Mammoth Hot Springs. From above, though, the cascading terraces are like an enormous piece of lace laid over the sandy earth. There are now four mounds at the Great Salt Lake beach, growing up to 3 feet tall.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The governor has reaffirmed the state’s commitment to accepting refugees from across the world and says he would like to return the number of people arriving in the state to the levels before President Donald Trump took office. In a letter to the president and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said the state has welcomed almost 8,000 refugees since 1989, and before Trump took office, it was accepting about 325 to 350 a year. In fiscal 2019, Vermont took in 115 refugees, said Amila Merdzanovic, of the Vermont office of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. “Vermont’s refugee communities have made countless contributions to our state,” said Scott’s letter to the president. “Refugees help ensure a healthy sized and diverse student population. They help employers fill open positions, contributing to the community and local economy, and pay federal, state and local taxes.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers voted Friday to ban firearms at the state Capitol, the first in what’s expected to be many contentious gun votes in coming weeks. Newly empowered Democrats who made up a majority of a special rules committee voted to ban guns at the Capitol and a legislative office building despite bitter protests from Republicans, saying the move was needed to protect public safety. “Our focus here is to keep everybody safe,” said House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn. “These are policies and rules that should have passed a long, long time ago.” Public officials have expressed concerns about planned Jan. 20 rallies that are set to draw huge crowds of pro-gun and gun-control advocates. Gun advocates from around Virginia and even out of state have pledged to turn out in force to highlight their resistance to proposed gun-control measures.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Wolf advocates seeking to halt the state Department Fish and Wildlife from shooting wolves to protect livestock have suffered another legal setback. The Capital Press reports King County Superior Court Judge John McHale on Friday dismissed claims that Fish and Wildlife’s lethal-control policy violates the State Environmental Policy Act. McHale’s ruling mirrored one in November by a Thurston County judge presiding over a similar lawsuit. Fish and Wildlife wolf policy lead Donny Martorello said that the department prefers to develop wolf policy outside courtrooms and that this decision lets it continue to do that. Jonathon Bashford, an attorney for the wolf advocates who brought the lawsuit, said they are reviewing the ruling and exploring their options.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The governor says a technology company has agreed to open a research facility in the state to look into using coal to make carbon-based products. Gov. Jim Justice gave additional details about the agreement with Ramaco Carbon on Thursday after mentioning the research center in his State of the State speech. “We absolutely need to continue doing all we can to harness the power of coal in every way possible, and having this facility to test new ways to convert this dynamic resource is a great opportunity for all,” the Republican governor said. Ramaco Carbon has received more than $5 million in federal grants to support its research, Justice said in a news release. One of the projects the company is working on revolves around using coal as a precursor to manufacture carbon fiber for the automotive industry.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: High winds, towering waves and flooding have caused millions of dollars in damage to Port Milwaukee on Lake Michigan, the port’s director said Sunday. Wild weather Saturday forced the port to prohibit public access to Jones Island and caused flooding on all major roadways at the port. Winds gusted up to 50 mph, and waves reached 6 to 8 feet high. Port Director Adam Schlicht called it “an unprecedented event at Port Milwaukee” and said the port’s international docks, which are closed for the season, sustained “significant damage.” Floodwaters were receding Sunday, he said. The inner harbor is expected to reopen early Monday. The wind and water stripped off dock wall material and pushed it inland, and frozen floodwaters covered railroad tracks in a foot of ice, Schlicht said. Water levels on the Great Lakes have been at or near all-time highs for much of the past year, the City of Milwaukee said.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An annual elk hunt in Grand Teton National Park doesn’t draw in and concentrate large numbers of grizzly bears, scientists have concluded. The November to December hunt probably takes place too late in the year for grizzly bears to seek out animal remains that hunters leave behind, according to researchers with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Many grizzly bears have denned up for winter hibernation by the time a significant number of elk remains have accumulated, study team leader Frank van Manen wrote recently in the academic journal Ursus. The park holds the hunt to control elk numbers. Most national parks don’t allow hunting, but the law establishing Grand Teton decades ago provides for the hunt.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/04/chinese-laundry-phone-booth-advice-balloon-fiesta-news-around-states/119016838/", "title": "Chinese laundry, phone booth advice: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Amid a national debate over the use of pandemic relief funds, state lawmakers swiftly approved a plan Friday to tap $400 million from the American Rescue Plan to help build two supersize prisons, brushing off criticism from congressional Democrats that the money was not intended for such projects. The Legislature gave final approval to the $1.3 billion prison construction plan and to a separate bill to steer $400 million of the state’s $2.1 billion from the rescue funds to pay for it. With legislative leaders standing behind her, Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law soon afterward. The Republican called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. “This is a pivotal moment for the trajectory of our state’s criminal justice system,” Ivey said. Alabama’s plan to use almost 20% of its American Rescue Plan funds for prison construction drew criticism from Democrats including U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, who argued that was not the intent of the relief program. But state Republicans argued that the expenditure addresses a public safety need and is allowed under a provision to replace lost revenue and shore up state services.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state on Saturday activated emergency crisis protocols that allow 20 medical facilities to ration care if needed as Alaska recorded the nation’s worst COVID-19 diagnosis rates in recent days, straining the state’s limited health care system. The declaration covers three facilities that had already announced emergency protocols, including the state’s largest hospital, Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage. The state’s declaration also includes the other two hospitals in Anchorage and facilities across the huge but sparsely populated state. “Today’s action recognizes that Alaska has an interconnected and interdependent health care system, requiring the need for activation of the state’s decision-making framework,” the state health department said in a statement announcing the activation. “I want to stress that our health care facilities in Alaska remain open and able to care for patients,” said Adam Crum, the state’s health commissioner. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, 1 in every 84 people in Alaska was diagnosed with COVID-19 from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, which was covered by the state’s announcement, on Friday activated its own policy because of a shortage of beds, staff and monoclonal antibody treatments, along with the inability to transfer patients. “The move to Crisis Standards of Care is not something we take lightly,” Fairbanks Chief Medical Officer Dr. Angelique Ramirez said in a statement. “This is in response to a very serious surge of COVID in our community.”\n\nArizona\n\nChandler: A helicopter and a single-engine plane collided in midair Friday near a suburban Phoenix airport, sending the helicopter crashing into a field and killing both people on board. The plane landed safely, and the flight instructor and a student inside were not hurt. The collision happened in the city of Chandler near its municipal airport, said police Sgt. Jason McClimans. He said no one on the ground was hurt. The Chandler Fire Department received reports of a fire in a brush field next to the airport shortly before 8 a.m. Crews found a large plume of smoke and the wreckage of the helicopter on fire but were able to extinguish it relatively quickly, fire officials said. They inspected the helicopter and found the bodies of the two people on board. The chopper was operated by Quantum Helicopters and the plane by Flight Operations Academy. Both are flight schools, according to McClimans, of Chandler Police. Richard Bengoa, owner of Flight Operations Academy, said the four-seat plane is used mostly for flight training. Though officials did not allow Bengoa to get close to the plane, he said it appeared from a distance that its landing gear had been damaged. He said he had no information about how the collision happened and was not allowed to speak with the instructor or student.\n\nArkansas\n\nBella Vista: The Bella Vista Bypass opened to the public Friday, marking the end to a decades­long plan to link sections of an interstate in northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson marked the occasion with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday. The new roadway allows travelers to bypass Bella Vista, Arkansas, and connects 265 miles of Interstate 49 between Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Kansas City, Missouri. Discussions began more than 25 years ago for the project, and construction began in February 2011. According to the Arkansas Department of Transportation, construction included six projects that totaled more than $220 million. “Whenever you look at what’s happening in northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri, our economy is boosting. But if we do not have this kind of investment in infrastructure, then we can’t keep growing our economy,” Hutchinson said. “While this won’t guarantee we’ll continue to prosper in the future, it sure means we’re not going to stymie the growth we already have.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nYosemite National Park: A century-old building originally used as a laundry by Chinese workers at Yosemite’s iconic Wawona Hotel has been restored and turned into a visitor’s attraction, recognizing Chinese Americans’ contributions to the early history of the national park. Officials unveiled a new sign Friday marking the Chinese Laundry Building in Yosemite Valley, the Fresno Bee reports. New exhibits inside tell the story of Chinese workers who helped build Tioga Road and Wawona Road, critical infrastructure that made tourism to the park possible. The building – later used as a storage facility – is part of a cluster of structures that will make up the new Yosemite History Center, which will tell the histories of immigrants who made the park what it is today, said park ranger Adam Ramsey. “Chinese people have been a big part of communities throughout the Sierra Nevada for a really long time, and it’s about time that we started sharing that history here in Yosemite,” Ramsey said. According to research conducted by park ranger Yenyen Chan, in 1883 Chinese workers helped build the 56-mile Tioga Road in just 130 days. The stunning route across the Sierra Nevada reaches 10,000 feet in elevation and serves as one of the park’s main roads. Chinese workers were also employed in Yosemite as cooks, laundry workers and gardeners.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A majority of officers from a suburban Denver police department that had faced investigations and community outrage over its run-ins with people of color reported disapproving of the police chief who has committed publicly to reforming the force and its reputation. Members of the Aurora Police Department’s two labor unions, the Aurora Police Association and the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, voted in a poll last week that asked: “Do you feel confident in the leadership of Chief Vanessa Wilson?” The response was 442 votes against her to 16 in favor, the Sentinel Colorado reports. The vote comes less than a month after Attorney General Phil Weiser announced several Aurora officers and paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative. Weiser also announced last month that a civil rights investigation found the department’s patterns and practices indicated a history of racially biased policing. Doug Wilkinson, head of the Aurora Police Association, said the union vote was prompted by Wilson reopening an investigation into a May traffic stop of a Black man who said he was tackled and stunned with a Taser by police, who had “already been cleared of wrongdoing.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials announced a settlement Friday with Eversource over the electric utility’s response to last year’s Tropical Storm Isaias, which left thousands of people without power for days. Under the deal, Eversource has agreed to return $103.4 million to consumers and provide more accountability during future storms, Gov. Ned Lamont and Attorney General William Tong announced. Eversource also has agreed not to apply for a rate increase until at least January 2023, for rates that would not go into effect until at least January 2024, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office said. The storm hit Connecticut on Aug. 4, 2020, with rain and high winds, leaving roughly 800,000 utility customers without power at its peak. Local officials complained that an inability to contact the utility made it difficult to tell residents when or where crews would be coming to restore power. Many towns did not see a utility truck for more than two days, and some people were in the dark for over a week. Under the agreement, $65 million in Eversource funds are to be immediately returned to customers in the form of credits on their December and January bills. The company said $10 million will be used to assist customers who are having difficulty paying their utility bills. The average customer will see a total credit of $35, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Dover man who pointed a gun at counterprotesters during a campaign rally for a Republican U.S. Senate candidate last year has been convicted of two felonies. A jury convicted Michael Hastings on Thursday of first-degree reckless endangering and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony for pointing a gun at a group of protesters while attending a Lauren Witzke rally. The incident, which was caught on video by a protester, happened during a September 2020 rally in Wilmington. Witzke, who condemned the behavior, later lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Chris Coons. “Pointing a loaded gun at anyone is always dangerous, full stop,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a statement. “The defendant’s actions seriously endangered his fellow citizens who were exercising their right to free speech, and he now faces the consequences.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first Women’s March of the Biden administration headed straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, part of nationwide protests that drew thousands to Washington to demand continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy. Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting “My body, my choice.” Before heading out on the march, they rallied in a square near the White House, waving signs that said “Mind your own uterus” and “Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate,” among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply “1973,” a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s. “It’s sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But it’s a tradition I want to continue,” Baijal said of the march. The demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court. “Shame, shame, shame!” marchers chanted while passing the Trump International Hotel, at which some booed and waved their fists.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: Personal property recovered from the destroyed units of a condo building that collapsed, killing 98 people, will be divided into two categories: soft material and hard material, according to a plan outlined before a judge overseeing litigation from the tragedy. Only the hard items collected from the rubble where the Champlain Towers South building once stood will be returned to survivors and family members of those killed, officials said in court documents. The moisture-absorbing soft items, including clothing and bedding, would cost millions of dollars to decontaminate per EPA guidelines, they said. Photos are the exception to the rule, as Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has made those a priority to return to survivors, said Michael Goldberg, a lawyer appointed to manage the legal interests of the Champlain Towers South. About $750,000 in cash was recovered from the ruins. Family members and survivors will be reimbursed somewhat quickly for cash that is easily identifiable because it was in a wallet or purse with an ID. The actual paper bills will be transported to the U.S. Treasury in Washington, where they will be destroyed since they are contaminated. They’ll be replaced with checks, according to court documents. But “we are going to have claims for cash that far exceed what is coming back,” Goldberg said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Ahmaud Arbery’s mental health records can’t be used as trial evidence by the white men who chased and killed the 25-year-old Black man as he was running in their neighborhood, a judge ruled Friday. The decision by Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley further limits defense attorneys’ efforts to portray Arbery as an aggressive young man with a troubled past when the case goes to trial soon, with jury selection scheduled to start Oct. 18. The judge ruled that Arbery’s medical privacy, even in death, trumped the rights of the men standing trial to a robust defense. And he concluded that a registered nurse’s “highly questionable diagnosis” that Arbery suffered from mental illness during his first and only visit to a mental health services provider in 2018 could unfairly prejudice a trial jury. “There is no evidence that the victim was suffering from any mental health issue, or had otherwise decompensated, on February 23, 2020,” the date Arbery was killed, the judge’s ruling said. Prosecutors say Arbery was merely jogging on that date when father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael armed themselves and chased Arbery in a pickup truck in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick, about 70 miles south of Savannah.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Friday that he would extend emergency orders requiring masks and regulating travel amid ongoing concerns about high numbers of COVID-19 infections. Ige said his new proclamation would stay in effect for 60 days. The rules mandate masks in indoor public spaces. To avoid 10 days of quarantine upon arriving in the islands, travelers must show proof of vaccination or a negative result from a coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of their flight to Hawaii. The governor said he was concerned that the seven-day average of new daily cases continues to exceed 300. He noted that while that’s down from late August, when the figure approached 900, it’s still higher than last year’s peak. He said he was watching closely whether hospitals have enough beds and staff to care for the sick, noting that Hawaii’s geographic isolation means patients can’t drive to neighboring states for health care if local hospitals are full. Earlier this year Ige had hoped to lift restrictions once 70% of the state’s population was vaccinated against COVID-19, but he said “everything changed” with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the virus. As of Friday, 68% of the state’s population was fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has made public a collection of documents to journalists shortly after a judge again ordered her to reveal the records. The public records included feedback from the public regarding her newly created Education Task Force, which was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system – something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” Several journalists first requested copies of the public records months ago. But McGeachin’s office mostly denied the requests, telling some reporters it would cost them hundreds of dollars to access the materials and citing exemptions to Idaho’s public records law that didn’t apply to the documents. McGeachin also falsely claimed in public Facebook posts that the journalists were only seeking the records to encourage employers to retaliate against anyone who expressed concerns about the state’s public education system. In July, the Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin for the documents on behalf of Audrey Dutton and Clark Corbin with the Idaho Capital Sun, Blake Jones with Idaho Education News and Hayat Norimine with the Idaho Statesman.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The death of an Illinois State Police trooper on an expressway has been ruled a suicide, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said Saturday. An autopsy found District Chicago Trooper Gerald Mason, 35, died of a gunshot wound to the head, the medical examiner’s office said. The 11-year state police veteran died Friday afternoon shortly after the shooting on the inbound lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway on the city’s South Side, authorities said. “He was an amazing District Chicago trooper,” Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said during a news conference Friday evening. The trooper’s mother, Linda Mason, told the Chicago Sun-Times her son had wanted to be an officer since he was a toddler. He was a Chicago native who dedicated his life to policing, she said. “He was a sweetheart, and he loved everybody,” she said. “He just wanted to protect people and make this city and state better.” On Thursday, the Illinois State Police announced it would more than double patrols in the Chicago area beginning Friday in response to a surge in shootings on expressways over the past two years. There have been more than 185 shootings on expressways in the region this year, according to the agency, compared to a total of about 130 shootings last year and just over 50 in 2019.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers gave final approval Friday to their party’s redrawing of the state’s congressional and legislative districts, brushing aside objections that the maps give them an excessive election advantage and dilute the influence of minority and urban voters. The Indiana Senate and House both voted by wide margins without any Democratic support to advance the redistricting plan to Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb for his signature. Political analysts say the new maps that will be used through the 2030 elections protect the Republican dominance that has given them a 7-2 majority of Indiana’s U.S. House seats and commanding majorities in the Legislature. Republicans maintain they followed federal and state laws to match population changes recorded by the 2020 census while avoiding splitting counties and cities among multiple districts as much as possible. Democrats and civil rights groups countered by pointing to the fragmenting of Fort Wayne’s large Black and Latino communities among three likely Republican Senate districts that will have rural white voters making up the majorities. Critics also argued that the cities of Evansville, Lafayette and West Lafayette were divided among rural, Republican Senate districts while their populations were enough for them to have districts of their own that would be competitive.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: A University of Northern Iowa biology professor who required that masks be worn in his classroom and threatened lower grades for students who refused has been relegated to online teaching and stripped of his eligibility for merit pay. UNI professor Steve O’Kane Jr. had circulated a resolution among his colleagues saying faculty should be allowed to manage their classrooms, pushing back against a state law banning mask mandates. Regents President Mike Richards in May barred administrators from requiring masks or vaccines. He’s maintained that position despite the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. O’Kane received a disciplinary letter from UNI College of Humanities, Arts and Sciences Dean John Fritch, The Gazette of Cedar Rapids reports. Besides the loss of merit pay and removal from in-person classes, the letter requires O’Kane to complete training addressing his professional responsibilities as a faculty member – including following university policies – by Nov. 30. Despite the letter’s warning that he could be fired if he fails to comply with university policies on face masks, O’Kane said he will require masks again in the spring if he’s allowed to return to in-person teaching.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Residents can now register to vote at the state agencies where they receive public benefits under an agreement with civil rights groups that brings Kansas back into compliance with federal election law, the governor said Friday. Kansas’ Department of Health and Environment and Department for Children and Families have expanded opportunities for residents wishing to register or update their voter registration. The agencies have also committed to providing resources to help them register. “Every lawfully eligible Kansan deserves an equal opportunity to cast his or her ballot in every election,” Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release. “By sharing resources and expanding opportunities to get registered to vote, we will encourage more voices to be heard at the polls and more Kansans to exercise this important right.” The National Voter Registration Act, passed in 1993, requires voter registration assistance at state agencies providing public assistance benefits. Although the agencies may have been in compliance in the past, previous administrations allowed them to abandon those obligations, Kelly’s office said. To address those deficiencies, Kelly’s office has been working since November 2019 with voting rights advocacy nonprofit Loud Light, represented by the think tank Demos, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, and the ACLU’s national Voting Rights Project.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Fresh off landing a record-shattering economic development deal with Ford Motor Co. that put Kentucky at the forefront of the green energy movement, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday launched a reelection run that will be tied to his aggressive actions to combat COVID-19 in his rapidly reddening state. Still two years away from voters delivering a verdict on his pandemic-plagued term, Beshear filed paperwork allowing him to raise and spend money on his 2023 reelection bid. The 43-year-old governor faces a bruising campaign in a state dominated by Republicans eager to rip into his coronavirus-related restrictions during much of the pandemic. In a social media post, the governor said: “There are so many challenges facing our Commonwealth. Kentuckians are counting on me to deliver, and I won’t let them down.” Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman will be Beshear’s running mate again in 2023, said Eric Hyers, the governor’s 2019 campaign manager and adviser to his reelection effort. Several Republicans are weighing bids to unseat Beshear in 2023, including former United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft, Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Sen. Max Wise and state Rep. Savannah Maddox. State Auditor Mike Harmon already announced he’s in the race.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state’s largest health system is ratcheting up pressure to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Ochsner Health told employees it will charge them a monthly premium of $200 if a spouse or domestic partner covered under an Ochsner health plan is not vaccinated, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Ochsner has said all employees must be vaccinated by Oct. 29 to keep their jobs. President and CEO Warner Thomas said the surcharge for unvaccinated spouses and partners is part of an effort to keep health premiums low for employees. As a self-insured organization, Ochsner bears the cost of COVID-19 treatment for patients who are on its insurance plan. Unvaccinated people account for the vast majority of the health system’s COVID-19 patients. The vaccine fee for spouses and domestic partners will begin in 2022 and could deduct up to $2,400 yearly from the employee’s paycheck. Meanwhile, Louisiana is trying to encourage more people to get COVID-19 shots by offering them a cash incentive. Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Friday that the state’s “Shot for 100” program, which has been offering $100 cash cards to college students who get vaccinated, is expanding to offer the money to anyone who gets newly immunized against COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Gov. Janet Mills’ administration submitted an application to the federal government Friday to lease about 15 square miles for a floating offshore wind research area. The Democratic governor has touted the project as the nation’s first such site in federal waters and a chance to chart a new course for renewable energy. Maine wants to deploy a dozen or so wind turbines on floating hulls designed by the University of Maine. The research site would be located almost 30 miles offshore. The Governor’s Energy Office submitted its application to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The project “will help establish the best way for our state to embrace the vast economic and environmental benefits of offshore wind,” Mills said. Members of the state’s fishing industry have pushed back at plans for offshore wind off Maine. In response, Mills signed off on a prohibition of offshore wind projects in state waters in July.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: Six Flags America is scaling back hours during its annual Halloween events after a series of fights broke out over a recent weekend at the amusement park in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. A melee prompted the park to close an hour early Sept. 25, and the park said it would begin closing its gates at 9 p.m., news outlets report. Patrons won’t be allowed to reenter the park after 6 p.m., and no new entries will be allowed after 7 p.m., Six Flags said in a statement. Prince George’s County police confirmed that officers stationed at the park in Bowie responded to the fights and that several victims have filed reports but said no arrests had been made. Police and park officials said they meet regularly to discuss safety and security plans at the park and were reviewing plans late last week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than a year after they graduated, hundreds of Boston University alumni returned to campus Sunday for a belated commencement ceremony. The university hosted an outdoor graduation event for the Class of 2020, which never had an in-person commencement because of the pandemic. Nearly 2,000 graduates were expected to return for the ceremony at Nickerson Field, school officials said. The ceremony makes good, 17 months later, on the university’s promise that the May 2020 event had been postponed but not canceled because of COVID-19. The school said it’s enforcing public health measures including mandatory mask-wearing indoors. The university requires COVID-19 vaccination for all students and staff and said it’s “strongly encouraged” for visitors. Victor J. Dzua, president of the National Academy of Medicine, was slated to deliver a commencement address. The ceremony was one of several events planned as part of the university’s alumni weekend. Anyone who earned a degree from September 2019 through September 2020 was eligible to register for the belated commencement. The Class of 2021 had its own in-person commencement this year, although it was scaled back to meet city and state gathering limits.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The grand prize winner of ArtPrize is an old phone booth on a pedestrian bridge. Not just any phone booth, “Before You Go” allows people to listen to advice about life recorded by more than 100 local residents and others. The mother-son team of Monica Pritchard and Christian Reichle won the $50,000 prize Friday. “I’ve just had a passion for telling peoples’ stories in terms of business, and I’ve been sharing that with my son,” said Pritchard, who works as an executive sales coach. “Christian helped me make it come alive.” Pritchard said she and her son didn’t enter the competition to win it. “You pour your heart into something, and you don’t know how it’s going to go,” Reichle said. “To have the reception that we had, and then to win, is huge.” ArtPrize ended Sunday, but people still can experience “Before You Go.” The phone line where the messages are recorded can be accessed by calling (888) 665-2036. For 18 days, a variety of art was displayed in parks, museums, galleries, vacant buildings and other venues.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: The last remaining closure order related to wildfires in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has now been lifted, according to Superior National Forest officials. A hot and abnormally dry summer caused extreme fire danger and prompted a complete closure of the popular wilderness area in northern Minnesota for a couple of weeks after wildfires broke out. The last remaining closure related to the John Ek and Whelp fires has now been lifted. Cooler conditions and recent rainfall have helped keep the fires in check. “We have not seen any smoke from the fire for a couple of weeks now, and we feel comfortable lifting this closure as this fire is unlikely to spread much, if at all,” said Patty Johnson, the forest’s East Zone fire management officer. The BWCA received 3 to 6 inches of rain in September, which is about normal for the month. But officials say over the longer term, the region remains in drought conditions, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Fire crews have now removed all pumps, hoses and other equipment that had been staged for the John Ek fire. Meanwhile, to the south and outside the wilderness boundary, the Forest Service has scaled back the closure area around the Greenwood fire, which has reached 80% containment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The leader of a pediatricians’ organization is urging school districts to keep mask mandates in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. “Many school boards in Mississippi are removing mask requirements,” Dr. Anita Henderson of Hattiesburg, president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Thursday on Twitter. “Kids under 12 cannot be vaccinated and only about 30% of all 12-17 year-olds in Mississippi are fully vaccinated. Now is not the time to let our guard down.” The Mississippi State Department of Health has reported nine pediatric deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The state saw a significant surge in COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations starting in July, but numbers have decreased in recent weeks. In central Mississippi, the Madison County School District removed most of its mask mandate as of Sept. 24, making masks optional in most places but still required on buses. The district has about 13,000 students. The Rankin County School Board voted Sept. 22 to remove a mandate, saying that masks are now “not required but highly recommended” in the district with more than 18,000 students. The change in the central Mississippi district came weeks after some parents protested the mandate at a school board meeting.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Several thousand Missourians who previously were not eligible for Medicaid are expected to seek the health care coverage now that voter-approved expansion of the program has taken effect. Friday marked the day the health care program began processing applications. Voters approved Medicaid expansion in August 2020. The constitutional amendment passed with 53% of the vote. Previously, the state’s health care program did not cover most adults without children, and its income eligibility threshold for parents was one of the lowest in the nation, at about one-fifth of the poverty level. The expansion is expected to add Medicaid eligibility for up to 275,000 low-income Missourians. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people have applied for Medicaid under the expansion. A spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Social Services said enrollment information for October won’t be posted until November. The expansion was the subject of a court case that wound up in the Missouri Supreme Court, where a July decision paved the way for the plan to move forward.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Most of the state’s Republican lawmakers are urging their leadership to appoint a special committee to investigate the security of the state’s voting system. The effort is led by GOP legislators who are pushing false theories of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Republicans hold a two-thirds majority in the Legislature. The letter, signed by 86 of the state’s 98 GOP lawmakers, was sent Wednesday to Senate President Mark Blasdel and House Speaker Wylie Galt and asks for a response by Oct. 6. Blasdel declined to comment Friday, and the bureau could not reach Galt for comment. The letter proposes forming a committee, whose membership also would be two-thirds Republican, to conduct hearings about the election process and security and decide if any new laws are needed. “Many of our constituents have reached out to us with questions about Montana election security,” the letter said. “All Montana voters must have absolute faith in our state, county and local elections.” Montana House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, D-Helena, said the Republican letter offers no evidence that there are any problems with the state’s election system. County election officials run fair and secure elections following state laws, Abbott said Friday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A state contractor that places Omaha-area children in foster homes, checks on their welfare and ensures their needs are met has been temporarily barred from taking any new cases because it’s struggling to fulfill the requirements of its contract. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services set the 60-day restriction on Kansas-based St. Francis Ministries on Thursday. State officials also granted the provider a probationary license as a child placing agency. The department said state child welfare workers will handle new cases in Douglas and Sarpy counties during the probationary period. The state will rely on existing staff members to manage cases and hire additional workers. State officials have said St. Francis has failed to meet several of its contractual obligations over the past two years and has faced major financial problems. State officials negotiated a new contract with the provider in January, about three weeks before St. Francis was expected to run out of money. St. Francis initially won the Nebraska job by offering to do it for $197 million over five years, less than 60% of the bid from PromiseShip, the Omaha-based agency that held the previous state contract. Nebraska lawmakers and child advocates raised concerns at the time, but state officials gave reassurances.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: People who are healing and some still struggling gathered Friday to remember those who died and were injured during the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history four years ago on the Las Vegas Strip. “I was wounded. Those physical wounds have healed,” said Dee Ann Hyatt, whose daughter also was hurt and whose brother died in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting. “But the lasting scars for our family remain.” Hyatt spoke to several hundred people during a sunrise ceremony at the Clark County Government Center in Las Vegas. She remembered her slain brother, Kurt von Tillow, a trucker from Northern California, before a screen at an outdoor amphitheater that displayed photos of the dead. Fifty-eight people were killed that night, and two others died later. More than 850 were injured. “We continue to live the impact of all that happened that night, four years later,” Hyatt said. “People thrive and people struggle to live with the physical and mental pain, and our lives are forever changed.” The morning memorial featured a song, “Four Years After,” sung by Matt Sky, that was composed for the anniversary by Mark R. Johnson and released with multi-Grammy award winner Alan Parsons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A proposed rule that would severely limit remote instruction options for schools won’t go before the state Board of Education until November, but state officials already are advising districts to follow it. School districts currently can shift to fully remote or hybrid instruction for all students due to COVID-19 outbreaks. But under an administrative rule proposed by the Department of Education, schools would be required to provide in-person instruction five days per week except in cases of inclement weather or when a parent requests remote learning for an individual student. In an email to school leaders last month, Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut instructed schools on how to comply with what he called the “recently advanced” rules, without describing the current rules. Schools are permitted to offer remote instruction to individual students who have contracted COVID-19, are required to quarantine because a household contact is infected or have other family circumstances that prevent in-person attendance, he said. “I think there’s a little bit of a shift that’s taking place because we’re not in the same circumstances we found ourselves in last year, so people have to shift their mindsets,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLeesburg: A corrections officer at a state prison in southern New Jersey was arrested Friday on charges he beat and humiliated inmates without provocation or justification, according to federal prosecutors. John Makos, 41, a Millville resident who works at Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, was charged with conspiracy to deprive the inmates of their civil rights. He has been suspended from his job. From April through December 2019, prosecutors said Makos conspired with others at the prison to assault and punish certain inmates in a cruel and arbitrary manner by using excessive force that caused physical injury and pain. Prosecutors said Makos and at least one other corrections officer established an ad hoc regime of physical punishments for actual and perceived violations of the prison’s rules and customs and meted out the punishments in a cruel and degrading manner, at times with the aid of other inmates. Certain prisoners were singled out for brutal beatings, humiliation and assaults that only ended when the prisoner was close to passing out, according to a criminal complaint. In what was known to inmates as the “fence treatment,” prosecutors said Makos handcuffed a prisoner to a fence in the back area of the prison’s kitchen and the other arm to a swinging door, so the inmate would appear to be crucified.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons created a colorful tapestry against a blue sky Saturday, kicking off a nine-day annual event that was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The 7 a.m. mass ascension was the first of five scheduled for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which draws visitors from around the world. Two balloons hit power lines Sunday and caused a brief outage for more than 1,000 Public Service Company of New Mexico customers, who the company said were without electricity for a couple hours. No injuries were reported. Organizers of the fiesta said more than 540 balloons were registered this year. The 2019 event drew nearly 600 balloons from across the U.S. and 17 other countries. Organizers said they wouldn’t be checking for COVID-19 vaccination cards but noted precautions were being taken to preserve social distancing and provide access to hand sanitizer and hand-washing stations. Indoor dining for balloon pilots and VIPs was canceled. More than 80 balloons in special ornate or cartoonish shapes were disbursed throughout the launch field, rather than clustered together, encouraging crowds to spread out, fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said. Scheduled events included a chain saw carving display, fireworks, sky divers, musical stage performances and a strolling mariachi band.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Friday denied an emergency appeal from a group of teachers to block the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for public school teachers and other staff from going into effect. The teachers had filed for the injunction with Sotomayor on Thursday, in an effort to keep the mandate from going into effect Friday. Under the mandate rules, the roughly 148,000 school employees had until 5 p.m. Friday to get at least their first vaccine shot. Those who didn’t face suspension without pay when schools open Monday. Georgia Pestana, the city’s corporation counsel, said in a statement: “We are gratified by Justice Sotomayor’s decision. She made the right call on the law and in the best interest of students and educators.” Vinoo Varghese, an attorney for the teachers, said in an email: “We are disappointed, but the fight for our clients’ due process and those similarly situated will go on.” An original deadline earlier last week was delayed after a legal challenge, but a federal appeals panel said Monday that New York City could go ahead with the mandate in the country’s largest school district.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced agreement Friday on an energy bill that aims to meet Cooper’s goals on greenhouse gas reductions and gives dominant utility Duke Energy the ability to seek multiyear rate increases. The measure, which is expected to clear the Republican-controlled Legislature this week, removes most of the prescriptive actions that House Republicans laid out in an earlier version of the bill that passed the chamber in July. Instead, the new bill, largely negotiated between the Cooper administration and senators from both parties, directs the state Utilities Commission to come up with a roadmap by the end of 2022 on how to move toward goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that align with Cooper’s Clean Energy Plan. That plan seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels from energy producers by 70% compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The House plan would have contributed to a 62% reduction in power-sector greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade, according to an estimate by the commission’s public staff.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum and health officials said Friday that hospital capacity is reaching critical levels and urged residents to take action to help ease the crisis. State officials are urging the public to take a range of steps to help reduce hospitalizations, from avoiding high-risk activities to practicing defensive driving. The Bismarck Tribune reports COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state surpassed 160 on Friday for the first time in nearly 10 months, and the percentage of staffed hospital beds in North Dakota that remained available fell below 10%. “We all need to do our part to avoid hospitalization and prevent further strain on these facilities and their staff as we work through this incredibly challenging time,” said Burgum, a Republican. Hospital capacity has been a concern the past couple of months because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The 161 patients listed on the Health Department’s virus dashboard Friday was the most since mid-December. The most recent state data showed 214 available staffed inpatient beds and 15 available intensive care unit beds statewide. North Dakota’s six largest hospitals on Friday reported 43 patients had been sent to other facilities, sometimes hundreds of miles away.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state doubled the amount of money for its new Vax-to-College program Friday to $2 million and plans to expand the age range to include children 5 and older once a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for them at the end of the month. “This is the time for younger Ohioans to get the facts and to make the choice to get the COVID-19 vaccine to help protect themselves and others,” Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, the state health director, said during a press conference. The announcement comes as health officials across Ohio have been sounding the alarm about the rate of younger patients becoming sick and hospitalized with the disease. The overwhelming majority of those patients are unvaccinated. Vanderhoff detailed the changes in the new program in an effort to boost the number of vaccinations, which include increasing the number of $10,000 scholarships to 150 and the hope of expanding the age group to include younger Ohioans. Unlike under the Vax-a-Million program introduced in the spring, winners can put the money toward anything from college to trade school to other advancement opportunities. The program had initially targeted residents ages 12-25 who received vaccines but is now awaiting the FDA emergency use authorization for the Pfizer shot expected in late October to include 5- to 11-year-olds.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Students scored lower on standardized tests in 2021 following a year of disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The department reported 22.1% scored proficient in math, 24.8% in English language arts and 29.7% in science. The last testing, in 2019, found 31.9% proficient in math, 33.4% in English language arts and 34.5% in science. “The effects of the pandemic will be seen and felt for years to come,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister. “There is no quick fix.” The education department said Thursday that the number of students taking the tests declined following a year in which schools statewide adopted online classes or a blend of online and in-person classes due to the pandemic. The federal education department waived its requirement that at least 95% of students take the tests. The state education department reported 92% of students were tested in math, 92% in ELA and 91% in science. “We are asking schools and districts to engage in a deeper exploration of their data to understand who tested and who did not test while considering local context and variables,” said Maria Cammack, deputy superintendent for the state department.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s attorney general filed lawsuits Friday against two counties that had adopted ordinances that sought to nullify new statewide gun safety laws and declared themselves “Second Amendment Sanctuaries.” In her lawsuits against Yamhill and Harney counties, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum asked the circuit courts in those jurisdictions to declare the ordinances “invalid and void” because they conflict “with paramount state law.” “Gun safety laws exist to help keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep people safe. A county commission simply doesn’t get to override state law in this way,” Rosenblum said. The ordinances, passed by county commissioners in the two counties earlier this year, did not apply to local, federal or state firearms regulations that were in effect as of last February. But they did encompass a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor June 1 that mandates the safe storage of guns and bans them from the Oregon State Capitol and Portland International Airport. The new law, which went into effect Sept. 24, also allows public school districts, community colleges and universities to set their own policy banning guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The deadline passed Friday for Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration to comply with a subpoena from a Republican-controlled state Senate committee pursuing what the GOP calls a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election, as a state court sorted through three legal challenges. Wolf’s administration and Senate Republicans remained silent in the matter Friday. The court was expected to set up an expedited briefing schedule in one or all of the cases. Challengers, including Senate Democrats and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, have sought broadly to block the subpoena, saying it is an abuse of legislative power, and in particular have challenged its request for the driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers of roughly 9 million registered voters. Republicans maintain they are attempting to find and fix problems in last year’s presidential election and this year’s primary election. Democrats accuse them of helping perpetuate baseless claims that former President Donald Trump was cheated out of victory. It’s not clear whether Wolf’s administration can be forced to comply with a Senate subpoena. Democrat Joe Biden beat Trump in Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes, according to certified results.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Daniel McKee said Friday that the administration would try to find new assignments for health care workers employed by the state who are refusing a COVID-19 vaccination. The state’s health care worker vaccine mandate took effect Friday, the day after a federal judge tossed a constitutional challenge to the requirement filed by four people who work in the health care field. Workers who don’t comply are at risk of losing their state licenses and jobs. McKee said during an appearance on WPRO radio that there are a “small amount” of holdouts, but he doesn’t want to put people out of work. “We might be able to put them in another department,” he said. “We don’t want people to be without pay or without health care coverage, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn’t happen.” He said he would also encourage hospitals and other health care organizations to take the same approach. He stood by the mandate. “We’ve made a policy that we feel as though is in the best interest of the safety of the people in the state of Rhode Island,” he told the station. Some unvaccinated workers will be allowed to work an extra 30 days beyond Friday’s deadline if their absence would compromise patient care.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHunting Island: A 950-foot-long fishing pier at one of the state’s most popular parks – partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew and closed for five years – has reopened, restoring an important public access to the Atlantic Ocean. The pier at Hunting Island State Park, 15 miles east of Beaufort, is in effect a sidewalk that extends three football fields from shore. It offers visitors front-row access to great fishing, wildlife viewing and solitude. When Matthew made landfall in October 2016, it caused extensive damage to Hunting Island, including the pier, making it unsafe and prompting its closure. “We’ve been waiting for this to open,” said Brian Gilfedder of Beaufort, who was fishing on the pier with his wife, Mary Lou, on a recent sunny afternoon. The new pier is wonderful, the Gilfedders said, echoing others who were fishing or just sitting on a bench, drinking in the ocean, last week as feeding dolphins thrashed in the shallows nearby. “When it was closed, we couldn’t fish,” said John Freeman, a St. Helena Island resident who lives at Eddings Point and been fishing from the pier for years. From the pier, visitors can see waves rolling in from the Atlantic Ocean onto the barrier island. Also visible from the pier: Fripp Island and “Little Hunting Island,” the product of a hurricane that breached a lagoon, cutting the beach in two.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she will relaunch the state’s review of social study standards after it was mired in controversy. The Republican governor said she has “set aside” the standards proposed by the Department of Education and told the department to restart the process, saying everyone who has expressed concern about the process, including Native Americans, will be included in the do-over. “Our kids deserve to learn both America’s and South Dakota’s true and honest history, taught in a balanced context that doesn’t pit our children against each other on the basis of race, sex, or background,” Noem said in a statement. New standards are released every seven years. The governor’s plan calls for a new workgroup of people from across the state to develop the standards. Members of the previous working group – appointed by the Department of Education – said in August that they were caught by surprise on Friday when the department released a document with significant changes that cut references to Native American history and culture. Conservatives have also criticized the Department of Education’s proposed standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: About 1,450 people jailed illegally as minors can claim part of an $11 million class-action settlement, but fewer than 200 people have filed eligible claims. The lawsuit revealed the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center regularly locked up children for misdemeanor charges, including truancy, school fights and disobeying parents, plaintiffs’ attorney Kyle Mothershead said. The suit started by challenging the incarceration of children arrested at Hobgood Elementary School in Murfreesboro before expanding to include other youth jailed at the detention center on minor charges. Tennessee law strictly prohibits the pretrial incarceration of children unless they are charged with a violent felony, weapons offense or probation violation, according to the complaint filed in July 2017. Under the terms of a June 2021 settlement, eligible plaintiffs will get $4,800 per illegal incarceration and $1,000 per arrest. The original plaintiffs will receive a larger settlement. They include Kazmere Watts, who’ll receive about $31,000 after he was incarcerated for seven days for a school fight. He punched another student, but that student wasn’t seriously injured. “That was the first time I ever got into trouble,” said Watts, who was a freshman in 2014. “I wasn’t trying to hurt him. You’re a kid. You do foolish stuff.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A man seen on surveillance video wearing an American flag bandanna when he threw a Molotov cocktail into a county Democratic Party headquarters was arrested, a fire official said. Ryan Faircloth, 30, was booked Friday in the Travis County jail. He was charged with arson and possessing a prohibited weapon – the Molotov cocktail – according to Austin Fire arson investigator Capt. Jeffrey Deane. Investigators received multiple tips after releasing the surveillance video. One of the tips led to Faircloth’s social media. Information found online and other evidence led arson investigators and the FBI to make the arrest, Deane said at a news conference. “This person was not happy with the current political climate. He blamed this office and who they represent for a lot of the issues that he saw as problems with the country,” Deane said. “He was forthcoming and confessed to that.” Deane also said Faircloth left a note at the scene. He declined to give specifics on the contents of the letter but said the suspect alluded to possible plans for future attacks, which led investigators to act quickly to get him off the streets. It was unclear whether Faircloth had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints urged members Saturday to listen to the faith’s leaders when they seek “pure truth” and expressed gratitude for those who have followed church guidance on the pandemic, which includes getting COVID-19 shots. President Russell M. Nelson acknowledged at a church conference that the world is “still dealing with the ravages of COVID-19 and its variants.” And while he didn’t mention vaccines specifically, he thanked members for following the advice of church leaders, medical experts and government officials. The Utah-based faith has repeatedly encouraged its 16 million members worldwide to limit the spread by getting vaccines and wearing masks. “Contrary to the doubts of some, there really is such a thing as right and wrong. There really is absolute truth – eternal truth,” Nelson said from inside a mostly empty conference center in Salt Lake City. “One of the plagues of our day is that too few people know where to turn for truth. I can assure you that what you will hear today and tomorrow constitutes pure truth.” The two-day conference was taking place again without full attendance due to the pandemic, but for the first time in two years, leaders were back at the faith’s 20,000-seat conference center, with several hundred people watching in person.\n\nVermont\n\nCharlotte: A $6 million gift is going to the Vermont Land Trust to help diversify farm ownership, make farming more economically viable, and promote farming practices that contribute to clean water, healthy soil, and climate resilience, the High Meadows Fund, Vermont Land Trust and Vermont Community Foundation announced. A fund will be created with $2 million to expand land ownership and access among people who have been historically marginalized or oppressed based on their race or ethnicity, the groups said Thursday. According to the 2017 U.S. agriculture census, just 17 of the nearly 7,000 farms in Vermont are owned by Black people. “A gift of this kind could help all of us, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or oppressed,” Lydia Clemmons, president and executive director of the Clemmons Family Farm in Charlotte, said in a statement. A total of $4 million will go toward expanding the land trust’s work “to put hundreds of farmers onto the land operating successful businesses over the next 10 years,” the groups said. The Vermont Land Trust and a diverse group of farmers and community leaders will be holding discussions on how to design and increase the $2 million fund to expand land ownership and access, the groups said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A child under the age of 10 died of COVID-19 on Wednesday in eastern Virginia – the second fatal juvenile case of the week in the region, health officials confirmed. A health department spokesperson, Larry Hill, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he could not provide any further information about the child, whose death occurred just two days after that of 10-year-old Teresa Sperry. According to officials, they are the 12th and 13th juvenile deaths in the state since the beginning of the pandemic. Sperry, who was from Suffolk, started exhibiting severe symptoms Sept. 26 but was sent home from Sentara Obici Hospital after a chest scan came back clear. The next day, Sperry stopped breathing, her family told The Virginian Pilot. She was taken back to Sentara Obici Hospital in Suffolk. She was then transferred to Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, where she died. Sperry’s death was officially recorded Thursday by the Virginia Department of Health but was widely reported by local news outlets Wednesday. Sperry’s mother, Nicole, wrote on Facebook that her daughter was tasked with walking sick children in her class to the clinic at Hillpoint Elementary School. Nicole Sperry said she attributes her daughter’s death to parents allowing their sick children to attend school.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State correctional facilities will no longer place people in custody in solitary confinement as a punishment, after state officials determined it is not effective. The Washington Department of Corrections made the announcement Thursday, saying the policy has been in effect for the past two weeks, The Seattle Times reports. Corrections Secretary Cheryl Strange called it a historic moment in the department and a “key step in becoming a human-centered organization by advancing proven correctional practices and methods that support individuals in change.” She also said the practice has not been effective at deterring negative behavior. The agency collected data on the practice of isolating incarcerated people for punishment. It found that of 2,500 incidents in which people were subjected to disciplinary segregation from Sept. 1, 2019, through Aug. 31, 2020, most – 57% – were disciplined for nonviolent infractions. People who received disciplinary segregation on average spent from 11 to 16 days in isolation. Many had already been subjected to administrative segregation, which involves isolating a person for the safety of themselves or others, while their disciplinary hearing was pending. Most received credit for that time served in administrative segregation – which will remain in effect, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two fathers are suing state officials over a law that allows charter schools to open without the approval of local voters, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The lawsuit filed this past week in Kanawha County Circuit Court claims the law is unconstitutional and asks the judge to stop a newly created West Virginia Professional Charter School Board from authorizing any schools. The suit comes after Republican state lawmakers in March amended an earlier charter school law, making it easier for them to win approval. The amendments created the Professional Charter School Board, which can approve both online charters that operate statewide and brick-and-mortar charter schools operating in individual districts. Those schools can be approved even in counties where the local boards of education are opposed to them. The Professional Charter School Board is unelected. Instead, members are appointed by the governor and then confirmed or rejected by the state Senate. The four proposed board members are currently awaiting confirmation, even as they review applications to open new schools. The two fathers who are suing over the new law are both public school teachers and teachers’ union members. Defendants in the case include Gov. Jim Justice and the leaders of the House of Delegates and Senate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The former state Supreme Court justice leading Assembly Republicans’ probe of the 2020 election has sent subpoenas to election officials in Wisconsin’s five largest cities and the state elections administrator demanding information about private donations used to run voting operations. Michael Gableman sent subpoenas to election officials in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Madison, Kenosha and Racine as well as Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe. The subpoenas seek documents related to grants from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which gave more than $10 million to more than 200 Wisconsin communities last year to help cover election costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the money went to those five cities, drawing criticism from Republicans that the money was meant to boost turnout in Democratic areas. The subpoenas command the officials to appear before Gableman in Brookfield on Oct. 15 with their documents. A recount and court decisions have affirmed that President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in Wisconsin by almost 21,000 votes. Only four voters out of roughly 3 million who cast ballots have been charged with fraud.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Books about sex, LGBTQ issues and how to have a baby have public library employees in a deeply conservative city facing possible prosecution after angry local residents complained to police that the material is obscene and doesn’t belong in sections for children and teenagers. For weeks, Campbell County Public Library officials have been facing a local outcry over the books and for scheduling a magician who is transgender to perform for youngsters – an act canceled amid threats against the magician and library staff. The books are “This Book is Gay” by Juno Dawson, “How Do You Make a Baby” by Anna Fiske, “Doing It” by Hannah Witton, “Sex is a Funny Word” by Corey Silverberg, and “Dating and Sex: A Guide for the 21st Century Teen Boy” by Andrew P. Smiler, according to Susan Sisti, a local pastor who has been raising concerns about those and other books in the library. “It’s really easy to go into the library and look around a little bit and find a filthy book that should not even be in a public library,” said Sisti, pastor of Open Door Church in Gillette. Now, after a complaint filed with the sheriff’s office, prosecutors are reviewing the case. They will seek appointment of a special prosecutor to weigh in as well before deciding whether to pursue charges, County Attorney Mitchell Damsky said Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/20/red-panda-triplets-paul-simon-miracle-house-news-around-states/39985535/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The slenderclaw crayfish is barely surviving in northern Alabama. The tiny animal is now known to survive in just two creeks near Sand Mountain, where it burrows under rocks in shallow, slow-moving waters, Al.com reports. The animal lost most of its original habitat when the Tennessee River was dammed to create Lake Guntersville in 1939. And the population is still dwindling. Biologists who study the slenderclaw crayfish are not entirely certain why the population is still declining. More uncertainty surrounds whether the animal will get formal protections from the federal government. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list the crayfish as a threatened species, but the change may not be as protective as in the past, due to recently announced changes by the Trump administration.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: The Kenai River Foundation hosted its 13th annual Wounded Warriors fishing trip this month, bringing 68 active-duty soldiers stationed in the state down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish for salmon on the river. The trip is free for the soldiers and is made possible thanks to donations from sponsors including the Central Peninsula Hospital, Alaska Communications, Fairweather, LLC, Price Gregory International and Siemens Building Technologies. Professional fishing guides volunteered their services for the two days, and riders from several chapters of the American Legion provided a military escort for the buses that brought the soldiers primarily stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to and from Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers could make cities pay for raising the minimum wage. A new law that takes effect Aug. 27 requires the state to calculate the cost to Arizona’s government when cities and counties raise the minimum wage above the statewide rate. If the state has to pay more for services in those communities because of a higher minimum wage, legislators could force local governments to cover the additional costs. Proponents of the measure argue it is only fair after Flagstaff voters elected in 2016 to raise the minimum wage above the state’s rate, in turn requiring government contractors to increase pay for some low-wage workers. But others view it as an effort by the Republican-controlled Legislature to curtail the power of local governments.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Officials say two more medical marijuana dispensaries are expected to open in the state’s northwest this year. Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin says both dispensaries will be in Fayetteville. They’ll join the region’s first dispensary, The ReLeaf Center, which opened earlier this month in Bentonville, and another called The Source, which opened last week in Bentonville. The two Bentonville dispensaries are the seventh and eighth to open in the state since voters legalized the use of medical marijuana in 2016. The state has licensed 32 dispensaries to sell medical marijuana. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the state had issued more than 19,000 patient or caregiver cards as of Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: Scientists have installed an underwater sound system they hope will reduce collisions between whales and ships in the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California. A listening station on the channel floor is able to capture whale calls as far away as 30 miles, the Los Angeles Times reports. That device is connected by cable to a buoy floating above that transmits data by satellite to scientists on shore. From there, captains can be alerted to slow their ships down or reroute. It’s the latest attempt to prevent ships from running into whales in the channel, where cargo vessels in and out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach cross feeding grounds of endangered blue, fin and humpback whales.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the North Front Range region missed its air quality standards deadline. The EPA is expected to mark the nine-county region that includes Denver County in serious noncompliance with a federal standard. Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease. Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard Friday in the region to reduce the effects. Experts say air quality improved on average over the past decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWilton: The town has halted guardrail improvements following complaints about the look of new, steel barriers on some residential streets. Wood and wire guardrails traditionally have lined the roads in Wilton, a Fairfield County town on the line with New York state. First Selectwoman Lynne Vanderslice imposed a moratorium on upgrades this month after residents raised issues with the aesthetics of the steel replacements. The town had been installing steel guardrails in sections, such as along bends and near culverts, on two roads where the old guardrails were showing their age. Public works officials say the moratorium will provide an opportunity to conduct engineering studies and assess alternative guardrail styles and whether guardrails are even needed on those roads.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: Busted boats and outdated laptops are among 2,000-plus items that will be going to auction next month as town officials try to wipe away the scars from participating in a military surplus program. The goal for now, Mayor T.J. Redefer says, is to get the number of items as close to zero as possible to help to rebuild the community’s trust in the government. The stockpile is cited in a federal lawsuit regarding public access to a report on the program, which had found there was little town oversight and questionable accounting. The surplus items were requested by Dewey Beach police working with the Law Enforcement Support Office program, which helps local agencies reuse Department of Defense equipment. The only cost is shipping and transportation of the items, but sometimes the available items look better online than in person, Redefer says.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Confidential documents show the former chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority sought to limit an ethics investigation and prevent its findings from being made public. The Washington Post reports Jack Evans’ actions are detailed in investigative documents obtained from WMATA’s ethics committee. Records show Evans threatened the jobs of a board lawyer and secretary while trying to hide the findings of an ethics probe, which found he failed to disclose a profitable conflict-of-interest. Evans’ lawyer, Mark Tuohey, says Evans never intended that anyone be fired. Clarence C. Crawford, who chaired the ethics committee, made the findings public at the request of state and local officials. Evans resigned his transit job days later but remains a city councilman.\n\nFlorida\n\nDavie: The state’s iconic palm trees are under attack from a fatal disease that turns them to dried crisps in months, with no chance for recovery once they become ill. Spread by a rice-sized, plant-hopping insect, lethal bronzing has gone from a small infestation on the Gulf Coast to a nearly statewide problem in just over a decade. Tens of thousands of palm trees have died from the bacterial disease, and the pace of its spread is increasing, adding to environmental woes of a state already struggling to save its other arboreal icon, citrus trees, from two other diseases. Florida’s official state tree – the tall, broad-leafed sabal palm – is especially susceptible, and Florida nurseries, businesses and homeowners are taking a financial hit as they scrap infected palms. Some preventive measures can be taken, but once infected, uprooting the tree is the only practical solution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Experts say the state is among those most at risk of its residents not being counted accurately in the 2020 census. The Urban Institute says children under the age of 5 are especially at risk of being undercounted due to Georgia’s changing demographics. WABE Radio reports that nationwide, 4.5 million children live in areas that are difficult to count for the 2020 census. Statewide, 22% of Georgia’s population lives in areas considered hard to count. The radio station reports there are several reasons why so many Georgia children are difficult to count: They are often in young families, immigrant families and multigenerational homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nAuwahi: Musician Paul Simon has joined environmentalists attempting to reinvigorate a woodland by planting a tree during a ceremony on Maui. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday that the celebrated singer-songwriter joined Auwahi Forest Restoration Project volunteers seeking to revive the area’s plant life. Simon helped plant a lama tree and participated in chants with the group following a helicopter tour. The part-time Maui resident performed two environmental benefit concerts at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center earlier in the week that drew more than 8,000 attendees. Simon plans to donate his proceeds to the Auwahi project and Hawaii environmental group Kuaaina Ulu Auamo. Simon was put in contact with the environmentalists after visiting Hoolawa Farms in Haiku to view a rare kanaloa plant, one of only two in existence.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have approved two open-pit phosphate mines that include environmental protections intended to prevent the type of pollution caused by past phosphate mining in the area. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management says it approved the Caldwell Canyon Mine project in Caribou County, about 13 miles northeast of Soda Springs. Bayer subsidiary P4 Production will develop the mines on three phosphate leases. Bayer acquired agricultural giant Monsanto, which previously mined the area, for $63 billion last year. The area contains one the nation’s most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that’s turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. Idaho-based Simplot also has a mine in the area. But the area also contains Superfund sites because of pollution from past phosphate mining.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum has received more than $400,000 in grants for a project that aims to publish every document written by the nation’s 16th president. The Springfield-based library says the Papers of Abraham Lincoln project was awarded up to $350,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission awarded the project $87,125. Alan Lowe, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, says the grants show that experts in the field are confident the project “is on the right path to fulfill its important mission.” The project launched online in 2018. It gives people access to documents from private collections and archives held around the world.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: The new home of Indiana University’s art school will be modeled after an unbuilt fraternity house a famed modernist architect designed in the 1950s. IU’s trustees recently approved construction of the $10 million Mies van der Rohe Building. When completed in 2021, it will bring the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture and Design’s programs together within one building. The Herald-Times reports the 10,000-square-foot structure will be made of limestone, steel and glass, with second-floor windows spanning floor to ceiling. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a German-born architect known for his “less is more” approach emphasizing open space and industrial materials. He designed a fraternity house for Phi Lambda Phi in the early 1950s, but it went unbuilt. The new building will be similar to his design, with modern upgrades.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Robert Wolf has about 250 boxes of rock samples sitting in his garage waiting for a crew from the University of Iowa to come pick them up with a 20-foot truck. The collection took the better part of 30 years to find. Each rock sample has a number and is recorded in a log book that tells what it is, where it was collected and when he found it, The Messenger reports. And the collection is all Iowan. “There’s a sample of every formation in Iowa,” he says. “There are 350 rock units in and around Iowa. I have all the families and 95% of the members. That’s what makes this collection unique. It’s a good representation of the state of Iowa.” What makes his collection valuable and of interest to a university is that it’s properly cataloged. Without the information Wolf recorded, it’s just a big pile of rocks.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are expressing concern after a recent survey found more than 1,000 motorists illegally passed stopped school buses in one day. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports a task force is expected to make recommendations during the next legislative session on how to reduce the number of violations. In the April survey, 220 districts in Kansas that use 3,300 school buses reported 1,040 violations by motorists. That compares with April of 2018, when 214 districts operating 3,347 buses documented 1,030 infractions. Jim Porter, the southeast Kansas representative on the Kansas Board of Education, noted the sample included only three-fourths of the state’s districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tourism officials say more people visited the state in 2018 and spent more money. Officials say visitor trips to and within the state topped 71.6 million last year, and visitor spending rose to nearly $7.6 billion, up nearly 4% over the prior year and a 21% increase since 2013. The figures are the result of a study from Tourism Economics, the state Department of Tourism’s new research partner. Using the Tourism Economics model, officials say the industry’s economic impact in Kentucky went from $10.9 billion in 2017 to $11.2 billion in 2018, generating more than 94,500 jobs and $787 million in state and local taxes. The tourism department says it continues to build on Kentucky’s signature tourism industries of horses, bourbon, music, arts, outdoors and culinary to reach new audiences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three days of public events will honor former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, the state’s first female governor, who died after a years­long struggle with cancer. The Democrat who led Louisiana during hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be memorialized Thursday at an interfaith service in downtown Baton Rouge at St. Joseph’s Cathedral. Her casket then will be taken to the Louisiana Capitol, where Blanco’s body will lie in Memorial Hall for public visitation. On Friday, mourners in Louisiana’s Acadiana region can attend a prayer service for the former governor in Lafayette at St. John the Evangelist Cathedral. Blanco’s funeral Mass will be Saturday in Lafayette, followed by a private burial service. Blanco died Sunday. She was 76.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: Nature lovers who encounter fluttering butterflies might also be able to contribute to research about the colorful insects. Researchers at the University of Maine say residents can use a mobile app called the Monarch Model Validator to provide details about areas where butterflies are likely to be found. They plan to use the data as part of a model designed to predict the location of monarch butterfly nesting sites. The UMaine researchers say monarch butterflies begin a 3,000-mile migration south every fall. They also say the number of monarchs that complete the migration has fallen by 90% in the past two decades. App users will be able to answer a short survey and provide photos. They’ll be able to head to predetermined sites or find locations of their own.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Lawyers for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial” are asking the Supreme Court to step into the case. Lawyers for defendant Adnan Syed said in court papers Monday that the justices should order a new trial for Syed and reverse a Maryland court ruling against him. Syed claims his trial lawyer violated his constitutional right to competent representation because she failed to investigate an alibi witness. Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were high school classmates who had dated. In its debut 2014 season, the “Serial” podcast shined a spotlight on the case that led to renewed court proceedings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The memorial to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing is complete. Three stone pillars representing the three people who died at the finish line were installed Monday, marking the final step of the $2 million project, which took four years to plan and develop and underwent significant redesigns and other delays. Bolivian-born sculptor Pablo Eduardo said it was important that the final work reflect the hopes and expectations of families who lost loved ones. The monument includes four bronze and glass spires installed last month to illuminate the site. Cherry trees to bloom each April have also been planted, and two bronze bricks have been set in the sidewalk to honor the police officers killed in the bombing’s aftermath. The pillars installed Monday were gathered from places around Boston significant to the bombing victims.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A copy of the original land contract for Motown Records’ Hitsville U.S.A. will be unveiled as part of the music company’s 60th anniversary celebration. Officials with the Motown Museum, located where Berry Gordy Jr. launched his music empire, say they will share the rarely seen document via Facebook at 3 p.m. Tuesday. That coincides with the 1959 date that Gordy purchased the house on West Grand Boulevard. Museum CEO and Chairwoman Robin Terry called it “the start of a journey that would ultimately rock the world.” The event is part of a series of “archive dives” this year to coincide with milestone dates. The Supremes, the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and many others recorded hits there before Motown moved in 1972 to California.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Almost 90 musical acts will descend on the city this week for the Common Roots Festival, performing myriad styles on 12 different stages. The festival, now in its third year, was originally conceived as a way to breathe life back into downtown venues, restaurants and businesses during a major street construction project in 2017. Although that project has been completed, the volunteer team behind the festival has continued the mission to bring folks to downtown St. Cloud. “Downtown is now under a deluge of construction again, and we are hearing from business folks in that area that it is affecting business. So we’re right back where we started three years ago,” says festival coordinator Dawn Yilek. It all kicks off Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Beaver Island Brewing Company.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A group that advocates limited government is suing the state over its licensing requirement for people who earn money by plucking eyebrows with thread. Mississippi Justice Institute filed the lawsuit Monday on behalf of Dipa Bhattarai, a University of Mississippi graduate student. She grew up in Nepal, where she learned the technique of using a single strand of cotton thread to remove hair. Mississippi requires people who receive money for eyebrow threading to earn an esthetician’s license. The license requires training and exams, but none of the training deals with threading. The Mississippi Board of Cosmetology shut down Bhattarai’s business, and she wants to reopen it. She says she started earning money by threading eyebrows while she was a student at Mississippi University for Women in Columbus. “It’s going to sound cliche, but I just started my business with $240,” Bhattarai says.\n\nMissouri\n\nSedalia: Authorities are looking for an inmate who escaped from a crew that was helping to clean up after the Missouri State Fair came to an end for the year. Department of Corrections spokesman Karen Pojmann says 34-year-old Shannon Dewayne Watts, of Springfield, was reported missing about 12:45 a.m. Monday when he didn’t return to a van to head back to the Tipton Correctional Center. He was serving a 15-year sentence there for charges that included burglary, resisting arrest and tampering with a motor vehicle. The search was expanded beyond the nearly 400-acre fairgrounds in Sedalia several hours later when law enforcement couldn’t find Watts. He is described as 6 feet tall and 195 pounds. The 11-day fair began Aug. 8 and ended Sunday night.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A University of Montana art historian has called for a new state flag after receiving a top research award. The Missoulian reports Hipolito Rafael Chacon announced the idea Thursday to redesign the state’s identity with a new flag. Officials say his research received an award last month from the International Congress of Vexillology, a worldwide association of flag researchers. Officials say the design originated from just the seal because Montana troops needed a banner to carry in the Spanish-American War. Officials say the Legislature added the name of the state in 1981. Chacon says a public design competition could be the best way to select a new design. Experts say former historians tried to change the design decades ago, but state officials laughed at the idea.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinslow: Residents of this tiny community who are reeling from flooding this year are considering whether to move their entire town uphill. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the swollen Elkhorn River flowed in mid-March over a levee built to protect Winslow, damaging almost all 38 homes and 10 other buildings in the Dodge County town. Town leaders have proposed moving Winslow out of the flood plain to a new site, possibly a hilltop about 2 miles away. Town officials say that if residents stay, they’ll be at the mercy of the river. Zachary Klein, a village trustee and the volunteer fire chief, says the move could take two years. Klein says funding is available from federal, state and local sources.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials in the city are using the word “outbreak” to describe a sharp spike in hepatitis A cases reported mostly among homeless people and drug users. The Southern Nevada Health District reports that in seven months from November to June, it counted 83 cases of the virus that causes liver damage and can lead to death. That’s far more than the 58 cases reported in 2016, 2017 and 2018 combined. The district says more than 80% of reported patients were people without a permanent place to live, and 92% use drugs, some intravenous. The district has begun posting weekly outbreak updates on its website. Hepatitis A is most often transmitted through consumption of water or food contaminated with feces.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A University of New Hampshire researcher says oyster production in the state is only a small fraction of what it could be. Ray Grizzle, research professor of biological sciences, says the total number of farms is probably nearing the maximum for the Little Bay area, but production isn’t yet. USDA data in the 2017 Census of Agriculture says the state has 32 commercial mollusk operations in Strafford and Rockingham counties representing $419,000 in sales. Most of them are oyster farming. New Hampshire only had two licensed oyster farms when Grizzle began conducting research about 10 years ago. Grizzle, who’s with the university’s New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station, says some farms have included improved farming methods and marketing networks that involve wholesalers as well as directly selling to local chefs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The mayor says it could take another month before additional testing is completed on lead levels in the city’s water supply. That means residents in affected neighborhoods will have to continue receiving bottled water. Mayor Ras Baraka’s comments on a radio show Sunday were first reported by Politico. Newark began distributing bottled water a week ago after lead levels tested high in a few homes even though residents have been given water filters. About 14,000 homes are affected. In addition, a federal judge is expected to rule this week on an environmental group’s effort to force Newark to distribute water to thousands more residents who are served by a different water system. The Natural Resources Defense Council says those residents also are at risk from excessive lead levels.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory say they have plans for $13 billion worth of construction projects over the next decade at the northern New Mexico complex. They outlined their plans at a recent meeting attended by hundreds of representatives of construction firms from around the country. Most of the projects are related to the lab’s assignment to ramp up production of key nuclear weapon components known as plutonium cores. Other work would be aimed at serving a growing workforce, such as housing projects, parking garages and a potential new highway that would reduce commute times from Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Lab Director Thomas Mason tells the Albuquerque Journal the lab currently has 1,400 openings and plans to add another 1,200 jobs to its workforce of 12,000 by 2026.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State officials are asking the public to help choose a new license plate design. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says people can vote on the governor’s website for one of five plate designs. Four of the designs include the Statue of Liberty, while one features the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over the Hudson River. Voting runs through Sept. 2. The design with the most votes will become available in April. The new ones will replace the state’s blue-and-white plates, most of which are more than 10 years old. As vehicle owners renew their registrations, owners with license plates 10 years old or older will be issued new plates for a $25 fee. Once the new plates become available, the Department of Motor Vehicles also will stop issuing the newer blue-and-gold plates.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration is proposing a plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that the plan calls for cutting greenhouse gases from electricity production by 60% to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030, with a goal of getting to zero emissions by 2050. The state Department of Environmental Quality says North Carolina already has made progress toward cutting emissions, which are 34% lower than 2005 levels. Some of the plan’s suggestions include requiring the retirement of coal power plants and requiring utilities to increase use of renewable energy. It also suggests setting carbon dioxide budgets or carbon caps, or a combination of those approaches. The proposal stems from an executive order Cooper signed last year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A landfill north of the city could soon become the first facility in the state to accept higher levels of radioactive oil-field waste under new state regulations. The Bismarck Tribune reports Secure Energy Services is seeking permits allowing it to dispose of radioactive material at its 13-Mile Landfill, which already accepts other types of waste generated by oil development. The Health Department increased the allowable concentrations of technologically enhanced radioactive material to be disposed of at approved landfills from 5 picocuries per gram to 50 picocuries per gram in 2016. Picocuries are a measure of radioactivity. The change was controversial at the time, drawing lengthy hearings and a lawsuit from environmental groups.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: Eighty years after Rhoda Wise first claimed she was a receiver of Christian miracles, people are still visiting her home to see for themselves. Busloads of the faithful and curious come to Wise’s home in Canton to see the room where it is believed she was cured of a terminal illness and regularly was visited by Jesus Christ. The small wood-frame house is an unlikely Roman Catholic shrine nestled in a frayed neighborhood next to a nine-hole golf course. But every year it attracts visitors from all over the world. Visitor numbers are getting a boost this summer thanks to the local Roman Catholic diocese formally petitioning the Vatican to have Wise declared a saint. Wise died in 1948 at age 60.\n\nOklahoma\n\nCushing: Officials have closed a recreational lake while they monitor a dam breach in the area. City Manager Terry Brannon said Sunday that a breach has been detected in a concrete structure beneath the dam at Cushing Lake near this city about 55 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Officials say the breach is allowing water to pass unrestricted, but the flow remains controlled, meaning there hasn’t been a complete dam failure. Owned by the city of Cushing, Cushing Lake is about 9 miles west of Cushing, an oil hub with 300 storage tanks. Officials say the area affected by the breach includes fields and livestock but no structures. Authorities say police are notifying property owners and others with livestock downstream of the dam.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde have finalized their purchase of the former Blue Heron paper mill site at Willamette Falls. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the site that was once home to the Charcowah village of the Clowewalla now belongs to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. The 23-acre property is located within the tribes’ ancestral homelands and holds significant historical and cultural importance for the Grand Ronde. Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde chairwoman Cheryle A. Kennedy says they have reclaimed a piece of their homeland and are resurrecting their role as caretakers to Willamette Falls. The area is part of the lands ceded to the United States government under the Willamette Valley Treaty of 1855. Following the treaty, tribal members were forcibly removed from Willamette Falls and relocated to Grand Ronde.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSpringettsbury: It’s been three years since the last archaeological dig on farmland in this township to find remains from a Revolutionary War prison camp. A new dig started this month on a 4-acre area, and archaeologists and volunteers hope to uncover evidence that would help reveal the exact location of Camp Security. A few 18th-century items, such as wrought iron nails and Westerwald stoneware, have turned up, but “nothing yet that screams site,” says John Crawmer, lead archaeologist for the Friends of Camp Security. During the Revolutionary War, colonists held British prisoners of war from the Battle of Saratoga and the Siege of Yorktown at Camp Security from 1781 to 1783. It’s believed to be the last known Revolutionary War prison camp to remain undisturbed in the country. The public can visit the site Aug. 27 to learn more about the archaeological work.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Advocates for gun control demanded reforms at a gathering over the weekend. The Rhode Island chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America staged a rally Saturday to honor victims of the latest U.S. mass shootings and call for tougher gun legislation. Several dozen people attended the event. Some of the signs they held said “Disarm Hate,” “Enough” and “No One Needs a Weapon of War at Home.” Organizers say they’re pressing for a strong federal “red flag” bill to allow seizure of weapons in certain cases and legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America describes itself as a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A major building at the College of Charleston is set for a $50 million overhaul. The Post and Courier reports the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee agreed last month to borrow $45 million to renovate the university’s main arts building, the Albert Simons Center. Another $5 million will come from a one-time state appropriation. Architects are still designing the building’s new exterior. A previous renovation planned in the mid-1990s stalled amid exterior design disputes. School of the Arts Dean Valerie Morris says the renovation will create a black box theater for student productions, plus upgraded classrooms, bathrooms, and heating and cooling. Mold problems are promised to be fixed. Work could begin in summer 2020, with the art school temporarily relocating. The overhaul could be complete by fall 2022.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The U.S. Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state were unable to plant more than 3.8 million acres this year, the highest number in the nation. KSFY-TV reports the tally includes 2.8 million unplanted corn acres and nearly 851,000 acres for soybeans. The USDA says the total number of unplanted acres nationwide was more than 19 million acres, the highest since the agency began reporting those figures in 2007. Many states across the Midwest were hit hard by flooding this spring, leading to fields being too wet for farmers to plant.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis has launched a new initiative in hopes of raising graduation rates among its black male students, the school announced Monday. The African American Male Academy will start with a group of black male students in middle school and pair them with peer and faculty mentors, provide textbooks and other educational supplies, and give them access to early academic and career preparation. “Most students are in good academic standing when they leave the U of M before graduation – they leave for financial reasons,” university officials wrote in a statement announcing the program, adding that 60% of its students work more than 20 hours a week and have to help provide for their families. Students inducted into the academy will also be informed of scholarship programs and other “culturally responsive” initiatives meant to keep them in school and make their educations more affordable.\n\nTexas\n\nKemah: The Galveston Bay Foundation has seen the first structure go up on 30 acres of bayfront land it acquired in 2016. The Galveston County Daily News reports a pavilion designed and built by students from the University of Texas School of Architecture’s Gulf Coast DesignLab will be used to host as many as 75 students at a time in grades five to 12 from across the upper Texas coast region, helping them learn on-site about Galveston Bay’s wildlife, organisms, natural habitat and environmental threats. In June, DesignLab, an advanced studio design class, reached out to the foundation, offering its services. This motnh the architecture students went to Kemah and built the pavilion over a period of weeks. They put the finishing touches on it last week. A dedication is planned for Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A report says more women in the state are earning STEM-related degrees, but completion rates are still behind the national average. The Deseret News reports the Utah Women & Leadership Project released a study this month showing an additional 467 women graduated with science, technology, engineering and math degrees from 2012 to 2017. Officials say the 1% increase could be higher, but gender stereotypes have been attributed to women switching disciplines more frequently than men. Officials say girls who are introduced to women in STEM careers have increased their chances of engaging in a STEM curriculum by more than 60%. Officials say of the 44% of women in the workforce in Utah, there are a “particularly low” number of women who continue on to work in STEM industries.\n\nVermont\n\nWoodbury: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is seeking volunteers to become “Let’s Go Fishing” instructors who can pass on the fishing tradition to the next generation of Vermonters. The department will be hosting a one-day training workshop for new instructors Sept. 14 at the Buck Lake Conservation Camp in Woodbury. Instructors in the “Let’s Go Fishing” program organize and instruct clinics in their communities for young people and their families. The training workshop will give volunteers the basics of how to teach a basic fishing clinic. They will also learn about fishing ethics, aquatic ecology, fisheries management, habitat conservation and tackle craft. There is no charge, but pre-registration is required. Information can be found on the department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Virginia Zoo has announced the birth of red panda triplets. The zoo in Norfolk announced Monday that the triplets were born two months ago and are thriving in a climate-controlled den that’s out of sight from the public. Zoo veterinarian Collen Clabbers says red panda triplets are a “unique situation” for the endangered species from Asia. But she says the mother is “doing a great job.” The two males and one female were born to mother Masu and dad Timur. The cubs will live in the red panda exhibit after zoo staff members feel the little ones can navigate the exhibit’s trees and other features. The zoo is auctioning naming rights in support of red panda conservation. Bids can be placed online.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The last four members of a wolf pack that preyed on cattle in a rural area of the state bordering Canada have been killed by state hunters, prompting protests from environmental groups. The four wolves were part of a pack that originally had seven members and attacked cows, killing or wounding them 29 times since 2018 and nine times over the past month, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement Friday. Agency director Kelly Susewind authorized the killings of the remaining pack members July 31. Environmental groups opposed the killings, which they contended benefited one ranching operation in Ferry County in the remote Kettle River Range. Hunters for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife who were inside helicopters tracked down and shot the wolves from the air Friday, agency spokeswoman Sam Montgomery says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain Valley Pipeline has suspended some construction activities that could affect threatened or endangered species. WVPR-FM reports pipeline officials sent a letter last week telling federal regulators about the voluntary suspension in areas where construction could affect protected bat and fish species. The move follows a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups last week that challenged approvals by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Conservation groups are asking the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to toss two key permits issued to the 303-mile natural gas pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia. The 4th Circuit last month threw out the same Fish and Wildlife approvals for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Regulators say the pipeline may not resume the suspended construction without first seeking approval.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Native American tribes in the state are receiving federal grants for renewable energy projects that tribe members say will help reduce costs and lead to energy independence. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Odanah received a nearly $1 million grant, and the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Crandon got a grant for more than $1.5 million. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the grants will be used to install solar panels at tribal buildings. The move is expected to save the tribes millions of dollars in energy spending over the next 25 years. The Wisconsin tribes are among 12 nationwide that received a total of 14 grants from the federal Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs worth a total of $16 million.\n\nWyoming\n\nPowell: Wildlife officials say fewer grizzly bears have been euthanized this year in Yellowstone National Park compared to previous years. The Powell Tribune reports the U.S. Geological Survey says nine grizzlies were euthanized in Wyoming this year, but the number could increase before the bears go into hibernation in December. Officials say the Wyoming Game and Fish Department killed a record-high 32 grizzly bears in 2018, including 17 by mid-August last year. Officials say grizzly bears are euthanized to manage conflicts at the park that spans across Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Wildlife officials say three bears have also died in automobile collisions. Officials say they encourage people in the region to carry some type of defense in case of an encounter.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2021/08/09/2021-treasure-coast-municipal-elections-candidate-questionnaires-more/8091531002/", "title": "2021 Treasure Coast municipal elections: candidate questionnaires ...", "text": "In July we began to ask candidates to fill out questionnaires to help you understand your choices on the various fall municipal ballots.\n\nThe following candidate responses were not edited.\n\nOur editorial board planned to interview candidates for selected races.

Once I have finished my session with each class families of the Treasure Coast and St. Lucie County Children Service Council sponsors our once a month community project to turn everyday citizens into leaders for the communities that need it most.\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nI am running for the very same seat I originally ran for back in 2018 when I was only 24 years old because the platform and initiatives I stood for back then still lack within our city hall and District 1 community today. I believe that now more than ever we need to have a leader with new fresh ideas, innovative thinking, and the ability to network beyond our District lines to secure the resources District 1 needs to be successful. I posses the qualities and character needed to ensure District 1 of Fort Pierce doesn't continue to stay complacent and stagnate due to ineffective representation. Just like the previous commissioner of this seat Commissioner Rufus Alexander my love and want to see our hometown succeed runs deep and is at the core of who I am! I envisions a District 1 community that is independent from the economics of Downtown and self efficient enough to provide its own economic boast within the west corridor of Fort Pierce, Fl. This includes a high emphasis on trade programs and increased qualified workforce in District 1 of Fort Pierce, FL. I was raised by the elders of our community like many others in my generation to step up when the time came and be a authentic unbought voice for those who will need us most. District 1 will be more powerful and ready to combat gentrification with both the wisdom of our elders and the strength of our youth. This is the only way we will see true progress for District 1 when we build that bridge between generational leadership and work towards a common cause. Don't complain be the change isn't just my slogan it's a lifestyle.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nMy top priority during my first year as commissioner of District 1 would be my \"Build the workforce\" initiative program. I would first create a partnership to certify as many residents of District 1 in some type or multiple trade programs. I'd team up and work with IRSC Blackburn center that's right in the middle of my District and Green Task Work Force to increase our certified work force in the District by 60% or more by the end of 2022. Then work with as many local trade job opportunities and apprenticeships to funnel those certified workers into well paid trade jobs. One of the biggest issues my community has is the lack of capital to even begin to think about combating gentrification and increasing homeownership. I want to change this by increasing the average household income our community posses by replacing the minimum wage type work most are doing in our community with well paid trade work. This will now put our people in a position to not only talk about the issue but become active in combating them with financial backing and knowledge. This is how we truly save our community from being bought out and pushed away. I will do all I can to give the power back to the residents of District 1.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nThe biggest difference between my opponents and I would be my ability to build a network for myself and others beyond age, race, religion, and beliefs. I have been able to build strong friendship and partnerships with such a diverse group of people that has allowed me to be a self made successful entrepreneur at age 27. Building a better network of support for District 1 is key in getting us the resources and funding needed to progress it. I have worked for national pacs, non profits, and a United States Presidential campaigns which gives me the most experience in grassroots organizing and has allowed me to view the community blueprint of many cities around this country just like ours both the good and the bad. This has allowed me to learn from other cities mistakes and avoid problems for my own community I wish to represent. I have an amazing ability to organize people of different backgrounds towards a common goal. As one of the major leaders for the Black Lives Matter Movement last year in the Treasure Coast I was able to bring together hundreds of people in peaceful protest alongside local law enforcement in a time when many in our country were rioting I helped to lead effective protesting that was both peaceful and empowering. I am also the only candidate with the capability to bring more young leaders to the table and to inspire them to be the change that their community needs and we all know the the youth must step up if we are to ever see true change. The last thing District 1 needs is complacent leadership we need now more than ever fresh blood to shake up city hall and push District 1 towards a better future and I believe I am the candidate that can commit to doing that. I will always stand up for what I believe in and keep the needs of my constituents at the core of my policies and choices. I can care less about the position and title itself I am doing this because the position has the power to move District 1 my home into a better place that's beneficial for everyone not just a few.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I want to make sure that the industrial and economic growth that appears to heading to Fort Pierce is fairly allocated to the residents of District 1. I want Fort Pierce to set up training and internships for the expected trades coming to this area. If the residents are trained and given the opportunity to have careers instead of jobs, the City will flourish.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nLearning the specific facts of the 3 top priorities on the table of the current commission and understanding how to benefit all residents of Fort Pierce. I would start trying to mend the rift between the County Commissioners and the City Commissioners as bringing people together is one of my strong points. We all must work together to be a great City.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI have the ability to reach all areas of our community. I have the Education to understand the issues. The Experience to serve in a leadership roles, and the Ethics to never put the City or myself in any situation that would cause harm or embarrassment. I have a Florida and Washington DC bar license that I will not jeopardize for anyone.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I believe it is the greatest City in the world. It has so much potential waiting to be explored. It has had a negative stigma historically in so many aspects but that only leaves me to believe up is the only direction and I’m motivated and ready for the challenge to do all I can while I can to make it better.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nThe City of Fort Pierce was drastically impacted by COVID-19, there needs to be comprehensive plans to bring the citizens as well as the businesses back up to par and running full force in a positive direction. Also, our Police Department has got to establish a more conducive relationship with the general public in order to eradicate and stop crime, this is a benefit of small cities that has not taken place yet in the city of Fort Pierce.\n\nAlso, there needs to be a stronger effort towards strengthening many small businesses that have been closed to due to COVID. The city has so many resources available in the form of infrastructure and buildings that need to be utilized to assist the suffering businesses. Right now, we’re in a crisis, there is no time for on-the-job training my experience brings so much to the table to come out of the starting blocks running to protect the welfare and well-being of the citizen in so many areas.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from the other candidates in this race?\n\nExperience in these critical times is very important. I have a proven track record of having passionate, candid, serious character when it comes to holding political office and representing people. In the past I tackled the big issues even through the local and surrounding politicians had not addressed the underlying issue. I am an elected official not a politician. For example, when COVID-19 initially started I was the first to be initiated fighting it by having a self-sponsored testing site as well as a self-sponsored food drive, also in order to protect the well-being of the public. I initiated a policy for mandating body cameras and penalizing those officers who did not feel it necessary to turn on body cameras.\n\nHave you ever filed bankruptcy?

My wife, Alise, and I own our home, raise our children, and serve this city through our work in the St. Lucie County School District and the St. Lucie County Fire District, respectively. I love PSL, and I will not allow it to be overrun by out of town business interests that just want to make a profit. We can achieve growth without sacrificing our identity. Port St. Lucie is unique. Our wildlife and environment are central to the character and culture of our city. I am concerned that out of control growth without any regard for our fragile ecosystem, our precious waterways, and the needs and wants of PSL residents will ultimately result in a PSL that is indistinguishable from any other South Florida City. The future of Port St. Lucie should belong to the people who actually live here, not outside special interests.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nMy top priority would be to work with my fellow city council members to make sure we focus on sustainable smart growth while emphasizing safe pedestrian infrastructure such as more sidewalks, streetlights, and bike lanes. It’s also imperative that any growth that negatively impacts our environment is a non starter. Our unique ecosystem means everything to our hikers, hunters, kayakers and sport fishermen.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI’ve dedicated my career to a lifetime of public service. I have served my country and my community as a United States Marine, a firefighter, and a paramedic. For too long, our politics has been defined by individuals who only wish to advance themselves and the agendas of their largest donors. As someone who understands the meaning of service, I promise that serving the people of Port Saint Lucie will be my first and only priority. I believe great things are coming to Port St. Lucie. We can continue to grow our city while simultaneously promoting smart, sustainable policies to ensure that growth is managed responsibly.

I currently work for Cleveland Clinic as a pharmacist in the Emergency Department, serving both Martin and St. Lucie County.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nIn the past, I have worked with various organizations to help with local food drives and community health fairs. I have taken it upon myself to independently raise money for charitable organizations. I have utilized my skills to participate in community outreach in the form of medication reviews. I have partnered with the American Cancer Society to raise thousands of dollars for breast cancer awareness. I continuously assist in preparing the next generation of healthcare professionals.\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nI have lived in Port Saint Lucie for almost 20 years. During these past two decades our fellow citizens have been asked to make sacrifices; to pay a premium in taxes to live here without the municipal services to reflect that. Year after year revenue and expenditures have increased by double digits while tax cuts barely offset increased assessments let alone any cost-of-living increases. 2021 is reflective of this situation: groceries, gasoline, housing, and general inflation have made it harder for people to make ends meet. Yet, Port Saint Lucie has initiated tens of millions of dollars in new projects. I’m running to overturn the status quo of high taxes and low-paying jobs in our community.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain.\n\nTaxes and a lack of high-paying jobs are the biggest issues in our city. The excessive taxes imposed on our residents are not reflective of the region we live in when compared to our neighboring communities. Our high taxes take a disproportional amount of the net income from our citizens and reduce the availability of disposable income. Miniscule tax cuts while simultaneously increasing our expenditures by double-digit percentages is a flawed economic strategy. If elected I would champion aggressive tax cuts with the obligation on the city to make sacrifices and alleviate the burden on our families. It is much easier to cut the fat from a $150 million dollar budget than it is to squeeze more out of a $30K income.\n\nSkilled workers struggle to find high-paying jobs in our city. They eventually conclude that the few skilled-based jobs available are low-paying. It wasn’t that long ago that we had ambitions of being the biotech capital of Florida with high-paying salaries. Yet, we now celebrate near minimum wage warehouse jobs that won’t put a dent in our dismal 24:100 jobs to population ratio, which is one of the lowest in Florida. This is a direct result of our city being a poor incubator for businesses that can offer high-paying, skilled jobs. Businesses in Port Saint Lucie survive despite the government. The solution to this issue is to lower taxes which provides a better environment for businesses to succeed. This increases their demand for skilled workers allowing them the ability to provide higher-paying jobs out of necessity. Those new jobs and higher incomes can pay dividends in increased disposable income, thus synergistically continuing the cycle of economic growth. This principle shows that tax cuts do not necessarily mean revenue cuts.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nElected government officials should be servants to those they represent, and I believe that people need to be reminded of this order. I’m beholden to no one, and my only loyalty is to my fellow Port Saint Lucie residents. My goal is to champion a clear direction where the residents are the priority, not governmental agendas. At work I follow a simple rule, I treat everyone as though they were my mother. I expect other people to do the same. I do not believe anyone would be okay with taxing their mother to such a degree that they can’t afford the necessities in life.\n\nI do not have ambitions to permanently sit on the City Council, and I do not want to be a “career” council member. I want to affect real change to bring down our high taxes and move on so the next person can bring their ideas to the table. I agree with term limits, and I think there should be limits on how long our mayor and council members can serve. This ensures fresh ideas come into our city for the right reasons and with altruistic motives. I will not take a salary because we are servants in our communities, and those funds could be allocated better elsewhere. I consider it a conflict of interest for elected officials to vote on and give themselves their own pay raise, nor should they make more than the average per capita income of our citizens. City servants should not make more than those they serve.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Explain\n\nMy top priority in my first year in office will be ensuring Port St. Lucie remains the best place in the country to live, do business, and raise a family. In order to accomplish this, I will focus on several areas, including:\n\nTraffic: We cannot allow Port St. Lucie to experience the traffic nightmares of Fort Lauderdale or Miami. We must smartly plan our growth, invest in our roads, and ensure developer-paid fees are spent here in Port St. Lucie, not disproportionately north of Midway Road.\n\nProperty Taxes: St. Lucie County has one of the highest property tax rates in the state. I pledge to vote to continue lowering the city's property tax rate and will use my experience as a former county commissioner to lobby the county to lower their portion of the tax bill as well.\n\nPublic Safety: Port St. Lucie is the safest large city in Florida and we must keep it that way. I pledge to vote to give our police officers the resources and training they need to protect our community. I support the addition of a police division within Tradition and the construction of a police training facility within the city limits.\n\nEconomic Opportunity: We must continue to attract high-quality companies to our city, so there are high-wage jobs for our existing residents and so our young people can remain here or return home like I did to build their families and careers.\n\nAccessibility: This is our community.

I am extremely knowledgeable about Port St Lucie’s history and I believe that I have the experience necessary to help lead our city into the future, continuing to lower our taxes, keeping our city a “safest city” and protecting our precious waterways and environment. As a stable family man, I know how challenging it can be to raise a family in today’s world, with all the worries that comes with being a parent, like safety, education and putting food on the table. As a business owner, I understand our businesses’ needs as well, including lower taxes, code compliance, paying an affordable rent and attracting the right employees. As an attorney, I am skilled at negotiations and reading contracts, something I believe will serve the City well as new businesses and opportunities are brought before the council. I also served on several boards and committees with the City over the years, including the Planning and Zoning Board, and have a good background on how the city operates.\n\nI have worked hard over the years to earn the support and respect of hundreds of people in the business and legal industries. I know that I can help sustain the quality of Port St. Lucie through experience, integrity and honesty. Finally, I am running because I believe in giving back to my community to make it a better place to live. I believe in Service Above Self.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nBecause I have followed the City Council over the past few years, I believe the City Council has done a good job forming a strategic plan to guide their decision-making going into the future.\n\nHowever, there are things that I think need to be revisited, such as the water and sewer program to encourage those residents not hooked up to the system to do the right thing and connect. Water quality is key to the success of our city. We have seen over the years, how the North Fork and St. Lucie River’s have been under attack. I believe the city needs to look at other alternatives or best practices from other cities to encourage the 12,000 homeowners who haven’t connected to the city sewer system to hook up. The effluent going into the ground is not good for anyone, and we have already seen the impacts it has. I am interested in pursuing a plan by which those homes with septic are given every opportunity to convert with assistance, if necessary, through grants and special funding. The city still offers an interest free payment plan, but the city also needs to find other ways to better incentivize the homeowners to hook up. Over the last few years a few plans have been discussed and I believe it is time to review the efforts that have been made and revisit those options, whether it be a staggered approach for homes close to the waterways to hook up within a certain time or at time of resale of the property.\n\nAnother priority that I hope to tackle is the redevelopment of the east side of Port St. Lucie. The western side of our city is moving along at a fast pace, bringing thousands of homes and new residents, new retail and dining opportunities and higher paying jobs to our area. But just as important is the eastern portion of the city, especially the redevelopment of City Center. We need a triangulated approach bringing in government, the public and the private sector to create something that will benefit our residents east of the river, the way St. Lucie West and Tradition benefits the residents in the western side of our city.\n\nFinally, public safety is another important issue is making sure our city maintains it’s “safest city” designation by ensuring our law enforcement officers and officials maintain the highest standard of education and training, and have the most innovative equipment to help them do their jobs and keep our citizens safe.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nAll of my opponents are admirable for wanting to give their time in helping to guide the city. What sets me apart is my background in understanding the law, my background in being a part of numerous boards and committees over the years, giving me a broad perspective of the city and how it operates and the fact that I am a husband, son, father.\n\nMy community service is multifaceted to serve our business community, children, economic development and the impoverished. This service has included Hibiscus Children’s Center, Port St. Lucie Historical Society, 18th Congressional District Service Academy Panel, 19th Judicial Circuit Teen Court, St. Lucie County Economic Development Council, City of Port St. Lucie Planning and Zoning, Port St. Lucie Chamber of Commerce Area Council, City of Port St. Lucie Youth Court, Economic Growth Team of Port St. Lucie, Former Port St. Lucie City Council Candidate, Port St. Lucie Bar Association, and Rotary.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain: No\n\nCampaign website: https://votetraviswalker.com/\n\nTavaris Williams\n\nAge: 39\n\nEducational background: MPA, B.A- Sociology\n\nCurrent occupation and work history:\n\nI am a Contract Manager with Communities Connected for Kids, Inc- the lead community based care organization of the Treasure Coast that is responsible for child welfare and foster care.\n\nI have served as a Dependency Case Manager, as a Quality Assurance Manager, as a Program Director over Permanency and Community Resources, as well as in Contracts over my professional career- all in serving children and families in the state of Florida.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nI actively serve Port St. Lucie not because I'm campaigning, but because I'm fully ingrained into this community. I serve at the Treasure Coast Food Bank, United Way, United Against Poverty, Project Hope, Habitat for Humanity, Graceway Village, Goodwill, Salvation Army, and Veterans of War to name some of the organizations that I actively serve.\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nI'm running for office because I want Port St. Lucie to be a vibrant city for its residents for generations to come. It has provided my family safety, personal growth, a great career, and amazing friends. I care what happens to it, I care about its people, and I want to serve it in a capacity that allows me the direct ability to help retain its beauty, to sustain its growth in a responsible way, and to give its residents an affordable and desirable place to live and work.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nFurther Economic development is needed in Port St. Lucie. Too many of our residents are forced to find work in other counties due to the lack of opportunity within our city limits. I will partner with our city and county business navigators and officials to pursue business enterprises that would align with the academic and vocational skills currently being taught to our students. Port St. Lucie graduates youth at a remarkable rate of 98%, presenting a very attractive employee base for large businesses, if we continue to market our talent wisely. These actions would be in conjunction with supporting the small businesses of the city, and ensuring we as a governing body are giving them every opportunity to establish themselves, grow, and thrive.\n\nMy second priority would be to attract additional entertainment venues for residents to enjoy would also drastically improve the quality of life for our residents. Life is hard. The grind is very real for our families. Having ways in which to relax, laugh, and to relieve stress are all needed in maintaining a healthy balance in our lives. As Port St. Lucie’s demographics shift to include more families as well as young adults, these entertainment opportunities will help keep Port St. Lucie relevant as an amenity filled, vibrant city. This can be accomplished by the city showcasing its young, modern minds, cementing that we will support their business ventures, their ideas, and add their unique energy to a city that is rapidly growing and evolving.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nAs the son of a police officer and teacher, duty to community was instilled in me at an early age. My entire career has been serving families in the foster care system. I have seen true pain and trauma first hand professionally, and understand the importance of the decisions that those in leadership make, and how those decisions can lead to the prosperity or ruin of a community. My experience has showed me the cost of unintended consequences and the results of planning being short-sighted.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

I have had my own company since 2012 but have also worked in the Fortune 50. I now work as an independent technology consultant and investor. I hunt for projects I am truly passionate about and am especially interested in building long term business relationships founded on quality teamwork and communication. My work experience is extensive and you can read all about it on my personally built website.\n\nPlease see damosdesigns.com for more information.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nI've always been a volunteer and dedicate as much time as I can helping others.\n\nI've volunteered at schools and universities teaching about Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Software Development, and Game Design.\n\nI donate time and resources to the local Sebastian Property Owners Association.\n\nI participate in local events and have completed hundreds of hours of local voluntary community service.\n\nI donate my hair to children with hair loss.\n\nI 3D print prosthetic hands through the E-nable foundation to give children a free hand as an alternative to incredibly expensive prosthesis.\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nWe are taking the city back from the developers who want to destroy our environment and lifestyle, and from the corrupt government officials who carelessly spend our hard earned taxes. I was raised on the Lagoon: boating, fishing, crabbing, and clamming. We live in one of the most incredible natural landscapes in the country and along the nation's first wildlife preserve. We should be on the bleeding edge and leading the state with the most sophisticated solutions. I believe that the city has been spending our hard earned taxes in ways that do not benefit our community for far too long. They take our tax money to build facilities that the general public aren't allowed to use with contractors from out of town during a time we should be supporting our own contractors and investing our tax money back into our community. Meanwhile our residential streets flood and are filled with potholes. We've got potholes in the middle of one of our main intersections on US1 and 512. We've seen street signs on the ground on US1 for weeks at a time. We've got trash all up and down our riverfront because we have almost no recycling or trash bins along our riverfront walk. We have a 2021-2022 budget of $48 million. I want to make sure the people's money gets spent in a way that benefits the people who work so hard to make it.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nEnsuring we have a long term plan to preserve our environment and stop frivolous spending. This includes protecting our wildlife, helping our small businesses succeed, and ensuring our hard earned tax dollars get spent on our publicly accessible assets rather than on fancy facilities only our government officials get to use.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI'm the only Sebastian raised native and the only candidate younger than 50. Sebastian has been my home since I was born here 29 years ago. I plan on raising my children and grandchildren here and want to make sure they get to enjoy the same beautiful upbringing my generation was so blessed to have here in Sebastian. I've worked on many teams where I've needed to lead people twice my age so I'm not concerned about holding my own on the council. My youth is an asset. This city needs a pair of fresh eyes to see through the corruption and young blood to get it done right. My extensive background in technology will allow me to look at improving our community with the next generation of tech in mind. My career has been filled with solving hard problems with creative solutions. No other candidate will look at the problems our community has with the same perspective. My decisions will consider the short term as important as the long term because Sebastian has been, and will always be, my home.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain:\n\nNever filed for bankruptcy. My bills have always been paid on time. My credit score is great. I usually win whenever I play Monopoly.\n\nFrederick Jones\n\nAge: 58\n\nEducational background: Some college\n\nCurrent occupation and work history: Currently serving as a Councilman for Sebastian, I spent 6 years in the United States Marines and Retired from the Florida Highway Patrol after more than 30 years.\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\nI served 12 years on the Board of Directors for the Substance Awareness Center and formally the Chair of it's Board.

My credentials in 35 years of government work afford me the ability to begin working on day one for YOU. My decisions are made from honesty, integrity, and experience. I will ask the tough questions. I believe in a culture where people are heard, respected, and understood. I will learn from others; bring together different points of view; do my research, explain, and inform my opinions; become a resource for resolution; and work tirelessly for YOU!\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office?

More than ever, the City Council is in serious need of a fresh perspective from someone with no preconceptions. We should be systematically planning for the future and becoming proactive vs reactive in addressing the concerns of our citizens. My abilities lie in listening to people and then knitting various opinions together to build consensus and provide viable solutions.

Both the vitality of the City and future City revenue streams hinge on the successful completion of this once in a generation project.\n\n- The successful relocation of the Wastewater the Treatment Plant in a cost-effective manner needs to go forward. The obstacles both political and legal, need to be addressed to the satisfaction of all parties. The future health of the citizens, the lagoon, and the city are intricately entwined, and the city council must pay close attention to ensure this project goes forward in a successful manner and does not become a long-term cost burden.\n\n- To ensure that the success of the above projects and other issues within the City I would actively work to encourage outreach efforts, enhance communications and interactions with our community, while empowering staff and commissions to find solutions to residents’ concerns before they go before the city council. In this way, city council can give residents the most cost-effective, well-reasoned public service they deserve.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nIn a phrase…A completely fresh set of eyes and ears. I have gained a unique perspective into our city and its needs through my community involvement, but I also offer a rather fresh perspective since I am a comparative newcomer to the area. The same few issues have been at the forefront for our Council for some time, yet there has been surprisingly little movement forward. My sincere belief, is that it’s time for a new leader who listens to the citizenry and commissions, takes a fresh approach, and can propel projects forward. One thing is certain; The costs of completing large scale projects is not going down. Financial pressures need to be aggressively addressed. Now more than ever, the City Council is in serious need of a jumpstart! When you couple my current civic connections with my ability to consult and collaborate, we can continue to ensure that Vero Beach remains a wonderful place to live.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

We raised our two children here.\n\nFolks have been encouraging me to run for office. I have been told that, among other leadership qualities, I am a good listener. Folks want to know that their concerns are heard and someone cared enough to take time to listen to them. Many feel they will not be heard or bullied if they try to speak up. I always give the floor to those who wish to speak what’s on their minds, and do not embarrass, bully or shut down anyone. I have taken up many issues before the city council and I am seen as one who has a knowledge base of municipal operations and that I don’t hesitate to get necessary information. I am seen as one who takes a stand. And that I work till the conclusion of projects such as: the restoration of Jacoby and Piece of Pie Pocket Parks that included new playground equipment and lighting, the paving of 18th Street with sidewalks between 20th and 27th Avenues, the 90th Anniversary of The City of Vero Beach where I interviewed and recorded Pioneer Histories, the voter approved 2014 Parks Referendum which included adding Leisure Square to our City Charter, joining with Citizens to Save Leisure Square Pool in 2019, Neighborhood Plans for Osceola Park and Original Town, National Historic Designation for Osceola Park Neighborhood, the Art Village in the Edgewood Neighborhood, the current Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and currently supporting the Police Budget including Body Cams this year, supporting the purchase of a second street sweeper as another tool in the tool box for a healthy Lagoon, as well as the constructing of a new state of the art wastewater treatment facility.\n\nThe City of Vero Beach has always been on the move toward progress at her own pace. There are many unique qualities the City of Vero Beach has developed over time while maintaining her treasured identity. Folks have felt comfortable growing up and remaining here, raising families, or after moving to other locations, returning to Vero Beach, opening businesses, working for various medical, realtor, school, airport, landscape, restaurant, entertainment, the arts, security, construction, and other occupations. Many work on family farms, citrus groves, tree farms, construction enterprises, at retail stores. Many have chosen the difficult, thankless, but appreciated and necessary path of Protect and Serve as Sheriff Deputies and Police.\n\nIt is beneficial to remember our heritage as we move forward. Any change to our quality of life requires careful consideration.\n\nVero Beach is bridged by shared interests connected by the Indian River Lagoon as a\n\ncommunity of Neighborhoods. The Heart of our City is our Neighborhoods.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\n-On September 21, 2021, the City Council discussed and agreed to continue with: constructing a new state of the art wastewater treatment facility (a new water reclamation facility (WRF)) at the City Airport, pursuing grants for canal water treatment for reuse for irrigation, and decommissioning of the current wastewater treatment plant. I propose action that continues with this process and other to address the health of the Lagoon, and to address actual need and pollution type(s), including water quality monitoring, to assure any tax dollars/fees will address cause, effect and cure.\n\n-Continue open meeting discussions on the 3corners; there is a proposal on the table and the city council is waiting to hear from interested developers.\n\n-Taxpayers are always a priority.\n\n-Continue funding our Police\n\n-Continue to support local business for a healthy economy while respecting the unique quality of life our neighborhoods treasure. Vero Beach’s City Charter protects our low density, low height, low impact profile. I will work to ensure our City Charter is respected and kept public as a guide for any future development.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI have always been and will continue to be an advocate for a positive and prosperous Vero Beach. I am the candidate who is best prepared to step up and perform the duties of a Vero Beach City Council member, and have acquired specific knowledge based in local government and our community as can be seen on my resume. With a proven record of leadership, I am also a team player who will work for the good of the city residents and businesses. I have been an active civic and service volunteer in the Vero Beach community since 1986, spending hundreds of hours communicating, volunteering and achieving with many others in accomplishing a wide range of goals for children, families and local businesses. I have the ability to turn a negative into a positive and common-sense reasoning to consensus building on multiple levels. This is necessary when debating with fellow City Council Members and other Elected Officials to further the best interests of the taxpayer, residents, and businesses. My experience and understanding are enhanced after living in Vero Beach since 1975. Working with, and in the community, puts me in a unique position to represent all of Vero Beach.\n\nMy sleeves are rolled up as a volunteer and I will continue to respectfully work for the citizens of Vero Beach as your City Council Member. I am humbled by the support I have received and respectfully ask for your vote.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Also, a local who I proposed to in November. This is home and where we will raise our family. I’m concerned what type of Vero Beach were going to inherit 20-30 years from now because the reality is my generation will live with the consequences from the decisions being made today. I hope to build on Vero’s strong foundation with a New Perspective.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nPreserving the Indian River Lagoon – This is one of the most valuable resources to our city and county. It has been a great benefit to local residents, visitors, and the boating community. Its cleanup will require concerted action. If elected, the first goal for its advantage would be removing the City’s Waste Water Treatment plant off the Lagoon. This has been discussed since 2010 and here we are eleven years later still deliberating the matter. Secondly, I would contact other elected officials along the Indian River Lagoon to see what efforts they are taking and have been doing so. We need to unite and tackle this issue together.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nVero Beach is home to many retiree citizens, but many young adults, including myself, have found this area as an ideal location to call home. The representation on City Council should reflect said demographic. It’s crucial, now more than ever, to have a voice on Council who can relate to the working class after their attempts to impose a new tax after we just experienced an unimaginable pandemic that impacted many city residents and local businesses. I’m here to offer a fresh new perspective and be your voice on Vero Beach City Council.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain:\n\nNo.\n\nLink to campaign website or social media page:\n\nfacebook.com/votetaylordingle\n\nRey Neville\n\nAge: 79\n\nEducational background:\n\nBS-business; MS-HRM; MS-Telecommunications\n\nCurrent occupation and work history:\n\nCity council of Vero Beach, FL.\n\nPrevious employment:\n\n- College instructor - graphic design, software used in graphic design\n\n- Executive VP - point-of-purchase design and manufacturing with focus on beverages\n\n- Colonel, United States Air Force - 26 year career with focus in Telecommunications\n\nVolunteer and civic engagement:\n\n- Past Commodore, Vero Beach Yacht Club\n\n- Director, Florida Council of Yacht Clubs\n\n- FOSI volunteer for several years\n\n- KIRB cleanup volunteer; judge in annual awards\n\n- Leukemia and Lymphoma Society volunteer for many years\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nI think I have the right perspective on building a better and Improved Vero Beach, and I think I can make a difference. We need the waste water plant off the lagoon. We need an aggressive effort toward stormwater management. The \"3-Corners\" needs to be done right, and i can contribute to that effort.\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\nThe Lagoon is our top priority. A dead lagoon will kill our economy and we must not let that happen. Many people no longer fish in the lagoon and certainly do not swim in it around Vero where the nearly stagnant water flushes so slowly. Enteric bacteria is found in several places within the city limits. We must replace the wastewater plant and install a state-of-the art facility in a non-flood zone on the other side of the RR tracks at the city water facility on the airport. Stormwater management is next followed by an aggressive septic-to-sewer program.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\nI have lived in Germany and Turkey and learned how to adapt to their culture. I have implemented the Deming principle, frequently referred to as total quality management, something the Japanese have mastered and use to their great advantage. I have commanded two military organizations and was program manager for a $500M telecommunications program for the Air Force. I transitioned from a military environment to a civilian design and plastics manufacturing setting starting directly as Executive Vice President. I again adapted to a new setting as a college instructor, seamlessly. Lastly, in the past two years I have successfully operated in the political arena as a council member and vice mayor for the City of Vero Beach and look forward to doing so for the next two years. Most importantly, I have no political aspirations other than do the very best I can for the city I grew up in and love.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy?

Member\n\nStroke of Hope Club (assist stroke victims) President\n\nWhy are you running for office?\n\nTo My Fellow Vero Residents,\n\nIn 2009 I made the motion that eventually led to the sale of Vero Electric. But the task is not yet complete. I also promised that the sale would not change Vero or tarnish our unique quality of life. I seek a seat on the Vero Council to get the rest of the job done without further delay and to fulfill my promise to ensure that Vero Beach will stay the Vero Beach we know and love forever. I plan to use the skills of my public career to:\n\n1.Move ahead with a long term plan to remove the old power plant and make it useful to the public\n\n2.Not only will I NOT DEFUND THE POLICE, it is my # 1 priority. Stop crime before it gets here.\n\n3.Opponents of the electric sale lamented that taxes would soar, but they were wrong. Vero Beach does not need the proposed new stormwater tax. In fact, I will oppose ANY new tax.\n\nKEEP VERO VERO FOREVER……VOTE WILSON FOR CITY COUNCIL\n\nWhat would be your top priority during your first year in office? Explain:\n\n1. Development of the three corners property at 17th and Indian River Blvd.\n\nIn 2009 I was the first to advocate for the sale of Vero Electric. It took me 9 years to accomplish that task. I am grateful to so many people for their support to make that happen. It changed the future of Vero Beach for the better.\n\nUnfortunately, as my good friend Joel Tyson says, “Government moves at glacial speed” and it looks like without someone being elected to move the issue forward, it may take another 9 years to finish the task. Make the Electric property useful for you, its public owners.\n\nI have many friends who have spent many hours on plans. I am grateful for their work but I just don’t think we are there yet. This is a 100 year decision. Once that property is in use it is likely to be that way for 100 years. We only have one chance to get it right and make it a centerpiece for Vero on par with Riverside Park, The Playhouse and the Vero Beach Art Museum.\n\n2. Taxes\n\nWhen I promised to sell Vero Electric in 2009 I also promised that the sale would not result in the loss of Vero’s unique quality of life. Vero is irreplaceable. Perfect! Leave it alone!\n\nOpponents of the sale said “there will be mass layoffs, service will disappear, and taxes will explode”. None of this happened just as we predicted. Unfortunately, the same people who opposed the sale are themselves pushing for a new tax on Vero Property including businesses, residents and churches in the form of a stormwater tax.\n\nWe do not need even more expansion of government and more taxes. We have made giant strides protecting our lagoon and are on track to reduce pollution and protect our environment without this unnecessary tax.\n\n3. Crime.\n\nNothing can destroy the peace and tranquility of a town faster than rising crime. My aunt is the Mayor of Fort Pierce. She is making great progress but I know how high crime can scar a city’s reputation. Unfortunately, I have seen evidence that crime around us is now coming to this city.\n\nDefund the police is a national outrage and I vow that support for our Vero Beach Police Department is my priority. We must stop crime before it gets here. How many officers does it take to keep Vero safe? Answer: As many as they need!\n\n4. Our natural beauty.\n\nIn addition to our friendly nature Vero Beach is simply beautiful. Our lagoon is a central component. We have so many fine organizations and citizens active in protecting the lagoon and using City services to keep our City clean and healthy, we need to listen to them.\n\n5. Economic Development\n\nAlmost ten years ago I started the Vero Beach Chamber of Commerce. I and others felt it was time to have an organization to advocate for the Vero Beach business Community. I began a campaign to allow Vero Beach to receive its fair share of the County Tourist Development Tax. Others after me have failed to achieve that goal but like the sale of Vero Electric, I have a plan and believe that I can finally get that done.\n\nIt should also be noted that Vero’s number of locally owned businesses has been getting smaller in each of the last five years. That constant erosion is harmful to our way of life. Do we want only national chain stores operating in Vero? No.\n\nWhat distinguishes you from your opponents in this race?\n\n1. Accomplishments in the past and accomplishments in the future.\n\nThey say, “if you want something done give it to a busy man”. Likewise, if you want to actually accomplish things instead of endlessly talking about it give it to someone who has accomplished things in the past.\n\nIn addition to the sale of Vero Electric, I was instrumental in establishing Imagine Charter School in Indian River County. There were many objections and the vote on the County Commission was 3 to 2. Despite that opposition there are now over 900 happy families and students at Imagine Schools.\n\nAnother benefit and accomplishment is reducing impact fees. The County was making a killing collecting huge impact fees for things that were no longer needed. I fought for and received more that $2 million in refunds and many more millions back to the community through reduced impact fees.\n\nI won a 2500 foot safe zone around schools and helped Wesley Davis reform technology at the Property Appraisers office by providing online access to homestead applications and, with the help of you, the Realtors of this community, a complete overhaul of the Property Appraisers website. Advances that you probably use every day.\n\n2. The next reason is skill.\n\nIt is not good enough to want to do something, you must have the skill and knowledge to do something. My experience in and out of government has taught me the skills necessary to make things happen while others may require a learning curve, I do not.\n\n3. Demeanor. Let’s leave all the drama to Sebastian\n\nThe press has referred to me as a no nonsense guy. That is partially true, but I have learned since my days having to fight tooth and nail for the sale of Vero Electric, that some things are worth fighting for but not everything is worth fighting for.\n\nMy friend Col. Tony Young taught me to avoid the me versus you, us versus them, situations whenever possible. I may sometimes disagree with the other members of the Council but I respect them and look forward to working with them to find solutions and compromise when we need to do so.\n\nHave you ever filed for bankruptcy? If yes, please explain: no\n\nTracey Zudans\n\nAge: 50\n\nEducational background: University of Florida BS in Advertising\n\nCurrent occupation and work history:\n\nCurrent work:\n\nAdvertising Consultant\n\nWork History:\n\nIRC Hospital District Trustee\n\nPhilanthropist\n\nHome School Teach", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise’s afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. “I knew I wanted to send a message,” he said. He did – and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. “It’s good to see good news and see … that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,” he said. “That’s really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‘Hey, if he’s doing this, so can I.’ ” Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. “Kieran’s Curls for Cancer” has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. “This vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,” according to Dunleavy’s letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor’s correspondence. “We would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,” the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn’t say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving “will be documented in the investigation.” The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff’s office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff’s office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police’s investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn’t get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. “The National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn’t just absurd; it’s undeniably inhumane,” said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn’t comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk – more than a third of the population – have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park’s 106-year history. Last year’s East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park’s 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire’s delicate stroke and insensitive brush. “In some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,” said Doug Parker, the park’s trails supervisor. “In other parts, mainly on the west side, it’s completely black.” Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. “Visitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey’s to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. “The three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,” he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences – such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year’s budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a “supplemental” budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year’s $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation’s capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating – 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 – marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they’re glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state’s largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn’t allow. “We’ve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,” Gillen said. “It’s one of those things where we’re getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.” Gillen said it’s not just more people coming to the beach that’s driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn’t the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 “Palau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee” added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. “This hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau’s protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,” Cruz said. Tourists also sign the “Palau Pledge” and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council’s Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. “The community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,” King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor’s Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. “We really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,” said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. “Does it still make sense today? I don’t know,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. “I certainly didn’t have enough information to make a decision other than let’s maintain where we’re at.” Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor’s mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn’t had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot’s family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter was J.R. Simplot’s ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago’s first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago’s inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. “Graduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt’s exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,” Lightfoot said. “She is the real deal.” Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. “Now we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,” said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won’t do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as “suspicious,” according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is “suspicious.” Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one’s mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika’s Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state’s outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky’s labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the “latter stages” of selecting a contractor to take on the task of “reworking and rebuilding” the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. “If we can modernize our system, that’s going to make a big difference,” he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system’s antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. “It may take two to three years to make that an outcome,” Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. “The fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,” said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. “Something happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state’s history,” said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker’s burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state’s previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents “yet another example” of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. “My heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members – people with meaningful lives,” Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report’s author at the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. “We are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services” or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland’s state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town’s reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town’s efforts. “We look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we’ve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,” Khaldun said. “These deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.” One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. “The whole initial idea of it was to save lives,” McCormick said. “We’ve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.”\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi’s School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program’s goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. “Most participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,” the program’s website says. “Most only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.” The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won’t be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can’t be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment “indirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.” Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson’s administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff’s lawyers said they will appeal Beetem’s decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana’s Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they’re beginning to denude trees around his house. “They’re everywhere,” Wiederrick said. “Drought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.” Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects’ economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That’s enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream’s deep channel “to the extent technically feasible.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak’s earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church’s parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor’s emergency directives. “Unless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law” and “be fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,” the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings’ fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. “It’s a ‘wow’ moment,” Ernie Isley said. “This is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.” The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including “Shout,” “Twist and Shout,” “It’s Your Thing,” “That Lady” and “Fight the Power.” Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie “Animal House,” which iconically features “Shout.” The town’s council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ’60s and ’70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley’s family’s backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group’s new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state’s fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren’t doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state’s numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose – even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on “marginalized communities and inclusive voices” in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle “important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,” the historical society announced Thursday. “We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals’ right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city’s history,” Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation’s chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners’ concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. “Dr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,” Goehring said. “His business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. “Clearly the impact went down after that second week,” DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive’s success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: “When y’all announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‘Yes, I need to go do this now.’ ” DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher’s views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley’s company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon’s land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state’s Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals’ decision to uphold the aviation board’s plan was flawed because “there is no evidence in the record to support LUBA’s erroneous findings” in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body’s decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals “misunderstood its task” and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn’t be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools’ finances, staffing and programming. “We will review the bill when it gets to the desk,” said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. “Some students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,” said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of “noes” have culminated in the Legislature saying “yes” to a proposal that would remove lawmakers’ authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly’s role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. “It is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,” Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. “As a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We’re ready to blast off,” McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn’t worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. “We’re always on alert,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. “It’s quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,” he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it’s taking 60 days. “There’s also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,” he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. “For example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,” Bellinger said. “Each container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.” And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. “Last year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,” he said. “It ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. “You can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don’t have the briefs. You don’t see the arguments. You don’t have the depositions,” Bennett said. “If you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.”\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. “We sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,” the statement said. “We are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.” The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott’s death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of “fatal acute stress response” while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott’s face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. “Our foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.” Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July’s Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except “in certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.” Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. “We’re in our 80s,” Schreiber said. “We have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.” Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell’s commercial art works. “It would appear at this time there’s not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,” said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday’s council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. “Please don’t give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,” Gaston said. “One that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.” White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 “Unite the Right” rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park’s dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. “The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,” Dunn said. “People have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn’t have to fight this hard for it.” The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff’s Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school’s responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won’t have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College’s vaccination requirement was decided by the college’s Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. “I applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,” Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state’s tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. “Last year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,” DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. “Now that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.” The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as “high,” and in Grand Teton it’s “very high.” The scale tops out with “extreme” fire risk. The parks aren’t there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming’s biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/08/pants-gator-luke-perrys-mushroom-suit-crab-comeback-news-around-states/39458813/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A utility that provides drinking water to thousands of people in north Alabama has settled a lawsuit with 3M over chemical contamination. The agreement, announced in a statement by the company and the West Morgan-East Limestone Water and Sewer Authority, allows for the utility to construct a new filtration system for treating water. The water authority has said such a system would cost at least $30 million. The utility sued to make 3M pay for a new water filtration system to remove industrial chemicals that 3M produced for decades along the Tennessee River at Decatur. Federal rules prompted a brief scare in 2016 when the water system told customers not to drink the water because of chemical contamination.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State agencies, cities, the University of Alaska and school districts could not bar individuals from wearing tribal regalia or carrying objects of traditional cultural significance at public events under a bill introduced in the Alaska House. The bill is sponsored by Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky, a Bethel Democrat. The measure, introduced Monday, comes after school district administrators in Anchorage approved changes to allow graduates there to wear traditional tribal regalia and objects of cultural significance at graduation ceremonies. The bill describes a public event as an awards or graduation ceremony, public meeting, or another event held or sponsored by a state agency, municipality or school district or the University of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Blaming sexual images for “poisoning” the minds of Arizonans, Republican senators on Monday adopted a measure declaring pornography a public-health crisis and urging the state to “systemically prevent exposure and addiction.” The resolution – approved by the state House in February – deems the “societal damage of pornography … beyond the capability of the individual to address alone.” It argues that porn can lead to human trafficking, sexual abuse, infidelity, low self-esteem and eating disorders, among other issues. While the measure encourages officials to “educate individuals and families about its harms and develop pornography-recovery programs,” it doesn’t change anything in state law or impose new requirements. The largely symbolic nature spurred Democrats to oppose it on the grounds that it was distracting officials from true public-health crises.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: The city has removed a question from its city job applications that asks about an applicant’s criminal history in an effort to allow people with past criminal convictions to more easily enter the workforce. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the City Council wanted to remove the stigma of a criminal background from otherwise-qualified applicants. City Alderman Lloyd Holcomb Jr. says background checks will still be completed. But he says the new ordinance will give applicants a chance at a “fresh start” and allow them to demonstrate their qualifications before their record is checked. Mayor Shirley Washington says the ordinance will take effect in 30 days. The city of Little Rock and officials in Pulaski County have also removed criminal history disclosures on their job applications.\n\nCalifornia\n\nKernville: Wildlife authorities say new facilities built at the state’s Kern River Hatchery will allow breeding of Kern River rainbow trout that will be planted throughout the Kern River Basin. The plan will allow the territory to be stocked with native fish rather than domesticated strains. Department of Fish and Wildlife biologists plan to collect 50 to 100 mature trout from the Sequoia National Forest backcountry this summer to serve as brood stock for the program. Genetic samples will be taken to produce the best offspring. The program will be enabled by new wells to provide cool, year-round water to overcome the problem of warm summer water temperatures that prevented the hatchery from fully operating. The hatchery will continue to serve as a holding facility for rainbow trout reared elsewhere.\n\nColorado\n\nCoal Basin: The family that owns Walmart Inc. plans to construct public trails on their private land in the state. The Aspen Times reports that members of the Walton family expect to begin construction this summer on more than 4 miles of trails on their property in Coal Basin. The project is expected to be completed in 2020. The family-owned Crystal Basin Holdings LLC gained approval from Pitkin County commissioners in October to build a trail network designed for mountain bikers but also open to runners and hikers. Coal Basin is part of 221 acres owned by the Waltons about 186 miles west of Denver. The property is the last private land once owned by Mid-Continent Resources coal mining company. The remainder was transferred to White River National Forest.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials will pay tribute to the late Ella Grasso, the first woman elected in her own right as governor of a U.S. state. A ceremony marking the late governor’s 100th birthday will be held at 11 a.m. Friday in the Old Judiciary Committee Room at the Connecticut State Capitol. The Democrat was born in Windsor Locks on May 10, 1919, and died Feb. 5, 1981. The first woman to be elected governor without being the wife or widow of a past governor, Grasso served from 1975 until 1980. She previously served as Connecticut Secretary of the State and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. The town of Windsor Locks has declared 2019 the “Year of Ella.” Various events are planned throughout the year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Republican lawmakers are again proposing a constitutional amendment protecting parental rights in the state. The measure introduced Monday is similar to one that was proposed last year but failed to gain traction in the Democrat-led legislature. The bill says parents have a fundamental right to the care, custody and control of their children that should not be infringed by the government unless there is a compelling interest addressed by the least restrictive means. The amendment was first proposed after state education officials backed off a controversial proposal to allow schoolchildren of any age to decide their race and gender self-identity without parental knowledge or consent. Children also could have chosen a preferred name based on those and other “protected characteristics” including ethnicity, color and sexual orientation.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The City Council has approved a study to test playgrounds throughout the district for lead and other chemicals at a cost of more than $800,000, WUSA-TV reports. Video provided by the nonprofit The Ecology Center shows chemists using a high definition X-ray machine to test rubber shreds from Janney Elementary in northwest Washington. The chemists tested about a cup of the shreds used as flooring for the playground and found that out of 34 samples, eight had lead levels over 1,951 parts per million – almost five times higher than the EPA’s 400 ppm standard for lead in soil in playgrounds. Diane Zuckerman, president of the D.C.-based environmental nonprofit National Center for Health Research, says the testing is important because kids can breathe in lead dust or put the colorful pieces in their mouth, exposing them to lead poisoning.\n\nFlorida\n\nPunta Gorda: Sheriff’s officials say a woman pulled a small alligator from her yoga pants during a traffic stop. The Charlotte County sheriff’s deputy stopped a pickup truck Monday afternoon after it ran a stop sign, and driver Michael Clemons, 22, told the deputy he and passenger Ariel Machan-Le Quire, 25, were collecting frogs and snakes under an overpass. He gave the deputy permission to search bags in the truck. When the deputy found 41 three-stripe turtles in the woman’s backpack, he asked if she had anything else. She pulled the 1-foot gator from her yoga pants. Charlotte County Sheriff’s officials suggested an explanation on Twitter for the incident: “Not to be outdone by #FloridaMan, a #FloridaWoman pulled an alligator out of her pants.” The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission has taken over the investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nHoschton: The mayor and a council member in this mostly white city are facing calls to resign over racially divisive comments. At issue is how Mayor Theresa Kenerly treated a black candidate for the city administrator job in Hoschton, in northern Georgia. In documents released by the city, Councilwoman Hope Weeks wrote that the mayor told her Keith Henry was a good candidate, “but he was black and we don’t have a big black population and she just didn’t think Hoschton was ready for that.” Kenerly said she doesn’t recall saying that. At a tense city council meeting Monday, Councilwoman Susan Powers called for resignations of the mayor and her fellow Councilman Jim Cleveland, who has told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he abhors interracial marriage because he’s a Christian.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A section of the USS Missouri is being repaired as part of a $3 million restoration project to address rust and other deterioration on the Pearl Harbor memorial ahead of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II. The 887-foot Missouri was the site of Japan’s unconditional surrender Sept. 2, 1945, in Tokyo Bay. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the battleship will undergo repairs to its aft superstructure that are expected to be completed in August. Last year, a $3.5 million renovation was done on the tallest portion of the superstructure. Michael Carr, president and CEO of the USS Missouri Memorial Association, says rust is an ongoing issue for the historic ship. About 12,000 square feet of steel will be sandblasted and painted, and some 8,000 pounds of steel will be replaced. Five hundred gallons of paint will be used.\n\nIdaho\n\nMeridian: As the state’s population continues to grow, the city is outpacing previous growth estimates. Last year city officials estimated the population would grow to 150,000 residents by 2040. Now new data estimates from consulting firm Raftelis say Meridian is expected to hit that milestone by 2029. Meridian started as a rural farm community that became a Boise bedroom community as the capital city grew. Now the sprawling suburb is popping up on “Best Places to Live” lists, and it’s grown bigger than Nampa, which was the state’s second-largest city until 2016. Matt Stoll, director of the Community Planning Associated of Southwest Idaho, says the total population of the Treasure Valley region, which includes Boise, Meridian, Caldwell and Nampa, is expected to surpass 1 million residents in the next 20 years.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: Two universities are putting together what they say is the first database to focus on twins in the state. Northwestern University and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign say in a news release that they’re launching the Illinois Twins Project. Researchers will compile information from twins and other multiples in Illinois from birth until they turn 17 years old in what will be a scientific resource for researchers interested in how genes and environment influence twins and other multiples. And it will allow them to examine differences between identical and fraternal twins. The database will be an ongoing archive. It is intended to be a statewide registry completed by parents of twins and other multiples interested in having their children take part in future research by the Illinois Twins Project.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: A company could go ahead with plans for potentially storing 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide underground in western Indiana under a bill approved by state legislators. The carbon dioxide storage is part of a $450 million project proposed by Wabash Valley Resources LLC for an anhydrous ammonia fertilizer plant near Terre Haute. The bill restricts such carbon storage in Indiana to that site and calls for a special legislative committee to review the process. Citizens Action Coalition director Kerwin Olson tells the Tribune-Star that the study is needed to make sure state officials understand what’s involved. Gov. Eric Holcomb has until Wednesday to decide whether to sign the bill into law. He said last week that he was reviewing it closely.\n\nIowa\n\nOttumwa: Iowans can compete this summer against the top competitive eaters in the world. Major League Eating has announced the return of its Second-Annual Canteen Sandwich-Eating Competition at 1 p.m. June 1. The event is open to the public and will take place outside Canteen Lunch in the Alley. The No. 1 ranked competitive eater in the world, Joey Chestnut, and other top competitors will unite in Ottumwa to determine who can eat the most signature Canteen loose-meat sandwiches in 10 minutes. Chestnut has been competing in the eating contest circuit since 2007 and currently holds a world record for consuming 72 hot dogs in 10 minutes.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran is putting pressure on Amtrak to commit to continue running the Southwest Chief passenger rail service that connects Chicago to Los Angeles with stops in Kansas. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Moran recently delayed confirming three nominees to Amtrak’s board of directors in an effort to push the national rail carrier to offer assurances that the line will operate for at least another year. Amtrak’s president, Richard Anderson, agreed to meet with Moran and other lawmakers about the rail service’s future this month. Amtrak officials have considered suspending rail service from Dodge City to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and transitioning to buses. The Republican senator helped secure $50 million in the federal budget for the Southwest Chief through September.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Galt House has hired its first ever “artist in residence” at the riverside hotel. The artist Gibbs Rounsavall has been selected to be the first to carry the title. Rounsavall was chosen after a search that began in the fall of 2018 from 29 entries. The Louisville-based geometric abstract painter was appointed by a selection committee of 12 members of Louisville’s arts community who reviewed samples of submitted work, did interviews, and evaluated how the artists would represent the arts community and the city. Rounsavall will receive a working studio where his work will be on exhibition and open to the public. In addition, he will receive a monthly stipend and a food and beverage credit in the hotel. Rounsavall will serve in the position until February.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBlind River: Among the gum and cypress trees of a swamp sits a little chapel called Our Lady of Blind River, built decades ago by Martha Deroche and her husband, Bobby, after she said she had a vision of Jesus kneeling by a rock. Over the years, people have stopped by in boats or kayaks to pray in the one-room chapel. But floods over the years have damaged the little church, and the couple’s grandson Lance Weber had to close it about two years ago out of safety concerns. He’s been working to restore the building and raise it up to protect it from future floods. He grew up spending time with his grandparents and says he wants to make sure the chapel is preserved for future generations of the family. Along with necessary repairs, he plans to build a dock specifically for kayakers on the side of the chapel.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: U.S. census figures indicate the state lost 10% of farmland and 573 farms in the five years ending in 2017. The Bangor Daily News reports that the census figures released last month show a 15.8% decline in average net income per farm. Ellen Sabina, from of the Maine Farmland Trust, says the statistics are alarming. She says it’s time to support farms now, “before it’s too late.” There was some good news: The numbers of small farms – 1 to 9 acres in size – increased slightly, as did the number of farms that are larger than 2,000 acres. The census data also shows a 53% increase in the value of food sold directly to consumers, such as at farmer’s markets.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Blue crabs are rebounding in the Chesapeake Bay, with an annual survey showing the highest estimated population in seven years. That’s welcome news for fisherfolk and those who love cracking into bushels of the Chesapeake’s iconic crustaceans. Feasts of blue crabs steamed in peppery seasoning are a beloved delicacy and one of the last viable fisheries in America’s largest estuary. Overall, the bay-wide crab population rose by 60% from last year to reach an estimated total of 594 million. An annual winter survey released by the states of Maryland and Virginia shows almost twice as many juveniles as last year. Spawning-age females have increased, too. Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio, secretary of Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources, says in a statement that the bay’s crab population “is both healthy and thriving.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A museum with ties to the iconic Smiley Face has announced a $12.5 million capital campaign. The Telegram & Gazette reports that the 143-year-old Worcester Historical Museum has already raised $8.5 million since it began fundraising four years ago. A kickoff event at the museum Thursday will launch its public campaign. The museum’s collection includes items like a trunk owned by John Hancock and hundreds of pieces documenting the story of the Smiley Face, created by late Worcester commercial artist Harvey Ball. It also holds 7,000 book titles and more than 500,000 images. Museum officials say the money will go toward the museum’s endowment, capital projects and programming. A 6,000- to 8,000-square-foot museum expansion is planned using an adjacent property purchased last year.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Officials say some of the city’s new LED streetlights are prematurely dimming and burning out, and thousands more could fail. The Detroit News reports a letter from the Public Lighting Authority’s law firm says problems were discovered last fall with units made by San Jose, California-based Leotek Electronics USA that were “charred, burned, or cracked.” The lighting authority sued Monday in federal court. Leotek made about one-third of Detroit’s new lights, which were expected to last at least a decade. It acknowledged problems in a letter to the lighting authority, apologized and pledged to work with Detroit to correct problems. The last of Detroit’s 65,000 new LED streetlights were installed in 2016 as part of a $185 million program that was hailed as a success in the city’s turnaround efforts.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s failed bid to land Amazon’s second headquarters offered a modest amount of money and leaned heavily on quality of life as a selling point. Details of the state’s 122-page bid for the Seattle-based tech giant were released Monday. It suggested 18 cities where the project could be located and the prospect of up to $5 million in public subsidies. The report listed a wide range of attributes including the region’s talent pool, higher education system and accessibility to other parts of the country via the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. Amazon eventually split the headquarters project between two locations, the Queens area of New York City and Arlington, Virginia. It later dropped the New York location amid local opposition and moved some of its plans to Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMississippi\n\nSumrall: Twin brothers are graduating in the top two spots of their high school class. Jimmy Dilworth is the slightly older one, and he is valedictorian at Sumrall High School. Tommy Dilworth is salutatorian. They tell WDAM-TV that they have always been competitive, and they believe that has pushed them toward success. They are both in cross country, archery and track. They are both in the math honor society, Beta Club. The only activity they don’t share is cheer. Tommy is on the cheer squad. Jimmy is not. Graduation is May 25.\n\nMissouri\n\nFulton: A letter from the Prince of Wales highlights the 50th anniversary of a museum honoring Winston Churchill. Members of the families of Churchill and President Harry Truman were among the hundreds of people attending weekend activities at America’s National Churchill Museum on the campus of Westminster College in Fulton. The museum honors the place where Churchill delivered his famous “Iron Curtain” speech in 1946. The museum opened May 7, 1969, after the London church St. Mary the Virgin Aldermanbury was moved stone-by-stone to Fulton. The phrase “Iron Curtain” described the separation of Eastern Europe that was under Soviet Union rule. Prince Charles, in a letter read at a gala Saturday, noted the museum as the “remarkable and highly appropriate memorial” for the famous speech.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: About 160 acres of private land north of Yellowstone National Park have been purchased by the state for a wildlife management area. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and The Conservation Fund announced this week that the state agency purchased the land from fund for $550,775. The land abuts the Dome Mountain Wildlife Management Area and is habitat for elk that migrate between the valley and Yellowstone. FWP regional wildlife manager Howard Burt says the land is important elk winter range and also important for a lot of other species that use the game range, including grizzly bears. The land was appraised at more than $1.3 million, about twice what FWP paid for it.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Durham Museum has scheduled a free workshop on how to preserve personal heirlooms damaged during natural disasters, such as the recent flooding in much of eastern Nebraska. The Durham and the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative workshop is set to run from 10 a.m. to noon June 1 at the museum in Omaha. The workshop will include a formal presentation followed by questions and answers. Smithsonian experts will demonstrate how to handle, dry and clean damaged objects and share tips on safety, setting priorities and examining preservation options. People are asked not to take damaged objects to the workshop, but photos of damaged heirlooms are encouraged.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: In this town where cocktail parties celebrate implosions of the old to make space for the new, one artifact has endured. The “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign turned 60 on Sunday. “The sign is timeless,” says Nevada historian Michael Green. “The message hasn’t aged.” On May 5, 1959, the Clark County Board of Commissioners approved the iconic design of Nevada-born graphic designer Betty Willis, who worked with pencil, paper and ruler. “The letters W-E-L-C-O-M-E are presented as silver dollars, the coins that promised to come cascading from one of Vegas’ lucky slot machines,” wrote researcher Jeffrey Carlson in a blog post about the sign for The Neon Museum in Las Vegas. “The shape on the board, that stretched-out, curved diamond, might have been familiar to Betty Willis, and to hotel and motel customers all over the country in the 1950s. It was the shape of the standard hotel key fob.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlainfield: Antiques, paintings, rare books and other items that belonged to former poet laureate Donald Hall are about to go up for auction. Hall, who died last June at home in Wilmot, was the nation’s poet laureate from 2006 to 2007. William A. Smith Auctions in Plainfield is hosting an auction Wednesday of some of Hall’s jewelry, silver and fine china. New Hampshire Public Radio reports a Dock Ellis baseball card along with Hall’s book about Ellis is also up for sale. A Skinner Auctioneers event in Boston on Friday is including 10 paintings and fine prints, including works by Willem de Kooning and Andy Warhol, from Hall’s estate. Hall’s estate will also be holding a sale at Eagle Pond Farm this weekend. Hall published more than 50 books, from poetry and drama to biography and memoirs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The first of several new classes of New Jersey Transit railroad engineers is poised to take the wheel this summer. The agency says that will help lessen some of the effects of schedule reductions due to track repairs. Ten men and two women were recognized Monday by Gov. Phil Murphy for completing their classroom training. The Democrat has made improving the embattled transit agency one of his chief priorities in his first term. A shortage of engineers combined with higher-than-normal unexcused absences last summer led to numerous canceled commuter trains while NJ Transit was scrambling to finish federally mandated safety improvements by last December. Three additional engineer classes are expected to add about 40 more engineers by year’s end.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nClovis: Cannon Air Force Base has partnered with The Conservation Fund for the protection of nearly 48 square miles of land adjacent to the Melrose Air Force Range. The conservation easement was announced Monday. It’s funded through the U.S. Defense Department’s Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program and New Mexico’s economic development agency. Officials say the agreement represents the largest single transaction in the history of the Defense Department’s environmental protection program. In recent years, Air Force officials have become concerned about the potential for encroaching development around the eastern New Mexico range. The conservation easement will limit development, encroachment and changes to the landscape that could negatively affect flight paths, training operations or habitat for the lesser prairie chicken.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: More than 100 current and former sex workers are encouraging state lawmakers to repeal a loitering law they say police use to harass people simply for their appearance. Members of the group spoke at a rally Tuesday in the Capitol in Albany. They are calling for the decriminalization of prostitution and solicitation and say criminal penalties only punish and stigmatize sex workers. They say many such workers are underage, homeless or the victims of human trafficking. They also want lawmakers to make it easier for former sex workers and trafficking victims to expunge convictions for offenses such as trespassing or drug possession if they were forced to commit the crime by traffickers. Neither bill has been scheduled for a vote in the Democrat-controlled Legislature.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is now issuing identification cards to residents whose driver licenses or permits are suspended or revoked. People who have driver licenses revoked, suspended, disqualified or canceled will be issued an identification card upon surrender of their most recent driver’s license. The card is to be used as a photo identification only and doesn’t entitle people to drive. Legislators passed a law last year requiring that DMV issue the cards, which are free. The ID card is valid until the suspended or revoked driver license is reinstated or reissued by the DMV. The ID card is available to people whose driver’s licenses were surrendered starting May 1.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An heir to the Walmart fortune, a wealthy governor and oil companies could fund a big chunk of the private money needed for a Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in the western Badlands. It’s unclear how much might come from the Roosevelt family. State lawmakers recently approved $50 million in public money for the project, but it must be matched by $100 million in private money. The library foundation says it has $52 million in pledges. It’s widely believed most of that is from former Walmart Chairman Rob Walton and his wife, Melani. She declined comment. North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness expects “substantial” money from the energy industry. A spokesman says Gov. Doug Burgum also will contribute. He sold a company to Microsoft in 2001 for $1.1 billion.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Third graders at All Saints School in Sycamore Township are behind House Bill 235, which would designate the sugar cookie the official state cookie. Last fall, the students read a nonfiction story about the history of cookies. It noted that Massachusetts had a state cookie: chocolate chip, to honor the home of the Toll House cookie. The students then wondered if Ohio had a state cookie and, if not, how that could change. They spent several months researching state cookie designations, what cookie best fit the state and how to approach lawmakers with their idea. Ohio has a connection to sugar, they found. When pioneers first inhabited Southwest Ohio, they traded sugar as a commodity. The students concluded a generic sugar cookie could represent the diversity of the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Voter-approved changes in alcohol laws have boosted state sales tax collections on alcohol. Regulations that went into effect in October allow grocery and convenience stores to sell strong beer and wine and authorized liquor stores to sell refrigerated strong beer. The Oklahoman reports that since then, the state has collected an average of about $11.7 million a month in alcohol sales taxes and fees. Oklahoma Tax Commission figures indicate the state collected an average of $10.6 million a month during the six months before the changes went into effect. The changes effectively ended the sale of 3.2% alcohol beer in Oklahoma. The state saw a rapid decline in low-point beer tax collections after October and has not collected any taxes in the category in 2019.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state House has approved removing families’ ability to opt out of required childhood vaccinations. Lawmakers voted 35-25 Monday to prevent parents from claiming personal, philosophical or religious exemptions to avoid school vaccine requirements. The issue has proven one of the most controversial this legislative session and has drawn hundreds of parents in protest. Opponents say that the state shouldn’t interfere in individual medical decisions and that the safety of vaccines is still up for debate. This year has been the worst for U.S. measles count in over two decades. At least 77 people were diagnosed with measles as part of an outbreak in Washington and Oregon that public health officials declared to be over last week.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: An orchard of hundreds of trees will be planted on a hilltop as part of a nonprofit urban farm. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports volunteers will plant 200 fruit and nut trees at the Hilltop Urban Farm on the site of the former St. Clair Village housing project. Executive Director Sarah Baxendell says the Hilltop Urban Farm organization aims to address food insecurity in Pittsburgh’s hilltop neighborhoods. The orchard’s harvest will eventually be sold to wholesalers and local farmer’s markets. The organization began converting the former residential neighborhood to a 23-acre urban farm in 2017. It’s funded mostly with grants and charitable donations. A farmer incubation program will help urban farmers start new businesses, and a youth program will teach neighborhood kids about urban agriculture.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Monday that it has picked the University of Rhode Island as the home of a new institute for ocean exploration. NOAA said URI will host its Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute, and Titanic discoverer Robert Ballard will lead it. The institute will work with NOAA to explore unknown undersea areas, deploy remotely operated vehicles in deeper and shallower waters, adopt and integrate various autonomous vehicles for exploration, and improve the utility of the data. Ballard directs URI’s Center for Ocean Exploration at the Graduate School of Oceanography. He’s also president of Ocean Exploration Trust. “There is another half of America, beneath the ocean’s surface, that we know very little about,” Ballard said in a statement, describing the work as the “next Lewis and Clark expedition, only six times over.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Superman, Wonder Woman, Iron Man and Thor are all together at last. The University of South Carolina Libraries, in a press release, says it has received a gift of more than 180,000 comic books and related materials from lifelong collector Gary Lee Watson. Now known as one of the largest comic book collections in the U.S., the collection includes 143,000 unique comic books, 20,000 magazines, 15,000 paperbacks and much more. WIS-TV reports the collection will begin to be cataloged and processed for research and classroom purposes at the university. School officials say an exhibit at the library will be on display starting Aug. 29.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem says she won’t test an American Indian tribe that has banned her from one of the largest reservations in the country, but she hopes to change the directive. The Oglala Sioux tribe is upset with legislation pushed by Noem that aims to quell any protests against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline similar to those in North Dakota that plagued construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Tribal Council on May 1 voted 17-0 to tell Noem she’s no longer welcome on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Noem says she respects tribal sovereignty and won’t travel there without the tribe’s blessing. But she also hopes to change the tribal edict. Noem says she’s had informal talks with council members but hasn’t yet spoken with President Julian Bear Runner.\n\nTennessee\n\nVanleer: Luke Perry, the star of “Beverly Hills, 90210” who unexpectedly died in March, was buried in the state in an eco-friendly mushroom suit, his daughter says. In a Friday post on Instagram, Sophie Perry recounted a trip to California’s Redwoods and posted a photo she took of mushrooms growing in the forest. “Now, mushrooms hold an entirely new meaning for me. Any explanation i give will not do justice to the genius that is the mushroom burial suit, but it is essentially an eco friendly burial option via mushrooms,” she wrote. “My dad discovered it, and was more excited by this than I have ever seen him. He was buried in this suit, one of his final wishes.” She encouraged followers to look up more about the biodegradable burial option and the company that created it, Coeio.com. Since the mid-1990s, Luke Perry had owned a farm in Vanleer, roughly 50 miles west of Nashville.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: Baylor University has announced a $100 million donation that administrators say is the largest gift in school history. A Baylor statement says the donor wishes to remain anonymous. The donation, announced Saturday night in Waco, has been earmarked for Baylor’s $1.1 billion Give Light philanthropic campaign that includes teaching, research and service. School officials say the campaign has so far raised $692 million. Baylor is the world’s largest Baptist university, with enrollment of about 17,000.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: The city is ending its urban deer relocation program. The Daily Herald reported Monday that Provo will no longer relocate deer found wandering within city limits in the wake of state officials’ decision to no longer make that an option. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources announced last week that it was stopping the relocation program because of the spread of diseases and the survival rates for relocated deer. Herriman and Provo also will stop relocating deer. Provo has been participating in the urban deer program since 2017. In that time, the city has relocated nearly 90 deer. Meanwhile, the lethal urban deer program will continue in 17 cities in Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A legislative committee is holding a public hearing on a proposed constitutional amendment to make clear that the state prohibits slavery. The public hearing is scheduled for Wednesday evening in Room 11 of the Statehouse. Vermont was the first state to abolish adult slavery. The state Constitution currently says no person 21 or older should serve as a slave unless bound by their own consent or “by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.” The amendment would remove that language and add that slavery and indentured servitude in any form are prohibited. Changing the constitution is a years­long process.\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Virginia Tech expects to welcome its largest freshman class this fall. The Roanoke Times reports the school expects its 2019 freshman class to have about 7,500 students, breaking its previous record 2017 freshman class size of 6,836. The Blacksburg school has dropped its on-campus housing requirement for first-years in anticipation. University spokesman Mark Owczarski says more students decided to attend the school than anticipated. Engineering education professor Marie Paretti wrote a letter to the Tech Faculty Senate saying the larger class size should’ve been expected, as per faculty predictions shared with administrators. Paretti says the increase in students will strain the area. Mayor Leslie Hager-Smith says the town is braced for growth, but she is concerned about its ability to house and transport the growing student population.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Wildlife managers from tribal, state and local governments are joining forces at Lake Roosevelt this week to combat the spread of northern pike. The Colville, Spokane and Kalispel tribes are working with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and public utility districts in Chelan and Grant counties to catch northern pike in the largest suppression event of its kind. Northern pike is a prohibited invasive species that preys on fish such as trout, salmon and steelhead. Since being illegally introduced in the 1990s, the species has spread down the Pend Oreille River into Lake Roosevelt. Moving down the Columbia River would put billions of dollars in salmon and steelhead recovery investments and fisheries at risk. Anglers who catch northern pike can turn them in for a $10-a-head bounty.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Policymakers must address the consequences of poverty and the opioid crisis on students, according to a report released Tuesday ahead of the Legislature’s special session on education. The report from the state Department of Education also questioned the formation of charter schools and scoffed at education savings accounts. It stressed the need for policymakers to be flexible. Republican Gov. Jim Justice called the special session after the GOP-led Legislature failed to agree on teacher pay raises and other education measures during the regular session that ended in March. West Virginia has one of the nation’s highest poverty rates at 19.1% and by far the highest rate of drug overdose deaths. The report found that “public schools carry much of the burden created by abuse, neglect and household dysfunction.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Voters could legally take selfies with their marked election ballot under a proposal in the state Legislature. The Senate elections committee held a hearing Tuesday on the measure that would make it legal for voters to show their marked ballot. Wisconsin is one of 18 states that has a law barring the showing of a completed ballot, but it is rarely enforced. Bill sponsor Republican Sen. Dave Craig says showing a marked ballot is a free speech right. Craig says the ban is archaic in the age of social media, where voters are increasingly posting selfies with their completed ballots. But two local election clerks testified against the measure, saying it could have unintended consequences like making it easier for employers or others to force people to show how they voted.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: An independent report says visitors to the state spent more than $3.8 billion in 2018, an increase of 6.8% from 2017. The report by Dean Runyan Associates released Monday by the Wyoming Office of Tourism shows a steady increase in traveler spending and visitor volume in the state since 2007. According to the report, Wyoming saw 8.9 million overnight visitors in 2018, a 2% increase from 2017. The leisure and hospitality industry directly supports 32,290 jobs in Wyoming, making it the largest private-sector employer in the state. And the spending by travelers generates about $196 million in local and state tax revenue each year.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/08"}]}

For more about Spotlight Delaware, visit www.spotlightdelaware.org.\n\nA Delaware political action committee that claims to not support any candidate raised more than $200,000 in previous years from several high-profile donors, including a friend to Joe Biden, a solar executive in Boston, a DuPont heir, and a developer whose warehouse plans helped to spark New Castle County’s biggest political controversy last year.\n\nIn recent weeks, the group has used its hefty war chest to run a TV ad that lauds what it calls the health care plan of New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer – a candidate for Delaware governor.\n\nIt also recently sent political mailers to various Delaware voters attacking Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long – one of Meyer’s two opponents in the governor’s race – claiming she is “wrong on public safety.”\n\nDespite the advocacy, a spokesman for the group – which is called the Change Can’t Wait PAC – said it does not “expressly support or oppose any candidate.”\n\nWhen pressed on the messaging in the advertisements, the spokesman – Washington, D.C.-based consultant Julian Mulvey – said Change Can’t Wait is “following established Delaware law and practice, so assigning us to a candidate is incorrect.”\n\nState election law allows so-called issue-only political action committees to run ads that mention candidates so long as they don’t explicitly tell viewers to vote for a specific person.\n\nWhile the ads from Change Can’t Wait appear to be in compliance with the law, its own staff members have previously said that the group does support a candidate.\n\nIn 2022, a representative for Change Can’t Wait said in a filing to the Delaware Department of Elections that “our candidate does not have a primary in this cycle.”\n\nLast week, the group’s former treasurer acknowledged to Spotlight Delaware that Change Can’t Wait was formed in 2021 to support Meyer.\n\nDuring a press conference last month, Meyer said he’s aware of Change Can’t Wait. Asked if the group supports him, Meyer said, “You’ll have to ask them.”\n\nMulvey said Change Can’t Wait has communicated with Meyer’s campaign staff, but only “for the purpose of fact-checking before producing our communication.”\n\nIn all, the group’s advocacy is among the latest political maneuvering of the 2024 gubernatorial campaign made by outside political groups, which are legally barred from coordinating with candidates’ campaigns.\n\nSam Hoff, a professor emeritus in history, political science and philosophy at Delaware State University, said such third-party political groups have proliferated in the state, in part, because of its proximity to larger cities in the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\n“We can’t really think in terms of Delaware as a small state,” he said. “We’re part of a megalopolis region in which these PACs don’t stop at the border.”\n\nSince the start of summer, a union-affiliated PAC from New Jersey has backed Hall-Long’s campaign, and environmental PACs from the Washington, D.C., area have come out to support Collin O’Mara – Delaware’s former chief environmental regulator and the third Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nFinally, a PAC funded by executives at a New York translations company in recent weeks has begun spending what it previously pledged will be $1 million to oppose Hall-Long.\n\nThe donors revealed\n\nChange Can’t Wait did not report its campaign spending within 48 hours of buying its recent political ads, as other groups, called third-party advertisers, must do.\n\nSpotlight Delaware was not able to determine whether issue-only PACs are required under Delaware law to do so. Mulvey said his group is required to file an updated list of its donors before a deadline that falls 30 days before an election.\n\nThat deadline is next week.\n\nStill, finance reports from past years show that Change Can’t Wait has been fueled by several politically influential donors – many who have separately contributed directly to Meyer’s campaign.\n\nLast year, the group received its largest single contribution – at $25,000 – from a “John Hyanski,” according to the PAC’s filing with the Department of Elections. The listing is an apparent misspelling in the records of John Hynansky, a prominent Delaware businessman and close friend of the Bidens. The report lists the address of the $25,000 contribution at a Wilmington office associated with Hynansky’s businesses.\n\nThe contribution adds to $1,200 Hynansky donated to Meyer’s campaign in 2021, according to campaign reports.\n\nHynansky did not reply to requests to comment for this story.\n\nChange Can’t Wait also received a total of $24,500 through a string of donations in 2022 and 2023 from the president of ECA Solar, a Massachusetts-based renewable energy company.\n\nIn March, ECA Solar sold two solar farms in southern Delaware to a company owned by the global investment firm, Brookfield. At the time, Delaware Business Now reported that ECA Solar had become “one of the largest solar developers in Delaware.”\n\nTwo donors have given $15,000 to Change Can’t Wait. Those were Gerret Copeland, a philanthropist and heir of the du Pont family wealth, and Stonelock Properties, a New Jersey real estate company that owns four apartment complexes in Newark.\n\nBehind those donations were five contributions totaling $10,000 each. They came from a Newport engineering executive, a banker who lives at the Delaware beaches, a New Castle private jet company, and two more property management companies.\n\nA developer behind a mega-warehouse plan near Middletown, called the Jamison Corner Commerce Center, gave $5,000 to Change Can’t Wait, while one of his companies contributed another $5,000.\n\nThe proposed half-million square-foot warehouse is one of three in the Middletown area that last year sparked a politically tinged backlash among largely suburban residents.\n\nGet stories like this delivered to your email inbox by signing up for the free newsletter at spotlightdelaware.org/subscribe.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/27/trump-biden-debate-live-updates/74195213007/", "title": "Debate replay: Democrats worry about Joe Biden's debate ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden brawled in the first presidential debate of the 2024 race for the White House – sparring over issues ranging from reproductive rights to the southern border and inflation – even with a few confusing moments.\n\nIn a response that immediately prompted questions, Biden froze as he talked about Medicare services in America. After the debate, Democrats were sweating over the president's performance and his stumbles over talking points, data and more.\n\nThe president and the former president for 90 minutes attacked each other's records on the issues facing the nation: childcare costs, the spread of opioids and other challenges. They also waged into America's role on the world stage, with moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper pressing the candidate on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn one of the most heated moments of the night, Biden and Trump also fought over reports that the former president called veterans who lost their lives in war 'suckers.'\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nDonald Trump Veepstakes enter home stretch after Atlanta debate\n\nNow that the first debate is over, the Donald Trump running mate race heads into overdrive.\n\nA bevy of potential Republican vice presidential candidates flocked to Atlanta to carry the flag for Trump before and after his clash with Joe Biden - and amid news reports and informed speculation that the presumptive GOP 2024 nominee could announce his decision any day now.\n\n\"He's told some people, yeah,\" said Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law and a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, speaking to NBC News.\n\nThe Trump debate surrogate list included the most often mentioned possibilities: North Dakota Gov.

He stumbled over words and had to correct himself with numbers. He was sometimes hard to follow. On one occasion, the president appeared to lose his train of thought, concluding − confusingly − with the line, \"we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\n\"That's a good man. He loves his country. He's doing the best that he can,\" said Van Jones, a Democratic political analyst on CNN. \"But he had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence in the country and of the base, and he failed to do that.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump concludes: ‘We’re in a failing nation ... but we’re gonna make it great again’\n\nTrump in his closing statement called Biden a “complainer” and said Biden “doesn’t do anything.”\n\n“This man is just a complainer,” Trump said, mocking Biden. “He said ‘We wanna do this, we wanna do that, we wanna get rid of this tax, that tax.’ But he doesn’t do anything.’”\n\nHe also took aim at the Biden administration’s foreign policy, claiming that none of the crises across the world would be happening if Trump was still in office.\n\n“We looked like fools in Afghanistan,” Trump said. Hamas’ attack against Israel on Oct. 7, Trump claimed without evidence, was such a “horrible thing that would have never happened,” if he were still president. “Ukraine should have never happened,” Trump added.\n\n“We’re in a failing nation but it’s not gonna be failing anymore. We’re gonna make it great again,” Trump concluded.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden zeroes in on bringing down inflation, fixing tax system in closing statement\n\nBiden closed his debate performance by insisting that he would implement “a fair tax system” if he’s reelected, including guaranteeing that people who make less than $400,000 won’t see a tax increase.\n\nHe contrasted that by saying Trump increased taxes, caused inflation by fumbling the pandemic response, and will make it worse by implementing a 10% tariff on all imports to the U.S.\n\nBiden also touted policies passed since he became president, including lowering the cost of prescriptions. And he said if he is reelected, he would advance policies to support childcare and fix “bad pipes and other things causing health problems.”\n\n“We’re going to continue to fight inflation and give people a break,” he concluded.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nA \"childish\" argument about golf\n\nIt took an argument about golf scores - one of their few direct exchanges - to get the two candidates to accuse each other of childishness.\n\n\"Let's not act like children,\" Trump told Biden.\n\nReplied Biden: \"You are a child.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump blames Biden border policies for spread of opioids\n\nAsked what they would do to support people in the throes of opioid addiction, both candidates focused on the situation at the southern border.\n\nTrump said the flow of drugs across the border was under control until the COVID-19 pandemic. “Then we had to get tough,” he said, adding that drugs were “pouring across the border.”\n\nHe argued that since Biden has come into office, the flow of drugs is back up. Biden rebutted that he fought to get equipment that could detect fentanyl coming across the border, but that Trump killed the bipartisan deal in Congress that would have funded it.\n\n“He never argued it’s not a good bill. It’s a good bill,” he said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nYour money and the presidential debate: Trump and Biden spar over the economy, inflation\n\nAt the top of the high-stakes faceoff, Joe Biden and former Donald Trump sparred over their economic records in a bid to persuade undecided voters theirs is the winning plan to slow rising prices.\n\nExasperated Americans are paying more for the basics from check-out lanes to the gas pump, souring the national mood and making the inflation surge one of Biden’s greatest challenges going into the November rematch with Trump.\n\nYour money and the presidential debate:: Trump and Biden spar over the economy, inflation\n\n– Jessica Guynn and Bailey Schulz\n\nJoe Biden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office. But the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier. Biden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nFor more fact checks about what Trump and Biden said, follow USA TODAY's live debate fact check here (Biden-Trump debate fact check: Separating lies from truth (usatoday.com)\n\nTrump's claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n– Brad Sylvester\n\nFor more fact checks about what Trump and Biden said, follow USA TODAY's live debate fact check here (Biden-Trump debate fact check: Separating lies from truth (usatoday.com)\n\nBiden: Trump ‘didn’t do a damn thing about’ climate change\n\nTrump claimed he “had the best environmental numbers ever” and said his administration took significant action to address climate change: “My environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage actually.”\n\n“I have no idea where he’s been,” Biden responded, touting legislation he led that made significant investments in combating climate change, including the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden went after Trump for pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords, arguing the former president did nothing to fight climate change.\n\n“The only existential threat to humanity is climate change and he didn’t do a damn thing about it,” Biden said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump and Biden battle over serving Black communities\n\nAsked what he says to Black voters who are disappointed he hasn’t done more to help their communities during his time in office, Biden said: “I don’t blame you” and noted inflation is hurting them. But he said he has proposed tax credits for first-time homebuyers who are Black and made it easier for Black students to take out loans for college.\n\nHe added that he supports other policies that would help Black families, such as cutting childcare costs.\n\nTrump leaned into that response, arguing that Biden’s economic policies have hurt the pocketbooks of families of color and said undocumented immigrants are taking the jobs of workers of color.\n\n“He caused inflation and it’s killing Black families and Hispanic families,” he said. Trump added that he funded historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and supported criminal justice reform and economic opportunity zones.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat happened when Biden froze?\n\nJoe Biden was in the middle of answering a question about the economy during the debate on Thursday night when he began to stutter, froze on stage, and then began talking about the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do, child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to spend our health care system, making sure that we're in every single solitary person eligible,\" Biden said, before taking a long pause.\n\nHe then began talking about the COVID-19 pandemic and Medicare.\n\n\"For what I've been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do,\" he said, before taking another pause. \"If we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nBiden hits Trump over white supremacists in Charlottesville\n\nIn going after Trump, Biden cited the incident he says inspired him to run for president in 2020: The violent 2017 rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBiden noted that Trump said supportive things about the Charlottesville rioters. Trump accused Biden of making his criticism up, though Trump did say there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the deadly demonstration.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden freeze sparks backlash on Twitter\n\nBiden freezing on stage when discussing healthcare quickly drew fire on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Sorry, I’m voting for President Biden but a disaster so far,” wrote Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and NBC News analyst, on the platform.\n\nStephen Hayes, editor and CEO of The Dispatch, tweeted, “Let the Dem panic begin.”\n\n“Holy shit. Joe Biden isn’t running. He just froze. Trump is murdering him,” tweeted American writer and lawyer Clay Travis.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden hits Trump over his felony conviction\n\nDonald Trump responded to the fact that he is a \"convicted felon\" by claiming – without evidence – that Biden is a future felon.\n\n\"This man is a criminal,\" Trump said of his opponent, also noting that Biden's son Hunter Biden has already been convicted on a gun charge.\n\nBiden called the accusation \"outrageous,\" and added: \"It's simply a lie.\" For good measure, Biden noted that Trump's criminal case involved hush money to a \"porn star.\"\n\n\"You have the morals of an alley cat,\" Biden told Trump.\n\nThis all began with a question about Trump's claims that he may seek retribution against political opponents if he gets back into the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump doesn’t take responsibility when asked about Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nTrump didn’t take blame for the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack when he was asked about a mob of his supporters breaching the building in a bid to overturn the 2020 election results. Instead, he repeated his false claims that the attack was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s fault.\n\nTrump claimed he offered Pelosi “10,000 soldiers” to stop the attack, but Pelosi’s office has said she was never presented the offer by the former president. Pelosi also would not have had the power to refuse such an offer regardless.\n\nIn response, Biden went after Trump for his inaction during the attack, instead watching the riots unfold from the White House. He also slammed Trump for calling Jan. 6 defendants “patriots” and promising to pardon them.\n\n“The idea that those people are patriots? Come on,” Biden said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden touts support for Israel, slams Trump on NATO\n\nAsked what additional leverage he would use to end the Israel-Hamas War, Biden said international leaders and experts have endorsed his plan for a ceasefire, which would include trading hostages held by Hamas for a ceasefire.\n\nHe added that “the only thing I denied Israel” was 2,000-lb bombs that can do significant civilian damage, and said Israel is getting “all the weapons they need” from the U.S.\n\nTrump said Israel wants to continue its war against Hamas. “You should let them go and let them finish the job,” he said to Biden.\n\nBiden – in one of his more forceful responses of the debate so far – said Trump wants to pull out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said U.S. strength relies on alliances. “He has no idea what the hell he’s talking about.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump asked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nPutin would have never invaded Ukraine if he was president, Trump claimed without evidence. But he added Putin's terms in its brutal invasion of Ukraine should not be accepted.\n\nBiden retorted by saying he'd never heard more malarkey.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to Trump: 'You're the sucker, you're the loser'\n\nThe angriest exchange of the night came when Biden cited reports that Trump has described veterans as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\n\"You're the sucker, you're the loser,\" Biden told Trump.\n\nTrump denied making such comments, and demanded an apology from Biden. Not a chance, Biden replied.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPressed about his deportation plan, Trump goes after Biden over border\n\nTrump was asked about his plans to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” and whether he intended to deport all undocumented immigrants in the U.S., including those currently working critical jobs, whose spouses are citizens and have resided here for decades.\n\nTrump declined to answer and instead criticized Biden over his handling of the southern border and repeated his past anti-immigrant rhetoric at the podium.\n\n“We are living right now in a rat’s nest,” Trump said. “Every state is now a border state and it’s because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies. People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\n“We’re literally an uncivilized country,” Trump added.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump: I won’t block abortion pill\n\nTrump said he won’t block abortion medication if he is reelected.\n\nHe noted that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a challenge to mifepristone, the pill commonly used in medication abortions, said he agrees with that decision, “and I will not block it.”\n\nHe took credit for appointing the justices that were crucial votes in overturning Roe v. Wade and said the states are “all making their own decisions,” later adding that “the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing.”\n\nBiden rebutted that it has been “terrible” since Roe was overturned. He said he would reinstate the protections under Roe if he is reelected.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump appears to call Biden 'Brandon'\n\nTrump at one point appeared to call Trump \"Brandon,\" a reference to \"Let's go, Brandon,\" which has become a joke and a rallying cry for Republicans.\n\nThe phrase originated at an Oct. 2 NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won his first Xfinity Series and was being interviewed by an NBC Sports reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something at first difficult to make out. The reporter suggested they were chanting “Let’s go, Brandon” to cheer the driver. But it was clear they were saying, “(Expletive) Joe Biden.\"\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nOn top earners paying less in taxes\n\nWith US facing trillion dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now? Trump said the tax cuts spurred the “greatest economy that we've ever seen. “ Just prior to Covid and even after Covid, it was so strong that we're able to get through Covid much better than just about any other country, but we spurred that tax spurred.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden's voice draws attention\n\nOne story so far, at least on social media: Biden's hoarse-sounding voice.\n\nPollster Frank Luntz, who is conducting a focus group on the showdown, said on X: \"My focus group of undecided voters is surprised and concerned about Biden’s voice. This doesn’t bode well for questions about his health.\"\n\n–David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: The economy is coming back\n\nThe first question is to Biden about inflation.\n\nBiden, sounding somewhat hoarse, said the economy fell apart on Trump's watch thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is coming back under current leadership - slowly, but surely.\n\n\"Working class people\" are still struggling, Biden said.\n\nTrump replied that Biden's handling of the COVID crisis sparked inflation, and the two argued about who has the best economic approach.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden skip a handshake\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden took the stage on Thursday night without a traditional handshake, walking directly to their podiums.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden jokes about taking ‘performance enhancers’ ahead of debate\n\nJoe Biden joked about being on “performance enhancers” in a social media post shortly before the start of the debate – mocking the conspiracies pushed by Trump and some Republicans that Biden would have to take drugs to keep up.\n\n“I don't know what they've got in these performance enhancers, but I'm feeling pretty jacked up. Try it yourselves, folks,” Biden said in the post, holding a can that reads “Biden” and his slogan “No Malarkey.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly challenged Biden to a drug test, arguing taking artificial enhancements is the only way the 81-year-old Biden can display energy during the debate. Republicans have suggested, without evidence, that Biden was on drugs during his State of the Union address in March.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat time is the debate? 9 p.m. eastern to central, pacific\n\nThe CNN Presidential Debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET, which is 8 p.m. CT and 6 p.m. PT.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan I livestream the debate?

A livestream and recording of the first presidential debate will be available on USA TODAY’s YouTube channel.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow popular is Joe Biden?\n\nHow popular is President Joe Biden? People are certainly curious. Searches for \"Joe Biden approval rating\" in the past one hour shot up by more than 150%, according to Google Trends data.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, Biden’s latest 38% job approval rating remains largely unchanged from recent months and continues to put him well below the 48%+ threshold all reelected incumbents in the modern era have had at the time of the election.\n\nHis ratings among the three major party groups are also steady, with 83% of Democrats, 33% of independents and 5% of Republicans expressing approval.\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nLongshot Trump VP pick Sen. Katie Britt is not at the first presidential debate\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., one of about 20 Republicans seen as a potential Donald Trump option for vice president, will be watching Thursday's first presidential debate from her home in Montgomery, Alabama, a staffer for the senator confirmed.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to watching President Trump win tonight's debate as he outlines his vision to restore secure borders, safe streets, stable prices, and strong families,\" Britt said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nBritt's physical absence from the event in Atlanta could be a signal that the State of the Union star will not be Trump's pick.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRFK Jr. to hold his own livestream debate tonight\n\nDuring Thursday’s presidential debate, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is hosting a program over livestream after he failed to qualify for tonight’s event.\n\nTo make it to the debate stage, candidates had to get on a sufficient number of state ballots as well as earn at least 15% in four separate national polls. Shortly after the CNN Presidential Debate was announced last month, Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN violated federal election laws by scheduling the June debate.\n\nKennedy will respond to the same questions that Biden and Trump are asked in a livestreamed event moderated by John Stossel that his campaign is calling “The Real Debate.” It will start at the same time as the presidential debate and will be held in front of a live audience in a Los Angeles studio.\n\n– Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nMelania Trump? Eric Trump? Who's with Trump in Atlanta?\n\nAs Donald Trump arrived in Atlanta Thursday evening for the pivotal debate, some political observers were watching who's in Trump's entourage for the event.\n\nFootage from Trump landing in Atlanta shows he deplaned alone, and it is unclear if his wife Melania or other members of his family are there with him.\n\nBut several Trump surrogates\n\nwho have also been floated for the vice presidential candidacy, are part of the entourage in Trump's spin room, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum; Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and others.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDebate spin room buzzing hours before Trump and Biden take the stage\n\nHours before the big matchup between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the floor at Georgia Tech University’s McCamish Pavilion – a basketball arena converted to debate spin room – was buzzing with reporters, campaign officials and politicians.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom; Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy all were swarmed by reporters.\n\nTrump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski and Republican National Convention co-chair David Bossie also circulated in the crowd, along with religious leader Ralph Reed. FOX News host Sean Hannity walked through the crowd and stopped to chat with Reed.\n\nAsked about the questions Trump continues to face surrounding his character and temperament, Lewandowski said “it’s up for the American people to decide.”\n\n“They get to decide if an 82-year-old who is practicing standing for 90 minutes should be the next leader of this country,” Lewandowski said, adding a year to Biden’s age. “Or if Donald Trump should be the leader of this country because they don’t like they way he… made some remarks.”\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nBiden campaign to launch ads during debate\n\nThe Biden campaign will air a set of three ads in battleground states criticizing Trump on issues such as reproductive rights and threats to democracy, CNN reported.\n\nThe first ad, which will run before the debate, will seek to tie Trump to abortion restrictions passed by states after Roe v. Wade’s fall in 2022.\n\nThe second ad will feature a Michigan sheriff who will slam Trump for refusing to denounce the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, according to the outlet. The third ad, which will air after the debate, will focus on criminal charges across four indictments.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Donald Trump and Joe Biden stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nOne of Joe Biden’s signature priorities while in the White House has been addressing student loan debt. With his effort challenged or blocked in court, the president said alternative actions by his Education Department have resulted in $160 billion in debt relief for nearly 4.6 million borrowers as of May 2024.\n\nDonald Trump has criticized Biden’s efforts to cancel student loan debt for millions of borrowers. In 2023 he also praised the Supreme Court justices for striking down a chunk of Biden’s plan, which Trump called unfair for people who have paid back their educational loans.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Biden or Trump leading in the polls ahead of the debate?\n\nTrump and Biden are in a near dead-heat, according to a Real Clear Politics average of national polling. Trump is slightly ahead at 46.6% compared to Biden’s 45.1%, but those results are well within the margin of error.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nUSA TODAY is fact checking the first 2024 debate\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will be investigating claims from the presumptive nominees on debate night.\n\nWe'll be watching for statements that exaggerate, mislead, misrepresent or otherwise stray from reality.

Both have experience moderating political debates, including CNN’s Republican Presidential Primary Debate this cycle.\n\nOn Monday, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt accused the longtime political journalists of being biased during an interview with CNN's Kasie Hunt before the host abruptly ended the interview, The Hill reported.\n\nCNN defended Tapper and Bash, saying in a statement shared with USA TODAY Tuesday, \"there are no two people better equipped to co-moderate a substantial and fact-based discussion.\"\n\n– Rachel Barber and Kinsey Crowley\n\nJill Biden rallies supporters before debate\n\nHours before the two presumptive nominees were slated to hit the debate stage for the first time in the 2024 presidential race, first lady Jill Biden stopped in Virginia Beach on her way to Atlanta to support her husband, President Joe Biden.\n\n“You all know that there’s two visions for America and you’ll see them tonight when you watch the debate,” she told the crowd that had gathered inside of the Biden-Harris campaign office in Virginia Beach for a sign-making event.\n\n“You’ve already chosen your vision, or you wouldn’t be here,” she said to the crowd of Biden supporters. “The vision you’ve chosen is for strong, steady leadership versus the other vision, which is chaos and corruption.”\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWhat are the rules for the debate?\n\nThe candidates will be provided with a pen, pad of paper and a water bottle, but are prohibited from bringing props or prewritten notes. Following a history of presidential frontrunners talking over one another, CNN announced candidates' microphones will be muted throughout the debate when it is not their turn to speak.\n\nThe candidates will also not be able to consult with their campaign teams during the event’s two commercial breaks, a departure from past formats overseen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nBiden’s campaign won a coin flip against Trump’s, giving his aides the choice between selecting the president’s podium or the order of the debate’s closing statements. The president’s campaign opted for the podium on the right side of the stage, meaning Trump's campaign got to choose the order of closing statements. His team opted to give Trump the final word.\n\n– Rachel Barber, Sudiksha Kochi and Marina Pitofsky\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp did not vote for Trump in the primary\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, revealed that he did not vote for his party’s frontrunner, Donald Trump, in the state’s primary election in March.\n\nThe governor revealed his decision – counter to that of many GOP voters and lawmakers – in an interview with CNN on the eve of the historic debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\n“I didn’t vote for anybody,” Kemp told CNN Wednesday when asked if he voted for Trump.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is in the debate?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face off in the first presidential debate. Third party candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not participate in the debate.\n\nIn order to secure a spot on stage, CNN required candidates to have received at least 15% support in four approved national polls and qualify for the ballot in enough states to have the opportunity to earn the 270 electoral votes in November needed to win the White House.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat channel is the debate?\n\nThe debate will air on CNN and its related channels including CNN International and CNN en Español. Several other networks will carry the debate including Fox News, ABC News, NBC News, and NewsMax.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nGOP lawmakers want to see a more measured Donald Trump\n\nHouse Republicans tuning into tonight’s debate hope to see a more mellow version of Donald Trump compared to his previous debates with Joe Biden, telling USA TODAY that policy debates should be the priority for the former president.\n\nBut those GOP lawmakers acknowledged that Trump’s previous performance in debates means they can’t exactly have high hopes.\n\n“I think he’s his own man and he’s gonna do what he’s gonna do,” Rep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, said. Ellzey thinks Trump is going to come off more “gentlemanly” tonight.\n\n“You’re never gonna change Donald Trump. He is who he is, he talks the way he does,” Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., said. But he hopes to at least see a “little more measured approach” and “a little more hopeful.”\n\n“You been to Baskin Robbins? There’s 31 flavors,” Alford said. “I think there’s 31 flavors of Donald Trump. You’re going to see the rocky road, you’re going to see the daiquiri ice, you’re going to see a little vanilla. But in the end, it’s gonna be something you want to take home.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says it's 'good to be back' in Atlanta\n\nJoe Biden shared photos of voters cheering in Atlanta a few hours before the first 2024 presidential debate.\n\n\"I met some incredible supporters who are fired up ahead of tonight’s debate. Let’s finish the job,\" he shared on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nx.com\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill tonight's presidential debate be a 2020 replay? Here's what Chris Wallace said\n\nCNN personality Chris Wallace suggested on \"The Source with Kaitlin Collins\" that Donald Trump may change tactics in the first debate of the 2024 presidential election. Wallace moderated the first debate in 2020 between Trump and Joe Biden when he was an anchor at Fox News. That debate provided multiple campaign changing moments.\n\n\"I’ve talked to a lot of people in the top echelons of his staff. They say he finally understands how badly he did in the 2020 debate,\" Wallace said. \"The two words that are coming out ― you don’t usually hear from the Trump camp ― are ‘nice’ and ‘respectful.'\"\n\n– James Powel and Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhite House reporters urge CNN to widen access during debate\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association said they're concerned about CNN’s decision to deny their request for a specific White House pool reporter inside the studio during the network’s presidential debate in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nCurrently, CNN rules state that a pool of still photographers will be allowed in the studio, but a reporter specifically representing print reporters will be given access during commercial breaks. But a broader group of White House reporters say they need more access to cover the historic event.\n\n“That is not sufficient in our view and diminishes a core principle of presidential coverage,” the statement says. “The White House pool has a duty to document, report and witness the president’s events and his movements on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Biden and Trump shake hands?\n\nIt's not clear. The president's campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told Fox News that he probably wouldn't shake Trump's hand, but he added that he believes \"President Biden consistently rises above pettiness.\" Prior to the 2016 election between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a handshake was a central part of decorum of presidential debates.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on Ukraine?\n\nTrump has called for pulling back on U.S. defense commitments, throwing into doubt additional U.S. aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has also privately said he could end Russia’s war in Ukraine by pressuring its embattled government to give up territory, the Washington Post reported, despite the repeated and vehement refusal of Ukraine's leaders to cede any land in the conflict.\n\nBiden has been a vocal supporter of additional U.S. aid to Ukraine. He struggled, but ultimately prevailed, in 2024 to get Congress to provide additional support for Israel in its fight against Hamas and for Ukraine in its war against Russia’s invasion.\n\n– John Bacon and David Jackson\n\nWho is Donald Trump's VP pick?

Five squares in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins bingo.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on health care?\n\nExpanding health care coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act and lowering prescription drug costs remain two of Biden’s signature campaign promises in his second presidential race.\n\nHe has called health care a right, not a privilege, for all. He succeeded in winning the right for Medicare to negotiate prices for a slate of drugs for seniors and to cap their annual costs at $2,000. He has said he wants to extend both policies to all Americans.\n\nTrump tried and failed to repeal the health care law signed by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Now, Trump says he does not want to repeal it but to improve it and make it cheaper. He has not released a specific plan.\n\nAs president, he did sign legislation to increase funding for substance use disorder treatment in the wake of the opioid epidemic, and in 2017 he declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump arrives in Atlanta\n\nDonald Trump's Trump motorcade is now leaving the airport in Atlanta ahead of the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nAge has taken center stage in the 2024 race for the White House. If either candidate on stage on Thursday wins in November, they will become the oldest person to take the oath of office.\n\nDonald Trump is 78 years old. He was born on June 14, 1946.\n\n– James Powel\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on the economy?\n\nDonald Trump receives some of his highest marks from voters on his handling of the economy. A Wall Street Journal poll in March found a majority of voters said they trust him to do a better job than Biden in bringing down inflation, a top economic concern.\n\nIn 2017, Trump and his fellow Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, which would expire during the next president’s term in 2025.\n\nBiden says he believes the best way to boost the U.S. economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. His economic plan has included the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan - a post-pandemic stimulus package - and funding for major infrastructure projects and climate initiatives.\n\nBiden has called for an increase in the minimum corporate tax to 21% from 15%. He also wants to restore a previous version of the Child Tax Credit, make the healthcare tax credit permanent and give new home buyers a $400 a month tax credit for two years to bring down mortgage costs.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nLooking for a debate drinking game?\n\nThe first presidential debate of the 2024 general election is set for Thursday night, with presumptive Democratic nominee President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, set to meet face to face for the first time since the White House changed hands in 2021.\n\nHere are three games that can help you get through the presidential debate Thursday night.\n\nFrom Bingo to shotsPresidential debate drinking games, an American tradition\n\n– James Powel\n\nMary Trump, Donald Trump's niece, to make pitch for Biden at presidential debate\n\nMary Trump, a psychologist, writer, and niece and critic of former President Donald Trump, will make an appearance in the spin room following Thursday's CNN presidential debate, the Biden campaign said.\n\nShe will be supporting her uncle’s opponent, current President Joe Biden, and will be joined by several key Democratic leaders, including Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, California Rep. Robert Garcia and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n– Joey Garrison and Maya Homan\n\nHow old is Joe Biden?\n\nAge has taken center stage in the 2024 race for the White House. If either candidate on stage on Thursday wins in November, they will become the oldest person to take the oath of office.\n\nBiden was born on November 20, 1942. He is 81 years old.\n\n– James Powel\n\nWhere do Biden and Trump stand on climate change?\n\nTrump opposes most climate change legislation, a position that hasn’t changed since his term in the White House. During his presidency, he withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, a global climate initiative that Biden rejoined once he took office.\n\nBiden has warned that denying the impacts of climate change in the U.S. and around the world is “condemning the American people to a very dangerous future.” He has also set a national goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 and has pledged to make the American power sector 100% carbon-pollution-free by 2035.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAre Trump and Biden in Atlanta?\n\nBiden arrived in Atlanta this afternoon and greeted groups of supporters chanting “four more years” and “let’s go Joe,” according to White House press pool reports.\n\nTrump is expected to arrive in the Peach State at approximately 5:30 p.m.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nYes, Donald Trump is still waiting for Supreme Court to rule on immunity\n\nThe former president debates while he and the rest of the political world are on the cusp of an important legal ruling: A Supreme Court decision on his claim of immunity from prosecution for actions he took while in office.\n\nCourt rulings announced Thursday did not include the immunity case, which could determine when - and if - Trump is tried on criminal charges he tried to steal the 2020 election from Biden.\n\nThe high court is scheduled to issue more rulings on Friday, but that is not expected to be the final day of the current term. So the Trump immunity decision could slip until next week.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDemocratic governors talk Biden, debate expectations\n\nSeveral Democratic governors from across the country gathered in Minneapolis Monday on the anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While there, they looked ahead to tonight’s debate.\n\n“This will be the first opportunity in a long time for people to see the contrast of these two people side by side,” Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly told USA TODAY. “And I think if people are watching with open minds, open eyes, the contrast will be startling.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he wouldn’t give the president and leader of his party any advice ahead of the 2024 showdown.\n\n“This isn't theoretical. There's two people who are going to be president, one or the other,” Walz said. “There's going to be a vision that's hopeful, compassionate, optimistic, addressing climate change, addressing inequities. And then there's going to be grievance filled, you know, anger coming from former President Trump.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the debate?\n\nThe debate is scheduled to last 90 minutes and will include two commercial breaks.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nMust-watch cringe TV:Few swing state voters want to see Trump-Biden debate\n\nCNN says debate will not have an extended delay\n\nCNN corrected rumors that the first presidential debate will air with a 1–2-minute delay, instead of the standard 7-second delay, allowing the network to potentially edit parts of the broadcast. CNN Communications responded in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating “This is false. The debate will begin live at 9pm ET.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhere is the presidential debate?\n\nThe first presidential debate will take place at CNN’s studio in Atlanta, Georgia, without a live studio audience.\n\n– Rachel Barber", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/politics/biden-democratic-primary-challenge-2024/index.html", "title": "As worries about Biden in 2024 grow, other Democrats aren't ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA challenge requires a challenger – and all the Democrats being discussed as potential primary opponents to President Joe Biden tell CNN they’re ruling out runs and warning others to follow suit.\n\nThe chatter is fed by Democratic officials and party leaders who have begun to doubt that Biden is, as he’s insisted privately to donors and others, their strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump – or another GOP candidate – in 2024. And it’s being propelled even more by the 79-year-old President’s age, which has prompted questions about what kind of campaign schedule he’d be able to keep up.\n\nFear runs deep of yet another unfavorable Biden comparison to Jimmy Carter, who survived a 1980 primary challenge from Ted Kennedy but not the lasting wound going into the general election. Democrats privately hoping Biden might reverse course and not run are petrified that they’re backbiting their way into allowing Trump and Trumpism back into power.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped muted worries from going around the West Wing, according to four aides familiar with the conversations, that someone may yet emerge ahead of the President’s planned spring 2023 formal reelection campaign launch. Biden advisers expect to stick to that no matter what happens, including if Trump decides to jump in early.\n\n“Nothing about our timeline changes, but we’re prepared if he decides to run,” one person familiar with the Biden team’s political planning said about Trump.\n\nBut even Rep. Ro Khanna, the California congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, who first won his seat by beating an incumbent in a primary, said he won’t entertain the thought of jumping in against Biden, although he’s aware he’s being whispered about – so much that a close friend had a dream over July Fourth weekend that he did it.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Khanna told CNN. “I plan to support (Biden) because of the danger that Donald Trump poses. I would certainly not do anything to weaken him, and I hope no one else will do anything to weaken him. He’s still the safe brand in the midwestern states to make sure Trump is kept far away from the Oval Office.”\n\nThat also goes for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been causing the most antsy whispers from the Biden orbit with his comments calling out a lack of Democratic action and energy and his buying a July Fourth ad in Florida hitting Gov. Ron DeSantis, a prospective 2024 GOP candidate. Newsom, who’s facing reelection in November, compared the Democratic dynamics to those he initially faced in his recall election last year, when he and advisers worked to scare off several Democrats who’d looked at jumping in against him.\n\n“The success of our recall was about unifying around our party and defining the opposition. We need to unify the Democratic Party and not destroy ourselves from within,” Newsom said. “We need to have our President’s back. But we also have to get on the field. He needs troops. He has to govern. Our job is to organize, and it’s to have his back.”\n\nThe same goes for J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire first-term Illinois governor who also drew some behind-the-scenes brushback from Biden world by delivering a speech about his exhaustion with the Democratic status quo in famous first-presidential primary state New Hampshire. The Democrat, who’s running for a second term in November, lit up even more speculation with his response to the Highland Park shooting in his state earlier this month, which was more forceful than Biden’s.\n\nBiden “has said he’s running for reelection and I support that,” Pritzker told CNN, adding that though he thinks some other opponent may yet emerge, Biden “will win the nomination, and yet, it’ll be Ted Kennedy running against Jimmy Carter … They will lose and they will take away from the President. That’s not what we need right now.”\n\nThe speculation is at a high enough fever that when Pete Buttigieg’s PAC reactivated on Twitter at the end of June to endorse a few candidates for US House and state legislature, several plugged-in operatives began to wonder if this was the first step in the transportation secretary relaunching as a candidate. His attendance at Democratic National Committee events and meetings with a few potential future donors only sparked more talk.\n\nBut there’s nothing to that, according to a Transportation Department spokesperson, who said, “Buttigieg has had no involvement in Win the Era PAC since his nomination as Secretary. He is 100 percent focused on his job at DOT, including implementing President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.”\n\nSome have talked about Jared Polis, the Colorado governor known for straying from what became Democratic orthodoxy on Covid-19 lockdowns and is facing voters this fall. He has a personal fortune, several operatives noted, and while not enough to self-fund, enough to possibly seed a campaign and feel confident that he wouldn’t have to worry about endangering future job prospects. Polis campaign spokesperson Amber Miller said he’s “not considering anything like that and is focused on running the state of Colorado. If he is re-elected, he plans to serve his entire term as governor of Colorado.”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly said Biden intends to run and that she’d be his running mate, and no one around her or anywhere else believes she’d be able to pull off a campaign that started by breaking with him.\n\nSanders, the Vermont senator who has twice sought the Democratic nod, told CNN last month he would not run against Biden. A spokesperson for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, told CNN that nothing has changed since the Massachusetts Democrat told NBC News that she’s not running for president in 2024 and would be supporting Biden. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ top political adviser and former campaign manager, said trying to run by appealing to his wing of the party “would be an almost insurmountable climb to get to the top of that mountain, given that Bernie has said he’s going to be supporting Joe Biden if he runs for re-election.”\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated a member of Democratic House leadership to come to Congress, told late night host Stephen Colbert at the end of June that she was more focused on preserving American democracy than presidential speculation.\n\nBut she’s also held off on saying she would support Biden for reelection, noting that the President hasn’t said he’s running himself.\n\nAsked by CNN if that left space for her to consider running a youthful, progressive primary against him, a spokesperson for the congresswoman didn’t return requests for comment.\n\nFacing a ‘soft’ primary\n\nCarter-Kennedy isn’t the only historical example on Democrats’ minds. There’s Ronald Reagan’s bruising 1976 primary campaign against Republican President Gerald Ford, which helped pave the way for Carter’s win. Or George H.W. Bush never quite recovering from Pat Buchanan’s 1992 primary campaign, which hurt him with the GOP base heading into the general election.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, though, cited 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson faced a primary challenge from Eugene McCarthy. Eventually, other candidates jumped in, leading the President to withdraw that March from running for reelection.\n\nOperatives around a number of prospective presidential candidates argue that Biden is already facing a “soft” primary challenge from many directions. The goal, they say, is not to run against Biden, but rather to implicitly reassure the President that Democrats have other good options from the next generation or two, and that he should be comfortable passing the torch to them.\n\nThe other goal is for Democrats to get as ready as they can, on the chance that Biden drags out his reelection decision and then changes his mind so late into the presidential cycle that other candidates are hobbled in launching campaigns and raising money.\n\nFor all the free media attention that would come from declaring a primary campaign against Biden, no one seems to want to go down as blowing a hole in the party for Republicans to march back through – particularly at a moment when apocalyptic feelings are so high. This is about future ambitions, too: Those would-be candidates are aware Democratic voters would never forgive a spoiler.\n\n“It’s about us having his back, not taking back some wing of the party,” Newsom said. “It’s about everybody disabusing ourselves that we have the luxury of division from within.”\n\n“I believe there will be plenty of time post-Donald Trump to debate the future of the Democratic Party,” Khanna said. “For people who have future ambition, they’d much rather be running in a post-Donald Trump and post-Joe Biden world.”\n\nBarack Obama faced a flurry of primary speculation at about this point ahead of his own reelection campaign 12 years ago – to the point that Gallup tested how well he’d do if Hillary Clinton ran against him, and Sanders started poking around in New Hampshire about jumping in against him.\n\nMany of the Democratic leaders, operatives and donors who spoke to CNN about having these conversations insist it’s precisely their fear of Trump beating Biden that is driving them to cast around for possible other options.\n\nNot only is Biden now clocking lower approval ratings than almost every Democratic governor and senator on the ballot in November, but several internal Democratic polls have shown him struggling against Trump in battleground states.\n\nAsked if he understood what was generating the talk of a primary challenge that he thinks may yet emerge, Pritzker paused. First, he reiterated his support of Biden. Then, he repeated his call for more energy and action, without mentioning the President specifically.\n\n“We absolutely need to be stronger and louder in our condemnation of the right wing and what they stand for, and in our defense of the liberties of women and those who are marginalized,” Pritzker said. “There is a palpable change in attitude among Democrats.”\n\nPushing back on the nudging\n\nBefore he launched his 2020 campaign, Biden advisers had bounced around the idea of a one-term pledge as a way to answer questions about his age. Biden nixed the idea, saying he’d never be able to get anything done as an immediate lame duck. He’s made similar comments about what would happen to his power at home and on the world stage if he were to announce he’s not running for reelection.\n\nFew around Biden see that changing. Some even suggested that a primary challenger could inadvertently help him recover from approval numbers stuck below 40% by giving him a foil. If that challenge came from the left and allowed him to argue he hasn’t kowtowed to progressives – as Republicans and some Democratic moderates claim – several operatives said that would be even better.\n\nBut as White House aides regularly point out, no incumbent president has launched a reelection campaign this early, and Biden was the last serious primary contender to announce a 2020 campaign, pushing back on those who urged him to declare earlier.\n\n“There’s nobody who’s more infamous about his inability to make a decision about running for president of the United States,” joked one Democratic member of Congress, who asked not to be named. “And hey, he’s President.”\n\nAnd while four years ago at this same point ahead of the 2020 cycle, the Democratic National Committee was deep into preparations for primaries and debates, no such efforts are underway.\n\nLong before he became famous for managing Howard Dean’s anti-establishment 2004 presidential campaign (in what was an open Democratic field), Joe Trippi was a young aide to Kennedy’s 1980 primary challenge, running the floor operation for several states on the floor of the convention that summer.\n\nTrippi said he hopes anyone thinking of a Biden primary realizes it would be “murder-suicide,” and warned his fellow Democrats: “Nothing good can come from it.”\n\n“I learned that lesson the hard way as a young idealistic progressive in the late 70s early 80s,” Trippi said. “What we got for it was eight years of Reagan and four years of H.W. Bush.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/05/super-tuesday-2024-live-results-updates/72839863007/", "title": "Super Tuesday recap: Trump, Biden pick up big wins; Haley set to ...", "text": "Nikki Haley will drop out of the 2024 presidential race after voters across the country made their voices heard on Super Tuesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump defeated Haley, the former South Carolina Governor, in more than a dozen states, taking his most significant step yet towards the 2024 Republican nomination.

The president has 206 delegates ahead of Tuesday polls closing.\n\nAmong Biden’s Democratic challengers are Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. The multimillionaire launched his presidential bid in October attempting to pull moderate and liberal voters with disapproval for the president. Last month, Phillips announced major layoffs at his campaign staff citing a lack of funds but has persisted in his long-shot battle.\n\nAnother opponent is author Marianne Williamson, who announced her run for presidency in February 2023. Williamson’s campaign focused on forgiving student debt and confronting the climate crisis.\n\nThe “Peace Alliance” founder rejoined the race on Wednesday after she announced plans to suspend her campaign last month. Williamson said she rethought her decision after questioning Biden’s ability to beat Trump in the general election calling the former president a “fascist standing at the door.”\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nJoe Biden racks up Vermont’s delegates\n\nJoe Biden won Vermont’s primary on Tuesday night defeating his Democratic challengers including Rep.

They pledged not to let it happen again and revamped their campaign strategy to engage voters year-round.\n\nThey have swept the last three elections, including flipping the state for Biden in 2020. But it remains to be seen whether the strategy will work again this fall: Trump is ahead in recent state polls.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden declared victory in Virginia primary\n\nJoe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Virginia, racking up delegates in the state that borders the nation’s capital.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow many delegates does Joe Biden have?\n\nJoe Biden heads into Super Tuesday as the clear frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nBiden has 206 delegates headed into Super Tuesday, with a whopping 1,420 Democratic delegates up for grabs across tonight's elections. He also officially won Iowa's Democratic Caucuses on Thursday.\n\nBiden needs to secure 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n− Cy Neff\n\nAlabama voters head to the polls two weeks after IVF ruling\n\nAs Alabama voters head to the polls, the repercussions of the state's Supreme Court decision are reverberating across the country. Two weeks ago, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in in vitro fertilization are considered children and are entitled to protections under the state’s wrongful death laws.\n\nThe blowback was immediate: The decision kicked off a frenzy among patients and doctors grappling with its implications for people attempting to conceive, often after years of struggling to have children or other complications in family planning. Democrats immediately began messaging on the ruling as further evidence of a GOP-led effort to restrict reproductive rights.\n\nThe Senate Republican campaign arm urged Senate candidates to \"clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government\" to restrict IVF. Candidates followed suit, as did most Republican lawmakers in Congress.\n\nBut when Democrats in the Senate put them to the test by asking them to greenlight a bill that would protect IVF at the federal level, many Republican senators said it’s an issue best left up to the states.− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden wins Iowa's Democratic Caucus\n\nJoe Biden won Iowa's Democratic caucus, clinching a quick victory to kick off Super Tuesday's results.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nChris Christie, Ryan Binkley, Asa Hutchinson: Which candidates have dropped out of the 2024 race?\n\nOn the Republican side, Florida Gov.

Doug Burgum have dropped out of the presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump and Nikki Haley are still competing against each other for the Republican nomination\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Joe Biden, Rep.

But she has repeatedly denied that she wants to run for national office.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen do polls close on Super Tuesday?\n\nHere's a look at when polls will close states across the country holding elections on Super Tuesday.

As for voters who submitted their ballots by mail, roughly 19,000 ballots have been counted across North Carolina.\n\nWhile 49,000 mail-in ballots were requested, Bell said the actual number of submitted mail-in ballots can change if voters decide to vote in person on election day.\n\n— Molly Wilhelm, Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSuper Tuesday critique: Donald Trump attacks Fox commentators ahead of election night\n\nTrump took some time off from Super Tuesday preparation to criticize a pair of Fox News commentators.\n\nHard to say what exactly set off Trump, but he claimed on his Truth Social platform that Marc Thiessen \"was wrong about me in 2016, and in 2020 I got more votes than any sitting President in history.\"\n\nTrump, who otherwise used Truth Social to endorse other Republican candidates running on Super Tuesday, also looped former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove into his media critique.\n\n\"Put on people who understand what is going on in politics,\" Trump said. \"And while you’re at it, GET RID OF KARL ROVE!!!\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nFact checking campaign ads for you\n\nCampaign ads have flooded social media leading up to Super Tuesday as the remaining presidential candidates attempt to win over primary voters in 15 states and one territory.\n\nThese ads have spread widely – to more than a million screens in some cases – but many include false or misleading descriptions of past actions and policy proposals. Here’s a rundown of recent ads debunked by the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWhen will Super Tuesday results come in?\n\nIt depends on the state. Most polls are closing by 8 p.m. local time, but states across time zones are holding elections on Tuesday, from Maine to Alaska and California.\n\nCheck back here as the USA TODAY Network keeps you updated on races across the country.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow many delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday?\n\nThere are 865 Republican delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday and 1,420 Democratic delegates.\n\nThe Trump campaign suggested in a memo last month that the former president will likely lock in the nomination on March 12, just one week after Super Tuesday, with 1,223 delegates. In a worst case scenario, the campaign estimates he will become the designated nominee no later than March 19.\n\nA candidate must secure the majority of delegates, 1,215, to secure the Republican nomination.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill new election laws impact the outcome in North Carolina's primary?\n\nA trove of new election laws – including a ban on ballot drop boxes, new limits for mail-in ballot returns and required proof of voter ID at polls – will be tested in North Carolina on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe key swing state’s legislature was one of 14 states that passed additional restrictions last year. Some experts and advocates fear the laws could impact turnout on Super Tuesday, a test for the November general election.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Chris Kenning\n\nHow many states vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on March 5 include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on Super Tuesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nCalifornia Senate race: Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and other Democrats compete\n\nTuesday will also determine which two candidates in the heated California Senate race will advance to the general election. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, will land on the ballot in November.\n\nWhile Californians will choose from 27 candidates on Tuesday, the likely frontrunners are among three Democrats – California Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee – and one Republican, Steve Garvey, a former baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The candidates are running to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who died last year.\n\nPolling from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, last week found Garvey in a two-point lead over Schiff coming in at 27%. Schiff polled at 25% followed by Porter and Lee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nSome states hold primaries, while others opt for a caucus. While a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting taking place via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer, and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\nUp for grabs in each caucus and primary is a certain number of delegates. The delegates are sent to each party's national convention, and the candidate with the majority secures the nomination.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJoe Biden competes in Super Tuesday ahead of the State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden is competing in more than a dozen Super Tuesday states before he delivers his 2024 State of the Union address to lawmakers and Americans across the country on Thursday.\n\nThe president is expected to address the issues dividing the nation, ranging from inflation to abortion rights and the U.S. southern border. You can read more about the history of the presidential address here.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAlabama voters were sent wrong information ahead of election\n\nA representative from the Montgomery County Board of Registrars confirmed Tuesday that a portion of Montgomery voters got the wrong voting information ahead of the election.\n\nRegistrar Mark Anderson said on Super Tuesday that a mapping issue led to voters in the 2nd Congressional District being told that they were in a different district.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reported that at least 5,604 voters received information that they were in the 7th Congressional District, instead of the newly established, majority-Black 2nd District. Of the 5,604 voters, 4,513 of them are Black, SPLC reported.\n\nThe SPLC became aware of the issue over the weekend. Some Montgomery County voters received postcards with the incorrect congressional district.\n\n– Alex Gladden\n\nTrump says he’s not worried about raising money for legal cases\n\nIn addition to running a presidential campaign, Trump is spending his recent days trying to figure out how to pay more than $500 million in civil damages for bank fraud and defamation.\n\nIn his Super Tuesday interview on Fox News, Trump said he will be able to raise the money - but he didn’t say how.\n\n“I don’t worry about anything,” Trump said. “No, I don't worry about the money. I don't worry about money.”\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat states did Trump, Biden win on previous Super Tuesdays?\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, 14 states held primaries on Super Tuesday.\n\nTrump, the incumbent nominee running for his second term, carried all 13 of the Super Tuesday states (Virginia cancelled its GOP primary). Biden won by slightly smaller margins, winning delegates in 11 states with four going to then-candidate Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nWhen Trump launched his first presidential campaign in 2016, 11 states held primaries on Super Tuesday. The former president competed in a crowded field of Republicans but ultimately won in seven of the eleven states. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was declared the winner in three states and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won one state.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill Nikki Haley suspend her campaign?\n\nThe former South Carolina governor has repeatedly said she has no plans to drop out of the 2024 race for the White House. But Tuesday has the potential to deliver one of the heaviest blows to her campaign, and speculation has grown about her next steps.\n\nWould she join the long list of Republicans who have dropped out of the race and backed Trump as nominee? Or will Haley, seen by many as a moderate alternative to a Biden-Trump rematch, launch a third-party run?\n\nHaley continued to dodge the first question, defiantly telling Fox News Monday afternoon that they should ask Trump whether he would support another Republican nominee instead.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat will Donald Trump do after Super Tuesday?\n\nSince announcing his campaign in 2022, the former president has looked like a shoo-in for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAnd while Super Tuesday can’t clinch the spot for him – a nominee needs 1,215 delegates, and Trump will still be a handful short even if he sweeps the country – Tuesday could very well boost him closer to the finish line.\n\nBut despite his popularity with his conservative base, Trump would also likely need to tap into support from moderates and independents in a general election. Trump appeared to be starting that shift after his first primary election victory in January’s Iowa Caucuses.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nFacebook down on Super Tuesday\n\nFacebook users may have encountered the social media site not working properly on the morning of Super Tuesday.\n\nAround 9 a.m. ET, hundreds of thousands of users reported Facebook being down during one of the biggest election days of the year, according to Downdetector.\n\nMany users were reporting being logged out of Facebook accounts with no ability to log back in. It's unclear when Facebook will be back online for some users as polls begin opening for primary voters.\n\n-- Jonathan Limehouse\n\nStein: ‘Grab your photo ID’ North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein had some sage advice for voters flocking to the polls on Tuesday: bring a photo ID card.\n\nThat’s because the swing state has a litany of new laws that will be tested for the first time on Super Tuesday as Tar Heel State voters make a choice in one of the most closely watched gubernatorial contests this year.\n\nAmong them is a 2018 voter identification law that had been delayed by lawsuits. Another rule change also required mail-in ballots to include a copy of the voter’s photo ID.\n\nIn 2023, Republican state legislators went further by establishing a rule that any mail-in ballot received after the election wouldn’t be counted which Democratic opponents slammed because it kills the previous three-day grace period that allowed ballots to be counted as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nVoting rights groups have warned such laws will be hard to navigate for some, and they are keeping an eye out for trouble.\n\nStein, who is favored to win the Democratic nomination for governor, has spoken against the new laws and resisted them in his capacity as attorney general. He is likely to face Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who has spoken in favor of such laws as needed to protect election integrity.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat to watch in North Carolina’s governor’s race\n\nNorth Carolina will serve as the battleground for a marquee gubernatorial race: a likely faceoff between a Southern Democrat and a GOP candidate who is popular with Donald Trump's base.\n\nAs millions are flocking to the polls for Super Tuesday, primary voters in North Carolina have a sharp contrast in the two party's leading contenders to fill Cooper's seat: Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson.\n\nOnce a reliable Republican stronghold − long associated with the southern fried conservatism of the late Sen. Jesse Helms − the Tar Heel State has become more competitive largely because of diverse population growth.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNorth Carolina primary to set the stage for 2024 battleground\n\nPresidential candidates have been focusing their attention on North Carolina in the leadup to Super Tuesday, setting the groundwork for what analysts expect will be a hyper-competitive general election matchup.\n\nNorth Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democratic president since Barack Obama flipped the state in 2008. But it represented Donald Trump’s narrowest margin of victory in the 2020 election when he won it by just 1.34 percentage points over Joe Biden.\n\nBiden’s campaign is already setting its sights on an expected rematch, earlier this year installing a team of campaign staffers on the ground and committing Biden and other surrogates to appearing in the state.\n\nDemocrats dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Durham ahead of Super Tuesday to announce a $32 million investment from the American Rescue Plan Act, and Biden was in the state in January announcing a major investment in broadband internet infrastructure.\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump campaigned in Greensboro March 2 while his primary competitor Nikki Haley rallied supporters in Charlotte and Raleigh.\n\nPolling places are open in North Carolina until 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n—Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhy is today called Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the primary election day that decides the bulk of delegates for candidates in their respective parties.\n\nThe name “Super Tuesday” historical has been used to reference primary days when a significant number of states hold their primary elections, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nIn 1984, the modern \"Super Tuesday\" began when March became the month to “frontload” the primaries.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDonald Trump to hold rally Saturday in Georgia\n\nThe Trump campaign is starting to outline its post-Super Tuesday schedule, and it includes a weekend rally in a politically and legally significant state: Georgia.\n\nThe Saturday event takes place in Rome, Ga.\n\nTrump held a similar rally in nearby Dalton, Ga., on Jan. 4, 2021 - two days before the attempted insurrection by Trump supporters that tried to block Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote that elected Biden.\n\nUsing that rally in part to protest the 2020 election, Trump basically urged Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans to toss Biden electoral votes and re-elect him instead.\n\n\"People will remember the people who don’t support us,\" Trump said on that occasion.\n\nTrump now faces criminal trials in Georgia and in Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nIowa Poll: Trump dominates Biden in 2024 lead-up\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump would nearly double his margin of victory in Iowa over incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden if a rematch of their 2020 contest were held now, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn an early test of the expected matchup, Trump leads Biden by 15 percentage points among likely voters, 48% to 33%. Another 15% of poll respondents would vote for “someone else,” 1% would not vote and 2% are not sure.\n\nIn 2020, Trump defeated Biden in Iowa by about 8 percentage points.\n\n- Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhat states are involved on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on Tuesday include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on March 5.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump calls for Republican unity - while blasting Haley\n\nTrump began his Super Tuesday with a phone interview on Fox News and predicted Republican unity in the fall election - though he had few good things to say about Haley and her supporters.\n\n\"There's no path for her to win,\" Trump said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding that her continuing candidacy is only \"hurting the Republican Party.\"\n\nStill, Trump said that \"our party has to come together because we have to beat the Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to exit polls, many Haley supporters say they will not back Trump in the general election; that could create a drag that will undercut Trump's chances of defeating Biden.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nTaylor Swift encourages fans to vote on Super Tuesday\n\nTaylor Swift encouraged fans to vote on Super Tuesday but did not make a presidential endorsement.\n\n\"Today, March 5, is the Presidential Primary in Tennessee and 16 other states and territories,\" Swift wrote in her Instagram story. \"I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power. If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today.\"\n\n\"Whether you're in Tennessee or somewhere else in the US,\" Swift continued, \"check your polling places and times at vote.org.\"\n\n- Bryan West\n\nDo Democrats vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nYes – Democrats also vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic primary is not as consequential as the Republican primary because President Joe Biden is the incumbent candidate running for his second term and the likely Democratic nominee for the party in a much less contentious race for the nomination.\n\nWhile Biden does face two Democratic challengers – Dean Phillips and Marianne WIlliamson – both have yet to receive any delegates during state primaries held previously. Biden has 206 delegates prior to Super Tuesday polls closing.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat races are at stake on Super Tuesday – other than the presidential election?\n\nIt’s not just the presidential primaries that matter on Super Tuesday. Other competitive election are slated to happen in the states voting on March 5.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, is seeing a fierce intra-party primary battle between three major Democrats for a solidly blue open Senate seat in the liberal state. California voters will also consider a ballot measure known as Proposition 1, which would address the state's mental health system and homelessness crisis.\n\nNorth Carolinians will also vote in a gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, setting up what's expected to be a high-pressure race in the fall. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, while North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is expected to lead Republicans.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCandidates need to reach 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, 1,420 delegates are up for grabs, nearly three quarters of the delegates needed to become the party nominee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhich Super Tuesday states have open primaries?\n\nMost primaries fall into one of five categories: closed, partially closed, open to unaffiliated voters, partially open and open, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. The critical distinction among the categories is whether voters who are not registered party members can participate in a party’s primary.\n\nOpen primaries allow voters to choose which party’s ballot to vote without having to disclose or register with that respective party. This gives voters the opportunity to vote across party lines. Six Super Tuesday states will hold open primaries: Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nFive other states - Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Tennessee – will be open to unaffiliated voters on Super Tuesday, meaning voters who are not registered to a specific party can participate in a party’s primary of their choosing.\n\n- Kathryn Palmer and Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/05/26/california-primary-2022-41st-district-congress-calvert-rollins-lucio-views/9893339002/", "title": "41st Congressional District: Candidates discuss views on inflation ...", "text": "After California's redistricting process last year led to a split in the Coachella Valley's congressional districts, Republican incumbent Rep.

Raul Ruiz, a Democrat who has represented the western Coachella Valley since 2013, is seeking re-election in the valley's other district, the 25th Congressional District, which encompasses Cathedral City, Desert Hot Springs, Coachella and Indio, along with Imperial County and a sliver of San Bernardino County.\n\nIn congressional and legislative races, the top two finishers in the primary election — regardless of party — will advance to the state's general election Nov. 8.\n\nWith voting underway in California's primary election that concludes on Election Day June 7, here are the written responses to questions posed by The Desert Sun from Calvert, Kurani, Rollins, Nevenic and Lucio.\n\nEditor's note: Responses have not been edited for spelling or grammar.\n\nWhat drove you to run for election in California’s 41st Congressional District?\n\nKen Calvert: The main reason I’m running is because we need to get our country back on track. Under President Biden and one-party Democrat rule in Washington we have seen one crisis after another. Recent polls show only 2 in 10 Americans think our country is on the right track. The Democrats in this race will be a rubber stamp for the Biden/Pelosi agenda that Americans are suffering under.\n\nI’m also running because I want to continue delivering results for Riverside County. I have experience and seniority, especially on the House Appropriations Committee, that puts me in a unique position to ensure our region’s priorities are met. I am the only major party candidate who has lived in this district all their life. As a former small business owner, I also understand how difficult times are for people trying to stay afloat right now and will work to relieve the inflationary pressures on businesses that translate into higher costs for consumers.\n\nShrina Kurani: My parents immigrated here in the '80s, and they came to the United States seeking opportunity. I was born and raised in Riverside, and I grew up in my parents' small business. They worked seven days a week, and I spent my summers and days after school playing amongst the pool filters and pumps, until I started helping myself, sweeping floors and testing water for chlorine and alkalinity.\n\nI graduated from UC Riverside as a mechanical engineer and I’ve focused my career on how to make things work better. I’ve facilitated $2 million to small businesses in the area and over half a billion dollars across the nation, including to women-owned, LGBTQ-owned, and veteran-owned businesses, which has been critical throughout the pandemic.\n\nIf you look at Ken Calvert’s track record for the past three decades, he’s consistently voted against the interests of our community. Even during the pandemic, he voted against the American Rescue Plan which would bring $479 million to Riverside County, and is now voting against women’s rights and addressing the baby formula shortage.\n\nI am running for Congress to bring my approach to making things work better to Washington to put people first, create a sustainable future, and build an America where people feel safe, healthy, and have opportunities to succeed.\n\nWill Rollins: I became a national security and terrorism prosecutor because of 9/11. But over my career, I’ve seen the threats to our country change. Today, some of our biggest threats are right here at home, as people become radicalized by far-right conspiracy theories and disinformation. I have been on the front lines in the fight against extremism, helping to prosecute those who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6th and QAnon conspiracy theorists.\n\nThis is a systemic problem. Extremists, Big Tech and media outlets are profiting from spreading division based on lies, even as they erode our democracy and make it easier for adversaries like China and Russia to exploit us. We might not agree on who’s to blame for partisan disinformation, but we should agree that this level of divisiveness is unhealthy for our democracy and our communities. We need to end this cycle of division-for-profit by updating our laws to break down information bubbles and propaganda networks, to require transparency in advertising, and to create a modern Fairness Doctrine that protects the public’s right to be informed. And we need to get rid of politicians like Ken Calvert who believe service to one party — and one president — matters more than service to America itself.\n\nIf Americans can start agreeing on basic facts again, we can stop fighting each other and start working together on issues like our economy, infrastructure, and climate change. That’s why I’m running for Congress.\n\nAnna Nevenic: We need a change of direction in Washington. Most elected officials are too tied up to special interest and Super PAC's to make progress on the issues that affect average Americans. I care deeply about the future of our country. As a nurse, volunteer and community activist, I worked and conversed with thousands of people from all walks of life. Those roles have prepared me, to be an effective advocate for schools, students, seniors, veterans, homeless people, and all residents in the district. I will support a plan that works for seniors instead of drug companies. There are economic, social, and conservation solutions based on successful programs. We must focus on our common goals, a better future for our children and grandchildren.\n\nJohn Michael Lucio: Compared to other candidates who have been planning on running against the incumbent for a while, it was the January 6th insurrection on the Capitol and then how Calvert participated in trying to overturn the election that got me interested in running. Looking at Calvert’s 30-year history, Democrats were never able to competitively challenge Calvert. My seriousness in running originally was to try and pull Republican votes away from Calvert. After seeing multiple Democratic candidates running in an open primary, there was no way my original plan would work. At that point, I decided I had to be in it to win it. What the 41st needs is an option besides right-leaning and left-leaning candidates. Candidates who only see the district as red or blue. Besides the events of January 6th, the period after has been full of rhetoric, name calling, misinformation, and lies. I, like many other people, am just tired of the bullshit in politics. We need politicians who are about working together, doing what is right, and being transparent. Not anymore who are primarily swayed by party politics. That’s why I’m running to win.\n\nInflation in the United States recently hit a 40-year high, with gas, rental and grocery prices well above last year’s levels. How do you think Congress should respond to these inflationary pressures?\n\nKen Calvert: I’ve met with and listened to our manufacturers and key industry leaders, including Coachella Valley farmers. The cost of energy is a huge driver of the rising costs we are seeing. Higher gas and diesel prices as well as fertilizer have down market impacts across our economy. Americans are hurting because President Biden and Democrats in Congress have done everything in their power to shut down traditional American-made energy. Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline, imposed new restrictions on American energy exploration, canceled planned production lease sales, then acts surprised when lower supplies cause higher prices. I am the only candidate in this race who believes in reversing these policies. I support an all-of-the-above energy strategy that invests in renewables, harnesses domestic energy supplies, and reduces our dependence on foreign oil from dangerous dictatorships.\n\nShrina Kurani: Right now, the cost of living is rising with inflation and soaring gas prices eating at our paychecks while corporations like ExxonMobil, our largest oil company, reported its net profit more than doubled from last year, Chevron reported its highest quarterly profit in almost a decade, and Shell reported its highest earnings ever. The rising cost of goods is a result of corporate profiteering and our complex supply chain which evolved in times of relative peace and stability — from our lean manufacturing models we’ve been deploying for 5 decades which are efficient but not resilient, poor working conditions resulting in high turnover in the trucking industry which has manifested in a driver shortage, to the chip shortages we’ve seen after massive consolidation in chip manufacturing leading to now just five companies controlling over 50% of global capacity. We must address supply chain issues to lower inflation and reduce prices of everyday goods for everyday Americans.\n\nWill Rollins: Too many small businesses and working families are getting crushed by corporations with monopoly power. Costs of labor and goods are increasing for everyone, but when a handful of companies control the entire U.S. market for oil, agriculture, baby formula, and diapers, for example, they can keep their profits as high as they want without any competition. Shell just posted a record $9 billion in profit last quarter, and yet they’re charging us $7 per gallon at the pump and keeping their margins at 20% — even as taxpayers give these companies more than $20 billion in subsidies annually.\n\nThis won’t change if we keep sending representatives like Ken Calvert – who gets hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations – back to DC. We need to strengthen antitrust laws, create competitive markets in industries dominated by monopolies, and end subsidies for corporations that are price-gouging consumers.\n\nAnd to help with rising costs, let’s lower taxes on working families and small businesses by ensuring that billionaires actually pay their fair share. The wealthiest 400 families in the US pay an average of just 8 percent per year in federal income taxes and control more wealth than 60 percent of us — about 150,000,000 Americans — combined. I always ask people, “Did you pay more than zero dollars in federal income taxes last year?” Because two of the richest human beings to have ever lived — Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk — recently paid literally zero dollars in federal income taxes. Republicans and Democrats alike should be outraged that we’re stuck paying 30% or more while our laws allow the ultra-rich to pay nothing.\n\nAnna Nevenic: Some say that the economy is great, but for whom. Most Americans are forced to deal with rising costs for gas, health care, housing and college tuition. Inflation is caused primary by our over consummations of goods. Stimulus packages were given to everyone, regardless of the economic status. The inflation can be tackled, but we all must play the part. Consume less, drive less, carpool, take occasionally public transportation. Gas price is manipulated by oil companies, who are greedy and unscrupulous by all measurable means.\n\nGas cost is a major factor for increase in price for everything we buy and use. Trucking companies cost for fuel has doubled. As you know everything is delivered by trucks. When delivery cost is up, in retrospect we pay more for all goods and services.\n\nThe best solutions is to remove sanctions on Venezuela immediately. Sanctions only hurt people, not the political establishment. Stop delivery of oil from Saudi Arabia, located so far away. Let us help Venezuelan people who are unable to feed themselves.\n\nJohn Michael Lucio: Let’s be honest. Inflation is econ 101. It strictly has to do with supply and demand curves. Key indicators such as employment indicate the economy is working in some respects. Some aspects of inflation, such as grocery prices, are affected by other aspects, such as the costs of fuels and transportation. For some things, such as rental costs, are likely driven by the demand for available rentals. What I think is most prevalent in relation to what people are noticing is the rise in fuel prices. There are many factors that are affecting this including the war in Ukraine, OPEC’s refusal to increase their output, and what I would consider price-gouging by the major oil companies as shown by their increases in revenues. Congress does not have a whole lot of power to affect these changes. One side believes we should go after corporate profits, the other side thinks we should open up more drilling for those same corporations. As with all supply/demand curves, there is a point of equilibrium. We as consumers drive the market. What congress can do is work with federal agencies in making consumer buying power more efficient. Congress can start doing their part by managing debt and deficit spending better because if they don’t, it’s only a matter of time before tax increases are included in costs to us.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s draft opinion that would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision has drawn strong reactions nationwide, and also prompted an effort by congressional Democrats to codify the right to an abortion within federal law. Do you support codifying the right to an abortion at the federal level? And what was your reaction to the court’s leaked draft opinion?\n\nKen Calvert: First off, I believe the leak is an outrageous attempt to pressure and intimidate the Supreme Court as it deliberates an issue that has long divided our nation. Despite this leak, we do not know what actions the Court will ultimately take.\n\nI think it’s important for everyone to understand that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, that does not mean there’s suddenly a federal prohibition on abortion. It becomes a matter for each state to decide, which is what I support. Even the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg believed that the opinion in Roe should have been a narrower decision, not usurping the rights of states to make their own laws about abortion.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democratic majority in Congress tried but was unable to pass federal abortion legislation that would have taken away those states’ rights. They would have forced every state to legalize abortion on demand, including up to, and even during, the delivery of a baby. Even our European counterparts have reasonable restrictions on abortion, yet Democrats in Congress are insisting on abortion on demand up to 40 weeks. This is a difficult issue Americans have differing and passionate feelings about. In those instances, I believe government closest to the people can best represent how people feel.\n\nShrina Kurani: With the Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v Wade, Congress needs to pass legislation to codify Roe v Wade into law and protect the rights of women and LGBTQ Americans. Americans across the country are seeing what is at stake — with women’s rights under attack in this country, we need more women in elected office to help stand up for our rights. Ken Calvert voted against the Women’s Health Protection Act, and refuses to give women the respect and dignity we deserve. I will fight for a woman's right to choose and control her own body.\n\nWithout Roe v. Wade, full abortion bans even in the case of rape or where the mother’s life is in danger are on the table and we cannot stand for this, we cannot afford to move backwards on women’s rights in this way.\n\nWill Rollins: Access to abortion is a fundamental part of equality, privacy, and freedom under the law. The right to choice must be protected by Congress before tens of millions of American women lose the ability to control their own lives, health, and safety. The far right has already begun talking about a national abortion ban if they take power. We cannot let that happen.\n\nVoters should ask Rep. Calvert not only why he believes women don’t deserve the same reproductive freedom as men, but how he plans to enforce and pay for millions of government-mandated pregnancies. Does he think police officers should arrest any woman who asks her doctor about an abortion? Who does he plan to raise taxes on to pay for trillions of dollars in mandatory prenatal care? Should doctors and pharmacists be prosecuted for mailing the Morning After pill to patients?\n\nThis draft opinion is not the end of what the far-right has in store for women (and men): the ability to buy contraception, premarital sex, LGBTQ rights, and basic privacy in our bedrooms are now all on the line. America is supposed to be heading toward 2050, not 1850.\n\nAnna Nevenic: Women's right to choose, and to have control of her own body and reproductions, should not be dictated by church, or any government institutions. Both parties in Congress have used abortion as a political tool for too long. Women are tired of protesting and fighting for their personal freedom. Congress has the power to codify the abortion; but refused to do so in the past when one party has more supporters for this act. We can stop this travesty of justice now. If men were giving birth this issue would not play a role in the election process. If we provide comprehensive sex education and free birth control for women and girls, there would not be need for abortions. When Viagra came to market, Insurance companies covered the cost. What a double standard. Personal ideology has no place in political arena.\n\nJohn Michael Lucio: I would support codifying a right to choose in federal law. The reason is that the 9th amendment provides guarantees that rights provided to us that are not enumerated in the Constitution shall not be denied or disparage other rights given to us. Roe was a right given to us as a law of the land over 50 years ago. The judicial theory of Stare Decisis would have leaned in the direction of Roe remaining a right. One party has usurped the courts in their efforts for this one cause. Not only with codifying this law, but I would also like to see term limits for Supreme Court justices, only because the court has now become politicized. The remainder of the federal bench should remain life-long appointments. In regards to the leak, I spent most of my adult life working on highly-classified military programs for the government. What I found with classified materials, it was hard to keep those secrets. Anonymous sources use leaks to push their own agendas. I don’t know what the agenda of the leaker was, but I believe it was done because they see the politicization of the court and this was a sense of rebellion. The normal order in politics we use to know is gone. Norms are gone. It’s no surprise that SCOTUS, as the final untouched branch, is slipping below the surface of accepted standards and will be considered just as corrupt as the other branches are.\n\nLast year, the Biden administration set a target for the United States to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030, and zero them out by 2050. Do you support the administration setting these targets? And what steps, if any, do you think Congress should take to reduce the country’s carbon footprint in the coming years?\n\nKen Calvert: I support pursuing green energy alternatives, efforts to lower carbon emissions, and have championed programs to clean the air we breathe. In my opinion the best way to achieve those goals is by relying on American innovation and market forces to produce the technology we need. In fact, the U.S. has steadily reduced CO2 emissions since 2005. We can’t set and pursue arbitrary targets and ignore what economic impacts that may have in America. Especially if countries like China, Russia and India aren’t playing by the same rules and account for more carbon emissions than the U.S. and EU combined. Families are seeing the consequences of high energy costs today, and it is clear that Democrats do not care about the costs and in fact are ready to pursue even more punitive policies in service to their green agenda. Unlike my opponents, I strongly oppose a carbon tax which would disproportionately impact middle class and lower-income Americans. We can improve our environment and reduce emissions without hurting American families and job creators.\n\nShrina Kurani: Wildfire season is already upon us in California, and we cannot be left uninsured when it comes to climate action. In order to protect our environment for future generations, for our children and grandchildren, it requires us to vote out the biggest enemies to climate legislation in Congress. As an engineer and sustainability scientist, I’ve spent my career working to reduce waste and create quality jobs, and I’ve been an official delegate to the United Nations Climate Change negotiations since the Paris Agreement was signed, and that taught me that it is up to each of us to decide whether or not we will act to fight climate change, and as a country we have the opportunity to be a leader in developing a sustainable future.\n\nKen Calvert has a 7% scorecard from the League of Conservations Voters. He consistently votes against the environment and is effectively leaving us uninsured for the future. We need experts who know how to act on climate and who are focused on solving problems. I’ve worked to transition large industry in Southern California from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and we have the technology to cut emissions, gain energy independence, and boost our economy.\n\nWill Rollins: Climate change is an existential threat and one of the greatest challenges of our generation. I am committed to advancing an ambitious evidence- and science-based agenda to achieve net-zero emissions, leveraging every tool available for a swift transition to a more sustainable and cleaner planet and economy.\n\nRiverside County has the opportunity to develop thousands of small, clean-tech businesses that will have a foothold in expanding the green energy economy and the United States’ standing in clean energy. With the right tax incentives to encourage small, clean-tech businesses to start in the Inland Empire — and the assistance of the federal government in major infrastructure projects across the County — we will be able to grow our economy, improve public transit, and protect the planet all at the same time.\n\nTwo looming environmental issues impacting our region involve zoning and transportation laws and the cleanup and excavation of the Salton Sea. The region is growing rapidly, and I will fight for policies that promote smart growth and don’t leave at-risk communities behind, and ensure that we direct federal resources to the most vulnerable communities affected by climate change in our district.\n\nAnd finally, without access to clean drinking water, families and communities will suffer. We know that due to climate change, we’ll be facing increased numbers of droughts. We should be taking bold action now to reduce the impacts and mitigate the effects of climate change. We also need to secure billions of dollars in federal funding to ensure that our aging water infrastructure across the County is updated, capturing more runoff during storms and minimizing waste.\n\nAnna Nevenic: Cuts in carbon emissions is a major priority. We must work to expand further development of alternative energy sources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Some argue that we have enough oil in our country. We bring oil from the Middle East because it is cheaper to produce it there. Increased production of fossil energy, here at home will not lower gas price. Our companies export to Europe, because they are getting a higher return on their investment. As fires rage, water is scarce, and power is unreliable, we must work hard to reduce damage.\n\nWe have draughts in some area and coastal floods, because worldwide we have cut 60% of all trees. Trees are essential for absorbing carbon dioxide while at the same time inducing conditions for rainfalls. We must act now, the future can't wait. It is selfish and unconscionable not to take all measures to prevent world catastrophe for future generation. We are resilient people, together we can do it.\n\nJohn Michael Lucio: I am by far no expert on the climate and carbon emissions. We are talking about something that we, the United States, alone can solve. As far as the US goes, according to the EPA, burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor to greenhouse gases. I believe in nuclear energy. I spent my youth serving in the Navy and living onboard a nuclear submarine. I was constantly within 150 foot of a 160MW reactor. With proper oversight, I am 100% confident in nuclear operations. With this technology, it is too important to just let industry police themselves. We’ve seen failures when we pass off control to industry, such as the FAA certification of aircraft. Nuclear waste is a constant issue but I believe in the future technology will help us to solve this problem. I think the Biden administrations goals are stretch goals. Meaning, they are good targets but I do not believe we will ever achieve them, especially to zero by 2050. Congress is a big part of the problem. We have a market-based economy. Industry creates jobs and pays lobbyist to convince members of Congress to go against the interest of the general public and pursue those interests of the corporations. The only way Congress can have an effect would be by increased legislation. Such costs are always passed on to the consumer. We would be right back in the same supply/demand territory we are now because we all can’t afford to shift with these changes.\n\nTom Coulter covers politics and can be reached at thomas.coulter@desertsun.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/09/240-million-who-gets-joe-bidens-campaign-money/74295593007/", "title": "$240 million question: Who gets Joe Biden's campaign money?", "text": "If President Joe Biden exits the 2024 race, he'll leave behind hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds. He currently has $240 million split across a group of fundraising committees, according to Biden's campaign, which refers to its joint operation as Team Biden-Harris.\n\nThat's far more than sits in the war chests of any alternative Democratic nominee, including high-profile governors who have been campaigning nationally to fundraise for their own PACs.\n\nBut where the money trail would lead from there is unclear, because nothing like this has happened before. Even when President Lyndon B. Johnson dropped out of the 1968 presidential election, current campaign finance laws did not exist.\n\nHere's a rundown of where Team Biden-Harris' campaign money is stashed and where it would go if the president dropped out.\n\nBiden for President\n\nThis is the primary campaign committee for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and it had $91.6 million in the bank at the end of May. The conventional wisdom is that Harris would inherit this money if she became the nominee because her name is on the campaign's formation documents. And federal law says money of a presidential campaign also belongs to the vice presidential nominee.\n\nDan Weiner, the director of the Brennan Center for Justice's Elections & Government Program, cautioned that the law leaves a lot of gray area. \"It’s not crystal clear because I’m not sure if the people who drafted the Federal Election Campaign Act anticipated this situation,\" he said.\n\nIf Harris indeed gets the money, this would be Harris' only existing funding source. Her old war chests from her 2020 run for president and 2016 run for US Senate have both been zeroed out and deactivated.\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\nThe Democratic Party ended May with $65.2 million in its campaign war chest. While this money has become synonymous with Biden's presidential campaign, political parties use their money to support whoever their nominee is. That means that if Biden drops out of the campaign, this money would likely be used to support the campaign of whoever wins the nomination at the August convention.\n\n\"The DNC keeps that money and would presumably use it for the Democratic nominee, whether it’s President Biden or someone else,\" Weiner said. \"And I want to emphasize right now that all signs point to — it’s going to be President Biden.\"\n\nJoint fundraising committees\n\nBiden has three joint fundraising committees that pull in donations through a single account and then distribute them among many other PACs, ranging from his presidential campaign to local Democratic parties and the campaigns of members of Congress. At the end of March, Biden Victory Fund had $41.1 million; Biden Action Fund had $19.4 million; and Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund had $1.6 million.\n\nJoint fundraising committees are authorized by the groups receiving the money, and they form with written agreements saying how much money goes to each of those groups. That means, for example, that part of the Biden Victory Fund money belongs to Biden for President.\n\nHowever, it's common for these types of committees to file new paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to change how much money is allocated to which groups, and they might do that if Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nSuper PACs\n\nThe main super PAC supporting Biden is Future Forward, which ended May with $92.4 million in cash. Because super PACs are legally required to operate independently from candidates, Biden wouldn't have any official say in how this money is spent.\n\nThe leaders of Future Forward or any other super PACs currently supporting Biden may decide to spend the money on helping elect the new Democratic candidate for president, transfer the money to another super PAC, or refund the money to the donors.\n\nNewsom, Pritzker, Whitmer have small sums\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom ended December with $3.5 million in his 2022 gubernatorial campaign account. His national super PAC, Campaign for Democracy Group, ended March with $6 million, and the affiliated Campaign for Democracy PAC ended March with $6.2 million.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker ended March with $7.7 million in his state account for governor. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's gubernatorial campaign ended December with about $400,000 in the bank, and her Fight Like Hell PAC ended March with $1.8 million.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had $1.4 million in his Win the Era PAC at the end of March.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/02/08/democratic-debate-seven-candidates-new-hampshire-stage-make-case/4681958002/", "title": "Democratic debate: Seven candidates on New Hampshire stage ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg found out what it’s like to finish at the top in Iowa: you're targeted by your rivals in New Hampshire.\n\nThe Vermont senator and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor were often on the receiving end of attacks from the other five candidates on the debate stage at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H.\n\nSanders had to defend his electability as a democratic socialist and the expected large price tag on his proposals, such as Medicare for All.\n\nButtigieg had to defend his record on race as mayor and his relative lack of political experience on the national stage.\n\nAnd former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg took hits even though he wasn’t on stage, as rivals criticized him for spending tens of millions to win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n“I don’t think anybody ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a line that drew hearty applause from the audience. “I don’t think a billionaire ought to be able to do it and I don’t think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.”\n\nMore:A New Hampshire primary win is key for multiple Democrats. Here's what we know\n\nThe debate comes four days before New Hampshire holds the first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nIn the first few minutes of the debate, former vice president Joe Biden, who stumbled to a fourth-place finish in Iowa, acknowledged he won’t win New Hampshire.\n\n“I’ll probably take a hit here,” said Biden who is pinning his hopes on stronger finishes in Nevada (Feb. 22) and South Carolina (Feb. 29) where more diverse populations could give him a boost.\n\nThe debate could also be the last for long shots Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, who also got the least amount of speaking time.\n\nHere are some highlights from the night.\n\nKlobuchar on Trump: ‘He blames the king of Denmark, who does that?’\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar said that she believes the United States’ needs friends in the world.\n\nHer comments came after billionaire Tom Steyer criticized Trump’s strategy of isolating the United States.\n\nKlobuchar said that instead of having allies, “we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world.”\n\n“He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong,” Klobuchar said of Trump. “He blames his federal reserve chair he appointed himself. He blames the king of Denmark, who does that?\n\n“He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of Home Alone 2, who does that?” she continues. “That’s what Donald Trump does.”\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nCandidates team up against Bloomberg — and his money\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wasn’t on stage but the candidates were eager to talk about the billionaire presidential candidate who is spending tens of millions to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n“I don’t think anybody ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a line that drew hearty applause from the audience. “I don’t think a billionaire ought to be able to do it and I don’t think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.”\n\nThe Massachusetts senator known for her consumer activism also criticized her rivals for accepting money from PACs that can spend without limits.\n\n“Put your money where your mouth and say is and say not to PACs,” she said as she asked viewers to send $5 to her campaign and bemoaned the influence of big money in campaigns. “Understand this, our democracy hangs in the balance.”\n\n“I can’t stand the big money in politics,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed.\n\n“I just simply think people don’t look at the guy in the White House and say, ‘can we get someone richer?” the Minnesota senator said.’ I don’t think they think that. They want to have someone they can understand.”\n\nBernie Sanders tried to turn the criticism of wealthy people to Pete Buttigieg.\n\n“I don’t have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign.”\n\nButtigieg responded that Donald Trump and his allies raised $25 million just on Friday.\n\n“We need to go into that fight with everything we’ve got,” the former mayor said.\n\nButtigieg also disputed the suggestion that his campaign is fueled by rich people. As the only person on stage who is not a millionaire or billionaire, Buttigieg said, he knows something about building a movement. Because mayor of South Bend is not exactly a powerhouse fundraising position. Buttigieg said he is standing on the stage because of the thousands of average people who contributed.\n\n-- Ledyard King, Savannah Behrmann and Maureen Groppe\n\nSteyer pushes Biden on supporter's 'racist' comments\n\nTom Steyer took Joe Biden to task for a comment made by one of his backers in South Carolina. State Sen. Dick Harpootlian questioned what was behind Steyer’s payments to another state legislator.\n\n“Mr. Money Bags a.k.a @TomSteyer has paid S.C. State Rep. Jerry Govan almost $50,000 for a month worth of work? Is he pocketing the dough or redistributing the wealth? cc: Steyer FEC report,” Harpootlian tweeted\n\nSome members of the state’s black caucus thought that was a racially charged attack by implying Govan had done something illegal or wrong.\n\nSteyer challenged Biden to “come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian.”\n\nBiden countered that Steyer should join him in the “overwhelming support” he has from that black caucus. Biden said he has double the support that Steyer or anyone else has, which prompted Bernie Sanders to interject that several members of the black caucus support him.\n\nSteyer called Harpootlian’s remarks “openly racist” and again called on Biden “to do the right thing.”\n\nBiden said he’s already talked to Harpootlian and “I believe he’s sorry for what he said.”\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nButtigieg says 'systemic racism' part of why drug arrests went up in first mayoral year\n\nPete Buttigieg pointed to “systemic racism” as one of the reasons why marijuana drug arrests went up in the first year he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\n“There is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system and my city was not immune,” Buttigieg said.\n\nBut when asked specifically why marijuana drug arrests went up during the first year of his tenure, Buttigieg said that one of the strategies that his community adopted was to target gun violence and gang violence.\n\n“We adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder,” Buttigieg said. “These are all connected. But so are all the things that need to change.\"\n\nWarren was then asked whether it was a substantial answer from Buttigieg, who has been struggling to gain support among black voters.\n\nWarren simply said: “No,” which was followed by a wave of applause.\n\n“You have to own up to the facts,” Warren said. “And it’s important to own up to the facts of how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system.”\n\nIn addition, Yang used the moment to plug his “Freedom Dividend” which would provide $1,000 per month to every American over 18.\n\n“We can’t regulate (racial disparity) away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos, and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities,” he said addressing Warren.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer teed up the questioning, taking the discussion away from the Supreme Court to questioning why race wasn’t being discussed more substantially.\n\n“We have not said one word about race,” Steyer said. “Not one word.”\n\n“The night is still is young, many questions to come,” a moderator said, before throwing it over to Linsey Davis, who asked a question about race.\n\n-- by Rebecca Morin and Ledyard King\n\nSpeaking time halfway through the debate\n\nHalfway through the three-hour debate, Pete Buttigieg was leading the pack with nearly 16 minutes of speaking time.\n\nFollowing closely behind were Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, with nearly 15 minutes each.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren followed at 11 minutes, while Tom Steyer and Sen. Amy Klobuchar were both at almost nine minutes.\n\nAndrew Yang, who received only 1% in Iowa, had only spoken for five minutes.\n\n-- Savannah Behrmann\n\nStrong support for Roe v. Wade\n\nThe candidates came out strongly in favor of abortion rights, with Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren saying their Supreme Court nominees would have to support abortion rights.\n\n“It’s a woman’s right to do that. Period,” Biden said.\n\nAmy Klobuchar said she would only appoint judges that respect precedent, and that includes Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision saying women have a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe candidates also all backed legislation enshrining that right in law.\n\nButtigieg was asked about his proposal to expand the Supreme Court. He said it’s not a partisan move because he wants to also change the structure of the court so not all the justice are chosen through a political process.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nDrug crisis front and center in New Hampshire\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, who has often talked about her father’s alcoholism, said she would put a special emphasis on substance abuse treatment as president.\n\nSpeaking in a state where 467 people died of drug overdoses in 2017, the Minnesota Democrat said she would devote nearly $100 billion to combat opioid addiction. She explained how she would raise the money from closing tax loopholes and using money from n upcoming.\n\n“The people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better,” she said. “I will get this done. And it’s personal for me.”\n\nAndrew Yang was asked how he would implement his required three-day treatment for those arrest for drug use. There aren’t enough beds in New Hampshire or the nation to handle that, he was told.\n\nYang said he could take money from drug companies that have profited from the addiction epidemic.\n\nThe epidemic, he said, is not a money problem but a human problem.\n\nPete Buttigieg was asked about his proposal to decriminalize drugs: Does that include heroin, meth and cocaine?\n\nButtigieg said it still wouldn’t be lawful to produce or distribute such drugs. Without explaining how he would deal with drug users, Buttigieg talked about holding responsible drug companies who suppressed evidence of the addictiveness of their opioid medicines.\n\nThat has to happen, he said, even as the nation realizes that drug addiction is a medical issue, not a moral failure of those battling addiction,” he said.\n\n-- Ledyard King and Maureen Groppe\n\nSanders pressed about his record on guns\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders was asked about his gun control views in the past, including voting against background checks and a waiting period for buying firearms in his past.\n\n“I come, like New Hampshire, from a very, very rural state” Bernie explained. “In Vermont, until last ... two years ago, we had virtually no gun control legislation at all. I represented that perspective.”\n\nHe continued that “The world has changed and my views have changed.”\n\n“The bottom line is that I will not be intimidated by the NRA,” he concluded. “We’re going to run the gun policy that the American people want.\n\nHowever, Biden continued to hit Sanders on his track record, slamming him for voting against the ability to sue gun manufacturers, and the Brady Bill That mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers.\n\n\"Think of all of the thousands and thousands of people who died!\" Biden declared. “While you were representing your constituency, in a gun state, in fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands during that same period.\"\n\n“We have to be held accountable for the things we did,” Biden continued.\n\n-- Savannah Behrmann\n\nCandidates show love for Bernie following Clinton criticism\n\nSanders' fellow candidates showed him some love when the moderates brought up 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's criticism of his track record, saying “Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done.”\n\nBiden gave Sanders a quick side hug, the pair lightly laughing.\n\nKlobuchar also quipped, “I like Bernie just fine!\"\n\nThe two Senators then joked about whether it was the \"Sanders-Klobuchar\" amendment or \"Klobuchar-Sanders\" on a bill they worked on together\n\n--Savannah Behrmann\n\nButtigieg avoids attacking Biden in moment of unity\n\nPete Buttigieg passed up a chance to attack Joe Biden over the issue of impeachment and the fact that Republicans are continuing to delve into Biden and his son’s activities in Ukraine. Buttigieg was asked if it’s risky for Democrats to nominate someone under investigation.\n\n“No,” he said. “And we won’t let them change the subject.”\n\nButtigieg said he and Biden are competitors but “we’ve got to draw a line here.” Republicans’ efforts to turn a father against a son, he said, is the kind of dishonorable behavior that shows why Democrats need to win in November.\n\nBiden thanked Buttigieg and agreed that Republicans are trying to create a diversion.\n\nHe brought up Trump’s firing today of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine policy officer on the National Security Counsel. The nation should give Vindman a medal, Biden said, not Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk show host honored by Trump at Tuesday’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden encouraged the audience to stand up and clap for Vindman. That’s who we are, Biden said, and it’s not what Trump is.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nSteyer questions Buttigieg's ability to go ‘toe-to-toe’ with Trump\n\nBusinessman Tom Steyer, who is polling near the bottom of the field, took on Pete Buttigieg, who is surging following his strong showing in Iowa.\n\n“The issue here … is not about who has the best health care plan. All the health care plans are better. A million times better,” Steyer said. “The question is who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump. Who can take down Mr. Trump because he’s the real threat to the country.”\n\n“And let me say you have to have experience to take him down,” Steyer continued, directing his criticism to the 38-year-old, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor. “This is not a question of ‘he’s nice guy who’s going to listen.’ We need people with experience that’s why I’m worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe- to-toe with this guy and take him down or we’re going to lose.”\n\nButtigieg responded he can win based on his military service and his experience running an industrial Midwest city that is “the exact kind of community that (Trump) pretends to speak for but turns is back on.”\n\n“If we want to beat this president we’ve got to be ready to move on form the playbook we’ve relied on in the past,’ Buttigieg said. “And unify this country around a new and better vision.”\n\nSteyer is also running an ad this week in New Hampshire calling Buttigieg an \"untested newcomer.\"\n\n-- Ledyard King\n\nSenators highlight Romney’s 'courage' after impeachment trial\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar dismissed former mayor Pete Buttigieg’s assertion that non-Washington experience is best for “meeting the moment” for the White House, highlighting the experience and “courage” that came from the Senate impeachment trial.\n\n“We had a moment these past few weeks, mayor, and that moment was these impeachment hearings” Klobuchar said. “There was courage that you saw from only a few people.”\n\n“There was courage from Doug Jones, our friend of Alabama, who took that tough vote. There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took a very, very difficult vote [on impeachment],” Klobuchar said, highlighting that Buttigieg said the trials were exhausting to watch.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney was the sole GOP vote for convicting Trump on one count earlier this week, while Sen. Doug Jones was considered a potential swing vote serving in a staunchly red state.\n\nThe other senators on the stage also mentioned Romney’s vote Friday night.\n\nWarren stated that “all-but-one” of her GOP colleagues “locked arms” by voting for acquittal. Sanders declared Republicans knew “Donald Trump is a crook” but didn’t have the “guts, with the exception of Romney, to vote against him.”\n\n--Savannah Behrmann\n\nAndrew Yang says throwing presidents in jail is not an 'American tradition'\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang said that he is not opposed of presidents being investigated, but there should be limits to it and “you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office.”\n\nThe question came after Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked whether investigating President Donald Trump is the best way to unify the country. Warren said she believes that no one is above the law.\n\n“We need to reestablish the rule of law in this country,” Warren said.\n\nYang was asked about his past comments where he said that a leader “throwing a past president before them in jail” is not the way things are done in the United States.\n\n“Does that mean that any alleged conduct by the president or his administration should not be investigated?” said moderator Linsey Davis.\n\nYang said that “countries that have thrown past presidents into jail have generally been developing countries.”\n\n“Unfortunately that’s a pattern that once you establish is very, very hard to break,” he said. “What’s a more American tradition, we move the country forward, we don’t focus on the mistakes of the president leaving office.”\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden, Sanders spar on Medicare for All — again\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden slammed Sen. Bernie Sanders for his signature policy, Medicare for All, saying that the Vermont senator has yet to say how he is going to pay for it.\n\n“Bernie says you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All,” Biden said. “And he says he wrote the damn thing, but he’s unwilling to say what the damn thing is going to cost.”\n\nBiden claims that Sanders has said “we’ll figure it out later” in terms of how much his bill will cost. Biden also doubted that Sanders could get Medicare for All passed, noting that he “busted my neck” to get the Affordable Care Act passed.\n\nSanders, however, said that “if we do what Joe wants,” the United States will spend $50 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\n“We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country,” Sanders said. “Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the health care industry last year made $100 billion dollars in profit.”\n\nSanders said that Medicare for All would same the American people “substantial sums of money.”\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar also piled on, saying Medicare for All does not have widespread support like Sanders has said it does.\n\n“I keep listening to the same debate, and it’s not real,” she said, adding that two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate have yet to sign onto Sanders’ bill.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nThe debate over old vs. new\n\nPete Buttigieg made the case for generational change, arguing for a perspective that will leave behind the “politics of the past” and turn the page.\n\nJoe Biden had a wide grin on his face when Buttigieg said he’s not the right candidate if voters are looking for the person with the most Washington establishment experience. But he is if they want a different perspective.\n\n“The politics of the past were not all that bad,” Biden responded. He mentioned legislation he worked on to ban chemical weapons and fight violence against women. He also touted his early support for same sex marriage.\n\n“I don’t know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden is so bad,” Biden said.\n\nButtigieg countered that the last Democratic administration was successful because it “met the moment.”\n\n“Now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different,” he said.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nSanders: Trump ‘lies all the time’\n\nBernie Sanders was asked if Democrats should fret if he wins the nomination given how President Donald Trump has already gone after the Vermont senator who describes himself as a democratic socialist.\n\n“Those hits are going to keep coming if you’re the nominee,” moderator George Stephanopoulos asked the senator. “Why shouldn’t Democrats be worried?”\n\n“Because Donald Trump lies all the time,” Sanders retorted. “He will say terrible things about Joe (Biden). He has (said) ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth (Warren).”\n\n“At the end of the day … everybody up here is united,” Sanders continued. “No matter who wins this damn thing, we’re all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump.”\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar raised her hand when the candidates were asked who would be afraid of a socialist running as the party’s candidate in November.\n\n\"I think we are not going to be able to out-divide the divider in chief, and I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out” Klobuchar answered, continuing that, \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare is a candidate who will bring people in from the middle.\"\n\n-- Ledyard King and Savannah Behrmann\n\nButtigieg goes after Sanders\n\nPete Buttigieg wasted no time drawing a distinction between himself and Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying Democrats must unite the country, not divide it by saying “if you don’t go all the way to the end, it doesn’t count.”\n\nAre you talking about Sanders? he was asked.\n\n“Yes,” Buttigieg replied.\n\nSanders disputed the description.\n\n“Needless to say, I’ve never said that,” he responded.\n\nSanders said the way to bring people together is with an agenda that works for working people, not billionaires.\n\nBefore the debate, Sanders had accused Buttigieg of being beholden to wealthy donors.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden says he probably won’t win New Hampshire\n\nIn the opening minute of the debate, former Vice President Joe Biden – already stinging from a poor showing in Iowa – acknowledged he also probably won’t do well in New Hampshire Tuesday.\n\n“I’ll probably take a hit here,” Biden said.\n\nHe pointed to the fact that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire in 2016 and represents a neighboring state.\n\nBiden said he considers not just Iowa and New Hampshire, but also Nevada and South Carolina, to be the “starting point” for the nominating contest. Biden is counting on his strong support from African American voters to do well in subsequent states.\n\nThe question that prompted his response was why he has criticized Sanders and Pete Buttigieg as too risky to be the nominee when they won Iowa.\n\nBiden said that Sanders’ label of Democratic Socialist would hurt other Democrats lower on the ballot. And Buttigieg, Biden said, is a great guy and a patriot but is the former mayor of a small city who hasn’t shown he can attract a “broad spectrum of support.”\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nWill verbal punches be thrown?\n\nAnd now for the recurring question before each debate: Who will throw the most punches and which candidate will be the biggest target?\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden was perceived as the frontrunner as the debates began last year, California Sen. Kamala Harris went after his record on busing. In the long run, the attack didn’t help Harris, who dropped out in December. And Biden’s poor showing in Iowa means he may go after the top Iowa finishers.\n\nBiden did that Wednesday in New Hampshire when he suggested both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg were risky choices. Biden said Sanders’ identification as a Democratic Socialist would make it harder for Democrats farther down on the ballot to win. Buttigieg is a dicey choice, Biden said, because he’s never held an office higher than mayor of a small city.\n\nFriday, Sanders accused Buttigieg of being beholden to rich donors.\n\n\"I like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy,\" Sanders said at an event in New Hampshire. \"But we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.\"\n\nHis campaign started promoting #PetesBillionaires on Twitter.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nKey milestone:A New Hampshire primary win is key for multiple Democrats. Here's what we know\n\nVeterans courting veterans\n\nU.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who did not qualify for tonight’s debate stage, is trying to get the attention of viewers in another way.\n\nGabbard launched an ad Friday morning promising to bring “a soldier’s values” to the White House: dignity, honor, respect and service.\n\nIn her underdog campaign, Gabbard has been focusing most of her attention on New Hampshire. The state has a disproportionate share of veterans, which could help the Army veteran. But she’s not the only candidate with military experience.\n\nVoteVets, the political action committee that backs liberal veterans running for office, has run ads in New Hampshire supporting Pete Buttigieg, a former Navy officer.\n\nOn Thursday, Buttigieg held a “conversation with New Hampshire veterans” at an American Legion Post in Merrimack.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nCandidates show force in walk up to event space\n\nAndrew Yang may be trailing distantly in the polls, but his campaign did turn out the most young enthusiasts on the two-lane road leading to Saint Anselm College, waving signs and encouraging drivers in passing cars to honk their support. No. 2 in the highway straw poll were Elizabeth Warren supporters, chanting “L! I! Z!” The presence required a certain amount of commitment, given the freezing rain that was falling. (It is New Hampshire, after all, and in February.)\n\nThe media filing center, set up in a gym, was set up with work spaces for 414 journalists, plus a dozen TV crews lined up along one wall.\n\n-- Susan Page\n\nNew Hampshire voters are independent in more ways than one\n\nDemocrats may not be the only New Hampshire voters paying close attention to tonight’s debate. The state allows independents – voters not registered as Democrats or Republicans – to participate in Tuesday’s primary. And “unaffilated” voters make up the biggest chunk of the electorate.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won independents in his 2016 primary race against Hillary Clinton. But more moderate candidates -- like former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar – are targeting disaffected Republicans who’ve become independents. And outsider candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and entrepreneur Andrew Yang could also grab some of the independent vote away from Sanders this time.\n\nNew Hampshire is independent in another way as well. The state has a reputation for going its own way by delivering surprises to the frontrunner. It famously made Bill Clinton the “Comeback Kid” when he finished second place during a turbulent stretch of his 1992 campaign. And just when it looked like Barack Obama had a straight shot to the nomination with his 2008 win in Iowa, New Hampshire Democrats gave the victory to Hillary Clinton instead.\n\nWhen Clinton was the frontrunner for the 2016 nomination, however, New Hampshire voters flocked to Sanders.\n\nThe latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk poll released Thursday shows Sanders at 24% with Buttigieg close behind at 23%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the choice of 13% and Biden was picked by 11%. No other candidate was in double digits.\n\nIn an NBC News/Marist poll released hours before the debate, Sanders led with 25%, Buttigieg got 21%, Warren had 14% and Biden was at 13%.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nWho will be on stage and what's at stake\n\nWith the chaos of the Iowa caucuses (mostly) in the rear-view mirror, the top candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination appear on stage tonight for a debate in New Hampshire four days before the Granite State holds the first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday.\n\nNew Hampshire could be the moment where Iowa's top finishers – former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – separate themselves from the pack. Or where Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden regain their footing after third and fourth places finishes in Iowa, respectively.\n\nIt could also mark the end of the line for Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang. Klobuchar out-performed her polling in Iowa but still walked away with only 1 national delegate. Yang left Iowa with 0.\n\nThe candidates' order on stage was determined not by the Iowa results but by averaging the results of polls taken nationally and in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThat put Biden in the center, flanked by Sanders and Warren. They're sharing the stage with Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Yang and businessman Tom Steyer.\n\nYang, who was absent from the Iowa debate last month, met the qualifications for New Hampshire which included polling and donor thresholds.\n\nMore:In New Hampshire primary, could Pete Buttigieg end Joe Biden’s 50-year political career?\n\nModerators include George Stephanopoulos, \"World News Tonight\" Anchor, ABC Managing Editor David Muir and ABC News Live Anchor Linsey Davis.

There are all kinds of barriers she wants “to take on.” She also cites the need to stand up for unions and “working people” who are being “attacked by ideologues.”\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\nThe final question is trivia.\n\nThe two are asked to name two leaders who would influence their foreign policy.\n\nSanders cites Franklin Delano Roosevelt but seems to focus on domestic economic issues. He cites Roosevelt’s famous “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” a “profound statement” that gave the American people the courage to get out of the Great Depression. He cites public health care and free college education. Then he cites Winston Churchill who, as a wartime leader, rallied the British people when they stood “virtually alone” in opposing the Nazis.\n\nClinton chooses Nelson Mandela for his “generosity of heart” She then quickly pivots to citing Sanders’ criticism of Obama, including a recent endorsement of a book critical of him. “I just couldn’t agree more with those kinds of comments,” she said. “I understand what President Obama inherited … .I don’t think he gets the credit he deserves.”\n\nSanders takes offense: “That is a low blow,” says Sanders, who says he’s worked with Obama for seven years. The blurb endorsing the book said the next president has “to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process,” says Sanders. Clinton claims that Sanders called Obama “weak” and tried to support a primary opponent.\n\nSanders: “One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate.”\n\n10:38 p.m.\n\nThe two discuss Syria refugees.\n\nSanders talks about going to a Turkish refugee camp on the border of Syria. “I very strongly disagree” with Republicans who think we should “turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing.” Yet Arab nations have a responsibility as well. “The entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis.”\n\n10:33 p.m.\n\nThe two discuss their strategies for dealing with Putin.\n\nMuch of what he’s doing with aggression on the border with Ukraine and in Syria is because his country is suffering economically and he wants to distract attention, says Sanders.\n\nClinton focuses on Syria, saying she fears the Russians will continue their bombing and continue trying to take out U.S.-backed rebels instead of ISIL.\n\nClinton and Sanders disagree on a no-fly zone in Syria. They also clash over how to deal with Iran, with Clinton taking a harsher tone about all of the work that still needs to be done to change the behavior of the state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n10:28 p.m.\n\nThe two mix it up over former secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who’s praised Clinton.\n\nSanders calls him one of the “most destructive” secretaries of State in history. “Henry Kissinger is not my friend” and Sanders says he will not take his advice.\n\nClinton counterpunches that she takes advice from a broad array of voices and is still waiting to hear who Sanders does take foreign policy advice from.\n\nBernie Sanders really doesn't like Henry Kissinger\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nForeign policy, Clinton’s strong area, is the topic.\n\nIs the U.S. ready for the next terrorist attack?\n\nClinton gives a brief summary of her plan both at home and abroad before pivoting to the relationship with Muslims. “American Muslims are on the frontline of our defense,” she says. “They need to feel not just invited but welcomed” in American society. She mentions Donald Trump’s “demagoguery” about Muslims. “It’s not only offensive, it’s dangerous,” she says.\n\nSanders pivots to his vote opposing the war in Iraq, mentioning that much of what he feared would happen after the war, did happen.\n\nThen he makes his first really direct attack on Clinton on the decision to invade Libya.\n\n“A political vacuum developed,” and ISIL came in, she said.\n\nSanders again makes his point about judgment. As president, he would avoid “unintended consequences” and “perpetual warfare” in the Middle East.\n\n10:14 p.m.\n\nAre there any areas where government can be reduced?\n\nSanders: “I believe in efficient government, not in wasteful government.”\n\nClinton says she also wants efficient programs and mentions some training and other programs that can be streamlined.\n\nSanders mentions Department of Defense programs. It is the one federal agency that can’t be audited and there are a lot of duplicative programs.\n\n10 p.m.\n\nClinton and Sanders face off on Wall Street contributions and super PACS.\n\nClinton tries to distance herself from her super PAC, saying it was set up to support Obama and has now decided to support her but they do not coordinate. “It’s not my PAC,” she said.\n\nSanders says the super PAC got $15 million from Wall Street in the last quarter while his average contribution is $27 and that he’s proud of that.\n\nClinton invokes Obama. She says he was the largest recipient of Wall Street donations of any Democrat ever to run for president. “When it mattered, he stood up to Wall Street,” pushing through the toughest regulations since the 1930s. It’s not fair to imply she would not take on any vested interest, she says.\n\nSanders, visibly agitated: “Let’s not insult the intelligence of the American people, people aren’t dumb,” he says. Wall Street doesn’t make huge contributions “just for the fun of it,” says Sanders.\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nThe issue is Social Security.\n\nSanders says he differs with Clinton over lifting the cap on Social Security payroll taxes above $250,000 a year. Elderly people are cutting their pills in half, can’t heat their homes or pay their bills, says Sanders.\n\nClinton says we do need more revenue in the Social Security trust fund, including targeting “passive income” of the wealthy.\n\nShe also wants to prioritize changing payout formulas. Women don’t get any credit for their caretaking responsibilities and widows can lose up to one half of their income when their spouses die. “I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk,” she says.\n\nYet Clinton doesn’t appear to agree with Sanders on the $250,000 threshold.\n\n9:47 p.m.\n\nImmigration is the issue, and Clinton and Sanders mix it up on Central American children deportations.\n\nFamilies should not fear further deportations if he becomes president, says Sanders, citing meetings with tearful children.\n\nSanders takes the opportunity to try to draw a distinction on the issue of children lining up on the border, arriving from violent countries including Guatemala and El Salvador. “That was not, as I understand it,” her position, he says. He also says he opposed guest worker legislation in Congress because it was essentially exploiting the workers by requiring them to work for less than a living wage.\n\nClinton defends her position on the Central American children: “We had to send a message” to the parents of the children “not to send their children on this dangerous journey” and into the hands of “dangerous smugglers,” she said. Clinton claims the children were “being abused.”\n\nSanders counterpunches: “These are children leaving countries and neighborhood where their lives are at stake … I don’t think we use them to send a message.”\n\n9:38 p.m.\n\nThe African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse, says Sanders. When “you have unbelievable rates of incarceration,” which leaves children without their parents, “clearly we are looking at institutional racism” and an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, he says. Race relations would be better under a Sanders presidency, he says, because he’d create millions of jobs for low-income kids “so they’re not hanging out on street corners.”\n\nClinton is asked whether some white American have a right to feel resentful. She handles it by saying she would target all “distressed” communities, including those in coal-mining towns, regardless of whether they are black or white. “If you look at the numbers there are actually as many if not more white” areas that are being left out or left behind, says Clinton. “It would be a terrible oversight” not to address those problems as well, she said.\n\n9:32 p.m.\n\nCriminal justice reform is the issue.\n\nSentencing for blacks is higher than for whites, says Sanders. “We are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African Americans shot by police officers … any police officer who breaks the law will in fact be held accountable,” said Sanders.\n\nClinton says the first speech she gave in the campaign, in April, was about criminal justice reform, subtly trying to suggest she’s been talking about the issue the longest. “We have to go after sentencing,” she said, because a lot of issues happen at the state level. She also cites “systemic racism” in education and employment, factors that push young men out of school early and deny them employment opportunities. She draws loud applause.\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nClinton is pressed on her poor showing among women in the New Hampshire primary.\n\n“I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support, I just hope by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me,” she said.\n\nShe’s also asked about former secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s comments about there being a “special place in hell” for women who don’t support each other. “She’s been saying that for as long as I’ve known her,” said Clinton.\n\nClinton seeks the counterpunch by saying women’s issues are at the center of her campaign. On equal pay, paid family leave and other issues important to women, “we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that is at the core of my campaign,” she says.\n\nSanders hits on the same issues and is asked if he’s worried about thwarting who could become the first female president. “A Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well,” he said, citing his views on Wall Street and other issues.\n\n“I’m not asking people to support me because I’m a woman,” said Clinton. She said she’s running on her record and cites her endorsement from groups like Planned Parenthood.\n\n“We need a leader on women’s issues,” says Clinton, not just someone who “votes right.”\n\n9:20 p.m.\n\nSanders points to a couple of measures to fund his proposals.\n\nHe says he would do away with tax advantages for companies that stash their profits overseas and impose a Wall Street speculation tax to make public colleges and universities free. “We bailed them out, now it is their turn to help the middle class,” he said.\n\nClinton claims that Sanders’ plan is dependent on U.S. governors, like Republican Scott Walker, to immediately cough up $23 billion. “I’m a little skeptical of your governor … to make any commitment like that,” said Clinton.\n\n9:13 p.m.\n\nQuestion to Sanders: How much bigger a role do you see for the federal government?\n\nThe U.S. should join the rest of the world in going to a single-payer health care system and make public colleges and universities tuition-free, says Sanders. “Of course there will be a little” more control by government, he said. When the middle class is disappearing and childhood poverty is skyrocketing government “has a moral responsibility” to make sure all people have a “decent standard of living.”\n\nClinton then estimates that Sanders’ plans would increase the size of the federal government by 40%, and Sanders, notably, does not dispute this number.\n\nEconomists who’ve analyzed Sanders’ plans say they “don’t add up,” says Clinton. It’s important that “both of us are held to account,” she said. “This is not about math, this is about people’s lives,” she said, and “we should level with the American people,” she said.\n\nShe also claims many people will be “worse off than they were before.”\n\nSanders punches back by saying that Clinton is misrepresenting his plan by saying it would dismantle Obamacare. Sanders says the U.S. is the only major country that doesn’t guarantee health care and spends far more than those countries. He says it’s a matter of “having the courage” to take on the pharmaceutical industry and medical lobbies.\n\nThe last thing we need to do is throw our country into a contentious debate about health care,” said Clinton, who also accuses Sanders of making promises “we can’t keep.”\n\nClinton on health care: 'We are not England. We are not France'\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nThe debate begins with opening statements.\n\nSanders goes first, and he begins by hitting his core campaign message. “TheAmerican people have responded to a series of truths,” including a “corrupt” campaign finance system that allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the election, he said. He then hits the second pillar of his platform: a “rigged economy” funneling most of the income to the wealthiest 1%. “What our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics,” he said.\n\n“We need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy contributors,” he said.\n\nClinton said she wants to knock “down all the barriers” holding people back. “I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy and for good cause,” she said. Wages are stagnant and young people can’t find jobs. “We both agree we have to get unaccountable money out of politics,” she said, and make sure Wall Street can’t hurt Main Street. “I want to go further,” she said, to address discrimination in the job market and housing system, as well as hurdles that women face, she said.\n\nMore coverage of Clinton and Sanders:\n\nSanders supporters say superdelegates should back will of voters\n\nCongressional Black Caucus PAC endorses Hillary Clinton before South Carolina primary\n\nRep.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}]}

Mike DeWine said in a news release. “These tests – and Ohio’s amazing network of public libraries – make it easier than ever for Ohioans to get tested and to ensure that we are limiting the spread of the delta variant.”\n\nThe Abbott BinaxNOW Home Test is packaged with a telehealth session to oversee test administration and result reporting.

Automobile code readers are available to diagnose problems and jump starters for dead batteries. Light-therapy is available for checkout during those long, dark winter days.\n\nAnd the three-branch system soon will loan picnic blankets to accompany those attending outdoor story times, mostly for its Northwest branch. A full list of its offerings is found here.\n\nRecreational items\n\nGrandview Heights Public Library has 27 nontraditional items available for checkout. Among the more unusual are: guitars and ukuleles for those 18 and older, binoculars, driver-training cones and runestones and tarot cards for divination.\n\nIf cultural activities such as the zoo or museums interest you but admission or membership is a deterrent, Columbus Metropolitan Libraries continues its Culture Pass program, which allows patrons to use their library card to get passes to a variety of local institutions.\n\nThese include the Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, Franklin Park Conservatory, National Veterans Memorial and Museum and Ohio History Center.\n\nAnd if you want a nice piece of art for your home — but not forever — Westerville has hundreds of pieces of visual art that it lends to patrons for 28 days at a time.\n\nSouthwest Public Libraries, which serves the Grove City Area, loans out bike cable locks at its Westland Area Library branch. It is planning for other items in the near future.\n\nEducation and health items for every age\n\nSouthwest and the Delaware County District Library have a trove of assistance for those dealing with dementia or memory loss issues. Delaware loans its Memory Care Collection. Items include: conversation and reminisce cards, dexterity and painting activities and coloring books. Southwest has similar activity boxes that include fidget toys for different levels of memory loss.\n\nAnd for students, Delaware County's four-branch library system also has STEAM kits with projects for those interested in science, technology, arts, engineering or math.\n\nUpper Arlington Public Library also has resources for kids. Called Discovery Kits, the boxes include books, games and toys and have themes such as telling time, money, and dinosaurs.\n\nThe library's \"healing kits\" have items to help kids and adults work through difficult situations such as Alzheimer’s disease, the death of a loved one and COVID-19, said Christine Minx, library spokesperson.\n\nComputers and WiFi access\n\nAnd almost all libraries loan WiFi hotspots, devices that use satellite signals to connect up to 10 wireless device to high-speed internet. Most can be checked out for up to 14 days, ample time to complete a school assignment or watch the latest streaming movies. Many also check out Chromebooks or laptops, also for up to two weeks.\n\nSo is all this stuff really free?\n\nWell, not really. Everyone who pays property tax levies is paying for it. Columbus's library district mirrors the school district, and property owners pay more than $80 per year for every $100,000 of property value.\n\nBexley, Delaware, Grandview Heights, Grove City (Southwest Public), Upper Arlington, Westerville and Worthington each have their own levies, as do more than 200 others statewide.\n\nBut in Ohio, the state also supports public libraries. And anyone can join any public library anywhere in the state.

Why would anybody want to borrow a dusty old book when they can access the world's literature in e-book form with the touch of a button?\n\nIn the first few months after opening its doors, the new Irondequoit Public Library saw a 34 percent increase in visitors. The same thing happened in Gates, as that town's new library drew large crowds.\n\nA detailed study by the Pew Research Center found that this local pattern reflects a national trend: Libraries continue to be an incredibly popular resource, especially among millennials.\n\nPart of the reason is that libraries have undergone significant changes in the last 20 years, and they're no longer just a place to visit to borrow a book.\n\nHere are six other things you can do at your local libraries.\n\nMake something\n\nMost libraries have computers that patrons can use, but those aren't the only kinds of tools that are available. The Greece library is one of several in Monroe County that has a 3-D printer available to the public. Folks can come in with their ready-made projects or take a class in 3-D modeling and walk away with their first finished project.\n\nIrondequoit's library has a Maker's Lab, which offers soldering irons, Dremel tools, sewing machines and other implements for people who want to make things with their own hands.\n\nAnd in Webster, you can even get the ingredients to start a garden from the seed library. Each option is labeled by level of difficulty, and the seed packets are arranged alphabetically in the drawers of the old wooden card catalog.\n\nLearn something\n\nThe Pew Research study found that a majority of library patrons feel they are \"lifelong learners,\" and that many people say they learn more in a group setting than at home on the Internet.\n\nWhen librarians in Gates noticed that cooking books were becoming very popular, they started offering cooking classes. In December, the Brighton library offered a Star Wars-themed computer programming class for kids. East Rochester has a regular session for teens interested in electronics and robotics. The Fairport library, like many others, has a wide range of computer classes, from introductory subjects to more in-depth topics.\n\nMany of these classes are free, although they may require you to register in advance. Most libraries have online calendars with more details about their offerings.\n\nFind experts\n\nThe main job skill for librarians isn't putting books on a shelf, it's knowing how to find information. Many libraries have staff with expertise in specific subjects who are available to answer questions or point people toward other resources.\n\nA great example is the Chester Carlson Patent & Trademark Center at the Central Library downtown. It's staffed by experts in intellectual property issues who can help inventors and entrepreneurs navigate the legal steps they can take to protect their big idea.\n\nMany local libraries have career centers that can offer help with polishing up your résumé or searching for a job. Some have staff who are experts at helping veterans get connected with services and opportunities that are available and connecting them with outreach centers.\n\nAn increasingly popular service, now available at many sites, is one-on-one computer assistance. They can't help repair your hardware, but they can help you figure out how to set up an email account or how to download e-books onto that new tablet you got for Christmas.\n\nTap into online resources\n\nLibrary patrons in Monroe County can access a number of online resources, including subscription-based websites and commercial databases. Many of these services can only be used within the library, but some can be accessed remotely, using your library card to gain access from your own computer.\n\nNearly a dozen libraries in the county host a local history section, which include searchable digital versions of high school yearbooks, phone directories, old newspapers and even local photo collections.\n\nGenealogy buffs can get access to resources such as Ancestry.com and Heritage Quest. City residents can access foreign language classes through Rosetta Stone. Other online offerings include a variety of online newspapers, specialized business databases and an array of online encyclopediae.\n\nAnd anyone with a library card can get access to e-books and download them to their own devices. Most e-readers have built in support for the service, called OverDrive, or you can download an app to your smartphone or tablet. A similar service, called Hoopla Digital, offers other downloadable media to library patrons, including audiobooks, music and movies.\n\nBorrow other physical media\n\nIf books aren't your thing, there are plenty of other ways to consume content. Most libraries have large collections of music CDs, audiobooks and movies and television shows in DVD or BluRay format.\n\nMany libraries also have video games for a variety of platforms.\n\nAnd at the Central Library, you can even borrow works of art to take home and hang on your wall. The collection includes framed prints and other pieces, from classics such as Van Gogh’s Starry Night to more modern pieces by local artists.\n\nOther items you can borrow from a Rochester library: GPS units, ukuleles, board games and fishing poles.\n\nMeet people\n\nIn some Monroe County towns, libraries are located as part of a larger community center. In other locales, the libraries serve as a de facto community center, a place where residents can get together.\n\nMost of the libraries in Monroe County offer a variety of public spaces, from quiet study rooms to large meeting halls than can be used for formal gatherings.\n\nMany of the newer libraries have created teen areas, a place where teens can play video games, watch the latest anime, or just hang out.\n\nLibraries have always been a gathering place, from students collaborating on a project after school to parents and children sitting and reading together. Technology hasn't changed the need for personal connections and public spaces. In some ways, it's made libraries even more important in the digital age.\n\nSLAHMAN@Gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/01/05/5-ways-visit-met-without-breaking-bank/1007863001/", "title": "Cheap ways to visit the Met", "text": "The announcement this week that the Metropolitan Museum of Art is suspending its \"pay-what-you-can\" admission for out-of-staters, starting March 1, would seem to paint a less-than-rosy picture for New Jerseyans.\n\n\"It's unfair, it's really arbitrary,\" says Deborah Frizzell, professor of art history at William Paterson University.\n\nUnder the new policy, visitors from nearby New Jersey or Connecticut — unless they're 12 years old or younger, or have a student ID — must pay the full $25 admission price, while someone from Buffalo, seven hours from Manhattan, could pay as little as $1.\n\nNew policy:Met Museum will start charging mandatory $25 fee\n\nThings to do:William Campbell landscapes of Passaic on display at Lambert Castle\n\nThe Met says it needs to change its admission rules to help ease a $10 million deficit. But critics say that it will skew museum attendance toward the well-off, while leaving the Garden State's less fortunate (including many artists, who are typically not well-heeled) to scramble.\n\nPerhaps. But there are workarounds, alternatives, deals to take advantage of. (Though a Met spokesman said the museum, unlike many other cultural institutions, doesn't make passes available to local public libraries to lend to their members.)\n\nIf you're heavily into art but light in the wallet, here are some possible ways to visit the Met without breaking your bank.\n\n1. Go before March 1.\n\nWhy not? You still have nearly two months to enjoy the 2 million artworks and artifacts in the Met's three museums (the Fifth Avenue flagship, the Cloisters and the Met Breuer museum on Madison Avenue) at whatever price you name.\n\n2. Get to know a Museum member.\n\nThey can bring a guest. Or more than one, depending on their membership level.\n\n3. Plan your visit more carefully.\n\nThe new admissions scheme for out-of-staters is not good news for a casual visitor: the kind of person who plunks down $10, in between appointments, for an hour with Vermeer and Rembrandt. But to ease the sting, the Met has made its $25 admission good for three consecutive days at its three locations. If you plan a long weekend of museum-going, you'll get more than your $25 worth.\n\n4. Be a student.\n\nIf you, as a Jersey resident, are a student with a valid I.D.— whether from an in-state or out-of-state institution doesn't matter — the old pay-as-you-like policy still applies.\n\n5. Be a member.\n\nThis is what the Met really wants you to do — but is it really such a bad idea? For many, it might ultimately be the most economical way to go. For $100, you get unlimited admission for a year. Just four visits over a calendar year — or two each for a member and a guest — gets you to the $25-per-visit threshold. Anything beyond that effectively gets you a discount.\n\n6. Use a 'reciprocal membership.'\n\nThe Met has a reciprocal arrangement with 16 other major museums, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (not, alas, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, or the Guggenheim). If you're a member of any of these other museums, at a $600 level, you also get free admission to the Met, and vice-versa.\n\n7. Get a New York library card.\n\nIf you work in New York City, and have a New York library card, the Met considers you a de facto resident, and you're eligible for \"pay-as-you-wish.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2015/10/28/did-you-know-squirrels-plant-trees/74758006/", "title": "Did You Know that squirrels plant trees?", "text": "Dave Henderson\n\nCorrespondent\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I do not know all of the answers portrayed in the occasional “Did You Know?” column in this space. In fact, most of the information is stuff I didn’t know and, when I ran across it, figured that you didn’t either.\n\nFor instance, Did You Know that the majority of oak, hickory and other mast trees in our woods are planted by squirrels?\n\nYup, the little buggers bury far more than they can eat as a hedge against a harsh winter. You also can figure that every year, some unfortunate individuals, after burying thousands of acorns, get caught by a hawk, run over by a car or meet some other unfortunate demise, thereby generating a hundreds of oak seedlings instead of feeding one little rodent for the winter.\n\nAlso, Did You Know that the state has developed a fishing rod lending program at local libraries in an attempt to reduce barriers to fishing participation? The program allows library patrons to “sign out” a fishing rod, much like they would a book. Extra bobbers, hooks and informational materials are also provided with each loan. For a complete list of participating locations visit DEC’s website: dec.ny.gov/outdoor/98019.html.\n\nDid You Know that in Pennsylvania, residents may claim the carcass of a road-killed deer by contacting a Game Commission regional office within 24 hours for a free permit? If the motorist who hit the deer does not want it, another Pennsylvania resident may claim it. And I’ll bet you didn’t know that antlers from a road-killed deer must be turned over to the Game Commission, or may be purchased by the resident who claims the deer for $10 per point. Otherwise, removing antlers from a road-killed deer is illegal.\n\nDid You Know that New York fishing licenses, which are now good for 365 days from the date of purchase, are available online and can be printed at home for immediate use? Anglers also can purchase their license by calling (866) 933-2257, or from the numerous license issuing agents across the state. Those purchasing by phone will receive a confirmation number that can be used as proof of purchase until they receive their actual license by mail. Additional information can be found at the state License Center website: licensecenter.ny.gov/sporting-and-recreational-licenses.\n\nDid You Know that a wild mammal out wandering during the day that looks disoriented and/or shows no fear of humans may be rabid — or it may have distemper — which is not as dangerous? Animals with distemper will seldom be aggressive, while rabid animals usually are. They are particularly aggressive in the latter stages of infection, when the animal is nearly blind and reacts with furious aggression to any sound or movement. At this same time, the rabies virus has reached the salivary glands, allowing the virus to be transferred by deep tissue injection via teeth. I’ve been told that some mammals, like opossums, have a body temperature too low to incubate the rabies virus — although I am reasonably sure that a rabid opossum killed the tenant’s cat a few years ago.\n\nDid You Know that Gov. Andrew Cuomo has used the “message of necessity” — a tool provided in New York’s constitution that allows him to waive the required three-day period that a bill is supposed to “age” on lawmakers’ desks — to pass controversial legislation on gay marriage and gun control (SAFE Act)? Messages of necessity were intended for extraordinary circumstances when time is of the essence, not to squelch analysis and debate. Yet governor after governor has used it to ram things through, from state budgets to drug law reform, yet it has been verified by the state court of appeals.\n\nCayuga trap heads to final week\n\nUrb Wormer’s modest 48 wasn’t even the high score on his Groton team last week at the Tompkins County Fish & Game Club, but it was sufficient to vault him into the individual scoring lead heading into the final week of the Cayuga Lake Trap League.\n\nFor the second straight week, not one of the 114 shooters managed to break all 50 birds. Dave Erickson’s 49 edged out Wormer for high score on the Groton team and tied him high weekly honors with Newfield’s Bill Wallis.\n\nWormer’s six-week total of 241 stands one bird better than Dryden’s Dan Card, who broke a season-low 45, and Groton’s Bob Hutchings.\n\nCard holds a two-bird lead over defending champion Gerry Ostrander, of Groton, in the Veterans (65 and older) standings heading into the final week of competition at Lansing. Dryden’s Pat Card stands eight birds head of the field in the Ladies’ division, and C.J. Smiley, of Dryden, coasts into the final week with a 30-bird advantage among the Juniors.\n\nGroton, which has won the team title nine times in the past 10 years, is 13 birds ahead of Dryden in that race.\n\nWrite to Dave Henderson at Henderson Outdoors (www.HendersonOutdoors.com), 202 Prospect St., Endicott NY 13760 or via e-mail at ddhender@aol.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/04/23/guam-libraries-strive-keep-services-available/100394436/", "title": "Guam libraries strive to keep services available | Local News ...", "text": "John I Borja\n\njborja@guampdn.com\n\nWhen his children are out on school breaks, Christian Ong takes them to the Nieves M. Flores Memorial Public Library in Hagåtña.\n\n“It’s a way to get them to continue reading and to help bring up the skill,” Ong said. The Chalan Pago resident has a rule for his two kids: every hour they spend on an electronic device, they must spend the same amount of time reading.\n\nThe last time he visited the library was last summer, a few months after it was renovated. The library was closed for maintenance and expansion for about six months. It reopened in March 2016.\n\nOng, who also visited the library before its renovation, said the library still looks just about the same, though he noticed there’s no longer an air conditioning issue. He said he was content with the resources the library has to educate his children.\n\nThe Guam Public Library System does its best to continue providing the resources and services to library patrons like Ong and his children, according to program coordinator Frankie S. Aflague.\n\n“Today’s technology, everyone has their own phones. But what happens when that goes down?” Aflague said. It’s a unique experience to open up a book, flip through the pages and explore the stories they hold.\n\n(Story continues below.)\n\nModernization\n\nThe library doesn’t only offer books, Aflague said. In fact, a lot of the people who come into the library use the computers with free internet access. Not everyone on the island has that privilege in the household, so they come into the library to check their email, fill out an application or read the news online.\n\nWith the high interest of internet usage, Aflague said the library is planning to add an internet cafe to its facility. When the café will be included is dependent on the funding available, he said.\n\nThe program coordinator said the libraries try to be up-to-date with its resources. Aflague receives two to three large orders of books each year, depending on when funds are available.\n\nThe library system has considered the possibility of an e-book library, but Aflague said he wants to make sure the other services aren’t lacking. He also would need to research modules for lending e-books to patrons.\n\nEdihna Cruz has been a frequent visitor of the Hagåtña library since she was eight years old. Now at 17, she said the resources are good enough for her to keep up with homework. She is home schooled, and she uses the library for research. The internet service is decent, and she’s satisfied with the collection of books offered at the library.\n\n“The people are friendly, and I learn a lot from them,” she said.\n\nTight budget\n\nAflague said he works with a tight budget, just like any other government of Guam agency. While the renovation expanded the library to include a children’s library and a new administrative unit, the Guam Public Library System had to cut other services like the Library on Wheels, also known as the “Bookmobile.”\n\nThe Bookmobile would go around the island from Monday through Friday with a selection of books at residents’ convenience. The service ended after fiscal 2014 due to mechanical issues with the bus. Aflague said it wasn’t cost-effective to keep repairing an old bus that kept breaking down.\n\nThe library system also is short-staffed, he said. The other five library branches — in Agat, Barrigada, Dededo, Merizo and Yona — are only open one day out of the week and each have one library technician. Each of the libraries get the same supplies and materials, but the Hagåtña library usually receives more in quantity, Aflague said.\n\n(Story continues below.)\n\nCindy Ignacio is the sole library technician at the Barrigada library, which is much smaller than the Hagåtña library. On Thursdays, she sees about 80 visitors, mainly students, come in to do their homework or browse the internet. When the library is closed, she works at the Hagåtña library, just like the technicians at the other branches.\n\nIgnacio said the Agat and Dededo branches are similar in size to Barrigada's, but the Merizo and Yona branches have their own libraries for children.\n\nThe library receives assistance from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The institute does a great deal in terms of getting supplies, Aflague said.\n\nAflague said the library system isn’t in any debt. To prevent debt, the library system functions within its budget, he said.\n\n(Story continues below.)\n\nVisitor data\n\nAccording to data from the library system, a total of 63,224 people have registered for a library card from 2012 to March of this year. A majority of those registrations were done at the Hagåtña library while 14,182 people registered at the other five branches.\n\nFrom March 2016 to March 2017, the Hagåtña library recorded 73,604 visitors, with 1,245 of them registering for a library card.\n\nOf that total visitor amount, 20,365 people visited the children’s library and 551 registered for a library card.\n\n“A library card is a passport to any part of the world,” Aflague said. He encourages parents to come in and get a library card. It has to start at the home for children to take advantage of a free service the libraries offer to the public.\n\nThe children’s library usually sees more than a thousand visitors each month, Aflague said. Tamuning resident Keiko Okubo has been taking her grandson Toby to the library’s toddler program each week for the past two months. She said she likes the program because it not only teaches Toby to be creative, but it also helps him interact with other children.\n\n“The whole point is promoting literacy,” Aflague said. It’s a matter of the parents wanting to take part in effective programs and nurturing their children to be something more, he said.\n\nHours of operation\n\nNieves M.

The plaintiffs also claim their 14th Amendment right to due process was violated because there was no notice posted of the books’ removal nor an opportunity to appeal the decision.\n\nAmong the defendants listed in the case are Llano County Judge Ron Cunningham, Commissioner Jerry Don Moss, Library System Director Amber Milum and members of the library board. Jonathan Mitchell, an attorney who has crafted several pieces of conservative legislation, including the state’s six-week abortion ban, is representing the defendants. Mitchell, Cunningham, Moss and Milum did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWomen account for two-thirds of the country's student loan debt:Here's how it affects them\n\nBans targeted some books with LGBTQ+ or race themes\n\nAccording to the ruling, Cunningham and Moss pushed library officials to remove several books during the summer and fall of 2021, based on complaints from a community group claiming the works contained inappropriate content and promoted “grooming” behavior. The community group submitted additional complaints over the next several months about more books, including ones that touched on LGBTQ+ or race themes.\n\nThe court ruling states that in December 2021 the Llano County Commissioner’s Court dissolved its library board and established a new one, appointing several of the defendants in this lawsuit to the new board, as well as other residents who pushed for book removals.\n\nThe board then implemented a policy requiring all new books to be presented to and approved by the board before being purchased for the library system. In February and March 2022, the board banned staff librarians and the public from attending the board's meetings.\n\nAfter the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in April 2022, Pitman held a hearing on the case in October. In the ruling handed down this week, Pitman writes, “Defendants removed the books at issue to prevent access to viewpoints and content to which they objected,” and that he doubts their reasons for removing the books would “pass constitutional muster.”\n\nPitman’s order marks a significant victory for the plaintiffs, though the Texas Tribune has reported that the defendants are appealing the judge’s ruling.\n\n\"This is a ringing victory for democracy,” Ellen Leonida, the plaintiffs’ attorney, said in a statement. \"The government cannot tell citizens what they can or can’t read.

Only a handful of people have walked away from an execution attempt alive – just two of whom had a second execution date set. Last Tuesday, the state attorney general’s office filed with the Alabama Supreme Court an expedited motion to set an execution date for Miller before another man on death row. The attorney general’s office on Aug. 5 moved the court to schedule James Barber’s execution, but the court has not yet set a date. The court would have to suspend state appellate procedure to set Miller’s execution date ahead of Barber’s, according to the motion. After the U.S. Supreme Court OK’d Miller’s execution by lethal injection shortly after 9 p.m. Sept. 22, Alabama Department of Corrections staff tried to establish intravenous access to administer the lethal injection. Prison staff couldn’t find a suitable vein and called off the procedure 30 minutes before midnight, when the execution warrant expired. Staff poked Miller with needles for more than an hour, the Atlantic reports, before he “was left hanging off the upright gurney, his hands and one foot bleeding from failed IV attempts, waiting to die.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Amid a budget shortage, the city’s public school district is considering closures, Alaska Public Media reports. Across the Anchorage School District, 18 schools are operating at less than 65% capacity after a 5,000-student decline over the past ten years, according to the news outlet. A financial officer suggested perhaps five elementary schools might be dropped.\n\nArizona\n\nAlpine: A $25,000 reward has been offered for the arrest and conviction of perpetrators involved in a wild horse killing in the Apache National Forest, according to Amelia Perrin from the American Wild Horse Campaign. Two nonprofit organizations – the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group and the American Wild Horse Campaign – have pledged $20,000 toward the reward fund. Another advocacy organization, Animal Wellness Action, has pledged an additional $5,000 toward the reward, Perrin said. She said the reward is in response to the discovery of the death of a herd of wild horses in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest by volunteers from the Salt River Wild Horse Management Group. The groups announced the death toll has risen to 15 horses fatally shot, with 20 still missing and presumed dead. “The gunmen who are targeting these horses have inflicted enormous suffering on these innocent animals and caused immense trauma to the people who love them,” said Simone Netherlands, president of the group. The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests confirmed in a statement Friday that a number of horses were found dead near Forest Road 25 on the Alpine and Springerville Ranger Districts. The investigation is still ongoing. “Someone knows something,” Perrin said.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Just because the Arkansas History Commission ruled that the Confederate flag is historic and a part of a past flag display at Riverfront Park does not mean the flag needs to fly there again, a judge has ruled.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Five California tribes will reclaim their right to manage coastal land significant to their history under a first-in-the-nation program backed with $3.6 million in state money. The tribes will rely on their traditional knowledge to protect more than 200 miles of coastline in the state, as climate change and human activity have impacted the vast area. Some of the tribes’ work will include monitoring salmon after the removal of a century-old defunct dam in the redwood forests in the Santa Cruz mountains and testing for toxins in shellfish, while also educating future generations on traditional practices. The partnership comes three years after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom apologized for the state’s previous violence and mistreatment against Indigenous peoples. Newsom said the state should allow for more co-management of tribes’ ancestral lands. Megan Rocha, who’s on the Tribal Marine Stewards Network’s leadership council, said these coastal areas hold cultural significance for various tribes, making the partnership monumental. “It’s focused on tribal sovereignty,” she said. “So how do we build a network where it provides for collaboration, but again, it allows each tribe to do it in the way that they see fit and respects each tribe’s sovereignty.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former National Security Agency employee charged with espionage thought he was sending classified information to Russia when he was talking to an undercover FBI agent, according to court documents released Friday. Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, of Colorado Springs, is accused of six counts of attempting to provide documents and information related to national defense to the Russian Federation, according to his indictment issued Thursday. The information he is accused of providing includes a threat assessment of the military offensive capabilities of a foreign country, not named, along with a description of sensitive U.S. defense capabilities, a portion of which relates to that same foreign country, the indictment said. Dalke is being represented by lawyers from the federal public defender’s office, which does not comment publicly on its cases. The Army veteran allegedly told the undercover agent he had $237,000 in debts and had decided to work with Russia because his heritage “ties back to your country.” Dalke was arrested Sept. 28 after authorities say he arrived at Denver’s downtown train station with a laptop and used a secure connection set up by the undercover agent to transfer some classified documents. But first he sent a thank-you letter in which he said he looked “forward to our friendship and shared benefit.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city is scrapping the idea of building its own high-speed internet network and now plans instead to encourage expansion of existing, largely private broadband services, the New Haven Independent reports. Mayor Justin Elicker and Economic Development Officer Dean Mack told the newspaper in an interview that the decision stemmed from multiple factors, including current providers’ own growth plans and new federal money for improving broadband access. “We want to make sure we’re not spending local tax dollars on something the federal government will already be covering,” he said, and officials also now realize “that there’s market interest in doing what we were thinking of doing ourselves.” The $1 trillion infrastructure deal that President Joe Biden signed last November includes money to expand affordable high-speed internet access. Biden is a Democrat, as is Elicker. New Haven hired a consulting firm in January to explore options for improving internet access, including the possibility of creating a public network. Mack said the city paid the consultants about $40,000, and their work “really helped us out.” The city now plans to tap federal subsidies, woo new broadband providers and encourage current ones to carry out their expansion plans.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Chinese immigrant and chemist who played a role in the 1960s developing noise reduction technology at the DuPont Experimental Station was honored at a recent ceremony. A conference center was named for Theodore “Ted” P. Yin, who worked at the company in the ’60s with his wife, Fay Hoh Yin. DuPont officials recognized their achievements, along with those of all employees of Asian descent who have contributed to DuPont over the years. Ted Yin was a physical chemist at DuPont in the Elastomers Department from 1960 to 1969 and is widely remembered for his role in developing Noise, Vibration and Harshness Reduction. This technology is still used today all around the world and can be found in things like dishwashers in homes, railroad car wheels or engines in cars. Ted died in 1970 at the age of 39, leaving behind his two children, Monona and Duncan, along with his wife and his mother, Florence. Fay was a DuPont biochemist who conducted research on the rhinoviruses from 1966 until her retirement in 1991. She outlived her husband by 50 years and died in 2020. Mobility & Materials President Randy Stone was inspired by the Yin family’s moving story and contributions to DuPont and wanted to do something special to honor them.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new, scathing report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development highlights the filthy and dangerous living conditions in D.C. public housing, WUSA-TV reports. The 72-page document confirms the D.C. Housing Authority has inadequate management, lack of compliance with federal law and poor oversight. Now, D.C. leaders have three months to fix the 82 total violations cited by auditors. Officials must first respond to the report by Nov. 30. D.C. Housing Director Brenda Donald said the agency has received the report and is in the process of putting together responses. WUSA9’s initial investigations into D.C. Housing in May led to immediate action by some local agencies. At Potomac Gardens on Capitol Hill, repairs were made and are still happening. But then WUSA9 started hearing from other people about the conditions in public housing complexes all across the city – buildings the district’s government is responsible for maintaining. According to the audit, D.C. Housing received more than $76 million in federal funds to maintain more than 8,000 units. However, only 76% of their housing stock is occupied – the lowest public housing rate in the country.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: An army of 42,000 utility workers has restored electricity to more than 2.5 million businesses and homes in the state since Hurricane Ian’s onslaught, and Brenda Palmer’s place is among them. By the government’s count, she and her husband Ralph are part of a success story. Yet turning on the lights in a wrecked mobile home that’s likely beyond repair and reeks of dried river mud and mold isn’t much solace to people who lost a lifetime of work in a few hours of wind, rain and rising seawater. Sorting through soggy old photos of her kids in the shaded ruins of her carport, Palmer couldn’t help but cry. “Everybody says, ’You can’t save everything, mom,’ ” she said. “You know, it’s my life. It’s MY life. It’s gone.” While Gov. Ron DeSantis has heaped lavish praise on his administration for the early phases of the recovery, including getting running water and lights back on and erecting a temporary bridge to Pine Island, much more remains to be done. There are still mountains of debris to remove; it’s hard to find a road that isn’t lined with waterlogged carpet, ruined furniture, moldy mattresses and pieces of homes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFort Benning: First lady Jill Biden is scheduled to travel to Fort Benning this week to visit with members of the military and their families, according to the White House. During her visit Thursday and Friday to the army post near Columbus, Georgia, and Phenix City, Alabama, she’s also set to stop by the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Biden, who was second lady at the time, and then-first lady Michelle Obama launched the “Joining Forces” initiative in 2011 to aid members of the military, veterans and their families with employment support, educational resources, and programs for health and wellness. Biden previously flew into Fort Benning in April 2021 with her husband, President Joe Biden, on a trip marking his first 100 days in office, the newspaper reports. She was in Georgia more recently in July to visit a children’s summer program in Athens.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city started taking applications Monday for Oahu restaurants, bars, hotels and clubs that want to offer outdoor dining, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The option became popular at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the latest pilot program looks to expand on that economic boost and offer a way to guard against future outbreaks.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The city has settled a federal discrimination lawsuit with a former library employee who said they were harassed and discriminated against because they are nonbinary and transgender, the Idaho Statesman reports. Jax Perez filed a lawsuit against Boise, the former library director, and other library and city employees in U.S. District Court in Boise last summer. Perez, who uses they/them pronouns, was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. In a news release Friday, the city said the settlement was reached after both parties “evaluated the merits of the case and the resources required for extensive litigation.” “The city’s policies and practice continue to make the equitable treatment of employees a priority,” the statement said. “This settlement is an affirmation of that commitment.” The Statesman said it has asked the city for the settlement amount but has not yet received an answer. The lawsuit stemmed from two separate instances in 2019. On one occasion, the lawsuit said, then-library director Kevin Booe took action to have Perez fired after a library patron objected to a pride display Perez had organized at the library.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Kenyan runners Benson Kipruto and Ruth Chepngetich won the Bank of America Chicago Marathon on Sunday, while Emily Sisson finished second and set a record for an American woman. Kipruto finished in 2:04:24 – 25 seconds ahead of 2021 winner Seifu Tura Abdiwak of Ethiopia. John Korir of Kenya was third at 2:05:01. Chepngetich was the top woman for the second consecutive year, finishing in 2:14:18. Sisson ran the course in 2:18:29, followed by Vivian Jerono Kiplagat of Kenya at 2:20:52. More than 40,000 runners competed in the 26.2-mile event. Marcel Hug of Switzerland won the wheelchair division in 1:25:20. Susannah Scaroni of the U.S. was the top woman in 1:45:48.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Martin University will cut tuition nearly in half and erase up to $10,000 in debt for qualifying students in an effort to make college more affordable and accessible. Leaders of the small private school on the near northeast side of Indianapolis said the initiative, called the Reset to Reemerge Campaign, marked a historic moment for the institution, its students and the city. “We believe that every Hoosier has a right to an affordable college education,” said Sean Huddleston, president of Martin. “But we also know that making a student loan payment, even while enjoying a career, can interrupt one’s ability to achieve their financial goals and fully engage in the economic vitality of our city and state.” Martin has about 225 students currently enrolled. Indiana’s only predominantly Black institution of higher education, it serves a largely nontraditional population of adult learners from low-income households. As such, Huddleston said it has a moral imperative to address the college affordability issue. While it is plaguing institutions, students and families nationwide, Huddleston said the cost of higher education is particularly burdensome for the population Martin serves, but they may also have the most to gain. As many as 300 former students could benefit from the balance erasure, according to university estimates.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Regulators have declined a Winnebago tribal request that Summit Carbon Solutions conduct a state-level environmental impact study of its proposed $4.5billion carbon-capture pipeline across Iowa. The Iowa Utilities Board said Thursday that the Ames company will address its proposed pipeline’s environmental impact in connection with its request for a permit to build the 680-mile project across 29 Iowa counties. The three-member board has not yet set a date for Summit’s permit hearing. “It will be necessary for Summit Carbon to file testimony and exhibits that address the environmental permits and authorizations it needs to construct the proposed pipeline,” the board said in its order. It added that “other parties may file testimony and exhibits in response to the evidence presented by Summit Carbon” and cross-examine the witnesses on environmental issues. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska has a reservation in Dakota County, Nebraska, and Iowa’s Woodbury County, straddling the Missouri River. It requested in June that the Iowa Utilities Board, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the two counties, require Summit – as well as Navigator CO2 Ventures, which also wants to build a carbon capture pipeline – to conduct environmental impact studies. Both would cross or come close to Winnebago tribal land, as well as the Missouri River.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The tops of the twin towers of Assumption Catholic Church that have adorned the landscape of downtown Topeka for at least 90 years will soon come down because of weather-related deterioration. Work is expected to begin this month on the project, according to The Leaven, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. The top one-third of both towers will be removed and capped off, while the bells located in the east tower will be taken elsewhere and stored, the archdiocese said. Assumption was Topeka’s first Catholic parish. The first Assumption Church was built in 1862 and the second in 1882. The current Assumption Church, built in 1923, is part of Mater Dei Catholic Parish, which also includes Holy Name Catholic Church. The tops of Assumption Church’s towers were not part of the original building, having been constructed using slightly lighter-colored bricks between 1928 and 1932, the archdiocese said. It said water damage resulting from free-thaw cycles during the winters caused the towers to crumble. Serious deterioration was found in 2016 during an inspection of the towers, and an engineer recommended last year that the top one-third of each be removed, the archdiocese said. The rest of the church is considered to be in good condition, it said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A statue of King Louis XVI that stood for decades in downtown Louisville before it was damaged during racial justice demonstrations in 2020 may get restored and reappear in the city. But where and when the statue of the French king from whom Louisville gets it name will stand again – if at all – is pas encore connue, or unknown. A public art official told a Metro Council committee Wednesday that it could cost the city more than $200,000 to restore and relocate King Louis XVI. Consultants also have advised Louisville Metro that the statue could be a safety hazard if placed outside, and that also would not be “in the interest of preserving the statue,” according to the presentation. First installed on the west lawn of Metro Hall in 1967, the King Louis XVI statue was moved in 1973 to the northeast corner of West Jefferson and South Sixth streets and was a gift from Montpellier, Louisville’s sister city in southern France. The 9-ton marble statue of the former king, who helped colonists win the Revolutionary War before his public beheading during the French Revolution, was constructed in 1829 and initially placed in Montpellier’s public square, commissioned by the king’s daughter, Maria-Therese. It was removed from the square less than a year later. In 1966, Montpellier offered the statue to Louisville.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two people from a sunken fishing boat were fending off sharks in the Gulf of Mexico when a crew rescued them and one other person from waters off the state’s coastline, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard launched a search after a relative reported the three people failed to return from a fishing trip Saturday evening. The 24-foot, center-console fishing boat sank about 10 a.m. Saturday and stranded the three people without communication devices, the Coast Guard said in a news release. The three were wearing lifejackets, and one was showing signs of hypothermia when they were rescued Sunday about 25 miles offshore from Empire, Louisiana, a small community southeast of New Orleans. The news release said a Coast Guard boat crew saw two of the people fending off sharks, and both of them had injured hands. The crew pulled them from the water, and the two were lifted onto a helicopter. The helicopter crew lifted the third boater from the water. The two injured people were taken to University Medical Center New Orleans, where they were listed as stable. The Coast Guard did not release their names.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state Department of Education is not doing enough to enforce a decades-old law requiring students to be taught about Native American history, leading most schools to fall short, according to a study. Released Monday, on Indigenous Peoples Day, the study concluded most school districts are failing to cover all required areas of Wabanaki studies. “Teaching Wabanaki Studies is not optional. It is required by law,” Michael Kebede, policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said in a statement. The Wabanaki Alliance, the Abbe Museum and the ACLU of Maine used the state’s open records law to survey 10 districts and the state education department on their compliance with the law. The Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission also joined in the report. The 21-year-old state law requires schools to teach Wabanaki history, economic and political systems, and culture. The Wabanaki comprises the Penobscot Nation, Passamaquoddy tribes at Indian Township and Pleasant Point, Houlton Band of Maliseets, and Mi’kmaq.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Frederick County Public Libraries is bringing the library to patrons on three wheels. The Book Bike is designed to reach people who might not be able to come to a library branch in person. The bicycle’s bright orange cargo box, balanced between two front wheels, can carry up to 260 pounds, according to a FCPL news release. It comes equipped with an electric boost to help the cyclist pedal heavy loads. The library staff estimates the Book Bike can hold 300 children’s picture books or 120 adult fiction books. The Maryland State Library’s Library Service and Technology Act Grant funded the Book Bike. Beth Heltebridle, the C. Burr Artz branch administrator, said library employees will fill the Book Bike with materials they think will suit the audience they plan to visit. The Book Bike will carry a laptop, so patrons can check out materials or sign up for library cards. It also has a mobile hot spot that can deliver free Wi-Fi within 50 feet of the bicycle. The Book Bike launch coincided with National Library Card Signup Month. A FCPL library card gives the user access to books, movies, magazines, audio books and more. “It’s all about increasing access,” Heltebridle said. The Book Bike does not have a set route yet but is expected to frequent festivals, events and underserved communities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston Symphony Orchestra is embarking next month on its first overseas engagements since before the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of cultural events around the world. The orchestra is scheduled to undertake a four-city tour of Japan, performing at Yokohama’s Minato Mirai Hall on Nov. 9; Kyoto’s Concert Hall on Nov. 10; Osaka’s Festival Hall on Nov. 11; and Tokyo’s Suntory Hall on Nov. 13, 14 and 15. “The last few years have taught us to be especially grateful for the gifts of our lives,” Boston Symphony Orchetra music director Andris Nelsons said in a statement Wednesday. “This is how we feel about returning to Japan, where we will passionately share our music while expressing our deep appreciation for the people and culture of this great country.” The tour repertoire will include Mahler’s Symphony No. 6; Mozart’s Symphony No. 40; Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5; Strauss’ “Alpine Symphony”; and Caroline Shaw’s “Punctum.” The orchestra will be joined by Mitsuko Ushida on piano in Osaka and Tokyo. The stops in Yokohama and Kyoto are the orchestra’s first visits to those cities since the late 1980s. The orchestra’s last overseas tour was an eight-city European trip in September 2018.\n\nMichigan\n\nMuskegon: A judicial candidate is facing domestic assault charges partly based on video footage suggesting he hit his girlfriend repeatedly with a belt, prompting local domestic violence advocates to actively speak out against his candidacy. The candidate’s girlfriend and his attorney deny that he actually struck her. Jason Kolkema was arraigned on the misdemeanor charges in mid-September. Kolkema, a 51-year-old attorney running for Muskegon County’s 14th Circuit Court judicial seat, contends he was striking a chair with a belt and not his girlfriend as suggested by the video shot by an office worker in a building neighboring Kolkema’s apartment. “I understand that the optics are bad. I understand the anger and disappointment, especially from the people who voted for me and supported me … All of the facts will be revealed in due time,” Kolkema wrote on Facebook in response to a comment. His attorney, Terry Nolan, told WOOD-TV in September that Kolkema did not strike his girlfriend and said the incident shouldn’t disqualify him from seeking a seat on the bench. The woman said she was wearing a headset, and Kolkema struck the chair’s armrest to get her attention. The woman said she took some blame for the incident, writing that “it was rude of me to ignore him.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nKeewatin: Construction has started on one of the largest taconite projects in the state in recent years. U.S. Steel dedicated its $150 million plant addition in Keewatin on Wednesday as steelworkers picketed on the road to the facility. The union that represents workers at the Keetac plant is supportive of the project but remains at odds with U.S. Steel over a new contract. The national contract between the union and U.S. Steel expired Sept. 1. The United Steelworkers union has already settled with Cleveland-Cliffs, U.S. Steel’s main competitor on the Iron Range. The new U.S. Steel addition in Keewatin will produce pellets with a higher iron content than the traditional pellet. Full production of the new pellet is expected in 2024, the Star Tribune reports. Keetac is being retooled to make “direct-reduced” grade taconite pellets, which are used for producing iron for electric arc furnaces. Electric arc mills have traditionally used scrap metal but are increasingly utilizing direct-reduced iron or pig iron made from direct-reduced taconite pellets. Taconite plants on the Iron Range, including U.S. Steel’s Minntac facility in Mountain Iron, mainly produce iron ore pellets that are used in traditional blast furnaces. Electric arc furnaces are the primary source of U.S. steel production.\n\nMississippi\n\nHamilton: State regulators are investigating after a video showing four day care employees scaring children at a facility in an unincorporated northeast Mississippi community went viral on social media. The videos on Facebook show a day care worker at Lil’ Blessings Child Care & Learning Center in Hamilton wearing a Halloween mask and yelling at children who didn’t “clean up” or “act good.” Children can be seen and heard crying and, at times, running away from the employee wearing the mask, while another employee gives directions about which children acted “good” or “bad.” The employee in the mask is shown screaming inches away from children’s faces at times. Sheila Sanders, who has owned the business for the past 20 years, said she was unaware of the videos until Wednesday afternoon, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Sanders said one video was filmed in September and another on Tuesday. “No one came forth to tell me it happened in September,” she said. The behavior shown by her former employees in the video, she said, isn’t tolerated. “I contacted my licensure, and she has gotten involved,” Sanders said. “The people that did those acts are no longer with us. They were fired. I wasn’t here at the time and wasn’t aware they were doing that. I don’t condone that and never have.”\n\nMissouri\n\nExcelsior Springs: Authorities continued investigating a suspected kidnapping and sexual assault this weekend in a small town just northeast of Kansas City that was discovered when a malnourished woman escaped and screamed for help. Clay County authorities charged a man with rape, kidnapping and assault after the woman ran from his house in Excelsior Springs on Friday morning. She was hospitalized in stable condition Friday and reunited with her family afterward. “When we made contact with her, it was readily apparent that she had been held against her will for a significant period of time,” Excelsior Springs police Lt. Ryan Dowdy said. The woman told police there may have been two other victims, but authorities haven’t said whether any additional victims have been found. Investigators have continued to search the home from which the woman escaped, and Excelsior Springs Police Chief Greg Dull asked the public Saturday to be patient while officers sort through evidence. Dull said additional charges could be filed depending on the evidence investigators uncover. Excelsior Springs is about 30 miles northeast of Kansas City.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A U.S. magistrate judge has declared unconstitutional two Montana laws that sought to prevent the closure of a coal-fired power plant by subjecting its out-of-state owners to steep fines if they wouldn’t pay long-term maintenance and operating costs. U.S. Magistrate Judge Kathleen DeSoto said the state measures violated free commerce provisions in the U.S. Constitution and federal laws intended to keep states from interfering in private agreements, The Billings Gazette reports. Puget Sound Energy, Avista Corp., Portland General Electric and PacificCorp are majority owners of the Colstrip Power Plant in southeastern Montana. Their home states of Washington and Oregon are phasing out the use of coal-generated power over climate concerns – Washington in late 2025 and Oregon in early 2030. The utilities have previously objected to paying for repairs to extend Colstrip’s life beyond when they can sell the power. Talen Montana and NorthWestern Energy, which do not face coal-power bans, own the rest of the plant and want it to remain open. The disputed laws were passed by the Republican-controlled Montana Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte in 2021.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: With Ben Sasse apparently ready to resign his U.S. Senate seat to become president of the University of Florida, speculation is rampant that his temporary replacement could be Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts. Ricketts, who like Sasse is a Republican, would otherwise be out of a political job at the end of the year due to term limits. Scenarios of how Ricketts would ascend to the U.S. Senate run the gamut from his presumptive successor naming him as Nebraska’s newest U.S. senator to Ricketts appointing himself to fill the seat. However, Ricketts issued a statement Friday afternoon appearing to rule out appointing himself. “If I choose to pursue the appointment, I will leave the appointment decision to the next governor and will follow the process established for all interested candidates,” he said in the statement. The question is whether Ricketts wants the job. “I think the obvious candidate is Pete Ricketts, and if he wants to be a U.S. senator, then it’s his to take,” said Mark Fahleson, a former chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party. Ricketts on Friday confirmed that the news of Sasse’s departure caught him off guard. “The first I learned about Sen. Sasse’s plan to resign from the United States Senate was yesterday, when he called to notify me,” he said, adding that the job of governor “is the greatest job in the world, and it will remain my number one focus for the remainder of my term.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The area’s carpool lanes soon will be open to any driver during overnight hours for the next year-and-a-half. The Nevada Department of Transportation will start an 18-month pilot program this month where even a lone driver can travel in carpool lanes or HOV lanes between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The agency decided to try these new hours out after studies showed traffic on Interstate 15 came down every day between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. There are over 20 continuous carpool lanes in the metro Las Vegas area, according to officials. The new carpool lane hours begin Oct. 24.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAlton: Slain journalist James Foley has been honored with a stone memorial outside the church he attended in his childhood. Foley, a freelance journalist, was among a group of Westerners brutally murdered in Islamic State captivity in Syria in 2014. He grew up in Wolfeboro and attended St. Katharine Drexel Church in Alton, where the memorial was unveiled Sunday. “We wanted to do something so we would never forget that he’s a member of us, and he’s part of our family,” the church’s pastor, Fr. Bob Cole, told WMUR-TV. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, said her son would’ve been profoundly humbled by the gesture. “I was hugely grateful to find that Jim received so much strength from his faith,” she said. Two British IS militants, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty by a jury in connection with Foley’s death and are serving life sentences.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nearly two dozen historical sites and nonprofits in the state are set to receive cash injections in a new round of funding from the New Jersey Historic Trust. Part of the state Department of Consumer Affairs, the trust has recommended the release of nearly $15.8 million from the Garden State Historic Preservation Trust Fund to fund 65 projects across New Jersey. Four of the largest awards, $750,000 each, are expected to fund rehabilitation projects in Hoboken, Newark and Paterson. In Paterson, the money is earmarked for ongoing improvements at Lambert Castle. That project could receive a pair of $750,000 grants from the trust for a rehabilitation effort that has kept the Passaic County museum closed since 2019. Built in 1892, the former home of silk tycoon Catholina Lambert is expected to reopen in 2023. The long-term project received $750,000 from the trust in 2019 and $50,000 in 2018, which is also true for the Hoboken Free Public Library and Manual Training School project. Opened in 1897, the four-story public library this year underwent third-floor renovations and received a new HVAC system. The Newark money would boost efforts to preserve City Hall. Built in 1902, it features carved marble and a 24-karat gold-covered dome.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: A synagogue that is believed to be the first Jewish place of worship in the New Mexico Territory is back in the hands of the Jewish community. The Albuquerque Journal reported Monday the Las Vegas Jewish Community crowd-sourced enough funds to buy Temple Montfiore last month from the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. One of the oldest Catholic dioceses in the United States, it has been forced to sell properties to help pay a settlement agreement that resulted from a clergy sex abuse scandal. The synagogue was sold to the diocese in the 1950s because there were very few Jewish people in the region. In recent years, the building has been a place of worship for Catholic college students. When the Las Vegas Jewish Community became aware it was up for sale and that the deadline was in September, members turned to GoFundMe. The group raised over $300,000 in just a few weeks – more money than it actually needed. Diana Presser, a board member of the Las Vegas Jewish Community, saud it was fitting that the sale closed during Rosh Hashana last week. “I led the services for the first Sabbath of the new year in a building we now own,” Presser said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The mayor declared a state of emergency Friday over the thousands of migrants being sent from Southern states since the spring, saying the demand being put on the city to provide housing and other assistance is “not sustainable.” “A city recovering from an ongoing global pandemic is being overwhelmed by a humanitarian crisis made by human hands,” Mayor Eric Adams said. “We are at the edge of the precipice. … We need help. And we need it now.” By the end of its fiscal year, Adams said the city expected to spend $1 billion helping the new arrivals, many of whom are heavily reliant on government aid because federal law prohibits them from working in the U.S. Adams, a Democrat, said the new arrivals are welcome in the city. And he spoke with pride of New York City’s history as a landing spot for new immigrants. “New Yorkers have always looked out for our immigrant brothers and sisters. We see ourselves in them. We see our ancestors in them,” he said. But “though our compassion is limitless, our resources are not,” he said. New York City’s already strained shelter system has been under even greater pressure. Between five and six buses of migrants are arriving per day, Adams said, with nine on Thursday alone. And 1 in 5 beds in New York City’s homeless shelter system is now occupied by a migrant, swelling its population to record levels. The city has opened 42 new, temporary shelters, mostly in hotels, but Adams said more would need to be done.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Planned Parenthood’s political arm announced a $5 million investment Thursday in the state’s battleground races as Democrats fight to preserve the governor’s veto power in one of the last abortion access points in the Southeast. Just 32 days from Election Day, with absentee voting now underway, Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Action PAC North Carolina are targeting 14 legislative swing districts with ads, mailings, phone banks and canvassing. The investment is part of an existing $50 million national campaign to protect reproductive rights in nine target states – the largest-ever electoral program in its history. Abortions are legal in North Carolina until 20 weeks of pregnancy, as of an Aug. 17 federal court ruling. But with Republicans just five seats shy of a supermajority in the General Assembly – three seats shy in the House and two in the Senate – Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s power to veto more stringent abortion restrictions hinges on the November outcome. As its neighboring states slash abortion access in the months following the June U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, North Carolina has become one of the South’s few safe havens for the procedure.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An addiction counselor who helped defeat a marijuana legalization proposal four years ago has launched a fresh opposition group seeking to do it again this November. Kristie Spooner announced her group, Healthy and Productive North Dakota, less than five weeks before Election Day and after some major funders of the 2018 opposition had announced they would sit out the 2022 fight. The measure would allow people over age 21 in North Dakota to use and possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to three marijuana plants. “Kristie and other people in North Dakota were really concerned about the measure,” said Luke Niforatos, who helped Spooner launch the group. “We didn’t see an organized effort take hold sooner, so we’re doing it before it’s too late.” The group had raised just $750 as of Thursday, from Niforatos’ contribution as executive vice president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a Virginia-based political organization against marijuana legalization. But he said the group hopes to raise at least $200,000 to put toward digital, radio and billboard advertising. A different group that supports legalization, The New Approach, has raised about $550,000, treasurer Mark Friese said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Well over a year after Ohio’s former chief of K-12 public education announced his retirement, the State Board of Education hasn’t found a replacement. In fact, the board argued about whether to seek proposals from outside firms to search for a new state superintendent at its September meeting. “The move for even getting to the point of hiring a search firm was a fight,” board member John Hagan said. Ultimately, the 19-member board voted to start searching for a search firm, but Hagan said he doesn’t think an offer will be made until 2023. And that concerns him and other conservative board members because 30% of Ohio’s children were chronically absent last year, test scores haven’t recovered from the pandemic, and the state’s budget process is already underway. “When this kind of stuff happens, I think that we are losing integrity, and we should never use that word again in this room,” board member Diana Fessler said during September’s meeting. The position – vacant for 15 months now – oversees the education of Ohio’s 1.7 million public education students from kindergarten through high school and helps guide the development of academic standards.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Leaders of the state’s largest tribes say they will formally endorse Joy Hofmeister for governor amid their final push to inspire more tribal citizens to vote and unseat incumbent Gov. Kevin Stitt. Hofmeister has been a clear favorite among tribal leaders throughout the race, but leaders of the Five Tribes plan to take the unique step of expressing their joint support for the Democratic challenger Tuesday in Oklahoma City. While the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee and Seminole nations work closely together on many issues, their top elected officials rarely make joint endorsements in state political races. That they are doing so now signals how critical they view the outcome of the governor’s race. Stitt’s first term in office has been marked by conflict with tribal leaders over policing, taxing, gaming and hunting. Leaders of the Five Tribes said in a joint statement they are backing Hofmeister because she will work with them and because she shares many of the same economic, health and safety priorities. Hofmeister, Oklahoma’s superintendent of public instruction, switched parties last year to run against Stitt. Tribal leaders, including Chickasaw Gov. Bill Anoatubby and Choctaw Chief Gary Batton, soon donated to her campaign. Tribes across the state also created a voter awareness campaign.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Three of the state’s largest hospital systems are suing Oregon over its alleged lack of adequate mental health care, which they say has forced the hospital systems to house patients in need of mental health treatment for months. Providence Health & Services, Legacy Health and PeaceHealth say in the lawsuit the Oregon Health Authority has forced them to provide care they’re not equipped to give for patients who should be civilly committed to psychiatric institutions such as the Oregon State Hospital, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The state psychiatric hospital’s ongoing capacity crisis, along with a recent court ruling that strictly limits who can be admitted, has left community hospitals with nowhere to send patients in need of mental health treatment. Hospital representatives say they have been forced to treat those patients long-term. “The necessary components for safe and effective treatment provided at long-term care facilities – such as security, private rooms, kitchens and physical exercise – are not feasible at hospitals that are also responsible for meeting the short-term acute care needs of their communities,” a joint statement for the facilities said. “As a result, patients left in these environments by OHA do not receive needed care and, in many cases, decompensate back to unstable conditions.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A statue of Christopher Columbus remains hidden by a plywood box while its fate is decided in the courts, but the box has now been painted with the colors of the Italian flag. City officials told the news station KYW that they painted the box covering the 146-year-old statue in south Philadelphia’s Marconi Plaza with green, white and red stripes at the request of Councilmember Mark Squilla, who represents the district. The new look came just in time for Columbus Day, the holiday now celebrated in Philadelphia and elsewhere as Indigenous Peoples Day. Thomas DeFino, one of the residents who gathered in the park Sunday afternoon to celebrate their Italian American heritage with a parade and festival, welcomed the change, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. “They did it for us – the Italians. It made us feel a little bit better,” DeFino said. “It’s to honor our heritage. They had to pull some strings to paint it.” While he appreciated the gesture, DeFino said, he noted that the statue was “still in a box.” “He should have been taken out at least for one day,” he said. Mabel Negrete, executive director of Indigenous Peoples’ Day Philly Inc., told the Inquirer it was “unfortunate” that some Italian Americans in the city continued to celebrate Columbus. She said the painting “undermines intentions to move forward.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Drivers eager for a new license plate with the reimagined “wave” design will have to wait until next year. The state Division of Motor Vehicles on Thursday said it now plans to begin issuing the new-look plates to automobile owners in January, several months later than initially expected. Back in April, when a new design for the license plate was revealed, the DMV said it planned to start sending out new plates around Labor Day. By the end of May, that timeline was pushed back when vendor 3M had a problem securing the right type of envelopes in which to send the plates to automobile owners. The DMV told the Boston Globe in May that it didn’t expect to receive the plates until September, and customers would start receiving them in October or early November. But even though the envelope issue was resolved, the timeline for shipping the first new plates continued to slip, in this case to mid-November, DMV spokesman Paul Grimaldi wrote in an email. And instead of starting to send them out toward the end of the year, the state instead decided to wait until January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nInman: Five people died Sunday night in a shooting at a home in northern South Carolina, authorities said. Spartanburg County deputies and emergency workers found them suffering from gunshot wounds at a house in Inman, Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger said in a statement. Four people died at the scene, and a fifth died in surgery at the hospital, authorities said. All five people killed appeared to be adults, weren’t related to each other and were found in different parts of the home, the coroner said. Spartanburg County deputies said they won’t release any additional information on the shooting until the coroner has identified the people killed and notified their families. Clevenger said his office is performing autopsies and trying to identify the victims on Monday. The home where the bodies were found is about 10 miles northwest of Spartanburg.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Thousands of schoolchildren across the state are facing new barriers to getting proper nutrition at school due to the end of a pandemic-era federal program that provided free meals to all students regardless of parental income. Parents in South Dakota, meanwhile, are facing new financial challenges as they try to pay for meals for their children at a time when high inflation rates are driving up costs for food, energy, housing and many other necessary goods and services, South Dakota News Watch reports. The federal effort to provide free meals to all American schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic expired this summer. The pandemic-era program provided more than 4 billion free meals to American schoolchildren over the past two school years, including to tens of thousands of students in South Dakota. Sioux Falls School District Superintendent Jane Stavem told News Watch that ending the free school meals program after two years has put the district, parents and children in tough spots. The district does not have the funding to continue to provide free meals for all students on its own and is working on innovative ways to continue to pay for food for students who need it.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: One person was found dead in the rubble of a fire that broke out in downtown Gatlinburg early Sunday morning. The fire caused extensive damage to a block of businesses, including include Cafe 420, Puckers Sports Grill and Gifts of Gatlinburg, the city’s spokesperson said in a press release. Sandy Fox, who was staying at the neighboring Historic Gatlinburg Inn, said the fire was not visible when she initially walked outside about 6:30 a.m. Sunday, but the building was in flames 15 minutes later. She left to connect with friends and said the blaze had spread substantially when she returned at 9 a.m. During fire suppression efforts, crews found one person dead inside the structure, according to the press release. The identity of the individual has not yet been confirmed. Crews from the Gatlinburg Fire Department fought the blaze with assistance from Pigeon Forge, Sevierville and Pittman Center fire departments, the spokesperson said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Gatlinburg Fire Department, Gatlinburg Police Department and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Fire crews still were working on hot spots Monday morning, the city’s spokesperson said, and the owner of the damaged structure had a contractor demolishing the damaged building.\n\nTexas\n\nUvalde: The superintendent of the school district where a gunman killed 19 elementary school students and two teachers in May announced his retirement Monday, according to his wife’s Facebook page. In the statement posted to Donna Goates Harrell’s Facebook page, Uvalde school Superintendent Hal Harrell said he would remain in office throughout this school year until the school board hires his successor. The Facebook posting was first reported by CNN. The superintendent asked his wife “to post this message since he doesn’t have Facebook.” Harrell, the Uvalde school board and other school district officials have faced heavy criticism over the May 24 Robb Elementary School massacre in which officers allowed a shooter with an AR-15-style rifle to remain in a fourth grade classroom for more than 70 minutes. “My heart was broken on May 24th and I will always pray for each precious life that was tragically taken and their families,” the Facebook post said. “My wife and I love you all and this community that we both grew up in, therefore this decision was a difficult one for us. I have been blessed to work among amazing educators and staff who believe in education for more than 30 years, which have all been in our beautiful community. These next steps for our future are ... completely my choice.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The head of the state’s public school system is pushing back after a man delivering a prayer at an Orem City Council meeting asserted that “evil things ... are being said and done and taught in the school system.” Sydnee Dickinson, Utah’s superintendent of public instruction, called the comment “a dagger to my heart,” the Deseret News reports. Orem Mayor David Young had apparently asked his father, Allen Young, to deliver the invocation at a meeting late last month, when he urged voters to split Orem’s school district in the November election.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state’s recreational cannabis marketplace is off to a slow start. The obstacles faced by Vermont’s legal marijuana industry were reflected Oct. 1, the first day of legal sales for recreational use, when only one store in Chittenden County was open for business: Ceres Collaborative on College Street in Burlington. The line for Ceres stretched around the corner and down an alley, with an estimated 200 people waiting to get in. “There are growers that just aren’t ready to harvest and have available flower for Oct. 1,” Russ Todia, chief operating officer for Ceres Collaborative, said before the launch. “That’s for the indoor. For the outdoor, the weather hasn’t been kind. That puts growers in a tough spot, trying to harvest early, or just not having the yield they would have expected.” Tito Bern, owner of The Bern Gallery in Burlington, said most indoor growers have yet to get started. “Supply is terrible,” he said. Bern, who is applying for a Tier 2 license to be an indoor grower as well as a retailer, estimates his own smokable flower won’t be available for another five months. Bern thinks it will be two years before Vermont’s adult-use cannabis industry is fully up and running. “It’s going to take a while,” Todia agreed. “Generally, it will be a slow start for everyone.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A federal appeals court on Friday denied a request to rehear a case that found that gender dysphoria is a condition covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. In August, a three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals became the first federal appellate court in the country to find that the landmark federal law protects people with gender dysphoria, a condition that causes anguish and other symptoms as a result of a disparity between a person’s gender identity and their assigned sex at birth. The decision came in the case of Kesha Williams, a transgender woman who sued the Fairfax County sheriff in Virginia for housing her in a jail with men under a policy that inmates must be classified according to their genitals. In her lawsuit, Williams said that she was harassed and that her prescribed hormone medication was repeatedly delayed or skipped, violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. A federal judge granted a motion by the sheriff’s office to dismiss the lawsuit, but the 4th Circuit panel reversed that ruling, finding there is a distinction between gender identity disorder and gender dysphoria. The modern diagnosis of gender dysphoria “affirms that a transgender person’s medical needs are just as deserving of treatment and protection as anyone else’s,” Judge Diana Gribbon Motz wrote.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state this year has had the fewest square miles burned in a decade following the second- and third-worst fire seasons on record in 2020 and 2021. State Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz announced Friday that about 219 square miles burned in 2022 wildfires, The Seattle Times reports. That’s compared to nearly 781 square miles in 2021 and 1,316 square miles burned in 2020. 2015 was the state’s worst fire season in recorded history, when more than 1,562 square miles burned Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz celebrated the moderate fire season, saying a combination of Department of Natural Resources equipment, aerial firefighting assets, personnel, partnerships with other agencies, as well as a rainy spring that delayed the start of this year’s fire season contributed to the success. Since taking office in 2017, Franz has touted the benefits of controlled burns and of “treating” forests by thinning brush, trimming branches and removing dying trees. Department of Natural Resources officials since 2017 have tracked over 625 square miles of completed treatment, and about 109 square miles of prescribed burns in Central and Eastern Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A federal prosecutor is holding a forum this week on citizens’ constitutional rights and how they’re enforced. U.S. Attorney William Ihlenfeld and his staff are hosting the event Tuesday morning in Morgantown. Experts will explain hate crimes, disability rights, housing rights and other areas of the law, according to a news release from Ihlenfeld’s office. “Federal civil rights laws are an important tool in our efforts to make communities in West Virginia safer and more welcoming, but they are often overlooked,” Ihlenfeld said. The half-day program is free and open to the public. It starts at 9 a.m. at the Mon County Center at Mylan Park.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGreen Bay: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit from a taxpayers group seeking to block President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, ruling that the group doesn’t have standing to bring the lawsuit. The Brown County Taxpayers Association argued that Biden’s order unlawfully circumvented Congress’ power over spending. They also argued the plan was discriminatory by seeking to give particular help to borrowers of color. U.S. District Judge William Griesbach, an appointee of President George W. Bush, tossed the case Thursday, writing that the group does not have standing to challenge the plan simply because its members are taxpayers. Biden enacted the debt relief plan under the HEROES Act, which was passed after the Sept. 11 attacks sparked an American-led military campaign aimed at terrorism. The act gave the executive branch authority to forgive student loan debt in association with military operations or national emergencies. The president cited COVID-19 as reason to invoke the act. The lawsuit, filed by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on behalf of the taxpayers group, had argued it was an overextension of executive power that improperly sidestepped Congress.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Voters will decide next month whether to increase from 70 to 75 the mandatory retirement age for district judges and justices on the state Supreme Court, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation. Deaths remain at 56.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,099 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease, with a total of 77,624 people have been tested.\n\n_________\n\nA preliminary outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Windham County was announced by state officials Tuesday during Gov. Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

The meeting will also be aired live through the district's YouTube and Facebook pages. Interpreters will be available to translate the meeting.\n\nMonday, July 13, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,301.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Eight hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,096 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n76,581 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nNOTE: The Free Press noticed the numbers regarding new and total case counts didn't align from July 11 to July 13 and subsequently reached out to the Health Department. Ben Truman with the department said in an email that this is why there is a notice that this data is preliminary. He provided an example: A person who tested positive might no longer get counted if it is learned that they don't live in Vermont.\n\n_________\n\nSunday, July 12, 2020\n\nFourteen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,296.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Fifteen hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,089 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n75,851 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nSaturday, July 11, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Saturday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,283.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same as yesterday. Sixteen hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,066 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n75,032 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nFriday, July 10, 2020\n\nThe Governor announced $30 million in housing assistance for those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe money would be allocated Federal CARES Act funding: $25 million for renters and landlords and $5 million for homeowners behind on making payments. Those interested in receiving assistance can begin applying online starting Monday July 13 for the rental assistance program or mortgage assistance program.\n\nRenters' assistance money could be used for rent or security deposits as well as make up for landlord losses from the period starting March 1, 2020. Funding can be re-applied for and is given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of payment delinquency will be required.\n\nThe mortgage assistance program prioritizes the lowest income, highest risk of foreclosure homeowners who have missed at least two payments. Homeowners could apply for up to three missed mortgage payments; funds will be paid directly to the mortgage lender.\n\n__________\n\nKinney Drugs and a Walgreens in Essex will soon begin COVID-19 testing at their pharmacies.\n\nGov. Phil Scott asked other local companies to join the effort. Health Commissioner Mark Levine said having testing locations at local pharmacies takes some of the burden off the health department so they can focus on outbreaks and vulnerable populations.\n\n___________\n\nFive new cases of COVID-19 were reported Friday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,277.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — down one from yesterday. Nine hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,066 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n74,098 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nThe ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain will be regularly open starting July 10, Fridays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Timed tickets are required for two different time slots, 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 to 3 p.m.\n\n_________\n\nIn a news conference Friday afternoon, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said Vermont is doing well combatting the coronavirus, but emphasized that we are only in the second inning of a nine inning game, using a baseball analogy to make the point that there’s a long way to go before the crisis is over.\n\nWeinberger echoed the same point made during the call by Dr. Stephen Leffler, president and chief operating officer of University of Vermont Medical Center, who said, “There’s a lot of coronavirus in front of us.” Leffler said he understands that people are fatigued by the effort to deal with the virus, but “we have to be in this for the long term.”\n\nLeffler used a different spots analogy, saying we just finished the first quarter of the effort to fight the disease.\n\n_________\n\nAirport Director Gene Richards also joined the mayor’s call to give an update on measures being taken Burlington International Airport against COVID-19. The airport has added thermal imaging that can pick up abnormally high body temperatures, indicating a fever, in groups of up to 20 people.

According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184. Hospitalizations increased to four (from two) and those hospitalized under investigation decreased from 17 to 9 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56.

Outpatient restrictions remain in place, where family and friends are not allowed to accompany patients into their doctors' offices unless patients requires support and assistance to meet with their doctors.\n\nFor pediatric patients, one parent or support person is recommended, but both parents may be permitted to visit when \"necessary and appropriate,\" based on unique care needs and circumstances determined by the care team.\n\nPatients arriving in the emergency department or urgent care may also be accompanied by one consistent family member or support person.\n\n__________\n\nNational Life Group in Montpelier announced it cut 53 jobs in Vermont as a result of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The insurance company also cut 30 jobs in Texas and 12 in \"other remote locations,\" according to a news release.\n\nMehran Assadi, chairman, president and CEO of National Life, said in a statement the company does not anticipate any further job cuts.\n\nNational Life employees have been working remotely since mid-March, with the exception of a few dozen essential workers who continue to report to the office in Montpelier, the news release said. The company is currently planning a phased return to the office, which will not occur before July 20.\n\n__________\n\nTuesday, June 23, 2020\n\nOne new case of COVID-19 brought the state cumulative total to 1,164.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed. Two people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n__________\n\nBurlington City Arts will begin its 2020 summer artist market this weekend on Pine Street.\n\nThe arts organization announced a number of health and safety measures that would be in place due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The market will run each Saturday from June 13 through Oct. 17 from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at 339 Pine St. in Burlington.\n\nPrecautions being taken include:\n\nRequiring vendors to wear face masks and gloves, and encouraging shoppers to do the same.\n\nDirecting shoppers in one direction, with only one entrance and one exit.\n\nLimiting 10 to 15 shoppers in the market at one time, and relying on extra staff to regulate these numbers.\n\nEstablishing hand sanitizing stations at booths in addition to the market's entrance and exit.\n\nLimiting the number of vendors to 20 each week, with booths spaced at least 6 feet apart.\n\nEncouraging vendors to display merchandise in a way that limits touch.\n\nLimiting two people per booth at a time.\n\nOffering contactless payment.\n\nA full list of vendors participating in the 2020 markets can be found at burlingtoncityarts.org/artistmarket\n\n__________\n\nThursday, June 11, 2020\n\nThe Vermont National Education Association (NEA) expressed its concerns with the Governor and Agency of Education's announcement to reopen Vermont schools by Labor Day.\n\nDon Tinney, Vermont-NEA president, called the announcement “unfortunate” because the hard work required to plan for a safe reopening has not been completed, according to a press release from the Vermont-NEA.\n\nSome of the issues the organization said need to be resolved before setting an opening date are:\n\nEffective and robust testing and contact tracing in areas with in-person schooling.\n\nCollective pre-opening planning.\n\nSufficient time to plan and make facility preparations.\n\nEstablish protocols for social distancing and use of personal protective equipment, cleaning, how to respond if a student or staff member contracts the virus.\n\nAddress learning deficits as a result of remote learning and address student trauma.\n\nPlan for contingency distance learning if schools need to close again.\n\nEstablish regular and effective communication between schools and families.\n\nCreate protocols for how to deal with students and staff at higher risk of contracting the virus or experiencing life-threatening complications as a result.\n\nState should allocate funding to hire nurses, custodians, bus drivers, mental health counselors and to purchase sufficient amounts of personal protective equipment.\n\nGuidance on special education services.\n\nProtection of vulnerable children if schools close again.\n\nResources for families who do not benefit consistently from distance learning.\n\nEstablish which student groups would return first in a gradual return to school.\n\nSolve the internet access issues some families face.\n\nStandardized testing requirements be waived.\n\n__________\n\nNorthern Vermont University will begin its fall semester one week earlier than initially planned to position itself in case there is a resurgence of COVID-19 cases later this year.\n\nThe semester will also end early — residential students will return home for Thanksgiving break and will take final exams remotely, the college announced Thursday.\n\nThe plan will not affect the number of teaching and learning days, the college said in a statement. The accelerated semester includes no breaks, with instruction on Labor Day and throughout October. Students will leave campus on Friday, November 20, and are planned to be welcomed back when the spring semester begins on January 19, 2021.\n\n“We know this is different from our normal semester,” college President Elaine Collins said. “The health of the entire NVU community is our number one priority as we prepare to return to campus for face-to-face instruction.”\n\n__________\n\nVermont reported an additional 16 positive cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing its total to 1,110, Health Department statistics show.\n\nAccording to the data, 905 people have recovered from COVID-19 and 47,209 people have been tested for the virus in Vermont.\n\nThe number of people hospitalized with the virus decreased by one on Thursday for a total of three. Nine people are hospitalized under investigation for COVID-19.\n\nNo additional deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred — that total remains at 55.\n\n__________\n\nNo cases of COVID-19 were found at the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield following mass testing of inmates and staff, the Vermont Department of Corrections said.\n\nAccording to Corrections officials, 336 inmates and 181 staff at the facility were tested June 8. All tests came back negative for the virus.\n\nThe Springfield-based prison was the sixth and final facility to undergo mass testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only facility to have inmates test positive for the virus since it was first detected among members of the prison population, the Corrections Department said.\n\n__________\n\nWednesday, June 10, 2020\n\nA total of 74 cases of COVID-19 are thought to be associated with the recent outbreak that emerged in Winooski, according to Vermont Department of Health data from Tuesday evening.\n\nAbout 80% of those cases are in Winooski and most of the rest are in Burlington, the Health Department said. Only one in five people associated with the outbreak are reporting symptoms — the number of asymptomatic individuals is thought to be a contributing factor to the spread of the virus in the community.\n\nThere have been no deaths associated with the outbreak, the state reported.\n\n__________\n\nGuidance is underway to prepare Vermont schools across the state to tentatively open by Labor Day, announced Gov. Phil Scott in a press briefing Wednesday.\n\nHealth and safety measures for school districts are being developed by the state's Agency of Education and the Health Department, in collaboration with other Vermont educational organizations and pediatricians, and will be formally announced by next week.\n\n\"it's critical we finalize a plan now so we can reopen in the fall,\" said Scott.\n\nAmong the objectives of the guidance is to decrease the risk of COVID-19 entering school, being transmitted between staff and students, and ensuring students with certain needs are \"addressed in a fair and equitable measure\".\n\nProvisions could include social distancing on busses, daily temperature screenings at bus stops and school entrances, increased testing and tracing capacity, and mandatory dismissals if students or staff display any symptoms.\n\n\"It's likely we'll have to change or amend this guidance in the coming months,\" said Dan French, secretary of the Agency of Education.\n\n\"We're also preparing to improve our ability to provide remote learning as a contingency.\"\n\n__________\n\nRegistration is open for Vermonters seeking meals from distribution sites across the state this month.\n\nPick up sites are scheduled on these days in these areas , with more sites to be added for the remainder of June:\n\nMiddlebury area: June 10\n\nBrattleboro area: June 11\n\nMorristown area: June 12\n\nLyndon area: June 15\n\nGrand Isle County: June 16\n\nRandolph area: June 17\n\nDover area: June 18\n\nChittenden County: June 19\n\nPeople can register online at humanresources.vermont.gov/food-help or over the phone via 2-1-1.

That's no small triumph. Faced with everything this year's tossed our way — a global health crisis, our daily lives upended, a contentious election, fresh worries cropping up by the minute — it might seem Pollyanna-ish of us to reflect on the good. Silly in the face of serious. Joyful amid so much sorrow. Looking up as the earth beneath us shifts with uncertainty. But what can we say? We made it. So did you. Rooted here in the desert, we've found so many reasons to feel thankful. Here are 30 of them.\n\nWe'll start with an easy one: sunsets\n\nThere's really nothing like a Phoenix sunset. Not that I've seen anyway. And as a music journalist who's always interviewing artists from around the world, I know I'm not alone in being mesmerized by magic hour in the Valley. When Courtney Barnett brought her last tour to Phoenix from Australia, she said she was looking forward to the date because we have the \"best sunsets in the world.\"\n\nShe's right, you know. And if you find yourself not sharing our enthusiasm for those sunsets, here's what Arizona native Dierks Bentley once told me.\n\n\"When I’m out there to hang out with my buddy Brian (Frakes) in his backyard on Indian School, you’ll see an Arizona sunset and I’m just like, ‘I can’t take my eyes off it.’ He’s like, ‘Another sunset. Big deal.’ But to me, it’s like, 'No, look at that. That’s amazing! Look what it’s done to the clouds. The whole sky has changed color.\"\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nStreet art makes the city feel alive\n\nYou’ve probably read about James Baldwin. But you rarely see his face. Artist Antoinette Cauley aimed to change that with a nine-story portrait of Baldwin that went up in downtown Phoenix in August. Incorporating his famous quote, “Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing can be changed until it is faced,” the large-scale art stands as a reminder of his work, or an introduction to it.\n\nCauley’s mural is just one of the many works of art in downtown Phoenix artists created to let their voices be heard this year. From 100 beaded turtles scattered downtown with “vote” painted on their shells, to a literal 2020 dumpster fire and a mural honoring Black lives, Arizona creatives took to the streets as a pandemic and a presidential election loomed.\n\nThis year has felt apocalyptic. But driving downtown and seeing new art outside reminds me the city is still alive.\n\n— Elizabeth Montgomery\n\nYou'll find plant stores for pros and novices\n\nSure, lots of people were into houseplants before the pandemic. But it seems that constantly staring at the interiors of our homes combined with having much, much, much more time to take care of household tasks (like watering plants) spurred many folks — myself included — to go full on house plant crazy this year. Which makes sense considering the Valley has such an amazing collection of indie plant stores to enable addicts.\n\nAs any good metro Phoenix green thumb knows, The Plant Stand of Arizona offers a wide selection at unbeatable prices (bonus: you can usually pet Bentley, the owner's friendly golden retriever when you go) while Dig It Gardens wins the award for having the most helpful staff. (They'll even re-pot your plant babies for you!) And when you're looking to discover something special, there's nothing better than a stroll through the urban oasis that is Pueblo plant store.\n\n— Lauren Saria\n\nOur beer brewers and cocktail masters make imbibing fun\n\nWhen home became everything — your office, gym, school — it also became your neighborhood bar. And Arizonans reportedly enjoyed a whole lot of adult beverages during the early months of the pandemic. Good thing the Valley’s brewers and shakers were prepared and quick to, once they got the go-ahead, offer to-go drinks and deliver beer to doorsteps.\n\nBut they did more than mix up bevs and send them on their way. They made it fun. Thai spot Glai Baan issued glass jars of cocktails, each with a stuck-on label delightfully illustrating its name with a stick figure drawing. (Sunshowers, for instance, feature a smiling person with a flaming sunshine for a head standing under, you guessed it, a shower.) Wren House Brewing took their limited edition drop game to new levels, issuing hints about when new Frescas would hit the online shop with fresh labels that only made them more covetable. Pouring either into a glass at the end of another Groundhog Day made it feel a little like being on a twinkly patio or seated among friends at a long wooden table. Kind of. Not really. But almost.\n\n— Becky Bartkowski\n\nYoung Arizonans care about climate change\n\nLet’s face it: Phoenix was designed for cars, not people. And unless something changes, the climate crisis — fueled in part by carbon dioxide emissions — will continue to harm this city in different ways, whether it’s deadly heat or intensifying drought. While it’s easy to despair in a place dubbed “the least sustainable city in the world,” I’m thankful for the diverse generation of young Arizonans and first-time voters who give a damn about our air and water and living things. As my coworker Erin Stone reported, Gen Z will be the ones who live to see how climate projections play out in the latter half of their lives. I want to live in a Phoenix that will become more livable for everyone and I feel hopeful the next generation of leaders feel that way, too.\n\n— Priscilla Totiyapungprasert\n\nThere's no daylight saving time\n\nFrom the moment you move to Arizona, you repeatedly hear this question from friends outside the Grand Canyon State.\n\n“What time is it there anyway?”\n\nArizona’s decision in 1967 not to take part in pushing clocks forward and back means no extra hour of sleep in the fall. But it also means no spring forward disrupting your sleep schedule either.\n\nSure, sometimes you feel like you’re doing quantum physics deducting what time it is in other places. But isn’t it worth it to not have to change every clock in your home and office twice a year? Isn’t it great if you have small children that you don’t have to adjust their sleep schedules? Time peacefully marches on in Arizona without interruption.\n\nIf only the rest of the world would join us.\n\n— Melissa Yeager\n\nReconnecting with Japanese culture at Arizona Matsuri\n\nSince moving to Phoenix a year ago, there have been a few times when I’ve experienced a collective excitement for Asian cultures and food — something I saw firsthand every day while working in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo.\n\nSure, there was online hype for H Mart, which finally opened in Mesa in June. But it wasn’t until I was struggling to wade through the crowds (and the mud) at the 36th annual Arizona Matsuri in February that I felt like I was reconnecting with something I’d been missing since my move.\n\nThousands of people filled Steele Indian School Park to appreciate Japanese arts, culture and food that I’d grown up with in Southern California. Lines more than an hour long blocked pathways by the food booths offering taiyaki, curry rice and ramen.\n\nIt was the best “welcome to Phoenix” I could’ve asked for.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nIt’s a birding paradise\n\nIt’s difficult to run out of birds to spot in Arizona, from roadrunners to raptors to hummingbirds. The state is a birder’s paradise with 566 species to check off your list. In southern Arizona, Chiricahua National Monument’s unique sky islands make it a haven for over 200 species of birds, including the stunning red-and-green elegant trogon. In northern Arizona, you may even get lucky enough to spot one of the 102 endangered California condors that call Utah and Arizona home.\n\nThe state is also lousy with hummingbirds: about a dozen species can be spotted in southeastern Arizona each year. Compared to birders east of the Mississippi River who only get to enjoy one species, we’re in luck. I’m glad we have easy access to a perfectly peaceful activity in this time of social distancing.\n\n— Shaena Montanari\n\nSome Arizona food favorites are coming to the Valley\n\nIt’s has been a trying year for small businesses of all varieties. Restaurants and bars have been some of the hardest hit. However, there is still plenty to celebrate, as some of Arizona’s favorite food and drink destinations have opened locations in the Valley.\n\nSouthern Arizona’s Tombstone Brewing Company opened a new brewery outpost near Arcadia. The drive to Superstition Meadery just got a whole lot shorter as the Prescott favorite opened its downtown Phoenix taproom and restaurant in November. Globe’s comic and video game-themed spot Nurdberger opened a second location in Gilbert. Tucson vegan restaurant Beaut Burger is bringing plant based burgers and dairy free ice cream to the Valley in the new year and the Old Pueblo’s favorite fast food chain eegee’s confirmed plans of opening not one, but five Phoenix locations. Now, that all sounds like something to be thankful for.\n\n— Tirion Morris\n\nArizona's wine industry feels like a true community\n\nI’m a proud homer for Arizona wine. If I were some kind of expert, I’d tell you about the terroir and the technique and the what all, but I’m not. What I love about Arizona wine (besides the fact that it tastes good) is that the people who make it are so generous and welcoming. At Chateau Tumbleweed in Clarkdale, a winemaker poured for me and offered samples of wines not on the tasting menu. At the Southwest Wine Center in Clarkdale, where Yavapai College students do everything, the tasting-room manager once gave me a behind-the-scenes tour because it was a slow day. And I can’t count all the times I’ve been told, if you like this wine, you should try so-and-so’s down the street. Arizona’s wine industry feels like a true community, and we need all the community we can get these days.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nOur sports teams are perfectly mediocre\n\nEver wonder what it’s like to be part of a dynasty? Home to a consistent winner? In Arizona we don’t have to worry about that — and it’s kind of nice. Yes, the Arizona Diamondbacks won a World Series ... in 2001. The Phoenix Mercury have won three WNBA championships, but none since 2014. The once-proud Phoenix Suns were a fun bubble team but not much more, and despite one trip to the Super Bowl, the Arizona Cardinals have a tradition of failure. (A tradition they may reverse this season; we’ll see.)\n\nSure, winning is great, but mediocrity ain’t bad. Fans of Arizona sports teams can invest the perfect amount of fanaticism into their favorites: a little, but not a lot. Cheer, but don’t obsess. We don’t have the stress of wondering how a favorite team will fare in the championship game, because we so rarely get there. Enjoy!\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nThe calm of biking Valley canal paths\n\nI’m thankful for the multi-use paths along the canals that criss-cross the Valley. In particular, for the paths along the Western and Consolidated canals. I began to ride my bike more often when things started to shut down due to the pandemic. Before that I’d just ride occasionally on weekends, but when I started working from home, I’d get on my bike and ride to clear my head after work. It was a way to work up a sweat once the gyms closed, but soon it just became something I enjoyed doing. I started riding in the neighborhood but wanted to get in a more miles each day. I don’t have the faith in humanity – or drivers – necessary to feel comfortable riding long distances on busy streets, so I like to take to the paths along the canals. You can ride up to a mile in some places before you have to cross a major street, and there’s something calming about being able to ride along the water.\n\n— Weldon Johnson\n\nLandscapes are so beautiful they look like paintings\n\nI first visited the Grand Canyon 12 years ago for spring break when I was a geology student on the East Coast. It was my first time going west of central North Carolina, and one of my professors warned me that the size of the Grand Canyon might shock me because I had never laid eyes on something so vast in my entire life.\n\nHe was correct — all I could think when I first stepped up to the ice- and snow-covered South Rim of the canyon was that it looked like a painting. My ears filled with quiet in a way I had never experienced before. It is no surprise artists have been inspired by this geologic wonder for centuries. If ever lacking inspiration, I recommend everyone snap a photo of their favorite Arizona rock formations at the golden hour near sunset. Now that I live in Arizona, I remind myself to never stop being thankful that I have the chance to see the glowing red rocks of Sedona or the verdant green forests of the Mogollon Rim any time I want.\n\n— Shaena Montanari\n\nCurbside pickup is everywhere, even the library\n\nI'm still daydreaming about the leisurely Sunday afternoons I used to spend wandering up and down the aisles of ​Burton Barr Central Library. But the silver lining to the library's ongoing closure is that many Valley branches have reopened to offer curbside pick up so bookworms can still get their fix without having to leave the comfort of their cars. The system is remarkably easy to use: Anyone with a library account can go online, find and select the books they want to borrow, and the library will send an email when they're ready to pick up. Then you just pull up out front, call to let the library staff know you're outside and someone will run the stack out to your car.\n\n— Lauren Saria\n\nAlice Cooper is our resident rock legend\n\nI discovered Alice Cooper as a preteen Catholic schoolboy of the 1970s. With his macabre theatrics and darkly comic portrait of an anti-social antihero on the edge, this was peak Alice when it came to striking fear into the hearts of the middle American PTA and, more specifically, the woman I call \"mom.\"\n\nWhich is to say my inner 12-year-old was thrilled when I moved to Phoenix, where Cooper is not only part of the cultural fabric as our resident rock legend but an actual pillar of the community, holding an annual Christmas Pudding concert to build and operate the Solid Rock Teen Center, offering free music, arts and dance programming to kids from 12 to 20. Cooper oversees the center with his wife of more than 40 years, Sheryl Cooper. Bonus points for increasingly frequent reunions with the other three surviving members of the classic Cooper group.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nI found boba that reminds me of home\n\nOne ritual has remained a constant for me, pandemic or not: finding good milk tea boba — aka bubble tea or tapioca milk tea — even if it means an hour in the car.\n\nI schedule my Saturday errands around getting a cup of milk tea with chewy tapioca balls sitting at the bottom that require a big straw to sip up. Why go to such lengths? Because it’s delicious — depending on where in metro Phoenix you get it from, of course — and it reminds me of home.\n\nFrom enjoying boba slushies as an occasional treat from my mom in middle school to grabbing milk tea boba as a coffee alternative on my way to class in college, having boba tea is a comforting ritual for me. And places like Aloha Tea and Coffee in Glendale and Tea Swirl in Tempe have helped me satisfy my cravings and have a feeling of normalcy in these unprecedented times.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nInnovative theaters went virtual\n\nIt has been inspiring to have a front row seat as artists tenaciously thrive this year. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced Valley theaters to postpone entire seasons and cancel shows. So when 12 Arizona theater groups came together in July for a virtual show called “The 24 Hour Plays: Viral Monologues,” it gave us hope.\n\nWriters had less than 24 hours to create a monologue for an actor who had even less time to record their portrayal. The videos were posted on Instagram and the result was truly brilliant. In a year when so much feels unknown, those 24 hours made things feel a little normal. I’m thankful to see the Arizona theater community’s talent thrive under unprecedented pressure.\n\n— Elizabeth Montgomery\n\nPhoenix’s indie boutiques make shopping local easy\n\nThe need to shop locally has never felt so urgent. Here in Phoenix, though, patronizing independent boutiques is more of a joy than an obligation. Why? Because our neighbors have really good taste.\n\nPhoenix General, born from a pair of downtown stalwarts, offered comfort in incense, textiles and artist-made masks. Vintage go-to Antique Sugar served kaleidoscopic sweetness and some delightfully tart takes on Instagram. Bunky Boutique and Frances kept the spotlight on desert-inspired wares and wearables, while Noons and Local Nomad respectively blessed the timeline with art-inflected style and a sun-bleached state of mind.\n\nIn the year of WFH, when wearing something more elevated than sweatpants proved challenging and, honestly, pretty pointless, these shops helped us find fun in fashion, self-expression and supporting each other.\n\n— Becky Bartkowski\n\nYou can road trip all over the state\n\nIn 24 years of living in Arizona, I’ve never been more thankful for the ability to take a road trip. Drive a couple of hours in any direction and you can have whatever outdoors experience you want – active or laid-back – and as far from people as you want to get. Hiking near Greer, Flagstaff and at the North Rim of Grand Canyon, I saw a kaleidoscope of leaves turning on aspens, cottonwoods, maples and oaks. While kayaking the Colorado River above Lees Ferry, I was mesmerized watching trout jump and the underwater plants undulating in the current. And at the end of the day, easing into the hammock I strung between two trees felt like heaven.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nArizonans care about wildlife\n\nI’m thankful that the state has an array of stunning wildlife to observe such as mountain lions, coatis, tarantulas and snakes—and I’m thankful for the people who take care of wildlife-in-need at the Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center, Phoenix Herpetological Society and Liberty Wildlife.\n\nThe Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center rescues and rehabilitates hundreds of animals each year and releases the majority of them back into the wild. While the Center deals mostly with mammals, scaly creatures get the care and attention they need at the Phoenix Herpetological Society. This year, they nursed a severely injured Gila monster back to health and regularly take care of hundreds of tortoises that people cast off once the pets get too large.\n\n— Shaena Montanari\n\nSky Harbor's a hub for local food and drink\n\nA quick confession: Whenever I have a flight that leaves out of the D gates at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, my heart flutters with excitement. On the way toward the gate, I make a hard right to Le Grand Orange and grab a salted chocolate chip cookie for the flight.\n\nIf I was completely honest, a few times I’ve even walked from distant gates just to buy one cookie for myself, and another for the friend picking me up at the airport on the other side.\n\nThough the D gate is my favorite stop, at Sky Harbor, every gate has a local treasure that’s one of the contributing factors to Phoenix consistently leading the nation for having the best airport in America.\n\nSo, whether you decide to splurge on the onion soup at Zinc Brasserie, grab some guac at Barrio or pass the wait with a beer at O.H.S.O., give thanks that Phoenix has a robust local food scene at the airport.\n\n— Melissa Yeager\n\nIt's easy to grill pretty much any time\n\nOne thing I’ve always loved about living in Arizona, at least this part of the state, is that you can barbecue year-round. That’s not something you can say everywhere. If you’ve ever tried to work the grill when it’s 15 degrees outside in January (I come from Michigan), you know what I mean. Here, that’s not an issue. Yes, you’ll want a cool drink and a fan – maybe a mister – in the heat of summer. You might need a light jacket during what passes for winter around here. But whether you want to throw on a few quick steaks or burgers or you’re looking at spending hours smoking ribs or a Thanksgiving turkey, grilling is no problem. And you won’t have to brush six inches of snow off of it before you can get started either.\n\n— Weldon Johnson\n\nThis pit bull rescue cares for dogs like mine\n\nIn October I took Yolanda, a hefty 8-year-old pit bull, home to her new palace. I like to think I’ve given her a good life: a couch to snore on, a backyard to hide her chews, a garden hose to pounce on. I also think about the neighbors she left behind at the animal shelter, whose futures are uncertain. Some may never get adopted. That’s why I appreciate One Love Pit Bull Foundation, a Mesa-based nonprofit that offers free training classes for pit bull owners and sponsors at-risk or longtime shelter dogs. Maricopa County Animal Care is overwhelmed with significantly more pit bulls than any other type. I’m thankful for the people at One Love who are helping Yoli’s former shelter mates find loving families that can give them each the couch, backyard and garden hose they deserve.\n\n— Priscilla Totiyapungprasert\n\nWe have year-round farmers markets\n\nWhen I tell family in other parts of the country that I went Christmas shopping at my local farmers market, they find it hard to imagine. Pop-up tents, fresh produce and local artisans selling wares are mere memories of warmer summer days. But here in Phoenix, farmers markets are a year-round treat.\n\nNot only do farm-fresh apples make for better holiday pies and local honeys add a perfect touch to winter desserts, there are many gifts to be found at Valley farmers markets from handmade pasta and jam to unique jewelry and sweet smelling soaps. While the rest of my family battles the cold, I am thankful for cool mornings, hot coffee and a stroll through the farmers market.\n\n— Tirion Morris\n\nThree words: Changing Hands Bookstore\n\nA city’s not a real city unless it has a great independent bookstore. Sorry, that’s the rule. Happily Phoenix has one (Tempe, too): Changing Hands Bookstore. It’s been around since 1974, and it hits all the right notes required of a great bookstore: fantastic selection, employees who know what’s what about books and, most importantly, a welcoming vibe for like-minded people — which is to say, people who love to read.\n\nThe Phoenix location boasts the First Draft Book Bar, which is cool, and there are frequent author events at both stores, but really all that is just gravy. The reason Changing Hands is an Arizona landmark is because of the books — the words, page by page on the shelves, ready to be thumbed through, scanned, considered, purchased or put back, then on to the next one. There’s something inspiring about spending time there — it’s relaxing but uplifting, like any great bookstore should be.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOur natural wine scene is thriving\n\nThe natural wine trend arrived in other cities years ago, but 2020 was the year pét-nats and orange wines finally had their moment in metro Phoenix. And just in time, too. Getting through months of staying home was all the more bearable with a glass of glou glou. Thank goodness for online ordering and curbside pick up from downtown Phoenix's O.G. natural wine shop Sauvage and Hidden Track Wine Shop, a local favorite with a sizeable selection of low intervention wines. Plus with $5 delivery from Arcadia Premium, which started stocking some affordable natural options, nearby patrons no longer have to leave the house to get their hands on some crushable juice. Most recently, the Melrose neighborhood welcomed new bottle shop the Montecito into the mix, which offers a fridge full of pét-nat — and a nice selection of sour beers for those who love funk.\n\n— Lauren Saria\n\nSouth Mountain Park is the perfect escape\n\nDespite searing heat for a big chunk of the year, Arizonans are thought of as an outdoorsy bunch. Show us a good trail and we’ll hike it. And South Mountain Park — the largest municipal park in the United States — is dotted with them. All levels of difficulty are available, whether you are a beginner or an expert. Whatever trail you choose — Warpaint, Pima Canyon, Kiwanis, Mormon and Marcos de Niza are some personal favorites — you’ll find something to recommend it. No, there aren’t Sedona-level jaw-dropping views, but there are eye-opening ones. Best of all, this really is a city park, a short drive from just about anywhere in the Valley. It’s no exaggeration to say that one minute you’re in the middle of hustle and bustle and the next you are out in the desert. That’s not just an escape. That’s magic.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nThe music scene is a patchwork quilt\n\nEvery year without fail since I moved here from Pittsburgh in 2006, a fairly shocking number of my favorite records of the year have been made by Arizona artists. Phoenix is a thriving patchwork quilt of local music scenes within a scene, producing an astonishing variety of sounds, from punk to hip-hop, straight-up rock 'n' roll, blues, country, jazz and Afrobeat.\n\nIn simpler times, you could go see your favorite local artists live in some really cool venues, from the Lost Leaf to Last Exit Live, the Nash, the Rebel Lounge and Crescent Ballroom (among many others).\n\nUntil concerts return, I'm bingeing on recent recordings by some of my favorites: Playboy Manbaby's \"Debbie From Zumba\" EP, AJJ's \"Good Luck Everybody,\" Mega Ran's \"Two Hands Up,\" Injury Reserve's self-titled album, Sundressed's \"Home Remedy,\" the Darts' \"I Like You But Not Like That\" and Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra's \"Laugh to Keep From Crying.\"\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nWinter patio weather is a thing\n\nThere’s no question the summer heat can be brutal. Misters and fans do their best, but the heat can make sitting outside an uncomfortable option. As the sun cooks the pavement, we hide indoors with the AC cranked and wait while the summer, and a good chunk of fall, pass by.\n\nBut here in the desert, winter washes over slowly, with words of encouragement. We did it, we made it through the hottest summer on record and now winter weather is our reward. It’s time to celebrate with an ice cold beer or a fresh margarita on the patio. And this year in particular, as experts continue to recommend opting outside to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, Phoenix’s warm winter weather is something to be thankful for. While many around the country shovel snow, we can dust off the chairs and wind up the umbrella. Flowers are blooming, winter is here and it’s beer garden time. To that, I say cheers.\n\n— Tirion Morris\n\nDark skies initiatives keep the heavens unfiltered\n\nOn my feet for more than 13 hours, I was still more than 2 miles from the top of the South Rim when the sun began to set over the Grand Canyon. I had hoped by that time to be at the rim, watching a sinking orange glow highlight the path I had trekked from rim to rim. Instead, I was in the dark, struggling through the final miles of a difficult hike.\n\nFrustrated and exhausted, I sat down on a rock on the side of the trail to rest for a moment. When I looked up at the sky above me, an awe-inspiring sight breathed new life into me.\n\nA canopy of millions of stars, free from the light pollution of the city, danced above my head. The remorse of a missed sunset now quickly replaced with gratitude for this unexpected treat. From Flagstaff to Sedona, Arizona’s commitment to dark skies initiatives allows us all to see the heavens unfiltered.\n\n— Melissa Yeager\n\nReach the editor at rbartkowsk@gannett.com.
