So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Molotov cocktails and personal arms. See how Ukrainians are fighting back 02:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Zelensky called on citizens of the world also to join the fight against the “Russian war criminals.”\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend. Russian authorities have detained a total of 4,862 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country since the invasion of Ukraine was ordered independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová Laura Smith-Spark Julia Hollingsworth", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-security-council-intl/index.html", "title": "Crimea bridge explosion: Putin to chair Russia Security Council ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will hold an operational meeting of his Security Council on Monday, just two days after a massive explosion on a key strategic bridge linking Crimea and Russia.\n\nThe meeting itself isn’t out of the ordinary – Putin regularly holds operational meetings with the Security Council, usually on a weekly basis, according to TASS. However, it comes just days after a major humiliation for the Russian President, when an explosion severely damaged parts of the road and rail bridge between annexed Crimea and the Russian Federation early Saturday.\n\nAnd while the agenda has not been made public, the meeting comes at a strategic crossroads for the Kremlin, which must make a series of unenviable choices after Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has faltered after a month of military setbacks.\n\nSome road traffic and train traffic has resumed on the estimated $3.7 billion bridge. On Saturday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said repair works on the bridge would be carried out around the clock, with a damage survey to be completed within a day and divers scheduled to check all the supports of the bridge.\n\nThe first passenger services resumed travel across the bridge on Saturday, traveling from the Crimean Peninsula to Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia, Russia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement.\n\nCar traffic on the bridge has also restarted in two lanes, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Marat Khusnullin said on Sunday. “Traffic has already been launched along two lanes on the Crimean bridge,” he wrote in a Telegram post, adding that earlier, one lane was being used for cars traveling in alternate directions, slowing down traffic. Heavy trucks, vans and buses have been traveling by ferry since the blast.\n\nKyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast on the enormous 19-kilometer (about 12-mile) bridge, which was built after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, an annexation regarded by the West as illegal.” The crossing was opened by Putin himself in 2018, and Ukrainian reaction to the explosion has been gleeful and triumphant.\n\nPutin called the explosions on the Crimean bridge a “terrorist attack” and said the organizers and executors were “Ukrainian special services.”\n\n“Here, as reported, we have no doubts that this is a terrorist attack aimed at the destruction of the critical infrastructure of Russian Federation. And authors, executors, and masterminds are the secret services of Ukraine,” Putin said during a meeting with Chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin on Sunday.\n\nA round of Russian missile strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed 13 people early Sunday, including one child, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.\n\nAt least 89 civilians, including 11 children, were injured, Oleksandr Starukh, head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said Sunday.\n\nAccording to Tymoshenko, the rescue and search operations are still ongoing, they continue to get people out from under the rubble.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday dismissed the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in retaliation for the explosion on the bridge, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported.\n\nPeskov was asked by RIA whether the attack on the bridge could trigger an activation of Russia’s nuclear doctrine because it was “aimed at destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation.”\n\n“No. It’s a completely wrong formulation of the question,” Peskov said.\n\nUkraine’s military has been making dramatic advances in a counteroffensive – the Ukrainian military has recaptured 2,400 square kilometers of territory in Kherson region in the south of the country “since the beginning of the full-scale war,” a senior Ukrainian official said Friday, and Ukrainian troops are preparing for further advances into Russian-held Luhansk in the east, according to Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk region’s Ukrainian military administration.\n\nHayday acknowledged photographs of Ukrainian troops outside the Luhansk village of Stelmakhivka, less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the crucial post of Svatove.\n\nBut with a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive comes concerns Putin will escalate Russia’s war in Ukraine, with US President Joe Biden expressing fears of the possible use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n“First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,” Biden warned during remarks at a Democratic fundraiser in New York on Friday.\n\nHe added: “I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.”", "authors": ["Darya Tarasova Amy Woodyatt", "Darya Tarasova", "Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/01/mister-rogers-civics-education-fishy-promotion-news-around-states/49308903/", "title": "Mister Rogers, civics education: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican-led committees in the Legislature advanced new congressional, legislative and school board districts Friday as lawmakers try to get new maps in place in time for the 2022 election. The House State Government Committee voted along party lines to approve new lines for the state’s seven congressional districts and 105 districts in the Alabama House of Representatives. Democrats, who voted against the plans, raised concerns that the proposed lines don’t reflect a state that has grown more diverse and would pack their supporters into a single congressional district. And while the plan passed with GOP support, several Republicans expressed concern that their legislative districts had been sacrificed for other party priorities. The maps, along with Alabama Senate and Board of Education districts, are in line for votes Monday by the full Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate. Democrats have argued that Alabama, whose population is about 26% Black, should have a second congressional district with a significant African American or minority population. The seven-member delegation has for decades included a single African American, elected from the only district with a majority-Black population. The district is now represented by Rep. Terri Sewell, who’s also the only Democrat in Alabama’s congressional delegation.\n\nAlaska\n\nSoldotna: The city wants to create a new “main street” running parallel to the Kenai River. City officials on Thursday applied for a $360,000 federal grant that they hope would fund planning for the project that is also expected to boost capital investment in the area, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The planning project is estimated to take about 18 months and would help with efforts to design a new “main street” adjacent to the river. It would address about 85 acres of land running along the Kenai River, from Soldotna Creek Park to the Sterling Highway bridge. Many of the riverfront properties are privately owned, and development would require private and public partnerships. Currently, there is no road or trail that offers developed public access or views of the Kenai River between the highway bridge and state-owned land. Three dead-end roads stop short of the river. “Based on the number of no trespassing signs in many places the river today is more of an attractive nuisance than an asset,” city documents say. City officials informed City Council members that previous discussions with landowners indicated their support for collecting more information to determine the project’s feasibility. If approved, funding for the grant would come from the American Rescue Plan. Soldotna has already spent $90,000 of its own funds on the project.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly five years after Joe Arpaio was voted out as sheriff of Maricopa County, taxpayers are covering one of the last major bills from the thousands of lawsuits the lawman’s headline-grabbing tactics inspired – and the overall legal tab has hit $100 million. County officials agreed last month to pay $3.1 million to cover the county’s portion of a settlement with a restaurant owner who alleged Arpaio defamed him and violated his rights when raiding his businesses. The payout boosted the cost stemming from Arpaio’s six terms to $100 million for attorney fees, settlements and other costs the county has paid from lawsuits over things such as jail deaths, failed investigations of the sheriff’s political enemies and immigration raids of businesses. That doesn’t include the separate $178 million and counting taxpayers have shelled out in a 2007 racial profiling case stemming from Arpaio’s signature traffic patrols targeting immigrants, though about 75% of that spending has occurred during his successor’s watch as he works to comply with court-ordered overhauls of the sheriff’s office. Advocates for immigrants have long warned Arpaio should be viewed as a cautionary tale for the long-term financial obligations communities take on when they let local police officers handle immigration enforcement.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A special election will be called to fill the term of Republican state Sen. Lance Eads, who resigned from his position Thursday to take a job in the private sector. Eads, who won reelection last year to a four-year term, represented a district in northwest Arkansas that includes Springdale and parts of eastern Washington County. He said he was resigning to take a consultant job with the Little Rock-based lobbying firm Capitol Consulting Firm. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports Eads will remain a resident of northwest Arkansas. Eads served two years in the House of Representatives before first winning election to the Senate in 2016. Gov. Asa Hutchinson must call a special election to fill the vacancy in the Senate. “Sen. Lance Eads has served his community well,” Hutchinson said Thursday. “He has been a good partner in the successes we have achieved in Arkansas from economic development to lowering taxes.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nNewport Beach: Four weeks after an oil spill washed blobs of crude onto Southern California’s coast, surfers have returned to the waves, and people play in the surf. But fishermen still can’t drop lines in the same waters. California has prohibited fishing in an area that ranges about 6 to 12 miles off the shores of Orange County since an undersea pipeline leaked at least about 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. State environmental health experts are conducting studies to determine whether shellfish and fish are safe for human consumption – a process expected to take weeks or longer. Scott Breneman, owner of West Caught Fish, said he still fishes for tuna and black cod well beyond the prohibited area. He said he’s been able to keep selling his catch to restaurants, but customers aren’t buying like they usually do at a popular Newport Beach fish market because of concerns about the state fishing ban. “People assume that local fish is contaminated, and we’re fishing like 90 miles off the beach here, a long ways away,” Breneman said, adding that he’s heading out fishing about half as much as usual. “I don’t want to take the resource when I can’t sell it.” Commercial fishermen and charter operators have been hit especially hard. Some have joined lawsuits against pipeline owner Amplify Energy of Houston and worry about lingering effects on tourism.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A former long-shot Idaho gubernatorial candidate on trial in the 1984 killing of a 12-year-old Colorado girl has testified that he did not know the girl or her family before she vanished and denied being involved in her disappearance. At the time, Steve Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle Matthew and her family in Greeley, about 50 miles north of Denver. The girl’s remains were found by oil and gas workers in 2019. She had been fatally shot. Pankey was charged with Jonelle’s murder last year after showing extreme interest in the case for many years and allegedly sharing details with investigators that had not been made public. Pankey said in court that he pretended to know information about the case out of bitterness for police and for his former church and former employer, both of which he wanted investigated, KCNC-TV reports. Most of his testimony Thursday to questions by his lawyer was rambling and included comments about his hatred of racist police officers. District Attorney Michael J. Rourke pressed him about his views about police, which Pankey said came from seeing officers humiliate and hurt Hispanic people while he was working for an ambulance service in California. Pankey said he refused to put a splint on a sheriff’s deputy who broke his leg, letting the deputy ride to the hospital in pain. He said the deputy screamed for eight or 12 minutes. “I sat there and watched,” Pankey said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: The state’s attorney general is investigating the closure of Quinnipiac University’s Great Irish Hunger Museum, which shut its doors permanently in August after nine years dedicated to study of what’s commonly known as the Irish potato famine. Attorney General William Tong’s spokesperson Elizabeth Benton confirmed the probe to the New Haven Register on Thursday, saying in a statement that “we have an open and ongoing inquiry into this matter.” Tong took up the investigation after a lawyer representing an organization dedicated to saving the Hamden museum sent a letter to his office, raising concerns about the prospect of museum artifacts being sold off. The group, the Committee to Save the Great Irish Hunger Museum, was planning a “salute to the museum” Saturday with Irish dancing, food and treats. A Quinnipiac spokesperson told the Register that the university is “not selling any” items and that it’s committed to finding a way to ensure the collection “remains publicly accessible, advances the museum’s original mission, and preserves the story of the Great Hunger.” Morgan said the university is cooperating with the attorney general’s inquiry. Morgan said Quinnipiac decided to close the museum because of funding shortfalls and a lack of interest from visitors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Lawmakers in the state House don’t have enough votes to petition the governor to remove indicted Auditor Kathy McGuiness, who refuses to step down or take a leave of absence while she faces an indictment for alleged abuse of office. Instead, they appear to prefer a proposal from the Senate to ask the courts for advice on how to execute the constitutional law that sanctions the removal process, which has not been touched in living memory. Meanwhile, a judge ruled Thursday that McGuiness must be provided a public defender or pay for her own private attorney to fight criminal corruption charges. The ruling settles a conflict between McGuiness and Delaware prosecutors, who argued that McGuiness, by virtue of her public office, was entitled to a public defender, not her choice of a more expensive, private attorney to be funded by the public. McGuiness faces two felony charges and multiple public corruption misdemeanors, all of which carry the potential of more than 10 years in prison. Specifically, she is accused of giving her daughter a do-little job in the auditor’s office, rigging state contracts to avoid regulatory scrutiny and intimidating those who questioned her behavior, according to an indictment filed against her last month.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ahead of the holiday season, the National Park Service planted a new National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse in President’s Park on Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The new tree is a 27-foot white fir from Middleburg, Pennsylvania, the park service said in a release. Donated by Hill View Christmas Tree Farm, it will be the first white fir to serve as the National Christmas Tree. Since 1973, the National Christmas Tree has been a living tree that people can view year-round at President’s Park. The National Park Service said a white fir was selected because it is more resilient to needle cast disease, a fungal issue that affects spruce trees and causes their needles to fall off. The previous tree, a Colorado blue spruce planted in October 2019, succumbed to needle cast disease, according to the National Park Service. NPS officials say transporting and taking care of such a large tree can be challenging and requires careful planning and mild weather conditions. Late October is an ideal time for planting, but there is still a chance for transplant shock, experts say. NPS horticulturists will keep an eye on the tree’s health and ensure its transition is as easy as possible. The tree will be lit up during the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, details of which have not been announced yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nWinter Park: A little rain didn’t stop it from being a beautiful day at Rollins College as school officials unveiled a sculpture honoring alumnus and beloved children’s TV host Mister Rogers. Rollins President Grant Cornwell and others held umbrellas during Thursday’s private ceremony as they pulled back a drape on the bronze rendering of Rogers in his iconic sweater and tennis shoes, a work entitled “A Beautiful Day for a Neighbor.” “This inspirational sculpture will be a permanent reminder of the ideals and values modeled by Mister Rogers as he set out to make the world a better place,” Cornwell said during the ceremony at the private liberal arts college in Winter Park, just northeast of Orlando. Years before the world came to know him as Mister Rogers, Fred McFeely Rogers transferred to Rollins College in 1948 and graduated in 1951, according to the school. He majored in music composition and served as president of his fraternity and chairman of the Inter-Faith and Race Relations Committee. He also met his future wife at the school. He received an honorary degree from the school in 1974. The 360-degree sculpture designed by Paul Day, a British artist known for his public monuments, depicts Rogers surrounded by children, hand puppets from his show, lyrics from the theme song for “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the show’s Neighborhood Trolley. The sculpture will be part of the school’s Mister Rogers Walking Tour.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Former residents of a Black neighborhood that was destroyed more than 50 years ago and replaced with university dorms and parking lots are demanding the university recognize their loss. The city used eminent domain to force Black families out of the Linnentown neighborhood in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal plan. It sold the land to the state Board of Regents, and dorms and parking lots for the University of Georgia went up after the homes were razed. Now, a group of former residents and descendants wants the university to apologize for the land seizure and create a memorial to Linnentown, which was home to dozens of Black families, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. One member of the Linnentown Project group, Bobby Crook, told the newspaper the university needs to pay compensation, though he acknowledged that may not happen. The average condemnation award for homes in the neighborhood was $5,750, according to a resolution approved by Athens-Clarke County commissioners in February. The land – roughly 20 acres – and the improvements on it are worth tens of millions of dollars today. The county resolution did not mince words, accusing the city and the University System of Georgia of “an act of institutionalized white racism and terrorism resulting in intergenerational Black poverty, dissolution of family units, and trauma through the forcible removal and displacement of Black families, and the accumulation of the majority of their wealth and political power within the University System of Georgia and the City of Athens.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKihei: A new high school on Maui won’t be welcoming students as planned next fall because the state Department of Education didn’t build a pedestrian bridge to the campus. The state Land Use Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to stick to its earlier decision to require the state to build the bridge over Piilani Highway to Kihei High School, Hawaii News Now reports. That means the school won’t be able to open for the fall 2022 semester. The busy highway separates the school from neighborhoods where many students live. Currently, public school students in Kihei are enrolled at Maui High School, which is overcrowded. There are some charter school options in the area. The commission in 2013 said either a pedestrian overpass or an underpass would be required for safety. “It’s a shame that this high school, which is almost built, will not be open on time,” said Dan Giovanni, the commission’s vice chairperson. “To me, the fault for that is the DOE.” A department spokesperson said the department is assessing its next steps. Department officials said the state Department of Transportation advised them that a pedestrian bridge was not yet necessary because only a few students were scheduled to start school in August 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers will gather this month to consider legislation banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates by the federal government and private employers, according to top lawmakers in the House and Senate. Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro Tem Chuck Winder said the chambers will likely return for several days Nov. 15. The House never officially adjourned, and it can reconvene if called by Bedke. Winder said he would recommend senators return as well. Bedke said he expects about a dozen pieces of legislation to be introduced, including some to prevent employers from requiring workers get vaccinated. He said lawmakers getting between the employee-employer relationship wasn’t his preference, but some lawmakers supported the idea. “The objective is to get all of the various ideas out into the public domain so that everyone can take a look at them, to start the process,” Bedke said. “I don’t know how many of them, if any of them, will get critical legislative mass, in our bicameral system, but we’ll see.” Both said lawmakers will look at legislation that would allow the state to initiate legal action over federal vaccine mandates on private employers. The legislation would include $2 million for a potential legal battle.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A conservation group has reached an agreement with a northern Illinois airport that temporarily halts work on a project that would destroy an 8,000-year-old tract of remnant prairie. The Bell Bowl Prairie, located on the Rockford Airport’s property, is targeted for demolition as part of a $50 million expansion of the airfield’s cargo operations. The prairie’s longtime stewards, the Natural Land Institute, sued the Greater Rockford Airport Authority last week, seeking injunctive relief to temporarily halt bulldozers from destroying the 25-acre prairie. The nonprofit conservation group announced Thursday that a deal putting that work on hold through March 1, 2022, had been reached through U.S. District Court with the Greater Rockford Airport Authority, its board of commissioners and executive director, WTTW-TV reports. Construction of an access road that would cut through the prairie’s highest-quality habitat had been slated to resume Monday. The temporary hold buys more time for the Natural Land Institute to convince the Airport Authority to explore alternative design concepts that protect the prairie and the endangered rusty patched bumblebee, the institute said in a statement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal appeals court has cleared the way for state officials to start enforcing a law requiring reports from doctors if they treat women for complications arising from abortions, even though the court said the law could be struck down in the future. Action by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last week followed a 2-1 ruling by a court panel in August upholding the law, which had been blocked by a judge shortly after it was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2018. The law lists 25 physical or psychological conditions – including unsuccessful abortions, infections, uterine perforations, depression and deaths – that could trigger the reporting requirement for doctors or clinics. It makes failure to do so a misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Planned Parenthood challenged the law in federal court, arguing that it was vague and would leave medical professionals uncertain in determining whether they needed to report conditions such as a patient’s anxiety or minor bleeding regardless of whether they believed it stemmed from the abortion. The Chicago-based appeals court last week turned down Planned Parenthood’s request for the full court to reconsider the case, and it issued an order Thursday allowing the law to go into effect.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A school board candidate changed his name following conviction on a threat of terrorism charge last year after he said he would shoot up a high school and sexually assault students. Christian Mathew Holtz, 20, of Ankeny, is one of seven candidates running in Tuesday’s election for school board in the Ankeny Community School District. His campaign has focused on addressing bullying, protecting marginalized groups and being a younger voice for students on the board, among other issues. Holtz has been running his campaign and participating in candidate forums as he remains on probation for the threat of terrorism charge, a felony, according to court records. In March 2020, Holtz – then known as Isaac Quinton Holtz – was charged in Dallas County District Court after police accused him of sending an email to more than 750 Waukee High School students and staff saying he planned to come to the school with a gun, shoot all the students, and go into the locker room to sexually assault and murder girls. According to a criminal complaint, police said he admitted to sending the email. Holtz entered an Alford plea, a type of guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges that the evidence would probably persuade a judge or jury otherwise. He was sentenced to three years of probation. Reached by phone Friday, Holtz would not directly confirm or deny he is the same person involved in that case. “It’s not me because I’m not Issac anymore,” Holtz said. “I’m Christian.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of people opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates rallied Saturday at the Statehouse and pushed state lawmakers to quickly counter them, while an international labor union disavowed a local leader’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust that killed millions of Jews. The rally kicked off ahead of a rare weekend legislative committee hearing on mandates from President Joe Biden that affect as many as 100 million Americans. The hearing gave dozens of mandate opponents a chance to vent their frustration and anger with the White House and with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s handling of the pandemic. Several critics of the mandates suggested Saturday that they violate international human rights standards enacted in the wake of atrocities during World War II. Bryan Luedeke, a Wichita-area aircraft worker, called them “reminiscent of Nazi Germany.” His comments followed Friday’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust by Cornell Beard, president of the Wichita district of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A committee member, Rep. Brenda Landwehr, R-Wichita, appeared to agree with the analogy.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that jails cannot force inmates to pay for their confinement if their criminal charges are dropped or if they are found not guilty. Ruling for a Winchester man who was billed more than $4,000 for his incarceration, even though a felony charge against him was dismissed, the court said inmates can only be charged if the payment is ordered by their sentencing judge. And because people who are acquitted or have charges dropped are never sentenced, they can’t be required to pay, the court said in a 12-page opinion Thursday. Greg Belzley, the attorney for David Allen Jones, said the ruling is a “huge” victory for the presumption of innocence. Belzley said he will ask that the ruling be applied to all inmates who are exonerated or have charges dropped, which could have serious financial implications for the commonwealth’s jails. “Jails are crumbling, but the way that gets addressed is through taxes, not by going after our poorest citizens,” he said. “We are delighted with the ruling.” The attorney for the Clark County Detention Center, Jeff Mando, had argued in a brief that the presumption of innocence does not apply to jail fees because they are not “punitive.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state Senate has created a special committee to dig into complaints about the use of excessive force by the State Police, after troopers were documented in a series of beatings of Black men that have drawn attention from federal investigators. Senate President Page Cortez said he set up the seven-member advisory panel in response to requests from senators concerned about troopers’ behavior. He sent a letter Thursday officially naming lawmakers to the committee. Two senators from Baton Rouge will lead the work: Republican Sen. Franklin Foil will be chairman, and Democratic Sen. Cleo Fields will work as vice chairman. Foil intends to hold the panel’s first meeting in December, he said, and expects the committee to hear from the State Police and the public with an eye toward developing recommendations for tightened laws regarding use of force that legislators can consider. The review will focus more on overall policies, rather than specific allegations of improper force, he said. The Senate Select Committee on State Police Oversight will “go over what kind of oversight the State Police has when there are reports of excessive force that may have been used inappropriately and what mechanisms they have as far as safeguards,” said Foil, a lawyer and Navy officer who has worked as a military judge.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Health care centers are facing a staffing crunch, but COVID-19 vaccination mandates are not the cause, according to the chief of the largest health network in the state. MaineHealth CEO Andrew Mueller said the organization has a staff vacancy rate of about 10% and described that level of staffing loss as “really, really difficult” for the organization, especially at a time when hospitals are full. However, he said, the shortage can be attributed to an aging workforce and workers leaving the industry because of the stress of working during the pandemic. The deadline to begin enforcing the vaccine requirement for health care workers across the state arrived Friday. Mueller had said that he expected to lose 1.5% to 2% of staff systemwide but that those losses would be offset by fewer COVID-19-related absences. “We actually think we’re going to have more capability and less shortages in a real way by ensuring our workforce is vaccinated,” he said last week. Meanwhile, Northern Light Health announced that unvaccinated workers would no longer be working at its 10 hospitals as of Saturday. In Lewiston, Central Maine Medical Center was already in compliance, with unvaccinated staff members not allowed to work.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state lawmaker who is a plastic surgeon has been fined $15,000 and reprimanded for twice participating in legislative meetings via videoconference from an operating room during surgery. Del. Terri Hill signed a consent order last month agreeing to the disciplinary actions from the Maryland Board of Physicians, which found the Democratic lawmaker guilty of “unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.” The board noted that Hill participated in one voting session of a House committee while appearing in a video feed wearing “a surgical gown, facemask, and surgical cap.” In Maryland’s legislative session this year, legislative committee meetings were held by videoconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The public was able to livestream the meetings and hearings. “She was positioned under the surgical lights, focused downward, and would occasionally shift, reach for surgical instruments, or adjust the lights,” the board’s report said, noting the surgeon and other operating room staff “occasionally moved surgical equipment and blood-stained towels so that they were briefly visible on the video feed.” In a statement Friday night, Hill said she has worked hard to fulfill her professional obligations to both her patients and her constituents during the pandemic – a balance that has been challenging at times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Students will have greater access to school meals under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The new law requires schools or districts to implement universal free breakfast and lunch for all students if a majority of students in the school meet low-income criteria. The law also bars school employees or volunteers from publicly identifying a student when payment for a meal hasn’t been received. Denying a student a meal as a form of punishment for bad behavior or disposing of an already served meal because of a student’s unresolved meal debt is also banned. Schools will also be prevented from denying a student or their sibling the chance to participate in non-fee-based extracurricular activities because of meal debt; prohibiting a student from receiving grades, transcripts, report cards or graduating as a result of meal debt; or requiring a parent or guardian to pay additional fees or interest costs above the amount owed for meals. “This legislation is another way we can ensure all children in the commonwealth have access to healthy meals when they are in school,” Baker said after signing the bill last Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: As promised, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-sponsored legislation that would toughen in-person voter identification rules and require people to include additional information such as their driver’s license number on absentee ballot applications. The governor said the bills would disproportionately hurt minority voters who are more likely not to have a photo ID on Election Day than white voters. They also would prohibit the secretary of state and clerks from mailing absentee ballot applications unless voters request them and ban private donations to help administer elections. “Voting restrictions that produce such a racially disparate impact must never become law in this state,” Whitmer wrote to lawmakers. A GOP-affiliated ballot committee, Secure MI Vote, is circulating petitions that would enable the Republican-controlled Legislature to enact a similar initiative next year regardless of Whitmer’s opposition. In Michigan, voters who go to a polling place without a photo ID can cast a regular ballot if they sign an affidavit. More than 11,400 did so in the 2020 presidential election. Under the legislation, they would get a provisional ballot and have to verify their identity with the local clerk within six days of an election for their vote to count. The governor said the change would disenfranchise voters, and there is no evidence that affidavit ballots are related to voter fraud.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Sales at municipal liquor stores in the state soared in 2020 for a record-breaking year. Sales at Minnesota’s 213 “munis” jumped 10% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report released last week by State Auditor Julie Blaha. In recent years, a typical sales increase has been in the range of 1% to 3%. With many bars and restaurants either closed or operating at reduced capacity during parts of the year, people did more of their drinking at home, according to liquor store managers and employees. And the lifestyle shifts prompted by the pandemic played a major role. The Star Tribune reports the bars and liquor stores transferred more than $21 million back to their local governments in 2020, helping supplement traditional tax revenue. According to the International Wines and Spirits Record, Americans consumed 2% more alcohol last year than in 2019. It was the biggest year-over-year increase since 2002.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Retired NFL player Brett Favre and Mississippi Auditor Shad White feuded Friday over the auditor saying Favre failed to make speeches after being paid by welfare money. The Twitter spat happened days after Favre repaid $600,000 to the state – the last portion of the $1.1 million that the auditor said Favre received from a nonprofit organization that used money intended to help needy people in one of the poorest states in the U.S. The auditor said Wednesday that Favre still owes $228,000 in interest, and the state attorney general could sue if that is not paid by mid-November. “Of course the money was returned because I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,” Favre wrote Friday. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback, who lives in Mississippi, wrote that he made commercials for which he was paid by a nonprofit group. White tweeted that Favre’s contract required speeches and a radio ad. “The CPA for Favre Enterprises confirmed this was your contract,” White replied to Favre. “You did not give the speeches. You have acknowledged this in statements to my agents.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Professional sports teams are trying to put a proposal to legalize sports betting in the state on the ballot, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. A Jefferson City lawyer filed nine ballot proposals on the issue last week on behalf of the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Blues, St. Louis City soccer club and Kansas City Royals. Money from taxing sports betting would be split between schools and roads under the proposals. Efforts to pass a law allowing sports betting have failed for years in Missouri’s GOP-led Legislature, so the teams are hoping to take the issue directly before voters. Republican Sen. Denny Hoskins has proposed several bills to legalize sports betting. But he warned that legalizing sports betting through the Missouri Constitution will mean lawmakers can’t easily address any potential issues with the program once it’s enacted. In Missouri, proposals need a certain number of voter signatures to be put on the ballot. Backers haven’t started collecting signatures yet.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental regulators ignored the law when they permitted an expansion of a massive strip mine that is the sole source of coal for a large power plant despite concerns about water pollution, a judge ruled. State District Judge Katherine Bidegaray ordered the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to revisit its 2015 permit to expand the 25,752-acre Rosebud Mine, owned by Colorado-based Westmoreland mining. The judge’s Thursday order came after environmental groups sued over damage to a nearby creek from wastewater that flows out of the mine. Rosebud, in the Powder River Basin along the Montana-Wyoming border, fuels the Colstrip Power Plant that burns about 8 million tons of coal annually. For years, nearby East Fork Armells Creek has received salty water from the mine and contaminants from coal ash ponds at the power plant, The Billings Gazette reports. The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act forbids the state from issuing mine permits unless it can be proven there won’t be damage to the balance of water outside the permit area. But Bidegaray said the state was doing the opposite – allowing harmful salt levels in Armells to increase. It’s unclear what the ruling means for mining operations, a Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Christian student group has sued the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, alleging that the school discriminated against the group’s views when it denied a funding request to bring a Christian philosopher to campus as a guest speaker. The federal lawsuit by the group Ratio Christi alleges that the university failed to distribute money to student groups in a fair, viewpoint-neutral manner, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The lawsuit says Ratio Christi requested $1,500 in January from the university’s Fund Allocation Committee, which it was entitled to do as a recognized student organization. The group wanted to bring in philosopher and former university professor Robert Audi, who is currently a philosophy professor at the University of Notre Dame. The students were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization that supports conservative Christian causes. The lawsuit alleges that the university’s program council told Ratio Christi it would need to invite another person from a different ideological perspective to the same event to receive funding. The school allegedly said it could not promote speakers of an ideological nature with its student organization funding, according to the lawsuit. In a statement Friday, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts called on university Chancellor Ronnie Green to intervene and define policies that encourage all viewpoints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hundreds of hotel, casino and restaurant workers in matching red shirts rallied Thursday on the Las Vegas Strip as the Culinary Union made a second monthly call to return people to jobs idled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Culinary Union said more than one-third of its 60,000 members haven’t been rehired, despite a recovery by casinos and hotels from closures imposed in March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “If companies are going to charge you the full rate, you want to make sure you get full service,” union President Ted Pappageorge said, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The message echoed calls made Sept. 24, when the Culinary Union organized a march of thousands of members on the Strip. Casinos statewide have ridden a tourism surge to set monthly winnings records, room rates have rebounded, and tourism officials report the number of visitors is approaching pre-pandemic levels. Nevada’s unemployment rate in September was 7.5%, down slightly from 7.7% in August. That’s more than twice the record low of 3.6% in February 2020 but far below the record peak of more than 30% set in April 2020 – a month after businesses and casinos were shuttered. The union says many idled employees have exhausted public unemployment benefits.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed its Homebound Vaccination program for COVID-19 shots. Appointments are being scheduled to provide first, second and booster doses of the vaccines to people who are unable to leave their homes, have difficulty doing so, or have been advised by a medical provider that their health could worsen by leaving their home. The state Department of Health and Human Services has contracted with On-Site Medical Services in Newport to conduct the program. Appointments can be made by calling (603) 338-9292 from Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., filling out a form at www.onsitenh.com/vaccine, or emailing vaccinations@on-sitemedservices.com.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEnglewood: An eatery offered Bergen County voters what some considered a great catch for participating in the democratic process, but others say something’s fishy with the promotion. If customers showed that they cast their ballot Friday or Saturday – presumably by displaying an “I voted” sticker – they were eligible for a free fried fish sandwich at TJ’s Southern Gourmet. A state statute on bribery says offering or receiving “money or other valuable consideration” to induce someone to vote or not vote “shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree.” The fried whiting sandwiches being offered by TJ’s – and the giveaway’s promotion by Teaneck school board member Victoria Fisher, who is up for reelection – is cause for concern for some people. Teaneck Councilman Keith Kaplan said Friday that he sent information about the fried fish sandwiches to Bergen County Superintendent of Elections Debra Francica and that he would send it to the state attorney general if needed. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the offer for free whiting, which typically sells for $8 and is described by reviewers as “fried to perfection.” Francica, however, said she had “checked with the AG’s office, and that’s legal.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Researchers say they have more evidence that Chaco Canyon was more than just an ancient gathering spot for Indigenous ceremonies and rituals. The researchers from the University of Cincinnati analyzed pollen content and the chemical composition of soils to help document environmental impacts of the early residents who called the area home. Their findings, published last week in the journal PLOS ONE, focus on changes resulting from tree harvesting that sustained daily life at Chaco. The researchers reported a gradual degradation of the surrounding woodlands beginning around 600 B.C., much earlier than previously thought. While some of the mysteries surrounding Chaco, now a national park and UNESCO World Heritage site, are still debated in academic circles, there’s agreement that the massive stone buildings, ceremonial structures called kivas and other features that dot the landscape offered a religious or ritualistic experience for the ancestors of today’s Native American pueblos. Many of Chaco’s structures are aligned with celestial events, such as the summer solstice. David Lentz, a biology professor and lead author of the study, said many researchers have the idea that Chaco was too arid to sustain day-to-day living and that the infrastructure built over many centuries at Chaco was used only as a periodic ceremonial center and storage facility. Lentz said that explanation is too simplistic, and his team turned up evidence to support human management of the area’s environment to support daily life.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Nine in 10 municipal workers received COVID-19 vaccinations as a Monday deadline loomed under a city mandate, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. City officials have been making contingency plans to deal with an expected staffing shortfall Monday. De Blasio tweeted Saturday night that 91% of city workers had received the vaccine, which represented a jump from about 83% as of Friday night. Under a city mandate, those who haven’t received at least one dose of a vaccine against the disease will be put on unpaid leave starting Monday, raising the possibility of shortages of police, fire and EMS workers. New York has more than 300,000 employees. The police department, which employs about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, reported an 84% vaccination rate as of Sunday morning, while roughly 2 in 10 of the fire department’s roughly 17,000 employees remained unvaccinated as of Friday night. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro denied reports that some firehouses had been closed due to shortages. “Irresponsible bogus sick leave by some of our members is creating a danger for New Yorkers and their fellow firefighters,” he said in a statement Sunday. And six Brooklyn-based firefighters angry with the mandate were pulled from duty and suspended after driving a fire truck to a state senator’s office and threatening his staff over the requirement, with which the lawmaker wasn’t involved.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Bus drivers for the state’s largest school system called in sick Friday to protest working conditions, prompting administrators to urge parents to arrange their own transportation and warn of similar problems this week. Officials with the Wake County Public School System said 400 of the 600 buses operated by the system were running, news outlets report. Bus drivers have said concerns about being overworked and underpaid haven’t been addressed. Many parents said their children walked to school, or they were driven to school when their buses didn’t show up. The Wake County system has 160,000 students, and up to half of them ride the bus in a normal year. Wake County Superintendent Cathy Moore and school board chairman Keith Sutton wrote in a message to staff members: “The pay and salary structure for the work we do is not adequate. Our bus drivers shone a harsh light on this reality.” Moore and Sutton also said many drivers have to run as many as six routes a day without receiving extra compensation. They said most school staffers are in the same situation. The system also told parents that bus service for Monday is uncertain and asked families to plan for that possibility.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday called a fall special session to deal with a limited agenda that includes legislative redistricting and the approval of a spending plan for federal coronavirus relief aid. The Nov. 8 special session approved by the governor through an executive order has no time restriction and may last indefinitely, though legislative leaders said they hoped it would only last five days. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner and GOP House Majority Leader Chet Pollert have been meeting with Burgum in recent weeks to discuss the possibility of a special session. They joined the governor at the Capitol in announcing the special session Friday. The North Dakota Constitution limits the Legislature to 80 days of meetings every two years, and last spring’s regular session used 76 days. That means if the GOP-led Legislature had called itself back into session, lawmakers would have had to shoehorn the redistricting job, pandemic spending and other proposed legislation into just four days. Each of those subjects would take a minimum of three legislative days to be approved by both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP leaders said all of the Legislature’s pending business could have been accomplished during a reconvened session, though they preferred the special session.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two Republican appointees to the Ohio State Board of Education resigned Friday, about two weeks after they opposed its decision to rescind an anti-racism resolution passed last summer. Board President Laura Kohler, of New Albany, told reporters that GOP Gov. Mike DeWine requested her resignation and that Republicans in the state Senate who didn’t like the resolution would’ve had enough votes to remove her if she didn’t step down. The resolution, passed by the board last summer after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, condemned racism and included an acknowledgment that “the path to equity begins with a deep understanding of the history of inequalities and inhumanity.” It talked about training board members and Department of Education employees to identify their own biases and recommended that districts reexamine areas such as curriculum and discipline strategies. In their resignation letters to DeWine, Kohler and board member Eric Poklar, of Worthington, didn’t specifically mention the anti-racism resolution or related controversy. Kohler told the governor she felt resigning was how she could “best support you and your work at this time.” Poklar wrote that his “time on the board has ended” and that he was ready to pass responsibilities to the next person.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: While medical experts say it’s unclear why a condemned inmate began convulsing and vomiting after the first of three drugs used to execute him was administered Thursday, all agree the dosage was massive compared with what’s standard in surgeries, with one doctor calling it “insane.” The state’s prisons agency is now likely to face new litigation, which may focus on the state’s description of the execution of John Marion Grant for the 1998 slaying of a prison cafeteria worker as “in accordance with” protocols. Grant, 60, convulsed and vomited after the sedative midazolam was administered. That drug was followed by two more: vecuronium bromide, a paralytic, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Thursday’s lethal injection ended a six-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma that was brought on by concerns over its execution methods, including prior use of midazolam. Oklahoma’s protocols call for administering 500 milligrams of the sedative. Arkansas and Ohio are among other states that use that dose of midazolam in executions. “It’s just an insane dose, and there’s probably no data on what that could cause,” said Jonathan Groner, an Ohio State University medical school surgery professor and lethal injection expert. He added that sedation does not increase as the dosage goes up. “There’s a reason these drugs are given by anesthesiologists and not prison guards,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s “badly damaged” reputation – marked by months of destructive protests, a homelessness crisis and record year of homicides – is hurting its standing, according to its main tourism promoter. Travel Portland, the tourism promotion group partly funded by taxes, presented data to the City Council and mayor last week showing the city has declined to its “lowest level” of being a likely destination for delegates to attend conferences. Just 64% of surveyed tourists said they would visit Portland again. “There’s an old old saying, ‘It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and you can ruin it in an instant.’ That’s true of cities, as it is people,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said in response to the Travel Portland data. “And we’re just going to have to commit to that long-term process of improving the safety and the livability and the economic prosperity of the city.” The liberal city had long been known nationally for its ambrosial food scene, craft breweries and nature-loving hipsters. But last year, it became the epicenter of racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. For months, a small downtown area was consumed by protests that often turned violent, with clashes between demonstrators and federal agents, plumes of tear gas, fireworks exploding in the streets and rubber bullets flying through the air. While Portland’s violent protests have largely eased, there are still outbreaks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Members of the city’s largest transit workers union reached a tentative contract agreement early Friday, averting a possible strike that threatened to bring elevated trains, buses and trolleys to a halt and leave thousands of children and educators without a way to get to school this week. The existing contract between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the 5,000-member Transport Workers Union Local 234 was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The tentative agreement announced by the union includes a two-year contract with a pay increase, a pandemic payment and parental leave for workers. “Our members are essential workers who move Philadelphia and who have risked their lives putting their own families at risk during this pandemic,” Willie Brown, Local 234 president, said in a statement praising Friday’s agreement. Members are scheduled to vote to ratify the contract next Friday. The union had voted Oct. 24 to authorize a worker walkout if an agreement couldn’t be reached. The union represents bus, trolley and elevated train operators, as well as mechanics and other staff. Union leadership had asked for a four-year contract with annual wage increases and a pandemic payment to compensate SEPTA workers who had served on the front lines of the pandemic, keeping public transportation moving for other essential workers. Nearly 800 members contracted COVID-19, and 11 TWU members died from COVID-19 or related complications, union leaders said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Students from the state are asking a federal appeals court to affirm that all public school students have a constitutional right to a civics education, saying that they aren’t taught how to meaningfully participate in a democratic and civil society and that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was a symptom of such ignorance. Students nationwide need to know how to participate in the political process, effectively exercise their constitutional rights, and learn skills like media literacy to distinguish accurate from false information, their lawyers argue. The plaintiffs have asked the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Boston, to reverse a lower court’s dismissal of the case, declare there’s a constitutional right to an adequate civics education, and send the case back to district court. Such a judicial declaration is urgently needed, their brief to the court argues, in light of the events of Jan. 6 that were carried out by “a mob motivated by a fundamental misunderstanding of the congressional role in counting electoral votes.” Oral arguments will be heard Monday. The defendants include Rhode Island’s governor, education commissioner, and other education authorities.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJenkinsville: An area near the town has been hit with multiple minor earthquakes over the past week, including the latest one Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey initially registered the early Sunday morning earthquake in Fairfield County at 2.2 magnitude but later edged up the intensity to 2.3, multiple news outlets report. It’s the sixth small earthquake in the area over a week, with three quakes recorded Thursday alone. The State newspaper reports the South Carolina Emergency Management Division is studying the seismic activity. Earthquakes that register less than 2.5 usually are too small to be felt.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Workers at a pork processing plant that was overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic say the company is no longer working in good faith. A spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers local union said the workers are “fed up” with injustices at their facilities after being on the front lines of the pandemic at the Smithfield plant for nearly two years. Local union president B.J. Motley said in a Friday release that the company is speeding up lines of production, verbally abusing employees, and neglecting social distancing and sanitary measures. “In consequence, we are seeing a record number of quits, injuries, grievances and overall unhappiness,” Motley said. “Our workers are tired, and their families are being affected by the heartlessness of the situation.” Jim Monroe, vice president of corporate affair for Smithfield, said in a statement that it’s the first time they have heard those concerns and that they disagree with the “portrayal of conditions” at the facility. The complaints come four months after the union agreed to a contract with Smithfield, which increased base pay, provided a bonus, and offered options of one to three weeks of leaves of absence and 15-minute breaks for employees working eight-hour shifts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The GOP-controlled General Assembly has signed off on a number of measures undercutting COVID-19 protections, while also begrudgingly backing off on threats to revoke businesses’ ability to enforce mask mandates. Lawmakers approved the slate of bills early Saturday while most Tennesseans were asleep, marking the second time the Legislature has recently advanced significant legislation in the middle of the night. Democratic lawmakers quickly criticized that their Republican lawmakers were willing to concede to concerns raised by influential businesses lobbyists but not those pointed out by school and health officials alarmed at other measures that advanced during the three-day special legislative session. On Friday, Gov. Bill Lee’s office confirmed Ford Motor Co. and other manufacturers had expressed concerns with several of the proposals being discussed during the special session. Lee had declined lawmakers’ requests to call a special session to address the coronavirus, forcing them to collect enough signatures to call the session without the governor. By Saturday, Lee thanked Republicans for taking up certain issues but held off from promising he would sign all of the bills into law.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Marcos: Local police officials refused to provide an escort for a Joe Biden campaign bus when it was surrounded by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on an interstate, an amended lawsuit filed over the 2020 encounter alleges. The updated lawsuit, filed Friday, included transcribed 911 audio recordings, The Texas Tribune reports. The suit alleges that law enforcement officers in San Marcos “privately laughed” and “joked about the victims and their distress” in the audio recordings. The city of San Marcos didn’t return a request for comment from the newspaper. A spokesperson previously said the city and the San Marcos Police Department would not comment because of the pending litigation. Videos shared on social media from Oct. 30, 2020, show a group of cars and pickup trucks – many adorned with large Trump flags – riding alongside the campaign bus as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin. The “Trump Train” at times boxed in the bus. At one point, one of the pickups collided with an SUV behind the bus. According to the transcriptions, a 911 dispatcher told one bus passenger to call back if the caller felt threatened. “Are you kidding me, ma’am?” the caller replied. “They’ve cut in on me multiple times. They’ve threatened my life on multiple occasions with vehicular collision.”\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: Zion National Park officials and national conservation leaders met at the Utah Outdoor Recreation Summit on Thursday to hold the first public engagement meeting for a new recreation management plan. The five-person panel discussed the East Zion Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project to develop the east side of the park in order to disperse visitors and protect the “last unprotected gateway to a national park in the continental United States.” “The regional recreational management planning process is not just a thing: It is a spirit, it is a community effort, and it needs to remain such if it’s to be successful,” said Kevin McLaws, the owner of Zion Mountain Ranch and of the land granted for the East Zion Initiative. During the summit, titled “Crafting a Community-Led Vision for Regional Recreation Management in Greater Zion,” leaders and attendees discussed “solutions to trip planning, visitor experience, dispersal, mobility, and economic opportunity” that the region faces, the summit’s website said. As Zion is the third-most-visited national park in the county, seeing over 4 million visitors per year, the park and nearby gateway communities have seen record-high visitation since last fall, putting strain on amenities, the environment, businesses, park staff and locals and causing crowding.\n\nVermont\n\nFairfax: Some school districts are using electric school buses this fall as part of a pilot project to test their effectiveness. Gov. Phil Scott and education leaders celebrated the introduction of four electric buses in Fairfax on Thursday, with more expected to arrive this month. The buses also being used by the Champlain Valley School District and the Barre Unified Union District will start using them this month. “We are beyond excited to add electric buses to our fleet,” said Justin Brown, middle school principal at Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax. “We all hope this paves the way for more ‘green’ transportation in our – and our kids’ – future.” The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately save school districts money, officials said. An emissions settlement with Volkswagen is funding most of the project. The school districts each get two buses. Bus driver Patsy Parker said the electric buses are quieter than diesel models, which she believes makes her young passengers quieter, too. The buses’ battery range has forced schools to reconsider some routes, particularly during cold weather, school officials said. “Where we would normally be able to go 120 miles a day, we’re limiting more to 60 or 70 miles a day because of the cold weather. But that’s what this pilot program is about,” Parker said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The anti-Donald Trump group The Lincoln Project took credit Friday for five people appearing with tiki torches at a campaign stop by the GOP candidate for governor – a stunt recalling white supremacists who descended on the city amid violence in 2017. Charlottesville TV station WVIR reports candidate Glenn Youngkin was inside a restaurant when the group dressed in matching hats, khakis and white button-down shirts appeared beside his campaign bus. The former private equity executive and political newcomer is in a close race against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe as Tuesday’s Election Day nears. Photos showed the group holding large tiki torches. Their appearance recalled two days of chaos in 2017, when white supremacists gathered for a “Unite the Right” rally ostensibly to protest the planned removal of a Confederate monument. The night before the planned rally, a group carrying tiki torches marched across the University of Virginia campus, clashing with a small group of anti-racist protesters. The next day, a car driven by a self-avowed white supremacist plowed into a crowd of peaceful counterprotesters, killing one and injuring dozens. McAuliffe staffers promoted a reporter’s tweet about the group’s appearance, using it to attack Youngkin and suggesting that those holding the torches were his supporters. Youngkin staffers then accused the McAuliffe campaign or Virginia Democrats of being involved, drawing disavowals from McAuliffe’s campaign.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: After more than 18 months of pandemic-driven eviction limits, Gov. Jay Inslee said he would allow the latest version of the state’s eviction moratorium to expire Sunday. The move opens the door for an influx of new eviction cases and tests key tenant protections for the first time since the pandemic upended the legal process last year. “We have to have some end to the moratorium. You can’t have an economy ultimately where just nobody pays rent,” Inslee said at a press conference last week, the Seattle Times reports. Soon after the coronavirus hit, Inslee used his emergency powers to halt most evictions. This fall, Inslee loosened the rules. He replaced the moratorium with a “bridge” proclamation that still stopped some evictions for nonpayment of rent in certain parts of the state but allowed evictions for other reasons. The expiration of that policy Sunday means landlords can seek more evictions of tenants who fell behind on rent during the pandemic, provided owners go through newly required steps such as offering the tenant a payment plan. Most evictions will still be halted in Seattle, Burien and Kenmore, where local lawmakers have passed their own eviction moratoriums to last through early 2022.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKenova: When COVID-19 vaccines first became available, Ric Griffith’s family-owned drugstore was among 250 mom-and-pop pharmacies that helped the state get off to the nation’s fastest start in vaccinating its residents. Republican Gov. Jim Justice went on national news shows to declare West Virginia – a place that regularly ranks near the bottom in many health indicators – “the diamond in the rough.” Nine months later, those days are a distant memory. Demand for the vaccine has almost dried up, the question of whether to get a shot has become a political hot button, and West Virginia’s vaccination rate has plummeted to the lowest among the states. The governor, who spent months preaching the virtues of the vaccine to reluctant West Virginians, is still doing that but also promoting a new law that would allow some exemptions to employer-imposed vaccination requirements. And shots are mostly sitting on shelves. “I’m afraid that while taking a victory lap, we discovered that there were more laps to go in the race,” Griffith, who is also a Democratic member of the state House of Delegates, said Monday of West Virginia’s descent from first to worst. Griffith said he was proud of Justice’s nonstop effort to push vaccines “and the obvious love he has for the people of West Virginia.” But Justice also ended a statewide indoor mask mandate in June and has opposed vaccination and mask requirements since.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has declined to issue a ruling on a preliminary injunction requested by Ojibwe tribes to stop the state’s 2021 wolf hunt. But Chief U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson said Friday that he had “deep misgivings” about state rules that proved inadequate in February to keep the wolf kill to the intended target. The case is part of a lawsuit filed Sept. 21 by six Wisconsin Ojibwe tribes against the Department of Natural Resources and Natural Resources Board. The tribes argue that the hunt violates their treaty rights and endangers an animal they consider sacred. The Wisconsin wolf hunting and trapping season in February resulted in a kill of 218 wolves, 99 wolves above the state-licensed quota. The shares had been split 119 for the state and 81 for the tribes. The take by state-licensed hunters and trappers effectively consumed the tribes’ quota. The tribes are represented by the California-based environmental group Earthjustice. The case took an unusual turn due to a preliminary injunction on the wolf season handed out Oct. 22 in a similar case by a Dane County judge. With the season already effectively blocked, Peterson said he wasn’t able to issue relief. But he heard arguments and testimony over seven hours Friday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State senators on Friday voted down the last special legislative session bill they had written to counter President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccinations – one that would have prohibited discrimination against business customers and others based on their vaccination status. The special session that began Tuesday in response to the federal plans will continue Monday, however, when senators plan to take up a House bill to bar employers from considering vaccination status in hiring decisions. The measure cleared the House 38-20 on Friday. The Senate will also consider a bill that would give Gov. Mark Gordon’s office $1 million to fight the Biden administration vaccine requirements for certain federal, health care and other private-sector employees and to prohibit enforcement of the requirements in Wyoming. That bill passed the House 41-14 on Friday. With no more legislation related to COVID-19 immediately left to consider, the House adjourned until Wednesday. Lawmakers worried that prohibiting discrimination based on a person’s vaccination status would have unforeseen and unintended consequences for businesses. The bill would open the way for “still more ways to sue” businesses, said Sen. Dave Kinskey, R-Sheridan, calling it “a lawyer’s field day.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/europe/ukraine-russian-prisoners-of-war-intl/index.html", "title": "Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine voice disquiet, shame over war ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\n“I want to tell our commander-in-chief to stop terror acts in Ukraine because when we come back we’ll rise against him.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin “has given orders to commit crimes. It’s not just to demilitarize Ukraine or defeat the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but now cities of peaceful civilians are being destroyed.”\n\n“The crimes that we committed; we all will be judged.”\n\nThese are the voices of Russian prisoners of war now held by Ukraine.\n\nNearly a dozen have appeared in news conferences held by the Ukrainian authorities, just a few of the 600 that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says have been captured.\n\nTheir public appearances may be questionable under the Geneva Conventions, which forbid states from causing unnecessary humiliation to prisoners of war. And it is possible that they felt pressure to express views sympathetic to those of their captors.\n\nBut three captured Russian air force pilots who spoke to CNN did not suggest they were speaking under duress.\n\nCNN requested access to speak with the prisoners with the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. That request was made prior to a press conference that took place in Kyiv on Friday. CNN spoke with the three men immediately after that press conference.\n\nCNN were the only journalists in the room and at no time did Ukrainian Security Services, who were in the room throughout, interject or direct CNN or the prisoners to ask or answer specific questions. The interview was conducted in Russian.\n\nThe prisoners were not handcuffed, and while they didn’t move from their seats, seemed to be under no physical restraint.\n\nWe are reporting the contents of this interview as there appears to be a common thread appearing from other Russian prisoners of war speaking following their captures – that this is not a war they want to be fighting.\n\nThe three pilots sat around a table. One of them had a gash in his forehead, which he said had been sustained before his capture.\n\n“The treatment has been acceptable. They’ve offered us food and drink. They offered medical treatment,” said one pilot, whose first name is Maxim.\n\nCNN’s interview with the three Russian captives revealed that they had deep disquiet about their mission and the suffering of Ukrainian civilians. They also had harsh words for their commander-in-chief, Putin.\n\nAnd they spoke of tearful calls home.\n\nTheir testimony appears to support western assessments that there are morale issues among at least some Russian troops in Ukraine. On March 1, a senior US official said the US has “indications that morale is flagging in some” of the Russian units.\n\n“They again did not expect the resistance that they were going to get, and that their own morale has suffered as a result,” the official said.\n\nSmoke rises from a Russian tank destroyed by the Ukrainian forces on the side of a road in Lugansk region on February 26, 2022. ANATOLII STEPANOV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMaxim, an officer and fighter-bomber pilot, did most of the talking. He looked bruised and very pale but spoke lucidly in the tone of a professional soldier. CNN is using only the first names of the prisoners of war for their own protection.\n\nHe said he had only received his “secret combat order” the day before Putin announced the “special military operation” against Ukraine.\n\nThe pilots were asked what they thought about Putin’s claims that Ukraine was run by neo-Nazis.\n\nPeople protest the abduction of Mayor Ivan Fedorov, outside the Melitopol regional administration building, after he was reportedly taken away by Russian forces during their ongoing invasion, in Melitopol, Ukraine on March 12. Deputy Head for President's Office/Reuters\n\n“I think it was invented as a pretext and is something that the world cannot understand,” Maxim said. “But Putin and his circle need this in order to achieve their own objectives. One such step was that it would be beneficial for them to spread disinformation about fascism and Nazism.”\n\n“We didn’t see any Nazis or fascists. Russians and Ukrainians can communicate in the same language, so we see the good (in these people),” Maxim said.\n\n“It’s hard to give a direct assessment of his actions. But, at the bare minimum, judging by the consequences of his orders, he is incorrect.”\n\nAt a different media briefing in the same venue, a reconnaissance officer called Vladimir who had been captured told a group of international reporters, “Our government told us we need to liberate the civilian population. I want to tell Russian servicemen: lay down your arms and leave your stations, don’t come here. Everyone wants peace here.”\n\nVladimir then went a big step further, saying: “I want to tell our commander-in-chief to stop terror acts in Ukraine because when we come back we’ll rise against him.”\n\nAnother reconnaissance officer at the same event echoed the sentiment, addressing Putin directly.\n\n“You won’t hide this for long. There are many like us here. Sooner or later, we’ll come home.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Maxim, the pilot, became emotional about the suffering inflicted on civilians since the invasion.\n\n“It’s not just about demilitarizing Ukraine or the defeat of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but now cities of peaceful civilians are being destroyed. Even, I don’t know, what can justify, f**k, the tears of a child, or even worse, the deaths of innocent people, children.”\n\nHe said they were aware of what had happened in places like Mariupol, where nearly 1,600 people have been killed since the invasion began.\n\n“It was a horrifying fact, not just because it is a crime. It’s vandalism. You cannot forgive such things. To bomb a maternity ward?” he said.\n\n“It’s the most perverse f**king form of neo-Nazism, neo-fascism. Who could think of such a thing?”\n\nAnother pilot, whose first name is Alexei, added quietly, “It’s not really up to us, who to bomb, what to bomb. It’s a command.”\n\nCaptives talk of confusion, reluctance\n\nLive-streamed footage shows people carrying a banner in the colors of the Ukrainian flag as they protest amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Kherson, on March 13. Reuters\n\nMaxim and his fellow pilots suggested there was widespread disquiet about the Ukraine offensive.\n\n“I know in my unit, they are totally against it,” Maxim said.\n\n“They have many relatives and friends [in Ukraine], and they were told it was an operation localized to the DNR [the breakaway Russian-backed Donetsk area], and not an attack on the whole country. My division was totally against it.”\n\n“If Ukraine wanted to become part of Russia, to strike up some cooperation – by all means. No one would be against that. But to force them is just not acceptable.”\n\nNeil Greenberg is a professor of defense mental health at King’s College London. He served in the UK Armed Forces for more than 20 years and has deployed, as a psychiatrist and researcher, to a number of hostile environments.\n\nHe explained that under the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war are bound to give only their names, rank, date of birth and military identification number. “That’s all you have to give so the fact that they are saying more than that suggests that either they have been put in a difficult situation because they have had pressure put on them, or that they are distressed enough that they have broken protocol because they believe what they are saying,” Greenberg told CNN.\n\n“What’s interesting from a psychological point of view is that the average soldier doesn’t often have the political ideals of whoever runs the country. So if you ask soldiers why they do what they do, they often say they do it because they are fighting for each other – we are a band of brothers and therefore we are going to do what we do because we are following orders and we look after each other,” he added.\n\n“It’s unlikely that they would have the same ideals as Putin so it would be wrong to think automatically that those views were not true.”\n\nAnother soldier held by the Ukrainians told a separate media briefing of his artillery unit’s entry from Belarus down the road to Chernihiv. He teared up as he spoke of meeting locals who told his unit to go home, and said, “There are no fascists here.”\n\nHe also spoke of confusion among units. His group became stuck in a swamp and had to destroy their infantry fighting vehicle. They wandered on foot for several days before reaching a village and surrendering after an exchange of fire.\n\nAnother Russian soldier – in a video released by Ukrainian media – said he had crossed from Crimea on the first night of the offensive.\n\nThe unnamed soldier, who said he was 22 years old and gave his unit’s number, said it was soon obvious that “we are not here as peacekeepers, but to fight. We asked commanders what the f**k we are doing here. We couldn’t turn around and leave. Behind were the echelons [units] that kill deserters.”\n\nThe soldier said, “We were told there were no civilians in every settlement. But they were there. It worried us.\n\n“We had already realized that missiles were flying at the civilian population, against ordinary towns but not on military facilities. Although we were told quite the opposite. So, we surrendered.”\n\nLast-minute orders\n\nMaxim said he had received his combat orders the day before Putin announced the invasion.\n\nAnd then, he said, there was a surprise.\n\n“The order was canceled. Part of the air force that had already taken off had to turn back. We were happy and thought that maybe things had been resolved peacefully.”\n\nHe was wrong – and soon received a list of coordinates for targets in eastern Ukraine, around Izium and Chuhuiv.\n\nHe said he was not sure what he was hitting. “It’s impossible to really know what is beyond our state borders. For example, they mark down a column of tanks. But we cannot be sure if there is really one there or not.”\n\nCNN has analyzed multiple instances in which air-dropped bombs have hit civilian areas in Ukraine since the invasion began on February 24.\n\n“We only dropped non-locating missiles,” Maxim said, meaning what analysts describe as “dumb bombs,” unguided munitions which pose a greater risk of causing indiscriminate damage.\n\n“I just used the usual explosive bombs, made of cast iron… the same kind that were used during World War Two with some changes here and there over the years. There are more modern ballistic varieties, of course, but the fact remains that we did not use those,” Maxim added.\n\nLast week, US and NATO officials said Russia had relied far more heavily on less sophisticated, so-called “dumb bombs” than it has on its arsenal of precision-guided munitions.\n\n“It’s hard to say at this point whether that’s driven by expense, if that’s driven by a lack of inventory or if that’s just driven by a desire to be more brutal in the in the use of force,” a senior NATO official said on Thursday.\n\nOther Russian soldiers captured by the Ukrainians have also spoken of last-minute orders.\n\nSergey, who was with an artillery unit, said in an earlier media briefing that “at 10:00 am on the 23rd (of February) they were lined up and told by the commander about Putin’s order to attack Ukraine, seize Kyiv and “protect the population against the fascism and tyranny in Ukraine.”\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nThe pilots who spoke to CNN were uncertain about how the war would end.\n\n“I hope our superiors have control over the circumstances. How things are going to develop in the future, to make a wish for some outcome, I’m not going to do that here, to say what I want,” Maxim said.\n\nHe also spoke of his first contact with family back home.\n\n“I said ‘I’m alive’ because it was our first conversation. I told them: ‘I’m alive and being held captive.’\n\n“We talked about personal things. About our kids, the home; not about military stuff.\n\n“Of course, we really want to see our families and loved ones. To meet with them. And hug them because they are worried.”\n\nBut they were anxious about what might happen to them, said Maxim.\n\n“The crimes that we committed; we all will be judged the same. Other than that, I cannot say. It’s impossible to guess … They will judge us,” said Maxim.\n\nAnother soldier at a different briefing expressed similar feelings.\n\n“It feels terrible to realize our mistake. It will take years, decades, centuries to repair relations,” he said.\n\n“I wish I could sink into the earth and vanish.”", "authors": ["Tim Lister Sebastian Shukla", "Tim Lister", "Sebastian Shukla"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/24/cross-statement-injection-sites-swamp-refuge-mining-news-around-states/50634833/", "title": "Cross statement, injection sites: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday made her first public appearance in nearly three weeks, telling reporters she was in good health but also declining to say whether she had undergone any recent medical treatment. Ivey toured a science and technology lab at Dalraida Elementary School in Montgomery in her first public appearance since an Aug. 2 groundbreaking ceremony. The gap between appearances fueled speculation about the 77-year-old governor’s health. “I’ve got a clean bill of health from the doctors, and I’m looking forward to serving for four more years as governor,” Ivey told reporters. She brushed aside questions about whether she had recently undergone medical treatment in a hospital and did not directly answer. “It just seems like a lot of you just want to will these rumors into being, and that just isn’t going to happen,” the Republican governor responded, according to al.com. “I’ve got a clean bill of health from the doctors. That’s what matters, and I’m looking forward to serving four more years as your governor.” Ivey’s office on Aug. 12 began releasing occasional photos of her at work to combat the rumors, beginning with a photo of her greeting South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem at an airport when Noem arrived in Alabama for a speech.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A state corporation is the only remaining leaseholder in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that intends to pursue plans to explore for oil and gas on the refuge’s coastal plain after another private company gave up its lease in the region. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said Knik Arm Services, a small real estate and leasing firm, asked to have its 49,000-acre lease rescinded and lease payments refunded. The federal agency said it will honor the request made last week, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Knik Arm Services was one of two private companies that won leases in a sale held in the waning days of the Trump administration. The other, oil company Regenerate Alaska, gave up its lease earlier this year. The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state corporation, acquired seven leases in the sale. It is suing federal officials over what it calls improper actions that are preventing lease activities. The corporation got the leases to preserve drilling rights in case oil companies did not come forward. Mark Graber, who owns Knik Arm Services, said he invested about $2 million into his lease and for a first-year lease payment. He said he had wanted to hold onto his lease in hopes that the state corporation prevailed in its lawsuit and that oil development would produce royalties for his company. But he said the fight over the leases could take years.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A controversial state law restricting how the public can film police faced its first legal challenge Tuesday with a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The group’s Arizona chapter, joined by several news organizations in the state, filed a petition in U.S. District Court arguing the law criminalizes First Amendment freedoms. “This law is a violation of a vital constitutional right and will severely thwart attempts to build police accountability. It must be struck down before it creates irreparable community harm,” the ACLU wrote in a statement on its blog. In the complaint, the group contends the law not only has “blatant constitutional issues” but is too ambiguous in some parts. They are seeking an injunction barring law enforcement and others from enforcing the law. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, Maricopa County Attorney General Rachel Mitchell and Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone are all named as defendants. The law, signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in July, makes it illegal to knowingly film police officers from 8 feet or closer without an officer’s permission. An officer can order someone to stop filming even if they are on private property recording with the owner’s consent if an officer finds they’re interfering or deems the area unsafe.\n\nArkansas\n\nMulberry: Federal authorities have now started a civil rights investigation following the suspension of three law enforcement officers after a video posted on social media showed two of them beating a man while a third officer held him on the ground. The officers were responding to a report of a man making threats outside a convenience store Sunday in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma, authorities said. Arkansas State Police said the agency would investigate the use of force. State police identified the suspect as Randal Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, South Carolina. The attorney for the two deputies said Monday that Worcester attacked one of the deputies, giving him a concussion. The video shows one officer punching the suspect with a clenched fist, while another can be seen hitting the man with his knee. The third officer holds him against the pavement. In video recorded from a car nearby, someone yells at officers to stop hitting the man in the head. Two of the officers appear to look up and say something back to the person who yelled. The officers’ comments could not be heard clearly on the video.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Monday that he said could have brought “a world of unintended consequences” by allowing Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco to set up sites where opioid users could legally inject drugs under supervision. “The unlimited number of safe injection sites that this bill would authorize – facilities which could exist well into the later part of this decade – could induce a world of unintended consequences,” Newsom said. While he said the sites could be helpful, he worried that “if done without a strong plan, they could work against this purpose” and said that “worsening drug consumption challenges in these areas is not a risk we can take.” It was one of the most watched and most controversial measures of this legislative session. Proponents wanted to give people who already use drugs a place to inject them while trained staff stand by to help if they suffer accidental overdoses. The proposal came amid a spike in overdose deaths and a national opioid crisis. But opponents said the move in effect would have condoned the use of dangerous drugs. “Each year this legislation is delayed, more people die of drug overdoses,” said state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco who authored the California legislation.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: There is no evidence a woman who lost custody of her 7-year-old son for allegedly lying about his health problems plotted with QAnon supporters to have him kidnapped from foster care, her lawyer told jurors Monday at the start of her trial. The prosecution’s case about the alleged plot in 2019 is based on the account of Cynthia Abcug’s then-16-year-old daughter, who told her counselor that her mother was talking with followers of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory about launching a raid on the home, defense lawyer Brian Hall said during opening statements in court in Castle Rock in suburban Denver. Many QAnon supporters believe ex-President Donald Trump was fighting enemies in the so-called deep state to expose a group of satanic, cannibalistic child molesters they believe secretly runs the globe. Hall stressed that the girl did not know details about what was supposed to happen and did not think her mother knew where her son’s foster home was. But Chief Deputy District Gary Dawson told the jury that the daughter heard her mother talking about the raid on several occasions in September and August of 2019. Around that same time, Abcug bought a gun, and a man identified only as Ryan and described as an ex-member of the military and a sniper moved into their home to provide protection, Dawson said. An older son who was no longer living at home will also testify that he remembers Abcug talking about launching a raid to get her young son back, Dawson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: A city-maintained list of historic buildings could be the start to revitalizing the waterfront along the Thames River. A Local Historic Inventory was created during Monday’s Norwich City Council meeting, with a list of historic properties that the city would like to redevelop. All are located within areas determined by the Federal Emergency Management Association to be flood hazard areas and aren’t currently recognized by the National Register of Historic Places. The need for a list comes from a FEMA rule, which prohibits improvements worth more than half a property’s value yearly for buildings in a flood hazard area, likely preventing a quick redevelopment, Norwich Mayor Peter Nystrom said. “If you only allow (developers) to redevelop a site in a piecemeal fashion, it ties the hands of anyone interested in developing a site like that,” he said. There is an exception is if a property is on a recognized list of historic places. A property can join the National Register of Historic Places with a State Historic Preservation Office nomination. The property must be of sufficient age and historical significance, while retaining much of its historic character. If the property can make the list, there are tax credits and legal recourse to prevent demolition, said Regan Miner, executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, who was a consultant for the city in picking the list.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: DuPont plans to build a new production facility in Glasgow to support the expansion of the company’s semiconductor materials business. The new facility will likely be the first building in a 1 million-square-foot logistics park planned in the city. Once complete, about 70 current employees will move to the site. DuPont intends to hire about 10 new positions. DuPont estimates it will invest $50 million in the facility. The state on Monday approved taxpayer-funded grants up to $1.64 million to support job growth and construction of the building. “The DuPont Company has been part of Delaware’s DNA for 220 years,” Gov. John Carney said in a statement. “With this expansion of their semiconductor division, the company is showing their commitment to our state and workforce.” One member of the Council on Development Finance, the state board tasked with determining whether to give businesses money to relocate to or expand in Delaware, voted against the grants. State Rep. Ed Osienski of Newark pointed to DuPont’s history of downsizing within Delaware as cause for concern. “It’s great that you’re considering staying here, but I question the need for Delawareans to come up with $1.6 million to get DuPont to remain here and add some jobs when Delaware suffered a lot,” Osienski said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The states of Arizona and Texas continue to send asylum-seekers to the district as the school year approaches for children, but the Pentagon has again turned down a request from the mayor for National Guard aid, WUSA-TV reports. More than 8,700 asylum-seekers have been sent to D.C. from both states since April. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office said his state has sent about 7,200 migrants on 175 buses to the nation’s capital so far, while Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s office said 1,516 migrants have gotten on 41 buses to go to the district. About 1,300 migrants have been bused to D.C. from those states over the past month alone. Many of the buses that have rolled into Union Station have included children. Neither state could provide data on just how many of the bus passengers were below the age of 18, but it appears they will be welcome in DC Public Schools this fall. “School-aged children will go to school,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday. “That’s the plan.” Many of the kids who have been bused to D.C. have come with very little, said Madhvi Bahl, a migrant organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network and Sanctuary DMV. She said efforts are ongoing to collect supplies for them for the upcoming school year.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The president of a local NAACP branch has resigned, saying that as a South Asian woman she experienced “racist marginalization” from others in the civil rights group. Dr. Vanessa Toolsie, an elected vice president of the Orange County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, became its leader in March when Tiffany Hughes resigned to run for a Florida legislative seat. Born in Trinidad of Indian descent, she posted a lengthy resignation letter on Facebook on the NAACP branch’s Facebook page Sunday, the Orlando Sentinel reports. She also placed a brief statement on her personal Facebook page, saying: “I will NO LONGER tolerate ANY racism against me for being a #ProudBrownWoman of #SouthAsian and #Caribbean descent,” the Orlando Sentinel reports. Toolsie read her resignation letter during a virtual board meeting Monday night. One person objected, describing her claims as “false allegations against the executive committee,” the newspaper reports. Others asked in the chat feature whether Toolsie had any proof and what could be done to assure that no one else has a similar experience. The meeting was adjourned without further discussion. “I am concerned about this person and the charges that were made,” John Cummings, a spokesman for the group, told the Sentinel. “We don’t want to overlook or dehumanize or, in any way, cause anybody problems or concern intentionally or unintentionally.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A company seeking to mine near the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp’s vast wildlife refuge said Monday that its project is back on track after a federal agency reversed a June decision that had posed a big setback. Twin Pines Minerals said the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by the company by once again relinquishing the agency’s regulatory oversight of the proposed titanium and zirconium mine in southeast Georgia near the Okefenokee, home to the largest U.S. wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi River. “We appreciate the Corps’ willingness to reverse itself and make things right,” Twin Pines President Steve Ingle said in a statement, calling the development “great news” for the project. Scientists have warned that mining close to the swamp’s bowl-like rim could damage its ability to hold water. They urged the Army Corps of Engineers to deny the project a permit. But the agency declared in 2020 it no longer had that authority after regulatory rollbacks under then-President Donald Trump narrowed the types of waterways qualifying for protection under the Clean Water Act. Trump’s rollbacks were later scrapped by federal courts. President Joe Biden’s administration has sought to restore federal oversight of development projects that under Trump had been allowed to sidestep regulations to prevent pollution of streams or draining of wetlands.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Calling allegations that a couple stole identities of dead babies for unknown reasons unique, a U.S. judge on Monday upheld a previous ruling to detain the pair without bail. According to prosecutors, Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison are the real names of the couple who have been fraudulently living for decades under stolen identities, Bobby Fort and Julie Montague. The case has drawn speculation about Russian espionage. Prosecutors say Primrose spent more than 20 years in the Coast Guard, where he obtained secret-level security clearance. U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi said the mystery behind why the couple lived under allegedly stolen identities for so long is what makes the case unique “because the real question is, ‘Why?’ ” Primrose and Morrison have pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, false statement in a passport application and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors have suggested the case is about more than identity theft. A search of the couple’s home in Kapolei, a Honolulu suburb, turned up Polaroids of them wearing jackets that appear to be authentic KGB uniforms, an invisible ink kit, documents with coded language and maps showing military bases, prosecutors said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s near-total abortion ban appears to have a serious conflict with a federal law governing emergency health care treatment, a federal judge said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the Republican-led state of Idaho earlier this month, saying the abortion ban set to take effect Thursday violates a federal law requiring Medicare-funded hospitals to provide “stabilizing treatment” to patients experiencing medical emergencies. Idaho’s law criminalizes all abortions in “clinically diagnosable pregnancies” but allows physicians to defend themselves in court by arguing the procedure was necessary to avert the death of the mother. U.S. District Senior Judge B. Lynn Winmill said the potential conflict exists because Idaho’s law doesn’t appear to account for cases when a pregnant person might face serious medical consequences if the pregnancy is continued. “That is more than just a hypothetical concern,” Winmill told attorneys on both sides during oral arguments in Boise’s federal courthouse. The judge said he would decide by the end of the day Wednesday whether to temporarily block the strict abortion ban while the lawsuit proceeds.\n\nIllinois\n\nEdwardsville: Two young men who died last week after they entered a southern Illinois manhole where toxic gases were present have been identified by a coroner. Madison County Coroner Stephen P. Nonn said Jack M. Pfund, 19, of Edwardsville and Cody W. Toenyes, 22, of Bethalto died Friday at a construction site in Edwardsville. The men were found dead in a manhole leading to a sewer pipe at the residential development, and crews needed advanced breathing equipment to recover their bodies, said Edwardsville Fire Chief James Whiteford. He said first responders were met with “very little oxygen” and a “buildup of toxic gases” that likely led to the workers’ deaths, the Belleville News-Democrat reports. An Edwardsville police officer who was among the first responders at the scene was taken to a hospital for evaluation Friday in the city about 20 miles northeast of St. Louis. Nonn said Tuesday that autopsies found both Pfund and Toenyes’ preliminary causes of death were due to possible asphyxia due to low environmental oxygen and drowning. Toxicological testing that could determine the final causes of death for both men are pending.\n\nIndiana\n\nChesterton: For the second time in three years, a lifeguard shortage has prompted Indiana Dunes State Park to ban swimming until further notice. Visitors can wade up to waist-deep in the waters of Lake Michigan but are not permitted to swim or go deeper into the lake, the park announced Friday. Indiana conservation officers and park staff will be on hand to enforce the ban, it said. Visitors interested in next weekend or Labor Day weekend should monitor the Indiana Dunes State Park Facebook page for notifications regarding beach status, it said. Swimming is permitted at the beach at Indiana Dunes State Park only when lifeguards are present because of frequently changing conditions of the lake bottom and the unpredictability of dangerous rip currents that can occur along the shoreline at the southern tip of Lake Michigan, a news release said. The park is located about 50 miles southeast of Chicago and is a popular summer recreational destination for the region.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The owner of an ethanol plant in the west central Iowa city of Denison has agreed to pay a nearly $210,000 fine for failing to report chemicals that could be released during an emergency, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The penalty was part of a $1.73 million settlement the Andersons Marathon Holdings agreed to pay for 131 reporting violations there and at ethanol plants in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. The EPA says companies must report annually chemicals released into the air, water or through land disposal via the Toxic Release Inventory, which is meant to provide communities with information to help them respond in an emergency. The fine is the largest the agency has obtained to date under the 1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the EPA said. The agency said the violations occurred from 2016 to 2020. The EPA found the Andersons Marathon plant in Denison committed 32 violations in which it failed to report the release of chemicals in the plant’s fermentation vapor stream and also failed to provide accurate data. It was fined $209,241. The company also paid $1.52 million for violations at ethanol plants in Logansport, Indiana; Albion, Michigan; and Greenville, Ohio.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas Museum of History is offering free admission to the public through Sept.3 before it closes to undergo renovations. Carrie Nation’s hatchet, George Armstrong Custer’s riding boots and Dwight D. Eisenhower’s World War II field jacket are among pieces of the past on display at the museum, along with an airplane built in 1914 by Topekan Albin Longren and a steam locomotive, named after Topeka co-founder Cyrus K. Holliday, that was constructed in 1880 for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway. “Please join us in saying ‘Goodbye to the Past,’ ” the museum said on Facebook. The historical museum will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays until Sept. 3. The Kansas Historical Society’s Museum Store and Discovery Place have already closed for renovations, while construction is underway near the entrance to the building where they are located, the society’s Facebook site said. The state archives research room and the historical society’s nature trail will remain open during renovations. The museum normally charges admission fees of $10 for adults; $9 for senior citizens, active military and college students with identification; and $5 for youths ages 2 through 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear announced Tuesday that he’s calling the Republican-led Legislature into a special session to take up a relief package for flood-ravaged eastern Kentucky. The special session will begin at noon Wednesday, the governor said. The decision to reconvene lawmakers comes after discussions among lawmakers and Beshear’s administration. “We’ve had productive conversations – not bipartisan, but nonpartisan,” the governor said in a tweet. “We have now reached an agreement.” The governor didn’t immediately offer details of the relief package to be presented to lawmakers but wrote: “Together, we can provide the support and relief eastern Kentucky needs.” Historic flooding engulfed parts of eastern Kentucky late last month. The surging floodwaters destroyed homes and caused significant damage to roads, bridges and water systems. The catastrophic flooding caused at least 39 deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A deputy constable for a city court has resigned following allegations that he didn’t act when a witness told him a woman was being raped. The deputy had already been suspended after the allegation was made. The constable for 2nd City Court, Edwin Shorty, told news outlets that the deputy resigned Thursday. The deputy was working a private security detail in the French Quarter on July 26 when he was approached by a witness who said a man was raping an unconscious woman nearby. Shorty said an investigation showed the deputy stayed in his car for several minutes before walking away from the scene. He did not release the deputy’s name. Shorty said the deputy, who had 30 years of law enforcement experience, gave no explanation for his inaction.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The federal government will pay $8 million to settle a claim that a federally funded clinic failed to alert a mother or authorities of signs of abuse of a 6-month-old boy. Alexandria Orduna, of Brewer, contended medical professionals failed to recognize or report abuse inflicted on her son by a man who was living with her in 2019. The abuse wasn’t noted and reported until her son was taken to a hospital emergency room in Bangor. The boy is now almost entirely blind, and his brain stopped growing at the time of his attack, the Bangor Daily News reports. “This little boy couldn’t talk, but his body could, and his health care practitioners didn’t listen to what it was saying,” Terry Garmey, one of the mother’s attorneys, told the newspaper. Orduna sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which funds Medicaid, which paid for the boy’s care. The settlement sets aside $17,000 a month in a trust account for the rest of the boy’s life to contribute to the cost of his long-term medical needs and accommodations. The man who inflicted the injuries pleaded guilty last year to aggravated assault and other charges. He was ordered to serve four years in prison.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The state’s second-largest port is set to receive much-needed dredging and open the door to a continued economic boom thanks to a new agreement. On Friday, Gov. Larry Hogan announced a landmark partnership for a major dredging project totaling 137,000 cubic yards of material dredged from the Port of Salisbury to be reused to benefit over 70 acres on the Deal Island Wildlife Management Area. The material will be used to help restore wetlands, preserve natural habitats and protect infrastructure along the Manokin River to keep pace with rising sea levels. “When we learned about the dredging needs threatening to restrict operations at this port, our team immediately got to work with (our state partners) to focus on solving the problem. Thanks to a unique partnership at all levels of government, we’re moving forward with the dredging of this port,” Hogan said. According to current economic state data, the port transports more than $200 million in goods annually, including grain, petroleum and building aggregates. It has a 150-foot-wide channel and 14-foot-deep mean tide from the Chesapeake Bay to Salisbury.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMattapoisett: Gasoline vapors ignited by spark during a gas tank replacement project on a boat were the likely cause of a major fire at a marina last week that destroyed buildings, vehicles and boats and sent one employee to the hospital, investigators said. The fire at the Mattapoisett Boatyard on Friday that drew more than 100 firefighters and sent a plume of thick black smoke over southeastern Massachusetts that could be seen for miles was determined to be accidental, according to a statement Monday from the state fire marshal and local authorities. The investigation determined that the fire began inside a building at the boatyard where a worker had been replacing a boat’s gas tank. The fire, fanned by winds of up to 25 mph, spread to six buildings, 47 vehicles and 14 boats, authorities said. The injured worker remains in the hospital but is expected to survive. Three firefighters who suffered smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion injuries were treated at the hospital and released. Mattapoisett is about 50 miles south of Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A jury on Tuesday convicted two men of conspiring to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020, delivering swift verdicts in a plot that was broken up by the FBI and described as a rallying cry for a U.S. civil war by anti-government extremists. The result was a big victory for the U.S. Justice Department. A different jury just four months ago couldn’t reach a unanimous decision on Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. but acquitted two other men – a stunning conclusion that led to a second trial. Fox and Croft were convicted of two counts of conspiracy related to the kidnapping scheme and attempts to obtain a weapon of mass destruction. Prosecutors said they wanted to blow up a bridge to disrupt police if the abduction could be pulled off at Whitmer’s vacation home. Croft was also convicted of another explosives charge. The jury deliberated for roughly eight hours over two days. “Today’s verdicts prove that violence and threats have no place in our politics, and those who seek to divide us will be held accountable. They will not succeed,” said Whitmer, a Democrat, who turned 51 years old Tuesday. “But we must also take a hard look at the status of our politics. Plots against public officials and threats to the FBI are a disturbing extension of radicalized domestic terrorism that festers in our nation, threatening the very foundation of our republic.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nProctor: The parents of a teenage boy who was assaulted after football practice have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit claiming the coach and others failed to protect their son against known hazing. The September assault resulted in cancellation of Proctor High School’s football season and the resignation of its head coach. An 18-year-old former Proctor student and football player was given probation in June for assaulting the victim with a toilet plunger and must register as a predatory offender for 10 years. The federal lawsuit alleges the hazing practice was common before and during Derek Parendo’s coaching run. The complaint said other assistant coaches, the athletic director, superintendent and guidance counselors also knew about the practice. District leaders told Parendo to remove the plunger from the locker room and to advise players on hazing, the complaint said, but the district didn’t take adequate measures to ensure this, the Star Tribune reports. Parendo has called the assault an isolated incident and said hazing is part of the district’s “old culture,” which coaches have not discussed. Superintendent John Engelking has since retired from the district. He has said the district “has never ignored any alleged misconduct toward staff or students that (was) brought to its attention.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A mother testified Tuesday that her child’s public school is harmed by the state putting $10 million of federal pandemic relief money into infrastructure grants for private schools. Tanya Marsaw of Crystal Springs is a member of Parents for Public Schools, a nonprofit group suing the state to try to block the program Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed into law earlier this year. The lawsuit cites Section 208 of the Mississippi Constitution, which prohibits the use of public money for any school that is not “a free school.” During a hearing before Hinds County Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin, Marsaw testified that she pays taxes. “It is some of my money, and it should not go to private schools,” Marsaw said. Reeves signed two bills in April. One created a grant program to help private schools pay for water, broadband and other infrastructure projects. The other allocated the $10 million of federal money for the program, starting July 1. The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, the Mississippi Center for Justice and Democracy Forward filed the lawsuit June 15 on behalf of Parents for Public Schools, an advocacy group founded more than 30 years ago.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson on Monday called on lawmakers to return to work Sept. 6 for a special legislative session to cut income taxes. The Republican told reporters gathered in his Capitol office that he wants lawmakers to cut the top income tax rate from 5.3% to 4.8% and increase the standard deduction by $2,000 for single filers and $4,000 for couples. A single adult caring for two children and making at most $35,000 a year would see income taxes drop by about $140 a year, according to estimates provided by the governor’s office. Parson specified that, based on the limits in his special session call, lawmakers cannot cut income taxes so deeply that the state loses more than $700 million per year in revenue. The governor also recommended cutting income taxes entirely for individuals who make $16,000 or less in a year or for couples filing jointly who make less than $32,000. Missouri has more money on hand than ever before, thanks partly to a combination of inflation, higher wages and federal funds. The state closed out its 2022 fiscal year with a general revenue balance of nearly $4.9 billion – more than double the previous record set just one year ago.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Yellowstone: Cleanup continued Monday after a fuel pup trailer rolled onto its side in Yellowstone National Park last week and spilled gasoline, park officials said. The accident, which happened about 4 a.m. Friday on U.S. Highway 191 in the western side of the park, spilled 4,800 gallons of gasoline onto the roadway and into a wetland adjacent to the highway, the Environmental Protection Agency said. While the wetland feeds into nearby Grayling Creek, there had been no reports of gasoline reaching the creek. Crews were working Monday to clean up fuel, pump contaminated water, and excavate contaminated soil in and around the wetland, said Katherine Jenkins, a spokesperson for the EPA. Park law enforcement cited the truck driver for failure to maintain control, said park spokesperson Morgan Warthin.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state lawmaker from Omaha is promising to introduce a bill to legalize medical marijuana after similar measures failed to collect enough valid signatures to appear on the November ballot. State Sen. Jen Day said in a news release Tuesday that she will introduce legislation in the upcoming legislative session slated to begin Jan. 4. “We will exhaust every measure possible to get Nebraskans the medical freedom they deserve and want,” Day said. Her announcement came a day after Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen announced that the Medical Cannabis Patient Protections Initiative and the Medical Cannabis Regulation Initiative failed to get the nearly 87,000 signatures required to get on the Nov. 8 ballot. The failure did not come as a surprise. Organizers announced in early July that they would likely miss the signature goal needed to make the November ballot, citing the death of one of the effort’s top donors. That forced organizers to rely primarily on volunteers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: As students move into a repaired and remodeled college dormitory for the first time since it exploded three years ago, the legal battle over who is to blame has just started. More than 700 students, mostly freshmen, will be living in the University of Nevada, Reno’s Argenta Hall when the fall semester starts Monday. “Argenta is back,” UNR President Brian Sandoval announced Aug. 16 during a reception to thank contractors, architects and university staff for helping to rebuild and for getting through the past three years. On July 5, 2019, an explosion left the eight-story residence hall, the largest of nine dorms on campus, uninhabitable. UNR officials have often called the explosion the luckiest disaster: No one was seriously hurt when a pipeline in the boiler room filled air ducts and elevator shafts with gas, causing a massive explosion that rattled campus, twisted metal, blasted appliances across rooms and broke windows. A lawsuit filed in June by UNR’s insurance company says the company that serviced the boiler is to blame and responsible for millions in costs. A status conference with both parties is scheduled with Washoe District Court Judge Egan Walker at 10 a.m. Thursday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Election monitors have been appointed in Windham, Bedford and one ward in Laconia for the state’s Sept. 13 primary after problems were found in vote counting or the administration of elections in November 2020, the attorney general’s office said. The office said in a news release Monday that the monitors are appointed to work with election officials and review the conduct of the upcoming election to ensure compliance with state law. Following the November 2020 election, the Windham election review found “administrative shortcomings and significant inaccuracies in vote counts due to the processing of incorrectly folded ballots,” the office said. In Bedford, the election review found that election officials inadvertently failed to count 190 absentee ballots “due to misplacing a container of ballots during election day processing,” according to the attorney general’s office. The office said the Laconia Ward 6 election review found that “election officials inadvertently failed to count 179 ballots from 2020 elections that were cast but left in a ballot collection box, as well as some officials double-counting dozens of ballots” in the November 2020 election. The election monitors are required by law to produce a report within 30 days of the state primary election.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAnnandale: After a school year of fighting personal attacks and opposing the removal of LGBTQ books from school libraries, North Hunterdon High School librarian Martha Hickson was awarded the Lemony Snicket Prize for Noble Librarians Faced with Adversity by the American Library Association. Daniel Handler, also known as Lemony Snicket, presented Hickson with the award − a $10,000 prize, a certificate and an “odd, symbolic object” from Handler’s private collection − at the ALA’s annual conference in Washington, D.C., in June. The award annually recognizes and honors a librarian who has faced adversity with integrity and dignity intact. During the 2021-22 school year, Hickson was personally targeted when parents and other community members sought to remove five books that are LGBTQ-themed from the North Hunterdon High School library, which she opposed. The group labeled her as a “pornographer” and “pedophile” for providing children with access to the books in question, and she received hate mail, threats, nuisance vandalism, and questions about her judgment and integrity. She said the adversity became so pervasive and extreme that her blood pressure and anxiety rose to a dangerous point, and her physician removed her from the workplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: More than four grueling months and $300 million later, the federal government has declared the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history 100% contained, a notable milestone but just another step in what local residents and officials say will be a long journey toward recovery. The blaze was sparked in the spring by two errant prescribed fires conducted by the U.S. Forest Service. More than 530 square miles of the Rocky Mountain foothills burned, hundreds of homes were destroyed, livelihoods were lost, and drinking water supplies were contaminated. Local officials say there are years of work ahead of them to restore the landscape and protect against post-fire flooding. San Miguel County Manager Joy Ansley and her team have been working nonstop since the first plumes of smoke began rising from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. They helped coordinate the evacuation of thousands of people from small mountain villages and worked with the state and the city of Las Vegas as flames approached. With the summer rainy season in full swing, Ansley said parts of northern New Mexico are flooding on a weekly basis. “It’s going to be a long process, and just because the fire is contained, we’re certainly not out of the woods,” she said Tuesday.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester: A couple whom a Black firefighter accused of throwing a racist pool party this summer mocking the Juneteenth holiday said Tuesday that the party was intended to ridicule liberal politicians but wasn’t bigoted. The couple, dentist Nicholas Nicosia and real estate agent Mary Znidarsic-Nicosia, said their July 7 party had been mischaracterized, but Znidarsic-Nicosia confessed to running a racist Twitter account. According to a legal notice filed by firefighter Jerrod Jones, the Nicosias’ party featured a display mocking the Juneteenth holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the 19th century, with Juneteenth flags displayed over buckets of fried chicken. Jones, a 14-year veteran of the fire department, said his captain forced him and two co-workers to attend the party while on duty. He filed a notice of claim against the city of Rochester and the fire department seeking at least $3 million for emotional distress and at least $1 million in compensatory damages. The fire captain, Jeffrey Krywy, was suspended by the department and later retired. Znidarsic-Nicosia did admit to running an anonymous Twitter account that posted racist images and content but denied being racist. “I have made blatantly racist comments under that persona,” she said. “The culture of Twitter operates that way. It gives you an opportunity to be someone you’re not.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s most powerful state senator said Tuesday that he would prefer to have approved restrictions on abortion after roughly the first three months of pregnancy. Senate leader Phil Berger, speaking before convening another round of no-vote General Assembly sessions this week, also said he would support exceptions to any prohibition following the first trimester, such as in situations of rape and incest or when the mother’s life is in danger. The views of Berger, R-Rockingham County, would appear to represent a more tempered effort compared to GOP legislators in North Carolina and other states who want to outlaw abortion or dramatically scale it back following a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade. A federal judge last week reinstated a North Carolina law that prohibits abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy save for urgent medical emergencies. Incest and rape exceptions currently are not granted in state law. The first trimester is usually defined as 12 or 13 weeks of pregnancy. “I would say that after the first trimester, the state has an absolute interest in regulating the incidence of abortion,” Berger told reporters. House Speaker Tim Moore, R-Cleveland County, and Berger have said no potential action on abortion would occur until next year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The main group working to legalize recreational marijuana in the state has more than a half-million dollars to press its case – far more than the mostly shoe-leather effort on which it relied four years ago. Meanwhile, a major oil industry group that helped fund opposition last time says it will sit on the sidelines this time. The North Dakota Petroleum Council will not contribute to the fight the pot legalization effort that will appear on the November general election ballot, said Ron Ness, the group’s president. “It’s one of those things where we only have so many resources,” said Ness, whose group represents several hundred companies. Ness said 1 in 6 North Dakota jobs is directly or indirectly tied to the state’s oil industry. Most oil-field jobs require drug testing, and legalizing pot would likely shrink the employment pool, he said. The energy group contributed $30,000 to the failed statewide ballot effort in 2018 to legalize recreational marijuana. It was among a group of lawyers, law enforcement and business leaders that pushed opposition. The Greater North Dakota Chamber, the state’s largest business organization, contributed $64,000 to oppose the measure in 2018. CEO and President Arik Spencer said the group hasn’t decided whether it will help fund or even support another opposition effort.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two constitutional amendments have cleared their last big hurdle before heading to November ballots – one seeking bail reform, the other prohibiting noncitizens from voting. The specific language for describing the amendments was approved Monday by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican. The Legislature had sent the amendments in June to be put on the ballot. Issue 1, the amendment on bail, would change the conditions and amount of money needed to release someone. Bail would no longer be a standard set by the state. Instead, it would be up to a judge’s discretion based on factors such as public safety, including the seriousness of an offense, an individual’s criminal record, the likelihood a person will commit another offense, or “any other factor the General Assembly may prescribe.” The proposal followed a ruling by a divided Ohio Supreme Court in January, which said a $1.5 million bond for a Cincinnati man accused of fatally shooting a man during a robbery was too high. The language cleared the committee unanimously. The second amendment, Issue 2, would prohibit local governments from allowing non-U.S. citizens to vote in local elections. They are already prohibited from voting in federal and state elections.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Green or red – the colors will symbolize life or death, mercy or no mercy, in a prominent anti-death penalty display outside a northwest Oklahoma City church. Twenty-five crosses have been erected along the front lawn of The Lazarus Community at Clark Memorial United Methodist Church, each representing a person the state is scheduled to execute, beginning Thursday with James Coddington, and extending into 2024. The Rev. Bo Ireland, the church’s pastor, said the crosses – each 6 feet tall and about 4 feet wide – are hard to miss along a busy thoroughfare. But he said they’ll be even more eye-catching in the coming days and weeks. Ireland and a group of volunteers spray-painted the large crosses white Monday, but they won’t stay that way. “If James Coddington is executed, we will paint one of these crosses red, and if he is granted clemency, we will paint it green,” Ireland said. Coddington is set to be executed by lethal injection at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. He was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1997 murder of Albert Hale. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board recommended clemency for Coddington in early August. It is up to Gov. Kevin Stitt to decide whether the death row inmate is granted clemency or executed Thursday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A new microshelter village for unsheltered residents is set to open in south Salem after the City Council allocated funds for the project Monday night. The council voted unanimously to direct $750,000 in state sheltering grant funds to fund a microshelter village at Turner Road SE near Church at the Park, which owns the property there. The money was previously allocated to establish and operate a safe park program on Front Street, but staff said the location is no longer cost-efficient due to higher than anticipated costs. “Startup expenses will exceed original projections, leaving less for operations,” city staff said in a report to council Thursday. “For example, environmentally friendly sanitation services for up to 40 recreational vehicles requires a high level of up-front investment. The lease for the property ends in December 2023.” The Turner Road location was one of three locations Salem City Council approved for microshelters in a Jan. 24 meeting. Another was Front Street. Work is currently underway to relocate the Village of Hope shelter site to the other location approved on Center Street. Local advocates have made it their goal to have microshelter villages throughout the city in all eight wards. A community effort has raised more than $770,000 in donations – enough for at least 154 shelters.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Last week, searches for the word “crudités” on Dictionary.com spiked by more than 10,000% after Dr. Mehmet Oz mentioned the raw vegetable appetizer in an online video that went viral in the worst way possible for the U.S. Senate candidate. “Thought I’d do some grocery shopping. I’m at Wegners,” the GOP nominee says at the outset of the TikTok video, apparently jumbling the names of supermarket chains Redner’s and Wegmans by accident. The clip continues as Oz scans the produce section and grabs a head of broccoli, a bag of whole carrots, asparagus, salsa and guacamole in an awkward attempt to make a point about inflation. Cradling his vegetables, he announces aghast that the total at the register would come to $20 – for crudité! But few besides Oz seemed to know what that is. “In PA we call this … a veggie tray,” Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Oz’s Democratic opponent in the Senate race, tweeted dryly after the video started to blow up. But even after figuring out what a “crudité” was, the internet still had many questions for Oz. Why didn’t he have a shopping basket? Why did he feel salsa and guacamole would be appropriate dips for raw vegetables? Who eats uncooked asparagus? The TikTok video has racked up 4.4 million views to date and has been shared thousands of times on Twitter, generally accompanied by snarky comments. Fetterman wasted no time capitalizing on Oz’s social media mishap, reportedly raising $500,000 in just 24 hours after the clip went viral.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Federal officials have declared a drought-related disaster in the state. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on Monday declared all five of Rhode Island’s counties as “primary natural disaster areas” because of the ongoing drought. The declaration allows eligible farms to be considered for low-interest, emergency loans and other assistance from the department’s Farm Service Agency. Farmers have eight months from the date of the disaster declaration to apply for the assistance. “This prolonged drought has been tough on many Rhode Island farmers, harming the yield and quality of crops,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who earlier this month requested the disaster declaration, said in a statement. “This federal declaration is good news for the state and should help mitigate some of the production losses local farmers are facing.” Rhode Island saw less than 0.5 inches of rain in July, compared to an average of 2.5 inches, according to Reed’s office. More than 99% of the state is experiencing extreme drought.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The director of the state’s Department of Mental Health is giving up the post he’s held for two years, officials said. Dr. Kenneth Rogers, a psychiatrist hired to run the agency in April 2020, announced Thursday at an executive session of a meeting of the Mental Health Commission that he would be leaving the department effective Nov. 1, The State reports. Rogers emailed agency staff Friday shortly after The State reported news of his resignation, to announce his pending departure and thank them for their support. “You have shown incredible fortitude as we have faced extraordinary challenges, and I am proud to work with you,” he wrote. “While I am moving on to a new opportunity, I will forever be grateful for returning to SCDMH and for all I have learned during my tenure as state director.” Rogers did not disclose his next move to staff but pledged to send more information about what to expect in the near future and said he was confident the agency would be in “capable hands” going forward. The seven-member Mental Health Commission, which is appointed by the governor, will select the agency’s next director with confirmation from the Senate. Commission Chairman Greg Pearce said the board was surprised by Rogers’ announcement and had not asked him to resign.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: Gov. Kristi Noem has suggested she won’t push back if voters approve a recreational marijuana ballot measure this fall. The Republican governor talked about the possible future of legal cannabis in South Dakota during a visit to Aberdeen last week. Residents will once again vote on the issue when Initiated Measure 27 appears on the ballot in November. “From what I’ve seen, this amendment this year that will be on the ballot is written more appropriately towards the Constitution,” Noem said Friday at the Brown County Fair. In 2020, Amendment A sought to legalize recreational marijuana. It was approved by voters but struck down by the South Dakota Supreme Court after justices ruled that the amendment violated a provision in the constitution requiring amendments to encompass only one subject. Noem was an opponent of Amendment A two years ago. At her request, state Highway Superintendent Rick Miller and Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom filed the lawsuit that led to the court battle. Noem said that her job as governor is to implement the recreational marijuana resolution if it’s approved by voters in November. Unlike Amendment A, Initiated Measure 27 does not include tax and regulatory stipulations. Those will be left up to the Legislature.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Disgraced former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada and his top aide were arrested Tuesday on federal charges including bribery, kickbacks and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Their indictments follow the abrupt resignation in March of Republican state Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud charges involving Casada and his chief of staff, Cade Cothren. Afterward, speculation swirled about what additional charges might come in the corruption probe. FBI agents arrested Casada and Cothren at their homes Tuesday morning. If convicted, they each face up to 20 years in prison. Both pleaded not guilty Tuesday and received pretrial release with travel restricted to the middle district of Tennessee unless otherwise approved. The 20-count charging document alleges Casada and Cothren exploited their positions of power by working with another unnamed lawmaker to funnel money to themselves using a political consulting firm – known as Phoenix Solutions, LLC – to conceal their involvement. Cothren registered the firm in New Mexico because the state allows anonymous registration of LLCs, and he rebuffed requests for in-person meetings with Casada’s fellow lawmakers, saying the company representatives were out of state.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, accused of acting unethically and dishonestly when he worked to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory in 2020, has turned to his agency for help in a legal battle that could put his law license in jeopardy. A State Bar of Texas disciplinary committee sued Paxton in May, arguing he should be sanctioned for violating his duties as an attorney by lying to the U.S. Supreme Court when he said Texas had substantial proof that voting fraud propelled Biden to victory in four swing states. Paxton “knew or should have known” that his claims were false, misleading and unsupported by credible evidence, the bar argued. Paxton responded in June by asking a state judge to dismiss the lawsuit as an unconstitutional check on his power and a politically motivated attack based on his support for fellow Republican Donald Trump. State District Judge Casey Blair of Kaufman County is scheduled to hear arguments on Paxton’s motion during a Wednesday morning hearing in Kaufman, about 30 miles southeast of Dallas. The Texas Attorney General’s Office entered the fray last week when it asked state District Judge Casey Blair of Kaufman County to allow the agency to join the case on Paxton’s behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democrats are demanding that Gov. Spencer Cox’s pick to head the Department of Natural Resources resign his legislative seat and withdraw from the November ballot, saying it violates the state constitution for him to serve in both roles. Cox selected Republican state Rep. Joel Ferry as the agency’s executive director, a Cabinet position. Ferry has been serving in an acting role pending his confirmation by the Utah Senate, but he’s hanging onto his legislative seat and remains on the ballot in House District 1. The Utah Democratic Party says that violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches set out in the Utah Constitution, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. The governor’s office has previously argued that it doesn’t because Ferry resigned from legislative committees and assignments that would govern natural resources-related issues, and he is not taking any compensation for his legislative role. Legal counsel for the Utah Democratic Party and Joshua Hardy, Ferry’s opponent in November, wrote to Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s office Thursday asking for Ferry to be disqualified from the ballot since he’s ineligible to hold office if he is reelected.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s primary election results have been certified after a delay caused by a technical issue, Secretary of State Jim Condos announced Tuesday. The vote tallies and winners in the Aug. 9 primary were certified as official at a meeting of the canvassing committee Monday, he said. “The tri-partisan certification of election results as official is an important step in verifying the accuracy and integrity of our election results,” Condos said in a statement. “Vermonters deserve to have 100% confidence that official vote totals accurately reflect the ballots cast by voters. That is why results are carefully reviewed and certified by a member of each major political party.” Of the 133,578 ballots cast, 809 were deemed defective, his office said. Of those, 492 were fixed by voters under the new ballot-curing provisions of Vermont’s election law, leaving 317 defective ballots that were unable to be counted, he said. That amounts to a very low defective ballot rate under 0.25%, he said. The secretary of state’s office said a week ago that the certification was delayed because a state contractor had been unable to resolve a technology issue affecting the office’s ability to produce reports from votes submitted by town and city clerks.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say their efforts to inform a school system about the arrest of a counselor on solicitation charges were thwarted by undeliverable emails. Fairfax County Public Schools has launched an investigation into how Darren Thornton, 50, was able to keep his job as a counselor at Glasgow Middle School for 20 months after his arrest on charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in November 2020. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and others criticized the school system after police in Chesterfield County, where Thornton was arrested, said they informed school administrators in Fairfax County at the time of the arrest in 2020. Now, though, Chesterfield police say the emails they sent back in 2020 never went through. In a statement posted Tuesday on Facebook, Chesterfield County police Chief Jeffrey Katz said the email addresses his agency used had typos in them. “I think it is important not to lose sight of the fact that our staff caught Thornton (twice),” Katz said. “We made good faith efforts (twice) to ensure he was appropriately dealt with by the criminal justice system and his employer.” Thornton was arrested as part of an online sting when a police officer posing as a 17-year-old connected with Thornton over the internet.\n\nWashington\n\nGeorge: The Grant County Sheriff’s Office believes its deputies stopped a man from carrying out a mass shooting at the Gorge Amphitheater on Friday night. The sheriff’s office said people at the event and security personnel told them about 9 p.m. of a man in the parking lot near his vehicle, KOIN-TV reports. Witnesses saw the man inhale an unknown substance from a balloon and then load two 9 mm pistols from the trunk of his car, according to the sheriff’s office. Witnesses also told investigators the man put one gun in the waistband of his pants and the other in a holster that was outside his waistband. Witnesses say he then approached concertgoers and asked what time the concert ended and where they would be leaving the venue. The sheriff’s office said the man, identified as Jonathan Moody of Ephrata, Washington, was stopped by security outside the gates and disarmed. The sheriff’s office said no one was injured. After investigating, deputies arrested Moody on suspicion of one count of possession of a dangerous weapon and one count of unlawful carrying or handling of a weapon. Moody was lodged in the Grant County Jail. It wasn’t immediately known if he had a lawyer to comment on his behalf.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A rainy summer has set a record in the state capital. With a month still left in the summer, the 23.23 inches of rain that have fallen in Charleston since June 21 broke the mark of 23.13 inches set in 1958, the National Weather Service said. Nearly 4 inches of rain fell last week in the Charleston area. Flooding in parts of Kanawha and Fayette counties prompted Gov. Jim Justice to declare a state of emergency. Five of the 10 rainiest summers in Charleston have occurred this century. The others happened in 2003, 2006, 2013 and 2018, the weather service said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the Legislature asked a judge Tuesday to dismiss Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul’s lawsuit challenging Wisconsin’s 173-year-old abortion ban. Kaul filed the lawsuit in June after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision that essentially legalized abortion across the country. The ruling gave states the authority to regulate abortion on their own, putting Wisconsin’s ban back into play. The ban prohibits abortions in every instance except to save the mother’s life. Kaul’s lawsuit argues that the ban conflicts with a 1985 Wisconsin law that allows abortions before a fetus has grown enough that it could survive outside the womb. That point in time is unclear; some physicians say it’s about 20 weeks, others around 28 weeks. The attorney general also argues that the ban is unenforceable because it has become obsolete. The Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services, the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and former Democratic state Rep. Sheldeon Wasserman, who works as an obstetrician and gynecologist, have joined Kaul as plaintiffs in the case. Senate President Chris Kapenga, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMehieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, all named defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state has lost its holdout status in the monkeypox outbreak, with the Wyoming Health Department reporting Monday morning that a case has been detected in Laramie County, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Russian forces strike targets in western Ukraine, killing dozens at ...", "text": "Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country.\n\nThe attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n\nAs the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia’s relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.\n\nBut Russia’s war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv’s military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.\n\nA witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a “sudden clap” from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.\n\nLocal authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine’s Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a “terrorist attack” on peace and security “near the EU-NATO border.”\n\nThere were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO – unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.\n\n“Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,” Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. “Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.”\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,” Sullivan said.\n\nAmbulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nA senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia’s invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about reports of Russia’s request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, “I’ve never heard of that.”\n\nAs attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.\n\nZelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country’s delegation “has a clear task – to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nAmerican journalist killed in Ukraine\n\nHeavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain’s Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to “envelop” Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.\n\nRussian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia’s Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.\n\nBrent Renaud is pictured at the Peabody Awards Ceremony in New York City on 2015. Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nAmid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.\n\nRenaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.\n\nThe US State Department confirmed Renaud’s death on Sunday. “We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,” department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. “This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin’s indiscriminate actions.”\n\nSocial media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.\n\nTIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,” TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.\n\nUkrainians take to the streets to protest\n\nUkrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.\n\nResidents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation. From Telegram\n\nWaving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.\n\nIhor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show “Kherson is Ukraine” and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.\n\nBut the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city “can’t receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.”\n\n“Our main weapon is unity,” he added.\n\nIn recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the “Kherson People’s Republic.” If true, the move would mirror Moscow’s establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.\n\nPutin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.\n\nSchool demolished by Russian strike\n\nRussia’s air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.\n\nA school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.\n\nKim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. “Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,” Kim said.\n\nMissiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.\n\nIn the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been “massive shelling” of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.\n\nThe bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.\n\nUkrainian forces in Kyiv’s suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces’ attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Ukraine’s National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant’s electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.\n\nAs the devastation mounts, Zelenskysaid the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.\n\nMariupol’s city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.\n\nAs the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and “to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.”\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.\n\n“The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,” Vereshchuk said. “The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.”\n\nNew round of talks\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.\n\n“Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,” Podoliak said on Twitter. “Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.”\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.\n\nPodoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will “achieve concrete results.”\n\n“Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,” Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nThis comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said “significant progress” has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.\n\nTalks between Ukraine’s and Russia’s top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.\n\nIn Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.\n\nImages of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia’s riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.\n\nAccording to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Mohammed Tawfeeq Olga Voitovych Simone Mccarthy Tara John", "Tim Lister", "Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Olga Voitovych", "Simone Mccarthy", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/14/joshua-trees-flirty-juror-free-vasectomies-news-around-states/50834573/", "title": "Joshua trees, flirty juror: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The federal government on Wednesday said the state of Alabama illegally discriminates against children in foster care with behavioral and emotional disabilities. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a news release, said the state’s foster care program has illegally placed hundreds of students with disabilities into “segregated and inferior educational programs,” a direct violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. “Students with disabilities in Alabama’s foster care system are among the most vulnerable in the state’s care, and they deserve better than placement in segregated and inferior schools,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement. “The Civil Rights Division will defend every child’s right to equal educational opportunities in schools where they can be supported and challenged.” The department’s findings follow an investigation into allegations that the state denies children in foster care equal opportunity to basic educational services on the basis of disability. Gina Maiola, communications director for Gov. Kay Ivey, said in a statement that the Alabama State Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources have been “working proactively since 2018 to address the needs of our specialized treatment centers.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has indicated he will vote in favor of calling a convention to consider amending the state’s constitution. Candidates for governor at an Alaska Resource Development Council forum Tuesday were asked during a “lightning round” if they would be voting for a constitutional convention in next month’s general election. Candidates responded by raising “yes” or “no” signs, the Anchorage Daily News reports. Dunleavy and Republican Charlie Pierce raised “yes” signs. Former Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, and Les Gara, a Democrat, raised “no” signs. Voters are asked every 10 years if there should be a constitutional convention. While the question has in the past been soundly defeated, both sides of the debate have been preparing for a fight this year. Some convention supporters see an opening to push for one amid public frustration with years of political fighting over what size check should be paid to residents from Alaska’s oil-wealth fund. During a convention, delegates typically have free reign to propose revisions – or even entirely new constitutions – that would then go back to voters for ratification. Some of those pursuing a convention would like to restrict abortion or alter the process for selecting judges in a way that critics say could make the process more partisan.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state can move forward with the execution of death row inmate Murray Hooper next month, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. The high court granted the motion for a warrant of execution of the 76-year-old. He will die by lethal injection or gas in an execution scheduled for Nov. 16, according to the warrant signed by four justices. The other three recused themselves. Kelly Culshaw, an assistant federal public defender representing Hooper, reiterated that he has maintained his innocence in the double slayings on New Year’s Eve in 1980. Hooper was convicted and sentenced “based on corrupt police practices and unreliable witness testimony,” Culshaw said in a statement. “No physical evidence links him to the crime and Mr. Hooper’s execution should not be carried out until an analysis of key fingerprint and DNA evidence, which was scientifically unavailable at the time of his trial, has been completed,” she wrote. Hooper’s defense team filed a petition in September in Maricopa County Superior Court requesting post-conviction DNA and other forensic testing. Defense attorneys say a witness’s description of the assailants changed several times before she identified Hooper, who claimed not to be in Arizona at the time. They also allege criminal informants who helped implicate Hooper were influenced by incentives from the police.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The sounds of the DC and Marvel cinematic universes will be on display this weekend as the Fort Smith Symphony offers its “Symphonic Superheroes” concert. “It’s an exciting weekend because we have so much going on,” said John Jeter, symphony conductor. The concert is slated to begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at the ArcBest Performing Arts Center. Music from the movies “Robin Hood,” “X-Men,” “The Amazing Spider-Man,” “Wonder Woman,” “Mission Impossible III,” “Captain America,” “Batman/The Dark Knight,” “Transformers,” “Black Panther” and “Iron Man” will be featured. “It’s all very, very exciting stuff,” Jeter said. “The kids will really love it.” There is prominent brass and percussion parts in the symphony, adding drama to the sound, with African and Japanese percussion instruments in the mix too. The symphony will be followed by an after-party for audience members at the Bakery District with live music by the Kool Cats Jazz Quartet. And on Monday, fifth graders may get to see their first symphony with “Earquake” concerts for schoolchildren at the ArcBest PAC. It will be a busy day for the orchestra Monday, with the Indigenous composer chamber music concert at Propak on Garrison at 7 p.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state again pushed back its decision on whether to list the western Joshua tree as threatened after a unanimous vote Wednesday by the Fish and Game Commission. The decision to move back the vote until at least February comes months after the commission deadlocked on whether the native desert plant should be protected under the California Endangered Species Act. Since the tree is still under consideration to be listed as threatened, no one can remove it without authorization from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Before the commission’s split vote in June, the Department of Fish and Wildlife sent letters to Indigenous tribes with traditional ties to the area where the western Joshua trees live. That outreach resulted in six responses from tribal nations, said Director Chuck Bonham. In August, tribal members talked about the cultural and ecological significance of the tree on a Zoom call with Bonham and others. “I actually would love more time to keep the conversation alive with the nations themselves,” Bonham said. In 2019, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned for the tree to be listed as threatened in order to protect it from hotter temperatures, intensifying drought and development threats. Commissioners said they need more time to hear from tribal leaders and to allow tribal governments to consult again before the commission can make a final decision.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: A Utah-based Native American tribe that frequently has sparred with President Joe Biden criticized the White House again for not adequately consulting its leaders ahead of this week’s creation of a national monument on ancestral lands in Colorado. The Ute Indian Tribe is one of three Ute tribes in the West that share ancestral ties but operate independently. Representatives from the other two in Colorado – the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute – were on board with the plan and attended Wednesday’s ceremony with Biden but didn’t speak on stage. Biden and others addressed the significance of the land to tribes at length, and the White House’s official proclamation included a mention of Ute burial sites in the area. But the Ute Indian Tribe, which has nearly 3,000 members on lands in an area known for oil and gas operations in eastern Utah, claimed in a news release late Wednesday that it wasn’t on board with the plan. The tribe’s Business Committee, which serves as its governing body, said in the statement it was made aware of the new monument only a few days ago in a phone call with the White House, given scant details and little time to provide feedback. Melvin J. Baker, chairman of the Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council, noted that for centuries, the Camp Hale area was home to Ute people, and it remains culturally important to the Utes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: Two police officers shot dead Wednesday night were apparently drawn into an ambush by an emergency call about possible domestic violence, authorities said Thursday. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. State police said in a release that the 911 call the night prior about a dispute between two siblings appears to have been “a deliberate act to lure law enforcement to the scene” in Bristol. Bristol Police Sgt. Dustin Demonte and Officer Alex Hamzy were killed. Officer Alec Iurato was injured. Police said suspect Nicholas Brutcher, 35, was shot dead, and brother Nathan Brutcher was wounded. The surviving brother, 32, was hospitalized, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether he or his family had an attorney or someone else who can speak for them. The deadly encounter came during a week when at least 11 police officers have been shot around the country. Connecticut State Police said they were still working to answer many questions that remained about the confrontation. Neighbors said they heard two or three sets of gunshots, about 30 in all. “I heard a whole war going on behind me,” said Danny Rodriguez, who said he was outside his home across the street when the gunfire rang out. It was so intense that he could smell gunpowder in the air, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Anyone planning to drive through the city on Interstate 95 south this weekend will need to find a different route starting Friday morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation said. As part of the ongoing “Restore the Corridor” project, the highway will be closed between the U.S. Route 202 and the Second Street on-ramp from 9 a.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Tuesday. Drivers coming from Pennsylvania should use I-495 south to bypass Wilmington. All local traffic will be directed to exit I-95 onto U.S. Route 202 and then to take Delaware Route 141 south back onto I-95. Delays and heavier traffic are expected around all detours. By closing part of the highway, construction workers can pave and strip the road, install lighting and build guardrails more safely and quickly. And while it may inconvenience drivers, Department of Transportation spokesperson C.R. McLeod said the road closure represents the “final stretch of major work.” Construction on I-95 in Wilmington, which has been ongoing since early 2021, is slated to wrap up by the end of this year, which is earlier than expected. “The end is within sight,” McLeod said. A similar closure of I-95 north is slated for the last weekend of October.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court on Thursday against chemical manufacturer Velsicol Chemical LLC, claiming it violated city environmental laws by polluting a major waterway, the Anacostia River and the surrounding area for decades. In a complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, the city alleges that Velsicol produced a pesticide that contained chlordane and marketed it to low-income homeowners in the city from 1945 to 1988. That was the year the chemical was banned for sale in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency over health effects in humans, including tremors, convulsions and cancer. But Racine claimed at a press conference that Velsicol knew long before that that chlordane could cause cancer, as far back as 1959, yet still sold products that contained the chemical. Velsicol did not immediately return calls for comment. As recently as the 1960s, D.C. residents used the Anacostia River for recreation and food, but years of pollution from a variety of sources – sewage, chemical runoff and litter – made the river unusable. The lawsuit developed out of a decades­long effort to clean up the river, Racine said. Local environmentalists, like Matt Gravatt, chair of the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club, said the river is almost back to being safe for public use, but not yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday issued an executive order expanding voting access for the midterm elections in three counties where Hurricane Ian destroyed polling places and displaced thousands of people. The move, which followed requests from Lee, Charlotte and Sarasota counties and voting rights groups, comes as Florida begins to undertake a massive recovery from the Category 4 hurricane that hit Sept. 28 and leveled parts of the state’s southwest. The order extends the number of early voting days in the three counties and authorizes election supervisors to designate additional early voting locations, steps that allow voters to cast ballots at any polling place in their registered county from Oct. 24 through Nov. 8. Election supervisors can relocate or consolidate polling places if necessary. The order also waives training requirements for poll workers and suspends a signature requirement for voters requesting to have a mail ballot sent to an address different from the one election officials have on file. DeSantis has faced questions over what steps he would take to ensure voting access in the heavily damaged southwest part of the state, which has leaned conservative in recent elections. The Republican governor, who is up for reelection, has made tightening election laws a top priority over the past two years as he and others in the GOP reacted to ex-President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: An Atlanta-area sheriff stands accused of punishing detainees by having them strapped into a restraint chair for hours even though they posed no threat and obeyed instructions. Now a jury must decide whether he violated the men’s civil rights. A federal grand jury in April 2021 indicted Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill, saying he violated the civil rights of four people in his custody. Three more alleged victims were added in subsequent indictments. Prosecutors say placing the seven men in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment, and caused pain and bodily injury. Jury selection was set to begin Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last at least two weeks. Hill calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery on social media and in campaign ads. He has been a divisive figure – attracting both fans and critics – since he first became sheriff in 2005. This will be his second trial on criminal charges. The voters of Clayton County returned him to office in 2012 while he was under indictment, accused of using his office for personal gain – charges he ultimately beat. Hill and his lawyers have said his prosecution is baseless and politically motivated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An Oahu project aimed at at-risk youth has won a $20 million grant in a global challenge from the Kellogg Foundation, HawaiiNewsNow reports. Multiple nonprofit agencies running out of the Kawailoa Youth and Family Wellness Center will receive the money over the next eight years, providing services surrounding a juvenile correctional site, according to the outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks will likely start operating in early December, a U.S. Department of Energy official said Wednesday. Connie Flohr, manager of the Idaho Cleanup Project for the Energy Department’s Office of Environmental Management, told state officials the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory has successfully completed test runs with a simulant material. “We have every confidence that we will be operating in December,” she told members of the Leadership in Nuclear Energy Commission during an online meeting. The commission makes recommendations to the governor regarding policies to support the viability and mission of the Idaho National Laboratory and other nuclear industries in the state. Commission members, appointed by the governor, include state lawmakers, local government elected officials, university officials and others. The lab, one of 17 Energy Department national labs, is the nation’s top advanced nuclear energy research lab and one of the state’s largest employers with about 5,000 workers. It’s a huge economic driver in the state, especially in eastern Idaho, bringing in millions of federal research dollars.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Seven months after it purchased a former Pillsbury Mills plant, the nonprofit group responsible for clearing the property provided a first look at progress made on the site Wednesday prior to a public meeting. Chris Richmond, president of Moving Pillsbury Forward and a former Springfield fire marshal, hosted the tour of the vacant site, showing off a series of buildings deemed safe for showcasing to small groups. Richmond displayed several artifacts found during cleanup of the property conducted over the summer, including tools, a map of the property from 1966, handmade grain scoops and chairs, and an old Pillsbury’s Best flour sack. “The wrenches are the kind you would have seen pre-World War II,” Richmond said. “I’m sure these are 75 years or older.” Richmond and his organization completed their purchase of the property in March, with environmental testing and cleanup of the site being conducted throughout the summer. The property was home to a thriving grain and flour plant that had thousands of employees at its peak in the 1950s before a significant decline. When Pillsbury sold the plant to Cargill in 1991, about 350 workers were there, with 200 of them being transferred to Tennessee as part of a company restructuring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday that prevents the state from enforcing a Republican-backed abortion ban while it considers whether the ban violates the state constitution. The court said in the order that it was taking over appeals of a judge’s decision last month that blocked the law a week after it took effect. It denied a request from the state attorney general’s office to set aside the preliminary injunction and scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit filed by abortion clinic operators for Jan. 12. Owen County Judge Kelsey Hanlon blocked the law from being enforced, writing that “there is reasonable likelihood that this significant restriction of personal autonomy offends the liberty guarantees of the Indiana Constitution” and that the clinics will prevail in the lawsuit. The ban was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature on Aug. 5 and signed by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb. That made Indiana the first state to enact tighter abortion restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June. The five-member Indiana Supreme Court – all the justices were appointed by Republican governors – did not explain its decision. The order, signed by Chief Justice Loretta Rush, said “a majority” of the court agreed with its provisions but gave no further details.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Domestic violence deaths in the state are on the decline this year after spikes in 2020 and 2021. Between January and August, 12 people were killed in domestic violence incidents, the Iowa Attorney General’s Office announced. That compares to 17 deaths over the same period in 2021. Iowa had seen a spike in domestic violence fatalities over the prior two years, according to figures collected by the attorney general’s office. There were 17 deaths in all of 2020 – at that time the most Iowa had seen in a decade. More violent still was 2021, with 20 deaths in total. The deadliest year on record since 1995 was 2006, with 22 killings. State officials have attributed the 2020 and 2021 increases to the stresses on families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the Attorney General’s Crime Victim Assistance Division, noted that people in unsafe relationships had fewer options to cope with them under lockdown conditions. “Some victims can’t leave their homes, and services haven’t been as accessible,” Tibbetts Murphy said in a news release. “These issues have limited the ability to serve victims. And sadly, research has shown when services are limited, we see a rise in domestic violence homicides.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Alex Red Corn was dining out with his children one day in Salina when a bus full of student-athletes from Liberal High School pulled up and showed his children the kind of discrimination that still exists in dozens of Kansas high schools. “I was sitting at an Applebee’s, and the Liberal Redskins came into town,” he said. “A whole bus full of Liberal Redskins-themed stuff was surrounding us at the restaurant, and my kids were there, and there was a level of discomfort there.” But that’s a daily reality for the estimated 10,000 Kansas students who are Native American and either attend or are in the same athletic leagues of schools with disparaging, racist Native American imagery, said Red Corn, an assistant professor of educational leadership at Kansas State University and a member of the Osage Nation. Months after the Kansas State Board of Education helped organize a committee to address severe deficiencies in the education of and for Native American people, the group returned Tuesday with an initial proposal to have the state board formally recommend all Kansas high schools remove any Native American-themed mascot and imagery. The board had helped create the group after Education Commissioner Randy Watson made disparaging comments toward Native Americans in February.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Startup bourbon producer Jackson Purchase Distillery is boosting its investment. The company will increase its distilling operation investment in Fulton County in western Kentucky to nearly $26 million and create 54 full-time jobs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Jackson Purchase’s project has grown from an initially planned investment of $8.76 million and 30 jobs. Last year, the company’s management group acquired an unused distilling facility, the governor’s office said in a news release. To bolster the nearly complete distillery, company leaders began an expansion that will involve purchasing additional land, constructing barrel storage and making upgrades throughout the facility. “Kentucky’s bourbon and spirits industry continues to see tremendous growth,” Beshear said. “This is not possible without the support of companies like Jackson Purchase Distillery, which is tripling its original investment in this project and creating nearly double the number of quality jobs.” The distillery will produce in excess of 60,000 barrels annually once fully operational.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Transparency in reporting incidents of violence and other problems at the city’s long-troubled jail has improved recently, but only slightly, a federal judge told sheriff’s office officials Wednesday. U.S. District Magistrate Judge Michael North held a status conference on efforts to bring the Orleans Justice Center into compliance with mandated reforms. Those measures are required under a 2013 court-backed agreement involving the U.S. Justice Department, inmate advocates and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. North applauded the improvements, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports, but he warned Sheriff Susan Hutson that her administration still has a way to go in terms of transparency. North said the sheriff’s office has started sending the court weekly reports about jail incidents, including acts of violence, overdoses and suicide attempts. But he said more needs to be done. “We still have no information as to what’s being done to investigate these problems and why they continue to happen,” North said shortly before ordering the sheriff’s office to submit a proposal to the court for how it will share information about its investigations and prevention plans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A former Navy SEAL who’s seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree apologized for comparing federal fisheries regulators to rapists, saying the statement was “over the top.” Republican Ed Thelander was called out during a debate Wednesday evening for remarks he made earlier in the day attacking the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a rally for Maine’s lobster industry. “NOAA wants to rape you and your family, and they are saying pick a child,” he said. “You don’t negotiate with a rapist, and that’s what’s happening.” Pingree said during the debate that Thelander’s comments were not productive and dragged the discussion “down into the gutter.” “My comments were over the top, and I apologize for that,” Thelander said. “I’m very passionate about it. I love those families. I’m seeing the struggles they have, and nothing has been done about it.” Pingree, who lives in an island community on North Haven, disputed Thelander’s claim that nothing was being done as Maine officials fight regulations aimed at protecting right whales that could harm lobstermen. “Don’t say I’m not passionate about it,” she said. The debate in Maine’s 1st Congressional District touched on immigration, the economy, energy, abortion, education and other topics.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An appeals court refused Wednesday to intervene in a lower court’s decision to free a man who served more than 20 years in prison for the killing of a high school student, a case chronicled by the groundbreaking “Serial” podcast. The state Court of Special Appeals issued its order a day after prosecutors dropped charges against Adnan Syed in the 1999 killing of 18-year-old Hae Min Lee, saying DNA evidence excluded him as a suspect. Circuit Court Judge Melissa Phinn ruled last month that the state had violated its legal obligation to share evidence that could have bolstered Syed’s defense. Phinn ordered Syed’s release from prison and gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to retry him or drop the charges. Lee’s family asked the Court of Special Appeals – Maryland’s intermediate appellate court – to halt the case and suspend the deadline that Phinn set for prosecutors to decide whether to drop the charges. They argued they didn’t get adequate notice of the hearing at which Phinn ruled. A lawyer for Lee’s family said they wanted the judge to hold another hearing they could attend and address the court. But a three-judge panel from the appeals court rejected the family’s request in a two-page order. The panel gave Lee’s family 15 days to argue why their appeal isn’t moot given that the case against Syed has been dropped.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Common, America’s oldest public park, is getting a multimillion-dollar makeover that includes an expanded visitors’ center, more restrooms, additional sports facilities, and even a sit-down restaurant at the famed Frog Pond, city officials announced Wednesday. The goal is to make the 50-acre swath of green space in the heart of the city more welcoming, convenient, fun and accessible for both city residents and tourists. “Boston Common’s gorgeous tree-lined paths and open spaces have hosted so many moments marked in history, from shaping our collective conscience to celebrating our communities,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in a statement. “We’re excited to be sharing a plan that honors the Common’s history, reflects the community’s vision, and creates a space that will be more accessible, more resilient, and more inclusive for generations to come.” The Common was founded in 1634 and draws millions of people per year. It has been used as a place for public executions, as a pasture, and as a military training field, according to the nonprofit group Friends of the Public Garden, which helped develop the Boston Common Master Plan. More recently it has hosted civil rights marches, Vietnam War protests and a 1979 Catholic Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II and attended by an estimated 400,000 people during a soaking rainstorm. It was also the site of huge protests in 2020 against police brutality.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors raised concerns Wednesday about a female juror who apparently has been smiling at one of three men on trial in connection with a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020. Judge Thomas Wilson said he, too, noticed it and pledged to pay “close attention” to the juror. He said the expressions didn’t appear to be a reaction to testimony. “She is in my direct view,” Wilson said. “So I am often looking right at her while I’m listening to the witness testify. … I’ve seen smiles come out of her face. Not great big smiles but more of a small smirk.” The juror has been looking at Paul Bellar, 24, who was a member of a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen. Bellar, Joe Morrison and Pete Musico are charged in state court with providing material support for a terrorist act. The trial has lasted eight days so far. “Since the start of the trial – and we’re prepared to offer sworn testimony on this from two different witnesses – there’s been nonverbal communication” between a juror and Bellar, said Assistant Attorney General Bill Rollstin. He suggested that Bellar sent a signal Wednesday by clenching his fists and shaking them in an “affirmative way.” But Bellar’s attorney, Andrew Kirkpatrick, said that was a misinterpretation: Bellar was excited because the lawyer offered him Skittles candy for his birthday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to filing fraudulent insurance claims for a staged arson he attempted to portray as a politically motivated attack. Federal officials said Denis Molla, 30, of Brooklyn Center, falsely reported to law enforcement in September 2020 that someone had lit his camper on fire and that three unknown males were near his home when he heard an explosion. Molla told officials his garage door was vandalized with a spray-painted Antifa symbol and the words “Biden 2020” and “BLM.” He claimed his camper was targeted because it displayed a Trump 2020 flag. Police discovered that Molla started his own property on fire and spray-painted the graffiti on his own garage. He then submitted multiple insurance claims seeking coverage for the damage to his garage, camper, vehicles and residence caused by the fire, court documents show. Molla also created and allowed others to start two GoFundMe accounts to benefit Molla and his family. In total, he submitted more than $300,000 in fraudulent insurance claims, of which he received approximately $61,000 from his insurance company. Molla also received more than $17,000 from individual donors via GoFundMe. He pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some legislators say they will renew efforts to clarify that people in Mississippi may possess chemical strips to detect traces of the deadly drug fentanyl. A bill to decriminalize the test strips died early this year. But the state House Drug Policy Committee chairman, Rep. Lee Yancy, R-Brandon, now supports the effort, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he’ll introduce a bill during the legislative session that begins in January. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more lethal than heroin, has pushed drug overdoses to new highs across America. Delivering test strips to people is part of a strategy known as “harm reduction” that gives appropriate products to drug users to prevent accidental overdoses. If someone is about to take an illicit drug, they brush part of the substance against a test strip to see if it contains trace amounts of fentanyl. Opponents say the strategy encourages drug users to continue an addiction, but health professionals who testified at a legislative committee meeting Monday said it’s a useful mitigation strategy that can save lives. Dr. Daniel Edney, Mississippi’s state health officer, said he wants people who use drugs to seek professional help to end their addiction, but they need “harm reduction” tools in the short term. “The test strips are not going to encourage people to use drugs,” Edney said. “Those who are going to use drugs are going to continue to use drugs, anyway.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri is offering free vasectomies to uninsured patients in Springfield on Nov. 4 and in Joplin on Nov. 5. Vasectomy appointments will be offered from 9 a.m. to noon and from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. To be eligible, patients must complete a pre-screening exam by Nov. 3. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, leading Missouri to ban abortions, PPSLR saw demand for male sterilization procedures increase. “Since the Dobbs decision, we have seen an increasing number of male-bodied people coming and requesting this service,” Dr. Margaret Baum said. “We performed 142 vasectomies in 2021; already this year we’ve done close to 200 in 2022, and the year’s not out yet.” Baum said patients from across the state have been traveling to the clinic in St. Louis. In May, she began to provide vasectomies at the Springfield Planned Parenthood health center. Baum performs female sterilization procedures as well. “It’s just really important that these services are offered without judgement, without stigma, so that people who are informed about the procedure can make a good decision and decide if it’s the right thing for them, their relationship and their family,” Baum said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The commission that oversees the Montana State Library voted Wednesday to accept a new logo with colors pulled from the state flag after one commissioner criticized an earlier color scheme as reminding her of a rainbow LGBTQ pride flag. Commissioners voted 4-2 to approve the new logo but also decided to pause spending any additional money on the rebranding rollout until December, when they can consider additional information about how that money would be spent. The commission had voted 4-3 in early July to reject the initial logo after the library paid a company $130,000 in donated library foundation funds to create it as part of a rebranding effort to educate residents about the services the state library provides. Commissioner Tammy Hall said in June that the original colors brought to mind a pride flag, something she argued could set up an unnecessary political battle as the library seeks funding from the likely Republican-controlled Legislature next year. Commissioners agreed last month to consider a new color scheme. The predominantly blue logo is shaped like a hexagon and is meant to look like information is coming in through a prism and being reflected out as knowledge in four colored triangles. The rejected logo had triangles colored an orange-red, yellow, medium green and bright blue. The new logo has triangles colored red, bright yellow, yellow-green and a more muted blue – all pulled from the state seal on the Montana flag.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Average ACT scores for this year’s high school graduates across the state hit their lowest point in decades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The mean composite score on the college entrance exam for seniors in the class of 2022 was just 19.8, dropping below 20 – the maximum score is 36 – for the first time since 1991, according to the newspaper. Nebraska education officials said a downward trend in scores began five years ago, meaning it can’t be chalked up solely to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on learning.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Less than a month before Election Day, 14 members of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Laxalt’s family sent a letter endorsing his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. “We staunchly believe that Catherine is well equipped with her own ‘Nevada grit’ – a quality that she will take forward in representation of our home state for six more years across the halls of Congress,” the letter said. First obtained by The Nevada Independent, the letter does not mention Laxalt by name. Instead, it talks of Cortez Masto’s understanding of “the daily realities of dogged hard work” and mentions her experience in public education as well as her commitment to law enforcement. The family members also wrote that Cortez Masto’s career demonstrates she is “an authentic advocate of Nevada.” It marks the second time that some of Laxalt’s family has endorsed his opponent. During his unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2018, a dozen family members endorsed Democrat Steve Sisolak in an op-ed to the Reno Gazette-Journal. That letter more explicitly criticized Laxalt, saying he “leveraged and exploited” the family name throughout his campaign.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: The state Department of Environmental Services issued an immediate boil-water order Wednesday for customers of the Rye Water District after samples detected E. coli bacteria. The department wrote in its advisory Wednesday: “All consumers are being notified by the system and DES staff is working with the system to resolve the situation.” The Rye Water District was beginning the process of notifying district customers Wednesday afternoon. District superintendent Arik Jones noted that the district had yet to determine ways to assist affected users, such as by providing them with bottled water. Rye residents are distributed water by three purveyors, according to Jones: the Rye Water District, the city of Portsmouth and the Aquarion Water Company. The Department of Environmental Services’ boil order affects Rye Water District customers living in town only, he said. “This does not affect Aquarion customers,” Jones said. “It does not affect anybody served by Portsmouth.” The Rye Water District services roughly 1,600 connections and about 4,000 total customers. Jones said the boil-water advisory does not include Greenland residents, whom the district serves using Portsmouth water.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Lawmakers unveiled new legislation Thursday to rewrite the state’s firearm carry laws after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June expanding gun rights. Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin and Senate President Nicholas Scutari, surrounded by other lawmakers and red T-shirt-clad Moms Demand Action supporters, said the new measure will bar permit holders from carrying in schools, polling places, bars, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, airports, casinos and child care facilities. It also sets up a new requirement that permit holders carry insurance to protect against accidental discharge, coverage that Scutari said is already available in insurance marketplaces. The bill increases permitting, though the exact amount wasn’t immediately clear. The funds will be put toward compensation for crime victims under the legislation. The measure also calls for permit holders to undergo gun safety training and would set up a vetting process that requires non-family references to vouch for applicants. It would disqualify applicants with past violations of restraining orders and other “character of temperament” concerns, though just how those issues would be defined wasn’t immediately clear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: An expert in the field of Indigenous art has been named as the executive director of the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture. Pollyanna “Polly” Nordstrand, who is Hopi, will take on her new role next month. She will oversee a team of curators, anthropologists and archaeologists who are responsible for the preservation and interpretation of objects and works of art that represent Native people from the American Southwest and northern Mexico. “It is an exciting time to step into this leadership position as MIAC envisions its place as a 21st century museum with new exhibitions and expanded partnerships with tribal communities,” she said in a statement. Nordstrand, selected following a national search, is coming from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas, where she was its first curator of Native American art. In New Mexico, she’ll manage an anthropology library and archives as well as the Center for New Mexico Archaeology, the state’s archaeological repository. Nordstrand began working in the museum world around 1990 as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act came into effect. She said her approach to museums has been shaped by the increasing collaboration between tribes and institutions, and she has advocated for more equity and inclusion in museums.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed the state to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions. The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them. The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby’s order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state’s motion. Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts. The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn’t ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square. Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect. “My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Two history-making Black politicians and country music star Eric Church were among the six latest recipients of the state’s highest civilian honor announced Thursday. On Nov. 15, Gov. Roy Cooper will present the North Carolina Awards, which were created over 60 years ago to recognize significant contributions to the state and the country in several fields. Church, a native of Granite Falls, has received many Grammy nominations, among other industry awards. Other new recipients include U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, of Warren County, who was the first African American woman to represent North Carolina in Congress when she took office in 1992. She was also the state’s first Black representative since 1901. Former lawmaker Mickey Michaux of Durham served in the Legislature for more than 45 years, almost all of that time in the House, where he served as the chief budget writer in the late 2000s. He was appointed a U.S. attorney in 1977, becoming the first African American in such a role in the South since Reconstruction, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. Other recipients are Dr. Priya S. Kishnani, a professor and researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine; Stanley Riggs, a longtime East Carolina University marine geologist and expert on the coast and climate change; and journalist David Zucchino, a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill who received a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for his book on the 1898 overthrow of Wilmington’s government by white supremacists.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: More than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosive materials have been recovered in a residence in northwestern North Dakota, authorities said Wednesday. Police said multiple chemicals and powders were also found in the apartment in Williston, located in the North Dakota oil patch near the Montana border. No arrests have been made, although police say they have identified a person of interest. Bomb squads from Williston, Minot and Bismarck were disposing of the explosive materials at the Williston landfill. The process was suspended Wednesday afternoon due to high winds and fire danger. Police said explosions could be heard in some parts of the city as the devices were detonated.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which a probate judge rejected a transgender woman’s request to correct her birth certificate, leading to a split in court rulings and guidance on the issue. Attorneys for the Clark County woman argue the judge’s ruling, upheld by the 2nd Ohio District Court of Appeals, runs counter to a federal court decision, an Ohio Department of Health certificate change process, a Supreme Court probate form allowing for gender corrections, and procedures in more than a dozen other Ohio probate courts. The Clark County judge improperly ruled that nothing in state law gives probate judges authority to correct gender on a birth certificate unless it was originally made in error, according to an Aug. 1 court filing by the woman’s attorneys asking the high court to hear the case. The attorneys also noted that the state Health Department updated its process to allow for birth certificate corrections after a federal court in 2020 found unconstitutional Ohio’s rule prohibiting changes to gender on birth certificates. In addition, the state Supreme Court issued a form in August 2021 allowing probate courts to correct gender under state law, the attorneys said. The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 Tuesday to accept the Clark County case.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A district attorney debate took a bizarre turn Tuesday when the Republican candidate accused his Democratic opponent of being complicit in the disappearance and possible murder of two people. Kevin Calvey, an Oklahoma County commissioner, made the accusation toward the end of the hourlong livestreamed event. “Two Oklahomans are missing and may have been murdered because Vicki Behenna was willing to submit fake documents to a federal court to get her crooked client out of prison,” Calvey said to audible gasps in the auditorium. Behenna, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, denied the accusation. “It doesn’t surprise me that Mr. Calvey would make these statements,” Behenna said. “He is a career politician who has created a false narrative for his own political gain. This is something politicians do. This is not something a district attorney does.” Earlier in the debate, the two clashed over who is to blame for the problems at the aging Oklahoma County jail and the prosecution of police officers for fatal shootings. Both questioned each other’s integrity and fitness for the job throughout what was their only scheduled debate. They agreed that the death penalty should be rarely sought and that possession of small amounts of marijuana should be decriminalized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in at least four counties – Douglas, Klamath, Lane and Columbia – have complained to local election officials about people knocking on their doors, questioning residents and looking for evidence of 2020 voter fraud. Klamath County Clerk Rochelle Long issued a statement last month after residents called her office asking if the group was from the elections office, KGW reports. “I wanted to make it clear they were not from our office,” Long said. “We don’t go door to door. We don’t ask you how you voted.” Long warned that people may seem official and identify as from an integrity group. Long couldn’t point to any one person or group responsible for the effort. Election officials across the country have received similar complaints about people going door to door hunting for proof the 2020 election was fraudulent. While ex-President Donald Trump continues to argue the election was stolen, a mountain of evidence shows otherwise. “What these folks are doing is simply out trying to gather data in an unofficial way, and then unfortunately we’re seeing people misusing that data to try and spread the big lie,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said. “The election in 2020 was safe and secure in all 50 states.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two supporters of then-President Donald Trump arrested after driving a Hummer with guns and ammunition to a site where votes were being counted in November 2020 were convicted of weapons charges Wednesday but acquitted of election interference. Prosecutors argued that Vets for Trump co-founder Joshua Macias and co-defendant Antonio LaMotta, both of Virginia, planned a mass shooting in Philadelphia as the outcome of the presidential election remained uncertain. However, Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons rejected that theory, finding the men guilty only of bringing weapons to the city without a permit Nov. 5, 2020. LaMotta is separately charged with federal misdemeanor offenses stemming from his alleged illegal entry of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Both men remain free on bail pending a scheduled sentencing in December, when they face a possible sentence of probation to 18 months in jail, defense lawyer William J. Brennan said. “The commonwealth has presented no evidence to show that they came here to interfere with an election,” Brennan, who represents Macias, said after the one-day nonjury trial. “They came, they stared at a building, they talked to some police officers, and they didn’t bother anybody.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island police departments are poised to spend $16million in state and federal grants to equip police officers with body cameras and cover the costs of managing and operating the equipment. The architects of the Statewide Body-Worn Camera Program announced the grant awards to 42 police organizations Wednesday as Rhode Island moved closer to a deployment of 1,773 cameras – roughly a camera for every front-line police officer, according to Attorney General Peter Neronha. “That is a lot of law-enforcement officers (who) will now have the tools to bring us into the century in which we are operating,” Neronha said. State police Col. Darnell Weaver described the grant announcements as a culminating moment after months of coordination and planning work by police leaders and their agencies. “Cameras will add transparency, provide accountability and give a point of view, of perspective, to every police contact,” he said. The grant money was apportioned to finance the program for five years. The awarding of the money carries significance beyond finances. Police organizations that receive the money must comply with a detailed set of regulations on the use and operation of body cameras.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison over comments she made to police during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020 will not receive a lesser sentence, a judge has ruled. A jury this spring found Brittany Martin, 34, of Sumter, guilty of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner. Martin’s attorneys pushed for the sentence to be reconsidered and expressed concern about her pregnancy and health. Racial justice groups also got involved. In an Oct. 5 order, Judge R. Kirk Griffin pointed to Martin’s prior criminal convictions that he said contributed to her original sentence. In November 2020, an Iowa judge sentenced Martin to probation for leaving the scene of an injury and willfully causing bodily harm after her teenage son accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Griffin also noted previous convictions across multiple states for shoplifting, public disorderly conduct and possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Sumter County Assistant Solicitor Bronwyn McElveen said in a September filing that Martin has been on probation at least six times. “Probation has not been a deterrent to further criminal activities for the Defendant,” Griffin wrote in his order. “An active prison sentence was appropriate in this instance.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday authorized its staff to begin reviewing an application for a pipeline designed to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol refineries to an underground site in Illinois, assessing a filing fee of up to $400,000. The pipeline is the second proposed in the state. Both projects would pump carbon dioxide to sequestration sites where it would be buried thousands of feet underground. The one before the Public Utilities Commission – proposed by Navigator CO2 – would connect ethanol refineries across the Great Plains to a site in Illinois. The commission’s staff found that it could cost over $270,000 to review Navigator CO2’s application, which was submitted last month. Navigator CO2 agreed to covering a filing fee of up to $400,000. “It needs to be a quality evaluation and not have that cost fall back on the taxpayers,” said Kristen Edwards, a staff attorney for the commission. The pipeline projects, spurred by federal tax credits, promise to help in the fight against climate change by storing carbon dioxide rather than letting it be emitted into the atmosphere. But environmental activists have also pointed out the technology has struggled to get off the ground and allows emission-heavy industries to avoid taking drastic steps to cut greenhouse gases.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett has taken a plea deal after he was charged with driving under the influence after leaving a bar in June. In a statement, Hargett said he offered a best interest plea in the case Thursday, which amounts to pleading guilty while maintaining innocence. The Republican said his attorney believes he had a “strong case” to argue, but Hargett said he wanted to “accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.” “It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,” he said. The plea deal includes a $350 fine, a DUI school requirement, and having his driver’s license restricted for a year, news outlets reports. According to a report by a Tullahoma Police Department officer, an officer on June 18 pulled over the car Hargett was driving after watching it leave a bar and swerve over lane markings several times. The officer wrote that Hargett smelled like an “intoxicant,” had glassy eyes and kept saying, “Yes, sir,” at inappropriate times when he had not been asked a question. Hargett performed poorly on a field sobriety test, and a passenger in the car – who was not named – said the two had been drinking four hours earlier, the report said. Hargett agreed to a blood sample. Hargett has said he had been at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: Prosecutors asked a jury Wednesday to sentence a woman to death for killing a pregnant woman and stealing her unborn daughter from her womb. The appeal came as the penalty phase of Taylor Parker’s capital murder trial began for the October 2020 murder of Reagan Simmons-Hancock and theft of her unborn baby. The Bowie County jury previously found Parker guilty of capital murder. Prosecutor Kelley Crisp told jurors that the evidence would show Parker, 29, faked a pregnancy and repeatedly lied before killing Simmons-Hancock, 21, at the woman’s New Boston home Oct. 9, 2020, to get the infant she claimed to have been carrying. The baby also died. Parker’s attorneys hope to persuade the jury to spare Parker’s life and let her serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Defense attorney Jeff Harrelson said they would show that Parker was mentally ill.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The two candidates challenging U.S. Rep. Burgess Owens in a suburban congressional race laid into the first-term Republican on Wednesday evening for announcing at the eleventh hour that he wouldn’t participate in the sole general election debate. Democrat Darlene McDonald and United Utah Party’s January Walker both accused Owens of being a coward for skipping it and cast doubt on his reasoning – that he took issue with the moderator. Owens’ absence reflects a trend emerging in politics nationwide: While running attack ads and speaking to friendly media outlets, candidates and their consultants are deciding to minimize debate appearances or shirk them altogether. Owens said Wednesday afternoon that he wouldn’t participate because the commission had chosen Salt Lake Tribune editor Lauren Gustus as moderator. He was outraged in April 2021 when the newspaper published an editorial cartoon satirizing remarks he made about immigration and people crossing the border illegally. The sketch likened his remarks about immigrants entering people’s neighborhoods after crossing the border to Ku Klux Klan rhetoric. The cartoon garnered pushback from Utah’s entire congressional delegation. “I will not, in good conscience, have anything to do with the racist Salt Lake Tribune,” he said in a statement published on Facebook and YouTube.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: A drop of blood that was subjected to modern DNA testing enabled Vermont State Police detectives to make an arrest in the 1989 murder of a Danby couple found stabbed to death in their home, police said. Michael Anthony Louise, 79, was arrested Thursday in Syracuse, New York, on two counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of George Peacock, 76, and Catherine Peacock, 73, police said. The Peacocks were found dead Sept. 17, 1989. There were no signs of forced entry or items of significance having been removed from the house. Louise, who was married to one of the Peacocks’ daughters, was identified as a suspect about two weeks later. Investigators at the time developed circumstantial evidence tying Louise to the killings, police said. Detectives were unable to establish a conclusive link until forensic testing in May 2020 confirmed a DNA match to George Peacock in a spot of blood found inside Louise’s car in October 1989. The blood sample had been tested previously, but earlier tests were inconclusive. Authorities did not say why it took two years to make the arrest following the DNA match but said more information would be released when Louise is arraigned.\n\nVirginia\n\nDinwiddie: Three students and a teacher were taken to hospitals Wednesday after a fire broke out during a demonstration in a high school chemistry classroom, officials said. When the fire broke out in the classroom at Dinwiddie High School, the fire alarm was pulled, and all students were evacuated from the building, Dinwiddie County Public Schools officials said in a statement. A teacher was taken to a local hospital, and three students were taken to VCU Medical Center, officials said. Officials didn’t release details of their conditions. One student was treated at the scene and released. The cause of the fire is under investigation, officials said. Students were dismissed early, and Thursday was designated an asynchronous learning day, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Poor communication, deception, bad judgment and a lack of leadership contributed to tension, violence and killings in Seattle in 2020, according to a review of the city’s response to racial injustice demonstrations that year. Seattle’s inspector general, Lisa Judge, released the 81-page review Tuesday. It focuses on 23 days in June, shortly after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis led to protests across the U.S., The Seattle Times reports. Earlier reports by her office looked at the Seattle Police Department’s crowd control policies and on rebuilding community trust. On June 8, 2020, police abandoned the East Precinct building in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood in an attempt to defuse tension with protesters. The demonstrators used the opportunity to declare an eight-block “cop-free” zone known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The inspector general’s office concluded the occupation revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the city administration, led by then-Mayor Jenny Durkan, and police department, led by then-Police Chief Carmen Best. It also found police brass misled the public, exaggerated dangers posed by protesters to justify leaving the precinct, and employed a racist ruse in an apparent attempt to frighten and intimidate thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Students in kindergarten through 12th grade across the state have been invited to enter the First Lady Student Ornament Competition this fall. First lady Cathy Justice is asking all students to participate in the 18th annual event. It is open to students in public and private schools as well as those who are home-schooled. Students are asked to create a “Nutcracker”-themed ornament for a tree to be displayed at the Culture Center in Charleston during the holidays, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice’s office. There will be four divisions according to grade, and a winning class will be chosen from each division. The winning ornaments will be donated in January to the West Virginia State Museum. The four winning classes will receive a gift card to help buy supplies for their class. The ornaments and Christmas tree will be unveiled in early December in conjunction with Joyful Night. Entries may be mailed to Elizabeth Yeager, Department of Arts, Culture and History, The Culture Center, 1900 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305. Include phone number, email, mailing address, teacher name, school and class. The ornaments must be received by Nov. 18.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials estimate the state’s wolf population currently stands at about 970 animals, demonstrating that a much-maligned February 2021 hunting season had little impact on the population as a whole. Wisconsin Public Radio reports Department of Natural Resources officials released their latest population estimates at a board meeting last month and said they estimate between 812 and 1,193 wolves currently roam the state, with 972 likely the best estimate. Conservationists feared that a February 2021 hunting season would devastate the population after hunters killed 218 wolves in just three days, about 100 more wolves than the DNR allowed. Conservationists and wolf lovers called the hunt a slaughter. But the new numbers indicate the season had little effect on the population, which stood at roughly 1,100 wolves before the hunt began. The DNR planned to hold another hunt in November 2021, but a Dane County judge placed that season on hold in October 2021. A federal judge this past February restored protections for gray wolves across most of the country, preventing states from holding wolf hunts. Wisconsin’s current wolf management plan, which dates back to 1999, calls for capping the population at 350 wolves. The DNR is working to update the plan but hasn’t released anything yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nGreen River: A new soda ash mining operation is planned near an existing site outside the city, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. A subsidiary of the Ciner Group, based in Turkey, plans its new Project West development not far from the Pacific Soda mine and said it expected to bring in up to 2,000 temporary jobs during construction, with 300 permanent positions once the mine is operational, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/06/01/corridor-death-jumping-worms-dolphin-danger-news-around-states/50310719/", "title": "'Corridor of death', jumping worms: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: In what’s being touted as a major victory for clean water advocates, a Birmingham-based coal company has agreed to meet environmentalists’ demands and clean up an abandoned mine site on the Locust Fork tributary of the Black Warrior River. A consent decree signed last month by Drummond Co. Inc., a coal mining and processing company that dates back to 1935, and the Black Warrior Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court will require the company to remediate the long-shuttered Maxine Mine site near the town of Praco. The consent decree calls for elimination of the discharges of acid, sediment, and toxic, heavy metals, among other pollutants, that have been flowing into the Locust Fork for decades. “The rulings in this case and the consent decree itself are critical to protecting the Black Warrior River from harmful legacy impacts of coal mining, and set a precedent for polluters throughout the state,” said a news release from Barry Brock, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented Black Warrior Riverkeeper in this case. The consent decree requires Drummond to pay $2.65 million in court costs and $1 million for a supplemental environmental project to mitigate the effects of past pollution, plus set aside funds to operate treatment systems for at least 30 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has entered a contract with a former Dunleavy aide for up to $50,000 in part to advise the administration on what legal fights to pursue against the federal government. The contract with Strategic Synergies LLC was signed in April and released by Dunleavy’s office last week. Brett Huber is listed on the contract as the firm’s sole owner. The contract period is for April 25 through Oct. 24. Alaska has long had a contentious relationship with the federal government over lands and resource development and other issues. The state has a history of pushing back in areas where it thinks the federal government is overreaching. Huber was Dunleavy’s campaign manager in 2018 and an aide to Dunleavy following the Republican’s election. Huber went on the manage an unsuccessful campaign in 2020 against a voter initiative that ends party primaries and institutes ranked choice voting for general elections. He was brought back to the administration last year as a senior policy advisor for “statehood defense.” Huber left work in state government April 2, said Patty Sullivan, a Dunleavy spokesperson. She said the position Huber held within the administration “has not been filled, and existing staff cannot perform the unique work.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cities across metro Phoenix have partnered with the Salt River Project to figure out how best to increase water storage on the Verde River. In the long run, the partners want to offset the declining capacity of Horseshoe Reservoir by raising the height of the Bartlett Dam, which sits about 20 miles downstream, to store that amount of water and then some. The SRP and 20 partners are working with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on the effort. The partnership is kicking off a four-year study into the feasibility of modifying the Bartlett Dam. Congress authorized the study last year, after a two-year-long SRP and Reclamation appraisal study, the Arizona Capitol Times reports. Ron Klawitter, a senior principal at SRP, said accumulating sediment at Horseshoe Reservoir has led to the loss of more than 45,749 acre-feet of water storage, about one-third of the reservoir’s original capacity. An acre foot contains 325,851 gallons. Exploring how to address that loss, the feasibility study will look at the impacts of raising the height of the 287-foot Bartlett Dam by between 62 feet and 97 feet. If the dam were raised by 97 feet, that would increase its capacity to 628,000-acre feet from its current 178,186 acre-feet.\n\nArkansas\n\nHuntsville: Ronnie Hawkins, a brash rockabilly star from Arkansas who became a patron of the Canadian music scene after moving north and recruiting a handful of local musicians later known as The Band, has died. His wife, Wanda, confirmed to The Canadian Press that Hawkins died Sunday morning after an illness. He was 87. “He went peacefully, and he looked as handsome as ever,” she said by telephone. Born just two days after Elvis Presley, the Huntsville native known to friends as “The Hawk” (he also nicknamed himself “The King of Rockabilly” and “Mr. Dynamo”) was a hell-raiser with a big jaw and a stocky build. He had minor hits in the 1950s with “Mary Lou” and “Odessa” and ran a club in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where acts included such early rock stars as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty. Hawkins didn’t have the gifts of Presley or Perkins, but he did have ambition and an eye for talent. He first performed in Canada in the late ’50s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse. With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-’60s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves The Band.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans. Legislators advanced a bill last week to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes needed “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The California Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Rescuers have recovered the body of a second victim after a boat carrying 13 people capsized on a lake over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife rescue team located the body Tuesday morning in 107 feet of water at Lake Pueblo State Park after an all-night search, the state agency said in a statement. The 11 others on the boat survived. The Pueblo County coroner plans to release the victim’s identity after next of kin are notified. The eight children and three adults were on the large, flat boat near a picnic area at Lake Pueblo State Park when witnesses reported high winds apparently overturned the boat Sunday evening. The second victim, 38-year-old Jessica Prindle, of the community of Pueblo West, died at the scene, the coroner’s office said. The survivors were treated for hyperthermia at hospitals, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. Park manager Joe Stadterman said the accident “underscores the importance of being extremely careful around the water.” “If you are on or even near the water, we strongly urge you to wear a life jacket,” he said. Lake Pueblo is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases – known as “gifting” – could now carry a heavy price tag in the state. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year. Thousands of people have attended the events, often paying a fee to be admitted, and exchanged cannabis-related products for other items or received them along with the purchase of an item such as a T-shirt. The Connecticut Post reports cannabis advocates say the bill penalizes people for doing something that’s now legal in the state. The legislation’s supporters say it still allows friends and family to gift cannabis as long as no money is exchanged.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The opening trial day in the criminal corruption case against the state auditor came to an abrupt halt Tuesday when the judge decided to give attorneys more time to consider issues raised by defense arguments that the indictment against Auditor Kathy McGuiness is defective. Judge William Carpenter Jr. ordered a halt to the proceedings after expressing concern about arguments made by defense attorney Steve Wood and the prosecution’s response to those arguments. Wood argued in a Wilmington courtroom that the indictment should be dismissed because it fails to allege where McGuiness’ supposed crimes occurred. Wood said venue regarding where an alleged offense occurred is among essential elements required by Delaware law in an indictment. McGuiness lives in Sussex County, and her office is in the capital, Dover, in Kent County, but prosecutors brought the case in New Castle County. “Nothing happened here,” said Wood, who rejected prosecution arguments that jurisdiction in New Castle County – or any county for that matter – is appropriate because McGuiness is a statewide elected official. Deputy Attorney General Maria Knoll argued the indictment is sufficient for trial because McGuiness serves all three counties, and her alleged crimes affected all three counties. The judge appeared skeptical of that argument.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With signs in hand after traveling from afar, thousands of people made their way to see D.C.’s annual Memorial Day parade Monday afternoon – the first parade held since the pandemic began, WUSA-TV reports. Some families traveled from across the country to be in the city for the parade’s return and to pay a visit to monuments around town. Area bands were in full gear in the sweltering heat to honor the men and women who died in service to their country. Rick Johnson, a retired Marine who served for 22 years, said he hopes those who came out take time to understand the true meaning of the day. “We as Americans need to truly understand what being free is and what the American flag truly represents,” he said. A Virginia woman, who asked to only go by Marlene, said though she’s lived in Arlington for 20 years, this is the first time she was able to give her thanks in person and honor those who are no longer here. As the bands played familiar tunes, and veterans passed by, Chris Stockwell, an Army veteran, said he is thankful for those who chose America and choose it every day. “Not everybody goes out there and serves, but those that do, we need to show support for those people,” Stockwell said. “They go out there and give their all to this country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Detectives have arrested an 18-year-old man after receiving a tip that he threatened a mass shooting at a school in a social media post. Corey Anderson’s post showed him with a handgun, a rifle and a tactical-style vest along with a caption that said: “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. Anderson was arrested at his home near Tampa on Sunday and charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. “This type of threat is unacceptable. This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. The sheriff said his agency will “do everything within our power” to track down anyone who makes school threats. “Protecting our students is our greatest priority,” Chronister said in the release. “We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.” Deputies discovered that the weapons in the photo were airsoft guns, the news release said. Anderson was booked into jail and later released on bond, jail records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The district attorney of coastal Georgia’s largest county has become the latest prosecutor in the state to say she’ll generally stop prosecuting misdemeanor marijuana cases involving possession of less than an ounce of the drug. Like other prosecutors, police chiefs and sheriffs who have stopped marijuana enforcement, Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones cited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to test for small amounts of marijuana unless other felony charges are involved. “Without a verified test, the state cannot prove that the accused violated the law,” Jones said in a statement. She also cited Georgia’s 2019 law that made hemp farming illegal, saying it’s hard to tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. The change began immediately. Officials in other jurisdictions including the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties, as well as Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County, have made similar announcements since 2019. “Disposing of low-level petty offenses that do not threaten public safety and do not involve a victim allows the state to focus already-limited resources on the serious cases that do,” Jones said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The former head of the Hawaii National Guard has been chosen to be the city’s new police chief. The Honolulu Police Commission chose retired Army Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan from among four finalists. Logan takes over from interim Chief Rade Vanic. Logan retired from the military in December 2019. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Honolulu police officer for 20 years. The department is still recovering from the 2019 conviction of former chief Louis Kealoha after he used his law enforcement power to frame his then-wife’s uncle for stealing their mailbox. He’s serving a seven-year federal prison sentence. His wife, a former city prosecutor, is serving 13 years. Logan said he was “just as surprised as anyone” by the decision, and his goal was to motivate, inspire and mentor people in the department. “I have to make myself available to the public to get their insights and answer their questions and concerns and show that the department ... is going to help them in what they would like in their community,” he told reporters after his selection. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi congratulated Logan and said building back public trust and restoring morale within the department need to be top priorities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Just under a third of the state’s registered voters cast ballots in the May 17 primary election, nearly matching the percentage that voted in the 2018 primary. Including new election-day voter registrations, 32.4% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2022 primary, the Idaho Press reports. That compares to 32.6% of registered voters who participated in the 2018 primary. In both of those primaries, there were hotly contested races for governor. Gubernatorial races normally guide turnout numbers, said former longtime Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. “If you get a third, 33%, that’d be a great turnout. That’s a sad commentary on our process,” Ysursa said, “especially when the whole ballgame’s in the primary.” Idaho is a strongly Republican state, and so the primary election is generally a strong predictor of the general election outcomes. Voter turnout in the state’s primary has been stagnant or declining for years since peaking in 1972 with more than 58% of registered voters casting ballots. Turnout was high that year because it was the first time residents between the ages of 18 and 20 were allowed to vote. “That was a big deal,” said Andy Brunelle, a retired Forest Service employee who worked for the state and tracked voter turnout as an editor for the Idaho Blue Book for many years, starting in the late 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An attempted murder charge has been filed after an attack on the “Walking Man,” a 75-year-old homeless man who over years has become a recognized figure in downtown Chicago. Joseph Kromelis was badly burned while resting on Lower Wabash Avenue last Wednesday and might not survive, Assistant State’s Attorney Danny Hanichak said. A 27-year-old man charged with attempted murder and aggravated arson was denied bond during a court hearing Monday, the Chicago Tribune reports. “This defendant did not target someone he got in an argument with, someone who wronged him or someone that he even knew,” Hanichak said. “This defendant decided to target the most vulnerable person possible: a 75-year-old homeless man sleeping on the street.” The man told police he poured gasoline on blankets without knowing Kromelis was under them, the prosecutor said. Kromelis has been the subject of news stories and a documentary. He once told the Tribune he roams around downtown “as a way of life.” In 2016, Kromelis was attacked with a bat. A GoFundMe account raised more than $32,000, though it was unclear at the time if he wanted the money, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Dozens of St. Vincent Health and Ascension Health workers in the state who were suspended without pay for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are asking a federal court to open a class-action lawsuit. The 64 workers claim the hospital network discriminated against them because they objected to the vaccine on religious grounds. “Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will,” the lawsuit said. Ascension Health owns St. Vincent Health. In July 2021 Ascension Health announced a requirement that its associates had to get the COVID-19 vaccination by November. There are roughly 14,700 associates in Indiana. Ascension Health said in a July release that “tens of thousands” of its workers had already been inoculated. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve,” the release said. Like other hospital networks in Indiana, St. Vincent Health allowed workers to get an exemption for religious beliefs or medical conditions. But the 64 workers who filed the lawsuit Friday say St. Vincent Health and its parent company “failed to individually and properly assess each application for religious exemption.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An invasive earthworm native to east Asia that was discovered in Iowa in 2018 has now spread to at least 11 counties. Officials in Dubuque and Muscatine counties were the first to report finding jumping worms, which are also known as crazy worms or Alabama jumpers due to their vigorous writhing and wriggling when disturbed. The snake-like worms can grow up to 8 inches long and are found amid leaf litter and closer to the soil surface than other earthworms commonly seen in Iowa. A map released in April by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach showed that the worms have now been found in Polk and Story counties, as well as Buchanan, Clayton, Jefferson, Johnson, Linn, Scott and Winneshiek. The ISU Extension website notes: “We assume jumping worms are much more widely spread than reports indicate.” ISU Extension said the worms, which have been infiltrating U.S. soil since the late 1800s, likely arrived in North America in potted plants, nursery stock or soil. They’re typically 3 to 5 inches long but are known to grow up to 8 inches. Jumping worms are darker and smoother than earthworms commonly found in Iowa. Identifiable characteristics include a cloudy-white and smooth narrow band; that band is raised on other earthworms. They do not produce an exterior layer of slime.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The recent bulldozing of a camp for homeless people has advocates arguing that Topeka should adopt more liberal policies modeled after ones in Kansas City, Missouri. Social worker Russell Burton and other advocates hope to raise the issue at the Topeka City Council’s meeting June 7, The Kansas City Star reports. Burton wants the city to require outreach workers to visit before a camp is bulldozed and to remain until city workers leave, something Kansas City mandates under a policy adopted in mid-April. He also wants to require the city to store people’s personal items for 60 days, as Kansas City does, twice the time set by Topeka’s policies. Topeka on May 10 razed an encampment just north of the Kansas River where more than a dozen people were living. Ken Saffer, a 57-year-old resident of the encampment on and off since 2017, said his belongings were confiscated, including clothing, tools and a generator. Others scrambled to collect medication and important documents. Spokesperson Gretchen Spiker said the city provided more than the required 72 hours notice before clearing the camp and followed its policies regarding belongings. She said the city “went above and beyond” to protect individuals’ constitutional rights.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new park that will allow public access to the Kentucky River is planned in Fayette County. The city plans to purchase 30 acres on the river near the Interstate 75 bridge into Madison County, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said in a statement. The city has signed an agreement, but the Urban County Council still needs to approve it. “This will provide new opportunities for recreation in Lexington. It will be a beautiful new park. And those who love kayaks and canoes will have a place to get onto the river and travel 12 miles between locks,” Gordon said. The $1.16 million cost for the property will come from fees developers pay to the city for the purpose of acquiring land for parks, officials said. Outdoor recreation has grown significantly in the past two years, and the park will establish a new kind of regional tourism with other river counties, said Mary Quinn Ramer, who is president of Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State and local governments and educational institutions could not require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for entry into government facilities under legislation advanced by a state Senate committee Tuesday. The 4-2 vote sends the House-passed bill by Rep. Larry Bagley, R-Stonewall, to the full Senate. As it came out of the committee, the bill would subject any government or state-run educational institution to civil penalties if it requires COVID-19 vaccinations for entry. Backers say government entities shouldn’t be asking about a person’s health status. Opponents of the bill said they didn’t want local governments subjected to civil fines for trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The bill would not apply to government health care facilities that would risk losing federal funding under any federal requirements for vaccines. It passed the House last month on a 59-26 vote. If approved by the Senate, it would go back to the House for approval of Senate amendment. The deadline for final adjournment of the legislative session is Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nWaterville: The Maine Attorney General’s Office has ruled that the fatal shooting of a man by police last year was justified. Waterville police responded in February 2021 to reports of Eric Porter, 32, armed with a knife and threatening people outside a hotel. The attorney general’s office said Friday in a report about the shooting that police ordered Porter to drop the knife and surrender when he charged at an officer with the weapon. Another officer shot and killed Porter, the attorney general’s report said. The report said officers tried using PepperBall launchers at Porter to no effect, and an electroshock weapon also didn’t subdue Porter because of his thick winter coat. Attorney General Aaron Frey wrote in the report that the officer who shot and killed Porter believed his colleague “would have been seriously injured or killed had he not shot Mr. Porter.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Thanks to the preservation of an early 19th-century plat, residents can soon see for themselves how the town – founded by Jonathan Hager in the 1760s – began to blossom in the years after the American Revolution, the Herald-Mail reports. After nearly two years in the hands of an expert document conservator, the plat and other documents – including a rare copy of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s proclamation to Marylanders in the days preceding the Battle of Antietam – are finally home with the Washington County Historical Society. Plans are to keep the delicate originals stored and preserved but to display copies for everyone to see. “My best guess is the plat plan was generated in the early 1800s,” said society President Bill Maharay. “It descended through the Hager family; it’s on vellum, and it shows the development of Hagerstown through various growth patterns.” This plat shows where the town was expanding as it developed. “And it’s not done in an orderly fashion,” Maharay said. “What I find most interesting is the water source for the town was the stream that starts up over by where the post office is. It’s now all underground, but it shows that stream pattern. And then the area on North Potomac where it rises up past Franklin was called the ‘healthy’ part of town because of sanitation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Firefighters battling a huge fire in the grandstand of a Boston horse racing track were hampered by a limited water supply and had to use thousands of feet of hose, officials said. There were no reports of injuries in the fire at Suffolk Downs that was reported about 10 p.m. Monday. The fire was knocked down by about 2 a.m. Tuesday, but crews remained on site to put out hot spots, the Boston Fire Department said in a tweet. Suffolk Downs, which first opened in 1935, has not had live racing since July 2019, but the grandstand remained open for simulcasting. The fire was first seen in the old press box on the roof, according to a statement from HYM Investment Group, which is redeveloping the site, but the cause remains under investigation. Boston firefighters were aided by several other area departments. The 161-acre site partially in Revere is being redeveloped into a mix of housing, retail, hotel, office and lab space. “The fire did not impact the area of Suffolk Downs currently under construction and redevelopment of the site remains ongoing,” HYM said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Any summer plans for late-night scooting through downtown Detroit have been thwarted by a new curfew established by city officials. The curfew, first reported by Outlier Media, applies to rentable electric scooters in Detroit’s Central Business District, bordered by the John C. Lodge Freeway, Interstate 75, Interstate 375 and the Detroit River. In cooperation with scooter operators, scooters will be shut down in this area between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew was announced by the Detroit Police Department during a press conference addressing summer safety efforts, including increased patrolling in Greektown and drag racing restrictions. Electric scooters operating in Detroit include Lime, Bird, Spin, LINK scooters operated by Superpedestrian and Boaz Bikes. During the curfew and within the designated area, enforcement by the operators varies, but some scooters will operate at reduced speeds or allow riders to finish their already activated trips. The city has not determined when the summer curfew will end, Outlier reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council has approved $1.2 million in legal settlements with two people injured by police during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of officers two years ago. The settlements with St. Paul resident Virgil Lee Jackson Jr. and Nashville freelance photographer Linda Tirado mean the city has agreed to pay a total of $5.4 million to settle federal civil rights lawsuits over injuries caused by police in May 2020, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The City Council approved the two settlements Thursday. The council agreed to pay Jackson $645,000. His lawsuit said that a Minneapolis police officer repeatedly shocked him using a Taser’s “drive stun” mode, pressing the electrodes directly onto his skin. He was in a parking lot at the time. Tirado lost the sight in her left eye after an officer fired a rubber bullet while she covered protests outside a police station. The City Council agreed to pay her $600,000. Floyd, 46, who was Black, died after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 91/ 2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was sentenced to 221/ 2 years in prison for murder and manslaughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the state of using a discriminatory proof-of-citizenship requirement for some new voters under a law dating back to the Jim Crow era. The dismissal came weeks after Mississippi repealed a 1924 law that required naturalized citizens – but not people born in the U.S. – to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A new law enacted in its place has also drawn opposition but is being grudgingly accepted by voting rights groups who say it ultimately should protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote. The secretary of state had been running names of potential new voters through a state Department of Public Safety database of people with Mississippi driver’s licenses and identification cards. Voting rights advocates said this practice disproportionately hurt people of color by flagging them as possible noncitizens. The new law says that if the public safety database raises questions about citizenship, the potential new voter’s name must be run through a federal immigration database. Groups that advocate for voting rights and immigrants’ rights said the federal database provides a safeguard to protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal judge has ordered St. Louis County to pay $300,000 to two people who sued after police barged into their home six years ago with guns drawn and without a warrant. A final judgment in the case was entered Thursday against the county, ordering it to pay Jon Luer and Andrea Steinebach for damages stemming from the home intrusion, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said in a news release. The ACLU said Luer and Steinebach were awoken about 3 a.m. July 10, 2016, to find armed officers in their hallway searching for a suspect who had skipped out on cab fare. The two officers interrogated the couple’s teenage son and searched his room. The officers left after deciding he was not the suspect but did not file an incident report about their contact with the family, the ACLU said. “Our family is still haunted by the illegal middle-of-the-night invasion of our home by the very people that are supposed to protect us,” Steinebach said in a statement. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the family’s lawsuit could proceed, calling police actions in the case a “severe, warrantless intrusion.” A police spokeswoman referred questions to the St. Louis County Counselor’s Office, which did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s top schools administrator has been cited in the case of a vehicle illegally passing a stopped school bus last month. Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen was cited Thursday after speaking with an officer, Helena Police Lt. Jayson Zander said. According to a police report, a school bus driver said a truck driven by Arntzen passed his bus while it was stopped to pick up children just after 7:30 a.m. May 19 in a Helena subdivision. The bus driver recognized Arntzen and recorded the license plate number on the red pickup truck, the police report said. A video of the incident reportedly “does not show the license plate of the vehicle involved,” Arntzen’s office said in a statement Friday. “Superintendent Arntzen does not recall the alleged incident,” Brian O’Leary, spokesman for the Office of Public Instruction, said in a statement Thursday. “She does acknowledge she drives a red pickup and lives in the area.” Montana’s 2021 Legislature passed a bill to improve bus safety after a student in northwestern Montana was hit and critically injured by a driver who passed a stopped bus in November 2019. Arntzen testified during a February 2021 legislative committee hearing in support of the bill, which doubled the fine for illegally passing a school bus to a maximum of $1,000.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A large fire that raged through a chemical plant was extinguished by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents who were initially evacuated were allowed to return to their homes, authorities said. Thick smoke billowing from the Nox-Crete facility just southwest of downtown Omaha could be seen as far away Monday evening as the Elkhorn River, about 20 miles to the west. Battalion Chief Scott Fitzpatrick said the first call for help came shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, and firefighters who initially entered the building found a much bigger fire than they had anticipated, forcing them to retreat. Fire crews then fought the blaze from outside the building, noting the presence of chemicals and propane bottles inside. Explosions could be seen and heard as propane tanks ruptured. No injuries were reported from the fire or explosions. Officials said the smoke posed no major toxicity risks to the public. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. According to its website, Nox-Crete makes a chemical coating and deactivator that keeps curing concrete from bonding to forms. It also makes liquid floor hardeners, joint fillers, curing and sealing compounds, and water repellents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal Bureau of Land Management is collecting public comment until Wednesday on a big north-south electricity transmission project that Nevada’s main utility, NV Energy, says is a key to its plan for a statewide renewable energy network. The project, dubbed Greenlink West, would stretch about 350 miles to connect electricity facilities near Las Vegas in southern Nevada and Yerington in the north by the end of 2026. It would generally run parallel to and east of the California state line. Conservationists and protesters say they do not want to see that much public land disturbed, and members of a tribe adjacent to the route say the transmission lines would adversely affect culturally significant land. Barbara Durham, tribal historic preservation officer for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, told the Las Vegas Sun that disturbed areas could include former village sites and areas where tribal ancestors found food and traded objects. Timbisha Shoshone homelands are in Nevada’s Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda counties and California’s Inyo, Kern, San Bernardino and Mono counties. “We would prefer that they go through already existing areas that have been disturbed,” Durham said. “No matter which way they go, they’re going to find the same thing.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: Fireworks shows at a popular beach were canceled for Memorial Day weekend and put on hold for several weeks because endangered piping plovers are nesting there. Local officials hope they can still have fireworks on the Fourth of July at Hampton Beach, which is close to the Massachusetts border. Hampton Beach Village District Chairman Chuck Rage said two nests were found on the beach. Piping plovers are endangered in New Hampshire and threatened nationally. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Endangered Wildlife Program has been monitoring and protecting breeding piping plovers and their habitat on the seacoast since 1997. The sighting of endangered piping plovers prompted officials to cancel fireworks shows at the beginning of the summer season at Hampton Beach last year, too. The small birds nest in the sandy dunes at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. The number of nests is expected to reach a new record in the state this year, with 16 in total, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The fireworks shows will resume when the eggs hatch and the plovers abandon their nests on the beach, which could take about a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewton: Paddlers who want to camp overnight along the Delaware River within a national recreation area must now have a reservation and pay a fee. An increase in visitors to the area who choose to stay overnight has prompted the move. The 62 primitive river campsites within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area will cost $16 per site, per night. Starting in 2015, the park piloted a similar system for six of the sites known as Alosa. This new change brings all river campsites under that system. “Falling asleep and waking up at a primitive boat-in campsite along the banks of a nationally designated scenic and recreational river is a unique and special experience, particularly within one of the most densely populated areas of the country,” said Elizabeth Winslow, fee program manager. Because the Water Gap is part of the National Park Service, the recent announcement by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that entrance fees at state parks are being lifted this summer does not apply. The Water Gap does not charge an entrance fee but does have several areas, such as boat launches and beaches, which have user fees. Winslow said there are several concerns about the primitive sites, such as flooding, resource protection and operational issues, that have reduced the number of official river campsites in the past 20 years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As nearly 3,000 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Monday, federal forest officials worried about future flash floods, landslides and destructive ash from the burn scar. The nearly 8-week-old fire was surrounded by containment lines cut and scraped around half of of its perimeter, enclosing 493 square miles of forested mountains and foothills east of Santa Fe. A Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team has started publishing data from its post-fire assessments. Micah Kiesow, team leader and a soil and watershed program manager with the Santa Fe National Forest, said steep mountain slopes had acted like a sponge before the fire. “Post-fire in some of these areas, especially the high soil burn severity areas and the moderate, we’re looking at now a steep slope that’s more like a parking lot,” Kiesow told the Santa Fe New Mexican. He said that could signal an “extreme change in watershed response” during monsoon season. Flooding presents another problem for communities near burn scars with ash flowing into rivers and streams, according to Kiesow. Many water treatment facilities aren’t equipped for the expensive, time-intensive process of filtering ash. Experts say ash and debris can harm water quality with high levels of nitrates and phosphorus.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A black bear wandered into the city, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet off the ground Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net. The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile from the Capitol. The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones and single-family homes. Albany police tweeted out several pictures of bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap. Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city. Police closed off the street off for a few hours as the state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican legislation that supporters argue would give parents more say over their children’s public schooling and health – but that critics say would intimidate and harm LGBTQ youth – headed to the state Senate floor after another affirmative committee vote Tuesday. The “Parents’ Bill of Rights” legislation includes a provision that would prevent instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school curricula for kindergarten through third grade. Schools would have to notify parents about changes to their child’s health and services that they are receiving, such as psychological treatment, or before they could change a child’s name or pronouns in records. LGBTQ activists likened these provisions to those in a Florida law opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Several urged GOP lawmakers Tuesday to stop the measure, saying more young people would have their sexuality revealed against their will. Other youth will keep their sexuality hidden, increasing further the threat of suicide, opponents said. “This bill proposes forced outing of queer kids,” said the Rev. Vance Haywood, senior pastor of St. John’s Metropolitan Community Church in Raleigh. “It’s creating an environment where we’re telling folks that it’s not OK to be yourself. You have to hide parts of who you are.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The longest-serving member of the state Senate declined to comment Tuesday on whether he’s the subject of an ongoing investigation following a report that he’d traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg had previously announced plans to resign Wednesday, six months before the end of his term. “There is a time,” Holmberg told the Associated Press on Tuesday when asked about why he was abruptly ending his 46-year career. Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from Holmberg’s home in November. “The rain will stop one of these days, and things will go on,” he said, declining to elaborate. Homberg said he planned on attending a luncheon with some current and former lawmakers Tuesday. He plans on turning in his state-issued computer and legislative credentials that include access to the state Capitol on Wednesday. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four times, he chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio students would have to take a self-defense class to graduate from high school if a bill introduced Tuesday by two Republicans in the state House becomes law. “Young women between the ages of 16-19 are the most vulnerable to be sexually assaulted,” Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Township, said in a statement. “This training will also provide opportunity for development of relationships between students and their local law enforcement and school resource officers.” Called the Student Protection Act, House Bill 639 would require incoming freshmen in public and private schools to complete self-defense training as part of their health education starting in the 2023-2024 academic year. The instructors would have to be school resource officers or certified self-defense instructors. “Physical, emotional or sexual abuse and assault are never okay. These behaviors should never be tolerated or go unreported,” Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, said in a statement. “Reinforcing this message with our young people, while equipping them with defensive tactics and proactive strategies will help them protect themselves and avoid dangerous situations.” She added that self-defense training could also help students identify early signs and symptoms of mental health issues and potentially aggressive behavior in their peers. Young said the bill has been in the works for months, and the timing of its introduction soon after a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, was coincidental.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s cannabis regulator was busy last week working on final implementation of a “seed-to-sale” tracking system, the latest major update as it prepares to be reformed as a stand-alone agency this fall. The changes represent a watershed moment for the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority in its nearly four-year history. After launching in 2018, the agency struggled to keep up with the exploding industry that quickly boasted more dispensaries than any other state in the country and has been plagued with black market activity, while also supporting over 380,000 licensed cardholders who regularly purchase more than $64 million of medical cannabis products monthly. Now under the guidance of its fourth executive director, the agency continues to expand its personnel and oversight duties. Seed-to-sale, which went into effect Thursday, means every product sold to a consumer should theoretically be traceable back to its literal roots – a capability officials claim will create a safer and more legitimate industry. The marijuana authority’s independence from its current place in the state Health Department won’t happen until Nov. 1, but work is already happening to hire its own personnel to handle administrative positions, human resources and payroll.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: Officials in Clackamas County said Tuesday that they have finished duplicating the majority of primary election ballots that were rejected by vote-counting machines because of a printing error that resulted in blurred barcodes on tens of thousands of ballots. Elections officials were forced to transfer the voter’s intent from a spoiled ballot to a fresh one that could be read by the machines. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. Elections officials expect to finish tallying the vote by the end of the week and to certify all election results by June 13, the state’s deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: On Roosevelt Boulevard, where 10% to 13% of the city’s traffic fatalities happened each year prior to the pandemic, plans to redesign the city’s “corridor of death” – as some residents and safety advocates call Roosevelt – could be gaining traction. Studies show Black communities have been hit even harder by a national surge in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosevelt Boulevard is a chaotic, almost 14-mile maze that passes through some of the city’s most diverse neighborhoods and census tracts with the highest poverty rates. Driving can be dangerous, but biking or walking can be even worse, with some crosswalks longer than a football field and taking four light cycles to cross. “You would not design a street or a road like that today,” said Christopher Puchalsky, policy director for Philadelphia’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. “It feels like an expressway, but it’s in the middle and between neighborhoods.” The city is hoping for federal money to begin a long-term, billion-dollar redesign of Roosevelt outlined in a study released in 2019, as well as to fund a series of smaller projects to improve safety at high-fatality stretches on the road by 2025.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee, the Rhode Island State Police and the state Department of Education have asked every school district to complete a comprehensive survey of potential emergency hazards. The effort, announced at the State House on Tuesday, is aimed at identifying potential school safety issues and addressing any necessary repairs or upgrades. Through the School Building Authority, the Department of Education will approve up to $500,000 in emergency funds for each district to make additional security upgrades. They will be reimbursed once the work is completed. Approximately $25 million is available statewide. McKee said the country is still processing the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed by a lone gunman. Since then, he said, there have been 12 new mass shootings across the nation. “No one thing alone will end gun violence,” McKee said. Limiting high-capacity magazines and banning assault weapons will help reduce that risk, he said. “The safety of our children must be the highest priority,” the Democrat said. Every school superintendent will conduct walkthroughs of buildings, including reviews of doors and windows, car access, landscape features, lighting, alarm and camera systems, and communications systems.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hurricane season officially starting Wednesday, state emergency officials want residents to prepare. Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Hurricane Preparedness Week began Sunday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is emphasizing this year that people know their evacuation zone, how to prepare their home to ride out a storm and what highways they need to take to evacuate with the slogan “Know Your Zone, Prepare Your Home, Remember Your Route.” Preparing a home not only includes checking hurricane shutters and roofs but also making sure to have the right kind and right amount of insurance, the agency said. And it’s not just coastal homes that need preparation. Recent hurricanes to hit South Carolina have brought massive floods inland and can also bring tornadoes and high winds well away from the coast. Health officials said residents should also make sure their COVID-19 boosters and vaccinations are up to date and include masks and other disease-fighting items in their hurricane kits in case they need to evacuate to areas where there is high spread of disease. Four hurricanes have directly or indirectly impacted South Carolina in the past six years. Meteorologists are predicting an above-average number of hurricanes and tropical storms this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican candidates in state House races are raking in unprecedented amounts of campaign cash ahead of next week’s primary election. And a handful of ultra-competitive contests in the Sioux Falls area are driving that trend. A review of campaign finance reports filed this week by dozens of state House candidates in legislative primary races statewide found that dozens have brought in tens of thousands of dollars ahead of the June 7 election. And of the 10 candidates reporting the highest fundraising totals, more than half are seeking office in Sioux Falls or the surrounding area. Three of the top seven fundraisers come from a single contest that could tip the scales in an intra-party power struggled that’s pitted two factions of the state GOP against each other.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: After years of a stalemate, the Shelby County Commission is once again poised to consider funding new voting machines. County commissioners have in the past voted down a similar arrangement, voicing support for hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If approved, the agreement would spend $5.8 million on new machines from vendor Election Systems & Software LLC, known as ES&S, having the equipment fully operational by the August 2022 general election; $2.4 million of those funds would be reimbursable by the State of Tennessee. “We are at risk for the election that’s coming up in August, so that’s why we’re trying to move forward with having a process by which hopefully having this new equipment will achieve the outcome that it’s intended for,” said Shelby County Commission Chairman Willie Brooks Jr. Voters would then be able to choose at the polls between a paper ballot and an electronic ballot. The ballot marking machines will not allow voters to overvote and are accessible for voters with disabilities. The machine used to count votes can tabulate both printouts from the ballot marking machines and paper ballots that have been filled out by hand. It will also catch if someone has overvoted on a paper ballot, asking the voter if they want to move forward.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials are warning beachgoers to stay away from an overly friendly dolphin off North Padre Island. The marine mammal has gotten a bit pushy in the water off the island about 20 miles east of Corpus Christi, according to a press release from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Biologists report the animal is showing more aggressive behavior, separating children from their parents in the water, and isolating swimming pets from their owners,” the release said. The problem is that people have been feeding, swimming and playing with the dolphin for more than a year despite warnings from biologists, law enforcement and residents to stay away from it, according to the release. It said the dolphin “has become so used to humans that it now seeks out people, boats, and any form of interaction.” The mammal also has wounds caused by boats, and there are concerns about its safety, officials said. People are being asked to leave the dolphin alone. Boaters are asked to avoid stopping if the dolphin comes too close and to slowly move away. Swimmers are being asked to leave the water if they see the dolphin, the release said. “While the dolphin may seem friendly, this is a wild animal with unpredictable behavior,” according to NOAA.\n\nUtah\n\nMonument Valley: Federal officials signed an agreement with leaders of the Navajo Nation on Friday that provides funding for clean drinking water infrastructure for reservation residents and resolves questions about long-standing Navajo claims to water rights in the drought-stricken U.S. West. The signing formalizes the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement, which became law in 2020 as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. As part of the agreement, the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation $210 million for drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County – the part of the 27,000-square-mile reservation that lies in Utah. Many Navajo homes lack running water. Residents often fill containers at public taps or rely on water deliveries from volunteer organizations. Utah, which was also party to the agreement, will pay the Navajo $8 million as part of the settlement. “We had two real problems in our state. One was the Navajo Nation had claims to the Colorado (River) that would impair Utah’s water rights,” U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The other concern we had was about half the Navajo Nation residents (in Utah) didn’t have running water.” The settlement also quantifies the Navajo Nation’s water rights, quelling Utah’s anxieties.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to the city Sunday, after being canceled or shortened the past three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times, and they looped the half-marathon course twice. More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon, while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont, was first across the finish line, and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California, resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Authorities said two women were missing Tuesday after a group of people in rafts and on paddleboards went over the Bosher Dam on the James River a day earlier. WWBT-TV reports 12 people were involved in the accident Monday afternoon. WAVY-TV reports the dam has a 12-foot drop, and water levels have been high. Images of the search show the river seemingly placid above the dam but roiling below, with some of the group’s paddleboards and inflatable rafts caught in the currents below the rush of water. One of them managed to reach a nearby house for help. Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said kayakers in the area helped to rescue nine more. But Segal said two women were unaccounted for despite a very thorough search. Crews searched for the two women until dusk, and the search resumed Tuesday morning, Henrico County police said in a news release. Police said they have worked with friends and families of Lauren E. Winstead, 23, of Henrico County, and Sarah E. Erway, 28, of Chesterfield County, listing them as missing. Police warned that the river is at dangerous levels in some areas and that anyone entering the river should be extremely cautious.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A cougar attacked a 9-year-old girl who was playing hide-and-seek at a church camp, seriously wounding her and sending her friends running in fear. Lily A. Kryzhanivskyy and two other children were playing in the woods Saturday at the camp near the small town of Fruitland, northwest of Spokane. Lily jumped out to surprise her friends when the cougar attacked, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Adults rushed to help and found the girl covered in blood. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she had surgery for multiple wounds to her head and upper body. Lily was released from the intensive care unit Monday and remained hospitalized in stable condition, the department said Tuesday. Following the attack, adults staying at the church camp found the young male cougar and killed it. “We are extremely thankful for this little girl’s resiliency, and we’re impressed with her spunk in the face of this unfortunate encounter,” Fish and Wildlife Police Capt. Mike Sprecher said. “It happened fast, and we are thankful that the adults at the camp responded so quickly.” Tests completed over the weekend showed the animal did not have rabies, the agency said. Cougar attacks on humans are rare. There have been just two fatal attacks on humans in Washington state in the past 100 years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAlum Creek: Guided hikes, exhibits and interactive programming will greet guests during the weekend’s grand opening of the Claudia L. Workman Wildlife Education Center, officials said. The event Saturday is being hosted by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and the Forks of Coal State Natural Area Foundation. Those who attend the free event in Alum Creek can tour the 9,500-square-foot building, explore the 102-acre property and attend shows presented by the West Virginia Raptor Rehab Center, the Division of Natural Resources said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to having everyone come out and experience all that we have to offer, including ‘Touch a Snake’ and ‘Bird ID’ activities,” said Ashley Anderson, the agency’s park activities coordinator. The opening fulfills the vision of the center’s namesake, Claudia Workman, whose husband donated the land in 2015 so a nature-based education center could be built. The center has five main areas that include an introduction to Forks of Coal State Natural Area, an aquarium and reptile exhibit, a wildlife management area, a habitat management area and a wildlife observation area. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday beginning June 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOshkosh: The judge presiding over a case involving a violent altercation in a Wisconsin high school postponed the trial after defense attorneys argued that public sentiment related to the school shootings in Texas could taint the jury pool. Grant Fuhrman, accused of stabbing a high school resource officer multiple times with a barbecue fork in Oshkosh in 2019, is charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During a struggle, the officer shot the then-16-year-old student. Neither of them was seriously injured, and the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Fuhrman’s attorneys filed a motion to delay last week, four days after an 18-year-old entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot 19 children and two teachers. The defense said their client could not get a fair trial in the current environment. The request said the Texas case would have been on the minds of every potential juror if the interview process had started Tuesday as scheduled. “The length of time between the outside influence and the trial is critical. Here that time frame is mere days,” the motion said. Judge Daniel Bissett granted the delay and scheduled a status hearing for July 7.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A record haul in super PAC spending has poured into the race for the state’s sole U.S. House seat this year, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. More than $1 million has been reported to federal officials in such spending, with much of it aimed at unseating Rep. Liz Cheney, who angered many other Republicans with her stance against ex-President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The spending total by independent expenditure-only political committees has already more than doubled Wyoming’s previous record, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/27/john-prine-rocky-horror-rembrandt-news-around-states/50778515/", "title": "John Prine, Rocky Horror: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Two U.S. military veterans who disappeared three months ago while fighting with Ukrainian forces against Russia arrived home Saturday, greeted by hugs, cheers and tears of joy at the state’s main airport. Alex Drueke, 40, and Andy Huynh, 27, had gone missing June 9 in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine near the Russian border. The Alabama residents were released as part of a prisoner exchange. The pair had traveled to Ukraine on their own and bonded over their shared home state. “It’s them!” a family member shouted as the pair appeared at the top of an escalator at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. Smiling but looking tired, the two were pulled into long, emotional hugs by family members after their connecting flight home, then whisked to a waiting car. “Surreal. I still have chill bumps,” said Drueke’s aunt, Dianna Shaw. “I always imagined this day. I always held not just hope but belief in this day. But I thought it was going to be two or three years from now at best.” The families of the two men announced their release Wednesday. They were among 10 prisoners released by Russian-backed separatists as part of a prisoner exchange mediated by Saudi Arabia. “I had to get my hands on him to actually believe it,” said Darla Black, whose daughter is engaged to Huynh. “I’m just overwhelmed with gratitude. We got our miracle.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A woman was killed when the plane she was piloting crashed into Whiskey Lake near Skwentna, Alaska Wildlife Troopers said. The pilot was identified as Janell Rude, 67, of Anchorage, troopers said. An Air Force rescue team was deployed Sunday and found the plane submerged in the lake. She was the sole occupant onboard the Cessna 180A, troopers said. Troopers and military rescue swimmers recovered the body, which was then sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for an autopsy. The National Transportation Safety Board said in a tweet that it was investigating the crash. Skwentna is located about 65 miles northwest of Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Planned Parenthood asked a judge Monday to put on hold a ruling that allowed prosecutors to enforce a Civil War-era state law banning abortion in nearly all cases. Arizona’s largest abortion provider said the ruling issued late Friday has created confusion about the status of the law. Its lawyers cited conflicts created by the abortion ban dating to 1864, a more recent law banning abortions after 15 weeks, and a variety of other laws regulating the processes and paperwork when terminating pregnancies. “This confusion has forced Planned Parenthood Arizona to pause abortion services and cancel appointments scheduled this week – meaning that members of our community once again have been and will continue to be denied medical care that they deserve and need while this decision is in effect,” Brittany Fonteno, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement. Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson’s ruling lifted a 50-year-old injunction blocking enforcement of the 1864 law, which allows abortion only when the mother’s life is in danger. The injunction was imposed after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision guaranteed a right to abortion on 1973. Planned Parenthood asked Johnson to put her ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Pharoah Sanders, the influential tenor saxophonist revered in the jazz world for the spirituality of his work, has died, his record label announced. He was 81. Sanders, who launched his career playing alongside John Coltrane in the 1960s, died early Saturday, said the tweet from Luaka Bop, the label that released his 2021 album, “Promises.” It did not specify a cause. “We are devastated to share that Pharoah Sanders has passed away. He died peacefully surrounded by loving family and friends in Los Angeles earlier this morning. Always and forever the most beautiful human being, may he rest in peace,” said the label’s message on Twitter, accompanied by a heart emoji. Among the saxophonist’s best-known works was his two-part “The Creator Has a Master Plan,” from the “Karma” album released in 1969. The combined track is nearly 33 minutes long. Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1940, Sanders began his early musical life by playing drums, then the clarinet in church. In high school, he began renting out the school saxophone. After high school he moved to Oakland, California, where he intended to attend art school. But he soon moved to New York to join the city’s avant-garde jazz scene. He hitchhiked his way across country, he told The New Yorker magazine in 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A prominent law school named for a 19th-century rancher who sponsored deadly atrocities against Native Americans has a new name after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation approving the change. It was among several bills concerning indigenous people that the Democratic governor and former San Francisco mayor signed into law Friday, which he declared “Native American Day” in the state. The University of California’s Hastings College of the Law will be known as the College of the Law, San Francisco. The school’s graduates include former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. The school was founded in 1878 by Serranus Clinton Hastings, a wealthy rancher and former chief justice of the California Supreme Court who helped orchestrate and finance campaigns by white settlers in Mendocino County to kill and enslave members of the Yuki Indian tribe. The legislation also lays out restorative justice initiatives to be pursued by the college, such as renaming a law library with a Native language name, according to a statement from the governor’s office. Newsom also signed legislation to remove an offensive term for a Native American woman from all geographic features and place names in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A suburb’s plan to show a nearly 50-year-old movie at its arts center has officials scrambling to revamp the town’s indecency laws. The Denver Post reports the city of Parker plans to show the 1975 cult classic “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” at the Parker Arts, Culture & Events Center in October. But because the event center holds a liquor license, and the movie includes a momentary glimpse of a woman’s breast, the showing is prohibited under a town ordinance prohibiting “lewd and indecent” displays. “ ‘Lewd or indecent displays’ include the display of the female breast,” town staff said in a memo to Parker’s elected leaders. “Thus, the definition of ‘lewd and indecent displays’… would prohibit the screening of a movie, such as the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which displays the female breast.” Parker’s town council is considering two ordinances on the issue that officials say will bring the indecency code into compliance with a recent federal court ruling by no longer singling out female breasts – but not male breasts – as indecent. The council is expected to cast a final vote on the measures next month, potentially paving the way for the movie showing to continue as planned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nOld Saybrook: A 76-year-old man died Saturday when his SUV plunged into the water at Saybrook Point Marina and Resort in Old Saybrook, police said. Wedding guests at the nearby Saybrook Point Inn jumped in, pulled the man to shore and performed CPR but were unable to save him, police said. The man, identified as Steven Mark Wahle, of Old Saybrook, was pronounced dead at Middlesex Medical Center Shoreline in Westbrook. The incident happened about 10:15 p.m. The marina is located between the Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River. A fire department dive team determined Wahle was the only person in the SUV. Police pulled the vehicle from the water and impounded it, pending an ongoing investigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a lawsuit against Democratic Gov. John Carney over the state’s requirement for political balance on its courts. Friday’s ruling is the latest in a long-running legal battle over a “major-party” provision in the Delaware Constitution under which judicial appointments to the state’s three highest courts are split between Republicans and Democrats. The Delaware Supreme Court, Court of Chancery and Superior Court are subject to a separate “bare majority” provision that also applies to Family Court and the Court of Common Pleas. That provision says no more than a bare majority of judges on those courts can be affiliated with a single political party. The result of the major-party provision is that any person not affiliated with either the Republican or the Democratic Party is unable serve on any of those courts. Wilmington lawyer James Adams, a former Democrat who is now an unaffiliated voter, claims that the provision violates his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by barring him from being considered for a judgeship on the Superior Court, a position for which he has twice applied and been rejected. Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled Friday that Adams had legal standing to challenge the major-party provision and denied Carney’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police during the Jan. 6 siege has a book deal. Steven A. Sund’s “Courage Under Fire: Under Siege and Outnumbered 58 to 1 on January 6” will come out Jan. 3, just shy of the two-year anniversary of the riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. “It’s time to break my silence and reveal everything that I know happened,” Sund said in a statement released Monday by Blackstone Publishing. Sund resigned under pressure soon after the insurrection and testified the following month that he hadn’t seen an FBI field report warning of potential violence. He said the overrunning of the U.S. Capitol was the result of widespread failures. “No single civilian law enforcement agency – and certainly not the USCP – is trained and equipped to repel, without significant military or other law enforcement assistance, an insurrection of thousands of armed, violent, and coordinated individuals focused on breaching a building at all costs,” he testified. According to Blackstone, Sund will provide “a detailed and harrowing minute-by-minute account of the attack.” He will include a “never-before-heard accounting of a call from the White House” during the siege and “never-before-detailed conversations” between himself and congressional leadership.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz will begin their rebuttal case Tuesday, challenging his attorneys’ contention that he murdered 17 people because his birth mother abused alcohol during pregnancy, a condition they say went untreated. Prosecutor Mike Satz’s team is expected to call experts who will testify Cruz has antisocial personality disorder – in lay terms, he’s a sociopath – and fully responsible for his Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. According to the National Institutes of Health, people with antisocial personality disorder commit “exploitive, delinquent and criminal behavior with no remorse.” They usually have no regard for others, don’t follow the law, can’t sustain consistent relationships or employment, and use manipulation for personal gain, the NIH says. Prosecutors will want to reemphasize Cruz “understood exactly” what he was doing during the massacre and could “formulate and carry out a plan,” said David S. Weinstein, a Miami defense attorney and former prosecutor.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A district attorney said he may revisit a decades-old case in which the state Supreme Court overturned three murder convictions of a Black sharecropper in the killing of a white man, aiming to determine whether the sharecropper deserves to be formally but posthumously exonerated. Weaknesses in the case were detailed in a book published this year, “The Three Death Sentences of Clarence Henderson.” Carroll County District Attorney Herb Cranford has launched a review of the case and could ask a judge to formally clear Henderson’s name, as charges against him were never dismissed, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. He was tried and convicted three times for the 1948 killing of 22-year-old Carl “Buddy” Stevens Jr., a Georgia Tech student who was shot while on a date in Carrollton, a town about 40 miles west of Atlanta. Henderson was arrested more than a year after the killing, and defense lawyers, including a biracial team funded by the NAACP, repeatedly poked holes in the prosecution’s case. Those questions, including some focusing on the alleged murder weapon at a time when forensic science was in its infancy, weren’t enough to persuade jurors to acquit Henderson. But they helped persuade appeals courts to repeatedly overturn the conviction. In January 1953, Henderson was allowed to post bail and leave jail, but the charges were never dropped.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A 52-year-old man has been indicted on multiple counts after he allegedly forced a 15-year-old girl to tie up her boyfriend, then kidnapped and sexually assaulted her, as well as forcing her to smoke meth. Authorities say Duncan Mahi walked up to the girl and her boyfriend at Anaehoomalu Beach on the Kona side of the Big Island on Sept. 16, put a knife to her throat, and took the girl’s money and her boyfriend’s cellphone. Court documents allege Mahi told the girl to tie her boyfriend’s legs and hands together using zip-ties and tape that he provided. He forced her to put the boyfriend’s shirt in his mouth, cover his head with a towel and secure both items with the tape, the police booking sheet said. Mahi told the girl she would die if her boyfriend got loose, according to the police account. Once at his property, he shackled her to a yellow bus behind the main house by putting a fabric cuff around her left ankle that was attached to a cable. Police said the girl managed to get free the next day after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat. A witness saw them scuffling outside Cafe Pesto and stopped Mahi from running after the girl. A homeless man sitting on the sidewalk said, “That’s the girl in the news,” after which Mahi ran to a car. Police found Mahi in Hilo about two hours later.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge has banned cameras from the courtroom in the high-profile triple murder case against a mother and her new husband, saying he fears the images could prevent a fair trial. Seventh District Judge Steven Boyce made the ruling Friday, saying news organizations will no longer be able to shoot still photography or videos inside the courtroom in the criminal case of Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell. The couple are charged with conspiring to kill Lori Vallow Daybell’s two youngest children and Chad Daybell’s late former wife, and the strange details of the case have drawn attention from around the world. Both Vallow Daybell and Daybell have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry a potential death penalty. Late last month, Vallow Daybell’s attorneys asked the judge to ban cameras from the courtroom. They contended that one news organization abused the privilege by repeatedly zooming in on Vallow Daybell’s face during an Aug. 16 hearing. The attorneys, Jim Archibald and John Thomas, also claimed the cameras and microphones could potentially be used to overhear private conversations or to view private notes on the defense table, though they did not suggest that the equipment had ever actually been used in that way.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man climbed five stories of a fire escape to infiltrate a police facility Monday while officers were undergoing a SWAT training exercise and grabbed at least two guns before he was shot and wounded by police, the chief said. Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said the suspect was taken to the hospital with injuries not considered to be life-threatening. One officer was taken to the hospital with a sprained ankle. Brown said the suspect was seen on video leaving the facility and then returning to infiltrate it. He asked where to go to retrieve personal property at the facility in Homan Square on Chicago’s West Side. Then he came back to the building and climbed the fire escape to the fifth floor, where a door had been propped open for ventilation because there are no windows on that floor. Brown said it has not been determined if the man went to the building to retrieve property, saying that the man had an extensive record. It wasn’t immediately clear if property taken from the man was stored in the building. He had no other information about the man, other than to say he was a resident of Waukegan, a suburb about 42 miles north of Chicago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state could face a growing number of extreme heat days in the next 30 years, affecting the number of heat-related illnesses as well as seasonal energy costs in the state. The extreme heat designation is characterized by the National Weather Service as days on which the heat index reaches above 125 degrees. A recent study from First Street Foundation found that most counties in Indiana will continue to see high heat day hikes, with the southern portion of the state seeing the largest increase in what are called extreme heat days. Martin, Harrison and Clark counties are expected to see the greatest increase. Greenhouse gas-induced climate change is a driving factor for the rising number of high or extreme heat days in the 21st century, according to a 2020 Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences study. Urban development and population growth are also contributing to the growing number of extreme heat days. Low estimates show a minimum temperature increase across the U.S. of 2.5 degrees over the next 30 years, but since warmer air has a greater capacity to hold water, humidity will increase as well. This will have a compounding effect on heat indexes, the study says.\n\nIowa\n\nBondurant: The city is bucking a decades­long Beggars’ Night tradition by setting a new day for trick-or-treating. The Bondurant City Council in January passed a resolution that sets the trick-or-treat holiday, known as Beggars’ Night, to the last Saturday of October. That means this year, trick-or-treating is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Oct. 29 in the Des Moines suburb. In future years, trick-or-treating could be as early as Oct. 25 or on Halloween itself. Since the 1940s, cities across the Des Moines metro have held Beggars’ Night on Oct. 30 to avoid what had become some Halloween-night mischief. Most communities in the Des Moines metro will stick to that this year. In Bondurant, the idea to change to the last Saturday of October came from a community Facebook post. The city later conducted a survey to gauge interest. Of the 141 people who participated, 65% said they supported holding Beggars’ Night on a Saturday. City staff identified pros of setting a permanent day of the month, which included consistency, less rushing for families to enjoy the celebration, and kids not having school the next morning. Some possible cons included an impact on households with nontraditional work schedules, confusion about being the only metro community with that date, and a possible influx of people from outsiders.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: After the state paid out up to $466 million in fraudulent unemployment benefits, an oversight council tasked with ironing out issues doesn’t know the status of correcting critical cybersecurity issues. “I just don’t have a lot of confidence right now in the security of the system,” said state Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, “and I’m afraid for Kansas citizens.” Contractor FORVIS performed a cybersecurity audit, broken down into a risk assessment report and a penetration testing report. The firm also performed a forensic audit of unemployment insurance, estimating up to $466 million in fraudulent payments. The council released a redacted version of the penetration testing report this month. The risk assessment report hasn’t been publicly released. Officials said the risk assessment identified 31 recommendations, including six of a high priority, 11 medium and 14 low. The agency didn’t disclose an update on any of the six high priority recommendations, telling lawmakers the information could only be discussed in secret. “It’s got to be noted that there are 206 vulnerabilities listed in this report, of which 43 of them are critical, 74 are high and 89 are medium,” said Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, in apparent reference to the confidential risk assessment report from April.\n\nKentucky\n\nGreenville: A park in western Kentucky is being renamed after singer-songwriter John Prine. A dedication ceremony for the John Prine Memorial Park at Rochester Dam in Muhlenberg County is scheduled for Oct. 1, news outlets report. The project is part of updating an existing county park, said Karen Harper Lain, a spokesperson and committee member for the John Prine Memorial Park. The project includes a new boat ramp, more parking, a picnic pavilion, new playground equipment and landscaping improvements. Prine, who died in 2020, wrote “Paradise” for his father about the small town of Paradise on the banks of the Green River. Now a ghost town, the Muhlenberg County site became the home of a coal plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority from the early 1960s to 2020. Prine attributed the town’s demise to strip mining, with a father telling his son, who asks to return to the county and Paradise: “Mister Peabody’s coal train has hauled it away.” After his death, Prine fans began to visit Rochester Dam, which is also mentioned in the song, to leave memorials to the musician. Lain and others approached Muhlenberg County Fiscal Court about renaming the park after Prine’s death and said officials were “immediately on board.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A federal judge has decided not to block the state’s plan to move two dozen troubled juvenile offenders from a suburban New Orleans detention center to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. In a 64-page ruling issued late Friday, Chief U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick denied a motion to immediately halt the plan to move the teenagers to the adult maximum-security facility despite calling it “untenable” and “disturbing,” The Advocate reports. The state’s Office of Juvenile Justice proved in a three-day court hearing this month that it could provide the youth constitutionally required levels of care at the Angola facility, Dick wrote. “The prospect of putting a teenager to bed at night in a locked cell behind razor wire surrounded by swamps at Angola is disturbing,” the judge said in the ruling. “Some of the children in OJJ’s care are so traumatized and emotionally and psychologically disturbed that OJJ is virtually unable to provide a secure care environment.” But she also wrote: “While locking children in cells at night at Angola is untenable, the threat of harm these youngsters present to themselves, and others, is intolerable. The untenable must yield to the intolerable.”\n\nMaine\n\nKittery: Clammers will once again be permitted to dig for soft-shell clams, quahogs, oysters and mussels at Brave Boat Harbor. With the nod of approval from the state Department of Marine Resources, the town is reopening a long-closed tidal flat now deemed safe for shellfish harvesting. A limited number of licenses to harvest shellfish from Brave Boat Harbor will be sold by the town starting in October to both residents and nonresidents, as approved by the Kittery Town Council. Chuck Moran, the town’s deputy harbormaster and shellfish warden, told the council that the Department of Marine Resources found Brave Boat Harbor to be safe for clamming close to a year ago. Since that time, the town has been working with the Department of Marine Resources to prepare for the tidal flat’s reopening and the rollout of shellfish harvesting licenses. “We are now ready to look to sell licenses and open up the clamming season,” Moran said. Department of Marine Resources spokesperson Jeff Nichols confirmed the state found Brave Boat Harbor, which had been closed for a number of years due to higher levels of fecal coliform, to be safe to reopen last October.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The official portrait of retired Maryland Court of Appeals Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera has been unveiled. The depiction was destined to be highly symbolic, as it would be the first of 24 such drawings of the state’s top jurists going back to 1778 to feature a woman. But contained in the portrait are a host of symbols chosen to depict a dedicated judge, accomplished appellate attorney, fierce advocate, proud Marylander, and loving wife, mother and grandmother. Barbera stepped down from the high court last September upon reaching Maryland’s mandatory judicial retirement age of 70. Current Chief Judge Matthew J. Fader hosted the unveiling ceremony at the high court and said a young girl visiting the Court of Appeals might reasonably ask where the women are upon gazing at the portraits of all the men circling the atrium outside the courtroom. “After this afternoon, never again,” Fader said. “We will finally have a portrait of a female chief judge.” In the portrait, Barbera is seated in the red judicial robe she wore for the eight years she served as chief judge, and on her lap are legal briefs of a case pending before the high court. On the table beside her is a gavel, which she said represents not only the job of a judge but a note of thanks to her dozens of law clerks.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The city’s fire department has been awarded nearly $15 million in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to hire 60 new firefighters and purchase new equipment. “This funding from FEMA will assist our department in accomplishing its mission to protect the lives and property of the community by increasing daily staffing for a safer and more effective fire and emergency response,” Acting Fire Chief Martin Dyer said in an announcement. “We have a growing community, and that requires increased resources to ensure we have the personnel and equipment needed.” The city received two grants. The Staffing for Adequate Fire Emergency Response program awarded $14.1 million for the salaries of 60 new firefighters over the next three years. A second grant of $806,000 from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program will increase the fire department’s inventory of self-contained breathing apparatuses, personal radios and turnout gear for new recruits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state loosened regulations on staffing levels this spring and allowed for more frequent lockdowns at Wayne County’s juvenile jail amid understaffing and overcrowding so severe it has been operating under a “temporary disaster” plan. Complaints have grown that the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Facility has confined residents to their rooms for long periods and deprived them of basic care, including daily showers, recreation time and vital medication. In a move described as “rare,” the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, which is charged with overseeing the facility, first approved the jail’s request for a temporary waiver of licensing rules at the end of April because of its staffing problems. The rules variance allows the jail to operate with fewer staff and lets them lock residents in their rooms facility-wide when there aren’t enough workers. A month after the rules were relaxed, police were called to control a group of 18 residents who had gotten out of their secure rooms, destroyed property and fought each other, after one boy may have popped a lock and snagged a staffer’s set of keys. The juveniles blamed their breakout, in part, on not being let out of their rooms. “We are tired of not getting our showers. Nothing against you,” a youth told a staffer, according to an internal county investigation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: In-person voting for the midterm elections opened Friday, kicking off a six-week sprint to Election Day in a landscape that has changed much since the pandemic drove a shift to mail balloting in the 2020 presidential contest. Twenty people voted in the first hour as Minneapolis opened its early voting center, taking advantage of generous rules that election officials credit with making the state a perennial leader in voter turnout. First in when the doors opened was Conrad Zbikowski, a 29-year-old communications and digital consultant who said he has voted early since at least 2017. “I like to vote early because you never know what might happen on Election Day,” Zbikowski said, displaying his civic pride with a T-shirt that bore the sailboat logo of the City of Lakes. “You might get sick; you might get COVID; you might get in a car crash – there’s many things that can happen. But what you do have control over is being able to vote early and getting that ballot in.” Minnesota’s ballot includes races for governor and other statewide offices, with control of the Legislature at stake, too. Zbikowski said he doesn’t take the right to vote for granted, given that his family came to America from Russia when it didn’t have free elections. As a part-time poll worker – he was off duty Friday – he said he’s seen Minnesota’s safeguards firsthand and has full confidence in the integrity of the process.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: After the state spent millions of dollars in welfare money on Brett Favre’s pet project, a university volleyball arena, the retired NFL quarterback tried two years later to get additional cash from the state’s welfare agency for another sports facility, new court documents show. The governor at the time, Republican Phil Bryant, texted in 2019 with Favre, who wanted to build an indoor practice facility for the University of Southern Mississippi’s football team. Bryant told him federal money for children and low-income adults is “tightly controlled,” and “improper use could result in violation of Federal Law.” Text messages between Bryant and Favre are in court documents filed Friday by Bryant’s lawyers that seek to show the governor was willing to help Favre raise private money for the volleyball facility starting in 2017 and was unaware for more than two years that welfare money was going to the project. Mississippi’s largest-ever public corruption case has ensnared several people, including a pro wrestler whose drug rehab was funded with welfare money. The state has filed a civil lawsuit against Favre and others to recover more than $20 million in misspent welfare money intended to help needy people in one of the country’s poorest states. Neither Bryant nor Favre is facing criminal charges.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The speaker of the state House is urging the U.S. attorney in Kansas City to shut down Agape Boarding School, accusing the Christian school of “what amounts to organized crime against children.” Republican House Speaker Rob Vescovo sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Attorney Teresa Moore that was made available to reporters Monday. In it, Vescovo said state efforts to close the school have failed, and the local prosecutor has failed to take action to protect the boys who attend the school in the southwestern Missouri town of Stockton. “Right now in Missouri we are faced with the horrifying truth that a network of immoral individuals have engaged in what amounts to organized crime against children,” Vescovo wrote. But he said the situation is “more far-reaching and contains more deeply-rooted corruption than we are able to address solely at the state level.” Vescovo didn’t immediately respond to an interview request to explain his concerns about corruption. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City declined comment. Agape’s attorney, John Schultz, called the allegations against the school “100% false.” “There’s no evidence to support closing down Agape,” Schultz said.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest is seeking outdoor enthusiasts to spend the spring or summer working to preserve and protect one of the landscapes that they love. “Positions are available in multiple fields, including fire, recreation, natural resources, range, timber, visitor services, and archaeology,” park officials said in a statement about the more than 150 seasonal jobs for next spring and summer, with a weeklong application window opening Thursday. “Whether you want to work outside next summer or help visitors plan their trips, working for the Forest Service is an excellent way to build lifelong skills and connections. You will have the opportunity to enjoy a challenging adventure while contributing to an important mission.” The forest encompasses 2.8 million acres across central and north-central Montana. It includes island mountain ranges bisected by the Continental Divide and Missouri River and portions of 17 Montana counties, extending from the border of Glacier National Park to the southern tip of the Crazy Mountains and east across the Big Snowy Mountains south of Lewistown. “This forest provides timber for people, forage for cattle and wildlife, habitat for fish, plants, and animals, and some of the best recreation opportunities in the country,” the news release said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A mining company that wants to extract an assortment of rare elements from southeast Nebraska has announced an agreement that will provide up to $285 million to help cover the roughly $1.1 billion cost of building the mine. In addition to a merger with a special purpose acquisition company called GX Acquisition Corp. II that NioCorp announced Monday, the Colorado-based company also signed letters of intent to borrow up to $81 million more from Yorkville Advisors Global. So NioCorp could get as much as $366 million to finance the project. NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said that “these transactions have the potential to put NioCorp on the fast track to obtain the required project financing.” The main element NioCorp plans to produce at the mine about 80 miles south of Omaha near the town of Elk Creek is a heat-resistant element called niobium, along with scandium and titanium. The company has said analysis of samples from the site shows there is also a significant amount of rare earth elements there like the ones President Joe Biden wants to produce more of domestically. But it’s not yet sure whether it will be economically feasible to also produce some of those elements that are used to create the strong magnets used in a variety of high-tech products such as electric vehicles and cellphones.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Gov. Steve Sisolak says the state is launching a prescription discount card, a method of softening the rising costs of medications. The digital card, called ArrayRX, saves an average of 80% on generic prescriptions and up to 20% on brand-name drugs and is free for Nevadans, Sisolak said. For those without health insurance, the card is set to lower costs significantly, the Democratic governor said at a Thursday press conference in Las Vegas. Those with health insurance will be able to compare their costs with ArrayRX and can opt for whichever option is cheaper, he said. “Taking care of yourself and prioritizing your health shouldn’t leave you bankrupt,” Sisolak said. State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro said the digital card is “another tool in our toolbox to ensure that Nevadans can continue to afford the health care that they need and to take care of their families.” Sisolak announced in February at his State of the State address that Nevada would join Oregon and Washington in the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium, a program to reduce prescription costs through state discount systems. There is no cost to the state, Nevada’s Health and Human Services spokesperson said. Instead, a small transaction fee built into the price paid by the consumer helps cover the cost of the program.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSeabrook: The state Department of Safety’s report on the July 12 false alarm sounding at the NextEra Seabrook nuclear power plant finds that because there was no procedure in place for an inadvertent siren activation, it took almost an hour to start notifying the public there was no emergency at the nuclear plant. The result, according to officials in the beach communities, was a certain degree of panic from many beachgoers and local residents who had been told to leave the area by the sirens’ verbal broadcasts at 10:50 a.m. That panic was made worse by a few well-meaning but problematic good Samaritans who drove around Hampton telling people to evacuate because there was a problem at the Seabrook Station nuclear power plant. Although many could accept human error at the power plant caused the 10 alarms to be sounded by mistake, it was the lack of proper public notification that frustrated authorities and the public. It wasn’t until 11:49 a.m., according to the report’s timeline, that state officials transmitted information to the public of the inadvertent alarm activation via social media. WOKQ, the radio station listed in the Seabrook Station Emergency information brochures to get updated information in case of an emergency, was never notified.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Former Gov. James Florio, who championed a plan that substantially raised the state’s sales and income taxes, leading to his reelection defeat in 1993, died Sunday. He was 85. His law partner Doug Steinhardt and current Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed Florio died in statements Monday. “Governor Florio was a fighter who never backed down. He was a leader who cared more about the future of New Jersey than his own political fortunes,” Murphy, a fellow Democrat, said in his statement. Florio was a longtime public servant who held numerous posts on the local, county, state and federal levels. A Democrat, he made three unsuccessful gubernatorial runs before finally succeeding in 1989, when he defeated Republican Jim Courter and became the first Italian American to serve as the state’s chief executive. Florio drew sharp criticism in 1990 when he pushed a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature that extended a sales tax to, among other things, toilet paper. It spawned massive voter resentment and spurred the formation of Hands Across New Jersey, an anti-tax grassroots group that used rolls of toilet paper as its symbol. Florio was ousted after one term by Republican Christie Whitman, who tapped into voter anger over the tax hike and won the race by about 26,000 votes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state has granted funds to pay for possible prosecutions connected to last year’s fatal film-set shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. The state Board of Finance greenlit more than $317,000 to cover the cost of investigating potential charges in the shooting on the set of “Rust” outside Santa Fe. First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies made an emergency request for the funds to go toward a special prosecutor, special investigator, several experts and other personnel. As many as four people could face charges, according to a copy of the request obtained by the newspaper, though Carmack-Altwies did not say anyone definitely would. “One of the possible defendants is well known movie actor Alec Baldwin,” she said. When reached for comment by the newspaper, she declined to say which crew members or cast could face charges. The possible charges at which her office is looking range from homicide to violations of state gun statutes. Carmack-Altwies said she is expecting to receive the final investigation report from the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office soon.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York City officials are appealing a judge’s ruling that they lacked the legal authority to fire members of the city’s largest police union for violating a COVID-19 vaccination mandate. State Supreme Court Judge Lyle Frank in Manhattan ruled Friday that the city health department’s mandate couldn’t be used to fire or put on leave members of the Police Benevolent Association. Frank said it was “undisputed” that city officials could issue vaccine mandates. But the judge said officials overstepped their authority by unilaterally creating a new condition of employment, as opposed to going through collective bargaining. Frank ordered the reinstatement of union members who were “wrongfully” terminated or put on unpaid leave for refusing to get vaccinated. The city immediately filed a notice of appeal, freezing the judge’s decision until the appeal is heard. “This decision confirms what we have said from the start: the vaccine mandate was an improper infringement on our members’ right to make personal medical decisions in consultation with their own health care professionals,” PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. A spokesman for the city’s Law Department said the ruling “is at odds with every other court decision upholding the mandate as a condition of employment.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: After years of anticipation, a collection of rarely exhibited drawings by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn is now on display at the Ackland Art Museum. The Ackland’s newest exhibit, “Drawn to Life: Master Drawings from the Age of Rembrandt in the Peck Collection,” includes dozens of 17th and 18th century drawings by Dutch and Flemish artists, including five sketches by Rembrandt, who died in 1669. They’re all from the Peck Collection, which the Ackland received in 2017. It was the largest-ever gift for the UNC-Chapel Hill art museum, courtesy of the late UNC alumnus Sheldon Peck and his wife, Leena Peck. This vast collection, valued at $17 million, included 134 Dutch and Finnish drawings. “Drawn to Life,” with 70 pieces of work, marks the first time many of these drawings will be on view to the public since the donation. The museum notes that many can only be on display for short periods of time because they’re sensitive to light. While Rembrandt’s paintings and portraits from the Dutch Golden Age famously strike viewers with awe and a radiant glow, these drawings tell a vastly different story. This collection features more understated works that are meant to be looked at for longer periods of time.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There is little indication that an 18-year-old who died after being struck by an SUV was a political extremist as the driver claimed. Investigators say none of the witnesses they have interviewed support the idea that there was a political argument before authorities say Shannon Brandt struck Cayler Ellingson with his vehicle Sept. 18 in McHenry, and a family friend who knew the teen said he wasn’t active in politics. Court documents said Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that he felt threatened after having a political argument with Ellingson and believed the teen was part of a “Republican extremist group.” North Dakota Highway Patrol Capt. Bryan Niewind said Friday that authorities have talked to dozens of witnesses and plan to talk to more as they try to get a better picture of exactly what happened before the crash. “I can’t get into details about what the witnesses are describing to us. But what I can tell you is that this is not political in nature at all,” he said. “There is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim on the 911 call that Mr. Ellingson was a Republican extremist. There is no evidence to support that all through our continued investigation.” He also said there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was calling others to come hurt Brandt.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Teachers barricaded classrooms, kids texted their parents, and police rushed to high school campuses across the state Friday as a rash of hoax reports of school shootings were made. Legislators are trying to make it a felony to knowingly make a false emergency report. State Rep. Kevin Miller, R-Newark, and state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, have introduced companion bills to increase the penalties on “swatting” − making bogus reports to bring about a big police response, usually to a residence. The legislation would make it a third-degree felony and elevate it to a first-degree felony if anyone is seriously injured as a result of the false report. Those convicted could also be ordered to pay the government for resources spent on the hoax call. “I’m appalled by this type of behavior. It especially sickens me that they’d do this to schools. Think of the emotional impact that these types of incidences have on all those involved,” said Miller, a retired state trooper. He said currently such calls are prosecuted as misdemeanors under inducing panic or making a false alarm. Brenner said in testimony that swatting started as a prank among online gamers who would call in a report to get a SWAT team to show up while someone was streaming their video game play. Brenner and Miller both said they hope their bills gain momentum when lawmakers return to voting session after the elections.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A church with a distinctive white, egg-shaped dome was torn down early Monday after the congregation’s attorney previously said recent asbestos removal was not part of any plan to destroy the First Christian Church building. The property, which also includes the former home of Jewel Box Theater, was home to one of the city’s biggest churches when it opened in the 1950s. The property was put up for sale in 2017 with a dwindling congregation still worshipping there. Preservationists thought they had a savior for the building when Crossings Church signed a purchase contract for the landmark in 2019. But that deal fell through when the congregation’s leadership concluded the costs of renovation exceeded their budget for a new location. A local developer, Andy Burnett, was among the latest to make an offer for the property. When contacted by phone Sunday night, Burnett confirmed he offered $2 million, all cash, with a closing in 45 days, to buy the property and keep the buildings standing as part of indoor and outdoor sand volleyball and sports complex. Burnett said he had not gotten a response but was hopeful and willing to continue the conversation.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Some parks officials say high demand for crowded campsites is leading to arguments, fistfights and even so-called campsite pirates. Brian Carroll with Linn County Parks and Recreation said park rangers had to play mediator this summer as would-be campers argued over first-come, first-served campsites at Sunnyside County Park. “People were literally fighting over campsites,” Carroll said. “What we experienced this year was certainly a general level of increased frustration and anxiety of people not being able to get their campsite. There seems to be less general common courtesy going on.” Tensions also escalated over reserved campsites, with some recreationists wrongly claiming already-reserved sites by tearing off the reservation tags and replacing them with their own, prompting the nickname “campsite pirates.” The original parties end up angry and confused when they arrive to find their campsite occupied. The practice isn’t common, but it’s happening more than it used to, Carroll said. “In the past, it was extremely rare,” he said. Earlier this year, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department said it would seek legislation to give rangers added protection because of the increasing level of assaults and harassment targeting rangers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers at the Philadelphia Museum of Art began a strike Monday, citing wage and health care issues, as the institution said it would remain open during the walkout. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the union representing about 180 of the museum’s approximately 350 workers set up picket lines Monday at entrances to the main building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and at the nearby Perelman Building and the Rodin Museum on the parkway. The museum posted a notice on social media saying it was open as usual Monday, with officials saying managers and nonunion employees would run the operation. “We are committed to serving our community as we continue to negotiate in good faith toward a fair and appropriate new labor agreement,” the museum said. Museum workers voted to unionize in July 2020, and leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 47, Local 397, said Friday that they had been in talks with the museum on a new contract for two years without success. Union officials said higher wages and reducing health care costs are among the important issues outstanding. “Our members will not accept a contract that does not bring wages and benefits at the museum up to an acceptable standard,” DC47 President Cathy Scott said in a statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With his Republican challenger nipping at his heels and calling him “out of touch,” Gov. Dan McKee on Monday scaled back, for now, the raises of up to 43% his administration was proposing for his Cabinet members. In a statement read aloud at a public hearing by Brian Daniels, the head of the state’s Office of Management and Budget, McKee said he was unaware of the state law dictating flat salaries for high-level agency directors when his administration submitted the original salary package. Among the proposed moves: a $60,000 pay hike for the state’s health director that would raise the salary for the position – held by a series of temporary replacements since Dr. Nicole Alexander Scott’s resignation last winter – from $140,000 a year to $200,000 a year. When first talking about that and other double-digits pay hikes, McKee said he envisioned them as new salary maximums to be phased in over time, not all-at-once increases. “However, it is now my understanding that, by statute, the proposals represent flat rates and not salary caps,” he said. “With that in mind, I conducted a balancing test between what is best for talent development in the civil service and what is the most fiscally responsible path forward for Rhode Island taxpayers.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 20 people were arrested and more than 300 dogs rescued as authorities raided dogfighting kennels in the state, federal prosecutors said Monday. The sting started when state and federal agents interrupted a dog fight in Richland County on Saturday, U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said in a statement. That led agents to serve 23 warrants Sunday at what were known to be places where dogs fight or are trained to fight in Clarendon, Lee, Orangeburg, Richland, Sumter and York counties, investigators said. Twenty people face state charges of animal cruelty and dogfighting, authorities said. Investigators also seized about 30 guns and $40,000 in cash, prosecutors said. Officials said 305 dogs were rescued, with about 275 of them believed to be part of the dogfighting ring. The Humane Society of the United States and Bark Nation are helping to take care of the dogs. Some of the dogs had severe scars, open wounds and cuts, the Humane Society said. Some of the dogs were unusually thin, chained to trees with no way of getting food or water, the agency said. The arrests over the weekend are the first steps in a broader investigation that could include federal charges, Boroughs said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State Rep. Linda Duba, D-Sioux Falls, shared her abortion story for the first time in public during a reproductive justice rally organized by the South Dakota Democratic Party on Sunday. Standing on a stage and speaking to a crowd of people dressed in green – the international symbol for abortion access – at Fawick Park in Sioux Falls, Duba told the story of a young college girl in the winter of 1976 who found herself pregnant. Although abortion had been legal in the United States for nearly three years with the passage of Roe v. Wade, abortions were still not provided in South Dakota. “She came from a family who was pretty strict. She was worried about what people would think of her if they found out that she was pregnant, and that young girl was me,” Duba said. Duba was one of five speakers, four of whom are running for office this November, who spoke about the importance of abortion access. Because of a 2005 trigger law tied to the U.S. Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe in June, abortions in South Dakota are banned, even in cases of rape and incest. Duba said that women today must travel out of state, similar to what she had to do 47 years ago when she was a sophomore at South Dakota State University and went to Minneapolis on a Saturday for a 15-minute abortion procedure. “It was probably one of the scariest times in my life, and then I came back home, and I never told a soul,” she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennesseans are being asked to cement a right-to-work law into the state constitution at the ballot box in November – a move touted by pro-business leaders but adamantly opposed by labor unions. The state’s right-to-work law allows employees to opt out of joining a union and paying the dues even if the workforce is unionized. Tennessee’s major unions are against Amendment 1 and criticized the right-to-work law for creating a “free-loader situation.” “It makes unions the only entity that has to provide services to people who did not pay for them,” said Jason Freeman, the political director with Service Employees International Union Local 205, based in Nashville. “A majority of workers in a place can choose to unionize, and then the people who have not joined are entitled to the benefits and services their co-workers are paying for, while they are not.” Supporters of the amendment said they believe the right-to-work law bolsters Tennessee’s business-friendly economic climate and provides workers with a choice. “Through unions, employees can be forced to join something that they disagree with,” said Justin Owen, the president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, a conservative think tank. “That violates their freedom of association and should ultimately be left up to the individual.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A year after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott defended the state’s new abortion law – which makes no exceptions in cases of rape – by assuring that Texas would get to work eliminating sexual assaults, Lindsey LeBlanc is busy as ever helping rape victims in a college town outside Houston. “The numbers have stayed consistently high,” said LeBlanc, executive director of the Sexual Assault Resource Center in Bryan, near Texas A&M University. Despite hiring two additional counselors in the past six months, she still has a waitlist for victims. “We are struggling to keep up with demand,” she said. Overwhelming majorities of voters think their state should generally allow abortion in specific cases, including rape, incest or if the health of the pregnant person is endangered. Asked what Abbott has done in the past year to eliminate rape, spokeswoman Renae Eze highlighted older measures to clear rape test kit backlogs, a law signed in June aimed at coordinating and expanding sexual assault resources, and a task force his office launched in 2019 to address the issue. More than 14,000 rape crimes have been reported in Texas since the law took effect last year, according to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety. That was slightly down from the year before and consistent with a decline in other violent crime figures across the state.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Two women survived a mountain lion attack over the weekend when they were running in a canyon east of Salt Lake City. They came upon the mountain lion as they came around a corner on a trail run Sunday morning in Millcreek Canyon, said Faith Jolley, a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The mountain lion leapt at the woman closest to the animal, leaving two puncture wounds on leg, she said. They were able to get away and down the mountain after the uninjured woman threw a rock at the mountain lion. The woman’s injuries aren’t considered life-threatening, Jolley said. Wildlife officials later found the mountain lion they believe was the one in the attack and euthanized the animal. Jolley said mountain lion attacks are quite rare in that part of Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The retail sale of adult-use marijuana becomes legal in the state Saturday, ushering in a new source of revenue for Vermont, as well as satisfied customers, advocates hope. But in reality, hardly anyone will be ready to start selling Oct. 1. As of Friday, only three businesses had their licenses from the Cannabis Control Board: Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland, FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury and CeresMED in Burlington. And only three businesses had their licenses from the city of Burlington − Ceres, Grass Queen and Green State Dispensary − making CeresMED the only business in the city with both state and city licenses in place. Russell Todia, chief operating officer of CaresMED, said in an email that the downtown Burlington store is “tracking to begin adult-use cannabis sales in Vermont on October 1.” Nellie Marvel of the Cannabis Control Board said Friday the board will likely approve at least one more retail outlet at next week’s board meeting. “I cannot say at this time which those might be, or how many will be presented to the board for approval,” Marvel said. “Those numbers are subject to change pretty much until the last minute as we continue to have communications from applicants.” A total of 30 businesses have applied to the Cannabis Control Board for retail licenses.\n\nVirginia\n\nMcLean: The CIA has revealed a model of Ayman al-Zawahri’s safe house, used to brief President Joe Biden about the al-Qaida leader’s whereabouts before the agency killed him in a drone strike in Afghanistan. Shortly after al-Zawahri’s death, White House officials released a photo showing Biden talking to CIA Director William Burns with a closed wooden box on the table in front of them. Now, the contents of the box – a model depicting a white-walled home with at least five stories and three partially obscured balconies – are on display at the CIA Museum inside the agency’s Virginia headquarters. The museum is closed to the public, and access is generally limited to the agency’s employees and guests. The CIA allowed journalists to tour the museum, newly refurbished in time for the agency’s 75th anniversary, as part of a broader effort to showcase its history and achievements. Most of the exhibits took years or decades to declassify. The al-Zawahri model home is the rare artifact that had been used by intelligence officers just weeks beforehand. Al-Zawahri was killed in late July, nearly a year after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ending a two-decade war in which the CIA had a central role. The agency sent the first American forces two weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People in the greater Seattle area will be asked to approve as much as $1.25 billion in new taxes to improve the mental health system and build five regional crisis care centers. The Seattle Times reports King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell and others on Monday said they would put the tax plan on the April 2023 ballot. The King County levy would begin in 2024. The median-value homeowner would pay about $121 that year and continue through 2032. Officials did not say where the new five crisis facilities would be located. The tax package would also maintain and invest in residential treatment beds at long-term facilities that provide youth and adults with addiction and mental health treatment.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeaver: A federal civil rights lawsuit has been filed against a jail on behalf of current and former inmates who have described conditions at the facility as inhumane. The complaint filed last week about conditions at Southern Regional Jail in Beaver references a lack of access to water and food, as well as overcrowded conditions and fights that were allowed to continue until someone was injured, WVVA-TV reports. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the station that the agency could not comment on ongoing litigation, but an investigation of conditions at the jail earlier this year found no evidence of inhumane treatment. Republican Gov. Jim Justice ordered the investigation in March after WVVA reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in an April statement.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative news outlet sued the Wisconsin Parole Commission on Monday, alleging that it has refused to comply with open records requests made earlier this year. Wisconsin Right Now has been publishing a series of articles highlighting violent offenders who have received parole under Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration. A reporter for the outlet in May requested lists of all offenders who have been granted parole, release or early release since 2019, when Evers appointed John Tate as chairman of the commission. The commission sent a list of offenders released through 2021 and said in June that it would provide more recent information as it became available. According to the lawsuit, the commission did not respond to further communications or provide that information. The commission and the governor’s office did not immediately respond to messages left Monday. Tate stepped down from his role in June at Evers’ request after the decision to parole a man who served less than 25 years of an 80-year sentence for stabbing his wife to death angered the victim’s family and drew criticism from Republicans in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state’s Department of Transportation wants to use 23 acres of federal land to house temporary laborers as construction ramps up on a highway project, but conservationists are pushing back, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. The parcel, under U.S. Bureau of Land Management control, isn’t “an appropriate site” and would be better turned into a public park, a proposal first made in the 1990s, said Jared Baecker, director of the nonprofit Snake River Fund. Bob Hammond, an engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation, told the newspaper that while he understands the desire to preserve the land for recreation, “there’s no funding to do it in the next five or more years.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/25/eagle-cam-lynching-memorial-midwest-wildfires-news-around-states/50871577/", "title": "Eagle cam, lynching memorial: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After the company that opened a high-tech recycling center in the city went belly-up, and a second company needed steep government subsidies to keep it running, Mayor Steven Reed said the city has decided to cut its losses, end its public recycling service and sell the building. People in Montgomery throw all their trash into one container, and it’s separated and sorted into re-sellable goods at the $37 million facility. RePower South has handled operations there since 2019, when the company poured $10 million into upgrades to produce alternative fuel. But the price of commodities crashed the following year when China changed its import policies, and the facility couldn’t claw back into the black. Since then, Montgomery has paid RePower South about $2 million in subsidies to keep plant operations afloat. Reed said the company may continue to provide service temporarily, but the subsidies are over. RePower South issued a statement Friday afternoon saying it “will soon be announcing a new partnership to bring an advanced plastics recycling capability to Montgomery to build a sustainable, circular economy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Republican gubernatorial candidate faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor. The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay. The photographs will be displayed in the airport’s terminal for departing flights, across from the TSA office, through next October. The public will be able to view the exhibit without purchasing a ticket or going through the TSA security checkpoints. Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Districts in Laramie, Teton and Fremont counties will be the first to try the program to recruit and train educators, and other schools may be able to join the effort in 2024, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}]}

If granted, the power plant is expected to return to operation in 2028.\n\nA first for nuclear power\n\n“Powering industries critical to our nation’s global economic and technological competitiveness, including data centers, requires an abundance of energy that is carbon-free and reliable every hour of every day, and nuclear plants are the only energy sources that can consistently deliver on that promise,” Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation Energy, said in a statement on Friday.\n\nWhen Three Mile Island was shuttered for economic reasons in 2019, it had a generating capacity of 837 megawatts, enough to power more than 800,000 homes. Once brought back online, Constellation Energy said that it expected to once again generate more than 800 megawatts of electricity for Microsoft, as well as potentially add up $16 billion to Pennsylvania’s GDP along with 3,400 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nNo U.S. nuclear power plant has ever reopened after being decommissioned, which could make the Three Mile Island plant a first once it is brought back to operational status.\n\nWhat happened at Three Mile Island\n\nThree Mile Island, located near Harrisburg, is best known as the site of the most serious nuclear accident in U.S. history. In 1979, a mechanical failure caused the partial meltdown of the facility’s Unit 2 reactor, which has remained closed ever since. While the amount of radiation released during the accident was ultimately relatively minor, the incident was widely seen as causing public distrust of the nuclear power industry.\n\nA statewide poll conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research found state residents favoring restarting Three Mile Island by a more than 2-1 margin, according to Constellation Energy’s press release.\n\nRecent power demands from tech companies, much of it driven by the vast energy resources required by data centers supporting artificial intelligence, has led them to seek out nuclear power options.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon Web Services announced plans to purchase energy for one of it’s data centers from Talen Energy’s Susquehanna nuclear power plant, also located in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft's efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our commitment to become carbon negative,” Microsoft VP of Energy Bobby Hollis said on Friday. “Microsoft continues to collaborate with energy providers to develop carbon-free energy sources to help meet the grids' capacity and reliability needs,\"\n\nMax Hauptman is a Trending Reporter for USA TODAY.

But there’s another thing these tech giants aren’t cutting: Their growing business ties to the oil and gas industry.\n\nWhen Microsoft held an all-staff meeting in September, an employee asked CEO Satya Nadella if it was ethical for the company to be selling its cloud computing services to fossil fuel companies, according to two other Microsoft employees who described the exchange on condition they not be named. Such partnerships, the worker told Nadella, were accelerating the oil companies’ greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nMicrosoft and other tech giants have been competing with one another to strike lucrative partnerships with ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP and other energy firms, in many cases supplying them not just with remote data storage but also artificial intelligence tools for pinpointing better drilling spots or speeding up refinery production.\n\nAI bias:How tech determines if you land job, get a loan or end up in jail\n\nThe oil and gas industry is spending roughly $20 billion each year on cloud services, which accounts for about 10% of the total cloud market, according to Vivek Chidambaram, a managing director of Accenture’s energy consultancy. It’s not yet clear whether the extraction industry is getting its money’s worth, although experts remain bullish about the application of advanced technology to oil and gas exploration.\n\nNadella sought to assuage employee concerns at the Sept. 12 meeting, first by reiterating Microsoft’s internal efforts on environmental sustainability, according to the workers, who asked for anonymity because they feared retaliation for speaking about an internal meeting. The employees said Nadella also defended Microsoft’s energy partners, pointing out their investments in researching and developing more sustainable energy production methods.\n\n“There’s no fossil fuel CEO who sits there and says, ‘You know, I’m just gonna deny climate change,‘” Nadella said, according to the employees’ transcript of his remarks. “If anything, they’re all saying, ‘Let us have, in fact, the regulation, the pricing mechanisms that get us to this future.’”\n\nFederal court:FCC had the right to dump net-neutrality rules\n\nMicrosoft said in an emailed statement Tuesday that it is “focused on helping companies of all kinds become more efficient, including energy companies.” It declined to comment on Nadella’s remarks, which were part of a regularly scheduled “all-hands” gathering in which the CEO welcomes questions on a range of topics.\n\nLess than a week after that exchange and days before a planned worldwide protest over climate change, Microsoft announced yet another major deal for its Azure cloud computing platform – this time with Chevron and oilfield services giant Schlumberger. The timing of the announcement ahead of the climate protest and United Nations climate action meetings angered some environmentally-minded Microsoft workers and caught the attention of outsiders.\n\n“It is unconscionable that amid global climate protests, tech giants like Microsoft are announcing major partnerships with Big Oil,” said Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a tweet that coincided with the Sept. 20 global climate strike. “We must hold them accountable, demand they break ties with the fossil fuel industry, and move rapidly to sustainable energy.”\n\nEchoing that message was a small group of Microsoft employees who carried cardboard signs to a lunchtime protest that day outside of Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. “No Azure For Oil,” said one of the signs.\n\nBezos promises sustainability, defends oil industry\n\nAfter months of employee activism, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said he was pushing his company to the forefront on sustainability, committing it to have 100% of its energy use come from solar panels and other renewable energy by 2030. But he also defended Amazon’s work with the oil and gas industry, arguing that “we need to help them instead of vilify them.”\n\nSome experts say AI and cloud services could actually play a role in curbing emissions.\n\nDenying cloud computing services to the oil and gas industry would do little to address the bigger problem of the world’s ongoing dependence on fossil fuels, said Aseem Prakash, director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington.\n\n“We would not want to collapse the fossil fuel industry,” Prakash said. “We would want a soft landing.”\n\nIf anything, he said, an oil company’s shift to another company’s cloud platform may have some environmental benefits because it is more efficient than running its digital operations on its own servers. Driving down costs could also help open the door to investments in other, less polluting methods for generating energy.\n\nCharles Schwab eliminates online trading commissions:Fee war escalates, stock tanks\n\nIt’s less clear whether AI is mitigating pollution or worsening it. In their pitches to work with oil and gas companies, cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft have boasted of advanced machine-learning tools that can sift through huge troves of geologic and seismic data to help make decisions about where to extract resources. IDC oil analyst Gaurav Verma said AI is a critical technology for oil and gas companies that want to learn from that data to study oil reservoirs or predict when maintenance is needed on a pipeline.\n\n'It’s about how it’s being used'\n\nEarlier this year, ExxonMobil struck a deal to tap into Microsoft’s technology to capitalize on the shale oil boom in Texas and New Mexico. Microsoft has said that real-time data collected from a region spanning hundreds of miles would enable ExxonMobil “to make faster and better decisions” on drilling and well completion and support production growth by as much as 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2025.\n\nAn unsigned statement from Microsoft’s protesting workers said they’ve been “made complicit” by the company’s role in warming the planet.\n\n“Microsoft makes millions of dollars in profits by helping fossil fuel companies extract more oil,” the statement said.\n\nBut it’s not clear if tech giants are actually helping that much – in part because they may be overstating their own role in transforming Big Oil with AI.\n\n“The sundae they’re selling is the cloud,” said Chidambaram, the Accenture analyst. “The cherries they’re putting on it is the analytics.”\n\nChidambaram said that’s because oil industries are still cagey about sharing what they know about underground reserves and don’t want third parties analyzing that data.\n\nChidambaram said in the long run, however, AI could actually help meet climate goals. For example, machines that can capture better data and quickly analyze it could also help detect and reduce the leakage of methane from wells and pipelines, a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“Data can be used in many ways,” he said. “It’s about how it’s being used.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/investing/2024/03/12/selling-nvidia-billionaires-buying-these-artificial-intelligence-stocks/72940466007/", "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Investors Are Selling It and Buying These 2 ...", "text": "Sean Williams\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nOver the past 30 years, one of Wall Street's few constants is that there's always a next-big-thing trend or innovation garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors alike.\n\nAt the moment, no trend is captivating the attention and pocketbooks of investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhen discussing \"AI,\" I'm talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally manage. However, the true value of AI is seen with the incorporation of machine learning, which allows AI software and systems to evolve over time so they can become more efficient at their tasks.\n\nLast year, researchers at PwC released a report (\"PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution\") that suggested AI would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. This would include a $6.6 trillion increase in productivity, as well as $9.1 trillion derived from consumption-side effects.\n\nMore:Bye, department stores. Hello, AI. Is what's happening to Macy's and Nvidia a sign of the times?\n\nThe sector- and industrywide appeal of AI isn't lost on Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers. Billionaire investors from many of the most-watched investment funds have been strategically moving their capital into and out of certain artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nWhat's particularly noteworthy is that billionaires have been active sellers of the face of the AI movement -- semiconductor stock Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- while piling into two other AI stocks.\n\nBillionaire money managers are kicking Nvidia to the curb\n\nFollowing the end of every quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These 13Fs provide investors with detailed snapshots of what the top asset managers have been buying and selling. Based on the latest round of 13F filings, eight prominent billionaires put Nvidia on the chopping block, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millenium Management (1,689,322 shares)\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares)\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)\n\nDavid Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares)\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares)\n\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares)\n\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nNvidia has become what I regularly refer to as the \"infrastructure backbone\" of the AI movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are a staple of high-compute data centers. Demand has, thus far, handily outpaced supply of Nvidia's chips, leading to off-the-scale pricing power that's sent the company's data center sales through the roof.\n\nBut there's also no shortage of reasons to believe that the best for Nvidia has come and gone. In addition to growing external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia could contend with a significant amount of internal competition for AI chips from its own top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet, collectively account for around 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet all four companies are developing high-powered AI chips of their own.\n\nBillionaires might also be turned off by the regulatory headwinds Nvidia is dealing with. An initial round of export restrictions to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product, prompted Nvidia to develop the toned-down A800 and H800 chips. However, U.S. regulators ultimately restricted the export of these chips to China, as well. China is a key market for Nvidia, and these restrictions threaten to reduce its sales by billions of dollars every quarter.\n\nThe valuation doesn't make much sense, either. Nvidia is nearing the same levels that Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked at during the dot-com bubble, based on trailing-12-month sales. We've simply never seen a market-leading business trade at such a premium to its sales for an extended period of time. It shouldn't be that surprising that billionaires have been selling Nvidia stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 1 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Baidu\n\nThe first AI stock that had billionaire money managers completely forgetting about Nvidia during the December-ended quarter is China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU). Though not all billionaire investors will put their funds' money to work in China stocks, eight billionaires were buyers of Baidu (say that three times fast) during the fourth quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (290,154 shares)\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (147,481 shares)\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (135,600 shares)\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (80,815 shares)\n\nJim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (47,000 shares)\n\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (38,966 shares)\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (5,545 shares)\n\nBaidu's utilization of AI can be seen in two of its fastest-growing segments: cloud and intelligent driving. The company's AI Cloud can allow merchants to use generative AI solutions to tailor ads to individual customers. Meanwhile, Apollo Go is the world's most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service, with accumulated rides on public roads surpassing 5 million since inception. AI-fueled ventures are helping Baidu's non-online marketing segment grow by a double-digit percentage more often than not.\n\nWhat billionaire investors might appreciate with Baidu, in relation to Nvidia, is that its foundational operating segment would likely prevent it from tumbling if the AI bubble bursts. Baidu's internet search segment has accounted for between 60% and 85% of China-based internet search share over the past nine years. Having the clearly dominant search engine in China should afford Baidu strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates.\n\nBillionaires are likely also attracted to Baidu's minuscule valuation. Even factoring in the regulatory risks of investing in China-based companies, Baidu is valued at just 8 times forward-year earnings and less than 2 times trailing-12-month sales. It's a far cry from the mammoth valuation Wall Street has assigned to Nvidia, and presumably places a safe floor beneath Baidu's stock.\n\nArtificial intelligence stock No. 2 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Amazon\n\nThe other AI stock that had billionaires forgetting about Nvidia is none other than \"Magnificent Seven\" component Amazon. During the December-ended quarter, eight successful billionaire investors piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares)\n\nJim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares)\n\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares)\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares)\n\nDavid Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares)\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares)\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nAmazon is incorporating AI solutions into its operations in more ways than can be counted here. Some of the more intriguing applications include leaning on generative AI solutions within its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help merchants personalize advertising to consumers, as well as relying on generative AI to improve the quality of product listings for merchants.\n\nAlthough most people are familiar with Amazon because of its market-leading e-commerce platform, online retail sales contribute very little in the way of operating cash flow or profits since it's a low-margin segment. The lion's share of the cash flow Amazon generates can be traced back to its ancillary operations: AWS, subscription services, and advertising services.\n\nAWS is the critical cog that's powering Amazon's cash flow higher. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of growth, which suggests AWS can sustain its leading share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Despite only accounting for a sixth of Amazon's net sales, AWS was responsible for two-thirds of Amazon's operating income last year.\n\nAmazon is also historically cheap, when compared to Nvidia. Shares are currently valued at less than 13 times consensus cash flow per share for 2025, which represents a 44% discount to Amazon's average multiple to cash flow over the prior five-year period.\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

And now the real wolf might be just around the corner.\n\nThe threat is called “deepfaking,” a product of AI and machine learning advancements that allows high-tech computers to produce completely false yet remarkably realistic videos depicting events that never happened or people saying things they never said. A viral video starring Jordan Peele and “Barack Obama” warned against this technology in 2018, but the message was not enough to keep Jim Carrey from starring in “The Shining” earlier this week.\n\nWait, is that video real?:The race against deepfakes\n\nDeepfake:Instagram won't remove deepfake of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nThe danger goes far beyond manipulating 1980s thrillers. Deepfake technology is allowing organizations that produce fake news to augment their “reporting” with seemingly legitimate videos, blurring the line between reality and fiction like never before – and placing the reputation of journalists and the media at greater risk.\n\nBen Zhao, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago, thinks the age of getting news on social media makes consumers very susceptible to this sort of manipulation.\n\n“What the last couple years has shown is basically fake news is quite compelling even in (the) absence of actual proof. ... So the bar is low,” Zhao said.\n\nThe bar to produce a convincing doctored video is lower than people might assume.\n\n'Deepfake' videos:Can be generated with a single photo, research paper says\n\nFacebook:It's not deleting the fake Pelosi video. Should it?\n\nEarlier this year a clip purporting to show Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi slurring her words when speaking to the press was shared widely on social media, including at one point by Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani. However, closer inspection revealed that the video had been slowed to 75% of its normal speed to achieve this slurring effect, according to The Washington Post. Even with the real video now widely accessible, Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley’s School of Information and a digital forensics expert, said he still regularly receives emails from people insisting the slowed video is the legitimate one.\n\n“Even in these relatively simple cases, we are struggling to sort of set the record straight,” Farid said.\n\nIt would take a significant amount of expertise for a fake news outlet to produce a completely fabricated video of Oprah Winfrey endorsing Trump, but researchers say the technology is improving every day. At the University of Washington, computer vision researchers are developing this technology for positive, or at least benign, uses like making video conferencing more realistic and letting students talk to famous historical figures. But this research also leads to questions about potential dangers, as the attempts made by attackers are expected to continually improve.\n\nHow to detect a deepfake\n\nTo make one of these fake videos, computers digest thousands of still images of a subject to help researchers build a 3-D model of the person. This method has some limitations, according to Zhao, who noted the subjects in many deepfake videos today never blink, since almost all photographs are taken with a person’s eyes open.\n\nHowever, Farid said these holes in the technology are being filled incredibly rapidly.\n\n“If you asked me this question six months ago, I would’ve said, ‘Yeah, (the technology) is super cool, but there’s a lot of artifacts, and if you’re paying attention, you can probably tell that there’s something wrong,’” Farid said. “But I would say we are ... quickly but surely getting to the point where the average person is going to have trouble distinguishing.”\n\nIn fact, Zhao said researchers believe the shortcomings that make deepfake videos look slightly off to the eye can readily be fixed with better technology and better hardware.\n\n“The minute that someone says, ‘Here’s a research paper telling you about how to detect this kind of fake video,’ that is when the attackers look at the paper and say, ‘Thank you for pointing out my flaw. I will take that into account in my next-generation video, and I will go find enough input ... so that the next generation of my video will not have the same problem,’” Zhao said.\n\nDo you know what an FSA is?:It could save you $2,700 a year\n\nDrowning in student loan debt?:You may have to ditch your dream job\n\nOne of the more recent developments in this field is in generating speech for a video. To replicate a figure such as Trump’s voice, computers can now simply analyze hundreds of hours of him speaking. Then researchers can type out what they want Trump to say, and the computer will make it sound as if he actually said it. Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all more or less perfected this technology, according to Farid.\n\nManipulated videos of this sort aren’t exactly new – Forest Gump didn’t actually meet JFK, after all. However, Farid says this technology is hitting its stride, and that makes the danger new.\n\n“To me the threat is not so much ‘Oh, there’s this new phenomenon called deepfakes,’” Farid said. “It’s the injection of that technology into an existing environment of mistrust, misinformation, social media, a highly polarized electorate, and now I think there’s a real sort of amplification factor because when you hear people say things, it raises the level of belief to a whole new level.”\n\nThe prospect of widespread availability of this technology is raising eyebrows, too. Tech-savvy hobbyists have long been using deepfakes to manufacture pornography, a consistent and comically predictable trend for new technology. But Zhao believes it is only a matter of time before the research-caliber technology gets packaged and released for mass-video manipulation in much broader contexts.\n\n“At some point someone will basically take all these technologies and integrate and do the legwork to build a sort of fairly sophisticated single model, one-stop shop ... and when that thing hits and becomes easily accessible to many, then I think you’ll see this becoming much more prevalent,” Zhao said. “And there’s nothing really stopping that right now.”\n\nFacing a massive consumer trust issue\n\nWhen this happens, the journalism industry is going to face a massive consumer trust issue, according to Zhao. He fears it will be hard for top-tier media outlets to distinguish a real video from a doctored one, let alone news consumers who haphazardly stumble across the video on Twitter.\n\n“Once we live in an age where videos and images and audio can’t be trusted ... well, then everything can be fake,” Farid said. “We can have different opinions, but we can’t have different facts. And I think that’s sort of the world we’re entering into when we can’t believe anything that we see.”\n\nThinking about retirement?:Answer these 3 questions first\n\nElectric bills can be a pain:Here's where you'll pay the most for them\n\nZhao has spent a great deal of time speaking with prosecutors, judges – the legal profession is another sector where the implications are huge – reporters and other professors to get a sense for every nuance of the issue. However, despite his clear understanding of the danger deepfakes pose, he is still unsure of how news outlets will go about reacting to the threat.\n\n“Certainly, I think what can happen is ... there will be even less trust in sort of mainstream media, the main news outlets, legitimate journalists (that) sort of react and report real-time stories because there is a sense that anything that they have seen ... could be in fact made up,” Zhao said.\n\nThen it becomes a question of how the press deal with the disputes over reality.\n\n“And if it’s someone’s word, an actual eyewitness’ word versus a video, which do you believe, and how do you as an organization go about verifying the authenticity or the illegitimacy of a particularly audio or video?” Zhao asked.\n\nDefeating the deepfakes\n\nPart of this solution may be found in the ledger technology that provides the digital infrastructure to support cryptocurrencies like bitcoin – the blockchain. Many industries are touting blockchain as a sort of technological Tylenol. Though few understand exactly how it works, many swear it will solve their problems.\n\nFarid said companies like photo and video verification platform Truepic, to which he serves as an adviser, are using the blockchain to create and store digital signatures for authentically shot videos as they are being recorded, which makes them much easier to verify later. Both Zhao and Farid are hoping social platforms like Facebook and Twitter will then promote these videos that are verified as authentic over non-verified videos, helping to halt the spread of deepfakes.\n\n“The person creating the fake always has the upper hand,” Farid said. “Playing defense is really, really hard. So I think in the end our goal is not to eliminate these things, but it’s to manage the threat.”\n\nUntil this happens, Zhao said the fight against genuinely fake news may not start on a ledger, but in stronger consumer awareness and journalists banding together to better verify sources through third parties.\n\n“One of the hopes that I have for defeating this type of content is that people are just so inundated with news coverage and information about these types of videos that they become fundamentally much more skeptical about what a video means and they will look closer,” Zhao said. “There has to be that level of scrutiny by the consumer for us to have any chance of fighting back against this type of fake content.”\n\nNicholas Diakopoulos, assistant professor in Northwestern University’s School of Communication and expert on the future of journalism, said via email that the best solutions involve a mix of educational and sociotechnical advances.\n\n“There are a variety of perceptual cues that can be tip-offs to a deepfake and we should be teaching those broadly to the public,” he said.\n\nDiakopoulos has referenced Farid’s work on photo forensics among ideas outlined in an article he wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review last year. He also cited a research project called FaceForensics that uses machine learning to detect, with 98.1% accuracy, whether a video of a face is real. Another research technique under study: Blood flow in video of a person’s face can be analyzed in order to see if pixels periodically get redder when the heart pumps blood.\n\n“On the sociotechnical side, we need to develop advanced forensics techniques that can help debunk synthesized media when put into the hands of trained professionals,” he told CNBC. “Rapid response teams of journalists should be trained and ready to use these tools during the 2020 elections so they can debunk disinformation as quickly as possible.”\n\n'We need change':Amazon workers are planning a labor strike on Prime Day\n\nThe best country to be a woman?:It's not the US\n\nDiakopoulos has studied the implications of deepfakes for the 2020 elections specifically. He also has written papers on how journalists need to think when “reporting in a machine reality.”\n\nAnd he remains optimistic.\n\n“If news organizations develop clear and transparent policies of their efforts using such tools to ensure the veracity of the content they publish, this should help buttress their trustworthiness. In an era when we can’t believe our eyes when we see something online, news organizations that are properly prepared, equipped and staffed are poised to become even more trusted sources of information.”\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Ultra-low interest rates make many options that they might have turned to in the past unworkable today.\n\nHowever, dividend growth stocks could provide the answer. While dividend payments are usually optional, confidence in a stock may rely on a rising dividend, dramatically reducing the likelihood of a payout cut.\n\nMoreover, not only do some dividends match Fidelity's 4% to 5% recommended withdrawal rate, but they also offer the payout that growth investors need without reducing principal. Magellan Midstream Partners(NYSE: MMP), Realty Income(NYSE: O), and Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) are three such stocks that could fund a sustainable retirement.\n\n► The Daily Money: Get our latest personal finance stories in your inbox\n\nMagellan Midstream\n\nWith the intense focus on alternative energy, one might overlook a fossil fuel company like Magellan Midstream. Magellan transports, stores, and distributes crude oil and refined petroleum products. The company owns about 12,000 miles of pipeline used for these activities.\n\nInvest wisely: Best online brokers\n\nPetroleum has become an increasingly unpopular energy source, and management stated that the business and the stock suffered temporarily as the pandemic led to a significant decrease in the volumes of crude oil and refined product transported in its pipelines. Magellan Midstream has not fully recovered, and it has lost 25% of its value since the beginning of 2020.\n\nHowever, the U.S. still derives 35% of the energy it consumes from petroleum, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This makes it unlikely that crude oil will go away as an energy source anytime soon.\n\nMoreover, its $4.15 per share annual dividend brings a cash return of around 8.8%. That might sound like a payout vulnerable to a cut. Nonetheless, the company increased its payout by $0.04 per share in the third quarter.\n\nIndeed, a 1% increase over two years may not impress. Still, its annual payout has continued to rise every year since it began trading in 2001. Additionally, just over $1 billion in free cash flow during the first nine months of 2021 covered the $685 million cost of its distributions, keeping its payout sustainable.\n\nMagellan Midstream stock might continue to underperform. But petroleum as an energy source will likely linger for decades, and at current payout levels, Magellan should continue to pay retirees well.\n\n► Nearing retirement? Walmart and Microsoft stock is as safe as it gets\n\nRealty Income\n\nRealty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in freestanding, single-tenant commercial properties. Such an investment might seem counterintuitive given the shift from in-store retailing to e-commerce.\n\nNonetheless, the company continues its recovery from the pandemic that temporarily affected a large percentage of its tenants. Now, it is on track to invest over $5 billion in new property acquisitions in 2021 across its three markets, the U.S., the U.K., and Spain. Although it reports a 99% occupancy rate, its FFO per share for the first nine months of 2021 came in at $2.41, down slightly from the $2.43 per share reported in the first three quarters of 2019.\n\nHowever, retirees who buy this stock will earn a payout of just over $2.95 per share annually, paid out monthly. This provides a cash yield of around 4.2% as of the time of this writing. Also, it has increased every year since 1996, making the company a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMoreover, it earned $1 billion in adjusted funds from operations during the first nine months of 2021. It paid $798 million in distributions to shareholders during this period, making its dividend affordable for the company, which must distribute at least 90% of its net income to maintain REIT status.\n\nRealty Income stock remains in recovery mode, selling for about 5% less than its January 2020 price. Still, at a price-to-funds from operations ratio of approximately 20, it may seem more reasonably priced. Also, with its high level of rising monthly income, Realty Income should face little trouble in providing adequate and rising levels of payouts to retirees.\n\nVerizon\n\nVerizon stands in a strong position in the U.S. 5G market. Since AT&T and T-Mobile are its only direct 5G competitors, it benefits from an oligopoly in this crucial service. Also, with a decades-long track record of winning quality awards from J.D. Power, it appears to have an advantage over its peers.\n\nAnd 5G offers Verizon a way to profit from a new line of business, network-as-a-service (NaaS). This subscription data service allows it to connect devices using artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things in ways not possible in the 4G world. The company has also led the way in promoting it, with Honda's autonomous vehicles and Arizona State University's immersive learning among the technologies powered by NaaS.\n\nRetirees will like that Verizon has hiked its payout every year since 2007. At $2.56 per share annually, new investors earn a return of about 4.9%, making it arguably one of the best dividend stocks for retirement. Also, the company generated over $17 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of 2021. This made it possible to cover the dividend's $8 billion cost over that period. The payout also does not affect nearly $14 billion in capital expenditures crucial for network maintenance and upgrades.\n\nInvestors could find this year's 2% payout hike underwhelming and might balk at buying a stock that has fallen 14% over the last year. However, the company's P/E ratio of less than 10 makes this stock cheap. As more investors come to appreciate the NaaS business, it could take Verizon stock and its dividend payouts much higher over time.\n\nOffer from the Motley Fool\n\n10 stocks we like better than Magellan Midstream Partners: When our award-winning analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now its parent company is taking a step that could move it closer to that elusive goal: building its first supercomputer.\n\nMeta on Monday announced its new AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), a supercomputer meant to be used for AI research projects. The supercomputer, which has been in the works for two years, may eventually help Meta develop far more powerful AI software — potentially useful for tricky tasks such as spotting hate speech in posts.\n\n“With RSC, we can more quickly train [AI]models that use multi-modal signals — for example, to understand the context of a post, including language, images, and tone,” Shubho Sengupta, a software engineer at Meta, told CNN Business.\n\nMeta is building a massive supercomputer called \"AI Research SuperCluster\" to train artificial intelligence models. The company said it is one of the fastest AI supercomputers out there, and it thinks it will be the fastest in the world once it's fully built later this year. Meta\n\nSupercomputers, which feature many interconnected processors clumped into what are known as nodes, have become increasingly popular and powerful in recent years for AI research. The US Department of Energy’s Summit, which is the fastest supercomputer in the United States and the second fastest in the world, has been used to aid investigations into things like unfamiliar proteins. A few large tech companies, such as Microsoft and Nvidia, also have supercomputers for their own use.\n\nIn a blog post Monday, coauthored by Sengupta, Meta said that, as of January, its supercomputer includes 6,080 GPUs divided among 760 nodes, potentially making it one of the most powerful in the world.At its current size, Sengupta said, it’s on par with the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, which ranks fifth in the world. When completed later this year, however, Meta said it will have 16,000 GPUs, and the company expects it will be capable of nearly five exaflops of computing performance — that’s 5 quintillion operations per second.\n\n“When fully built out, the cluster will almost triple in size, which will, to our knowledge, make it the fastest AI supercomputer in the world,” Sengupta said.\n\nMeta said its researchers have begun using the supercomputer to train large models related to natural-language processing and computer vision, and that researchers will be able to use the supercomputer to “seamlessly analyze text, images, and video together” and come up with new augmented reality tools. Over time, Meta hopes it will enable the company to “build entirely new AI systems” that can do computationally difficult tasks such as real-time translations for a large group of people who all speak different languages.\n\nThe company said early tests showed the supercomputer could train large language models three times faster than the system it currently uses. That meansan AI model that would take nine weeks to train with the existing system could be trained in three weeks with the supercomputer.\n\nMeta hopes its new supercomputer will eventually be able to train AI models with trillions of parameters — there are just a few known existing AI models at that scale. It would also be many times larger than GPT-3, which is a large language model from OpenAI that can generate human-sounding text and is being used for applications like language-learning and tax software for freelancers.\n\nEventually, Meta said, the supercomputer will lead to technologies neededto build a so-called “metaverse” — a wide-ranging, interconnected virtual realm that people can walk around within, via digital avatars, and interact with others who are also there virtually.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/17/alphabet-could-be-next-in-the-3-trillion-club/74405585007/", "title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia ...", "text": "Keith Speights\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\n\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\n\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\n\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\n\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\n\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\n\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\n\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\n\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\n\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\n\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\n\nShould you buy these future members of the $3 trillion club?\n\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\n\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Only Thiel stumped for the real-estate mogul, and after the tech industry had turned on him for that and his role in Gawker's failure, he was luxuriating in the I-told-you-so moment.\n\nlast week.Vice President-elect Mike Pence sat to Trump's right. (Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose company was often at odds with Trump, wanly looked on.)\n\nIn their orbit, on the periphery, a group of glum-faced tech titans: Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt — all of whom supported Hillary Clinton.\n\nSo were the Trump kids — Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. — who were sandwiched between Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner was seated nearby.\n\nThiel, the Facebook board member once treated as a pariah, was now Trump's gatekeeper to Silicon Valley.\n\nMORE:\n\nTech tries to get Trump's ear after shunning him during campaign\n\nTrump tells tech leaders 'There’s nobody like you in the world'\n\nTim Cook tells Apple staff why he attended Trump tech summit\n\nThe display of power portends a roiling year or two in tech. Trump railed against Amazon and Apple in tweets about corporate taxes and cyber security; now, he's likely to shape those issues as well as immigration reform, job creation, trade with China, deregulation and more, as he vowed during a bruising campaign.\n\n\"Tech is unusual in that the industry does not depend on government regulation or transfer payments, the way that banking, pharma, defense, agriculture and energy do,\" says Roger McNamee, founding partner of venture-capital firm Elevation Partners. \"All tech needs is policy stability and access to global markets. Trump prides himself on being unpredictable.\"\n\nThe stunning development offered a fitting cap to what was a topsy-turvy year for tech, which generated $3.5 trillion in domestic economic output and accounted for more than 15 million people, or 8.4% of total U.S. employment, according to the Computer Technology Association.\n\nIn the year that was, there were winners and losers among companies and technologies; new faces emerged while others faded; and driverless cars and drones became more visible in our streets and sky.\n\nApple's revenue and iPhone sales subsided while Snapchat threatened established Internet leaders on its way to what is likely to be a blockbuster IPO. Yahoo seemed to nail down a protracted sale of itself, while Twitter's struggles made it a persistent source of takeover speculation. In the background, tech's legacy companies entered into a series of cloud and data deals aimed at growth and relevancy.\n\nUber expanded its growing empire into self-driving cars — not without a trademark dust-up with government authorities — and Amazon soared with drones and our spending habits.\n\nBut there were growing problems for Facebook, grappling with a fake news fiasco that turned away some users, and at some of the many units at sprawling Google-owner Alphabet, from Nest to Fiber.\n\nHigh-profile meltdowns\n\nPerhaps no subject loomed over tech — and perhaps the world — than cyber security.\n\nWhether computer breaches that compromised the personal information of millions of consumers to a targeted hack by Russian operatives that conceivably tilted the U.S. presidential election, the very nature of conflict transformed this year to digital from military, says McNamee.\n\nAnd with the advent of the Internet of Things, the battlefield could extend to our homes, warn security experts. In October, malicious software that lets hackers take over home devices like DVRs helped cause a massive Internet outage along the East Coast.\n\n\"One of the biggest trends is the world waking up and realizing that connected IoT devices need security,\" says Talal Shamoon, CEO of computer security company Intertrust.\n\nSamsung's stumble with the self-igniting Galaxy Note 7 was an epic meltdown of quality control, distribution and marketing. Though it didn't dislodge the South Korean electronics giant as the pre-eminent smartphone seller globally, it undercut customer trust and raised questions on how the company will bounce back. (Rumor alert: bendable and two-screen Samsung phones may be on the way, according to a Bloomberg report.)\n\nMORE:\n\nInternet of Things comes back to bite us as hackers spread botnet code\n\nObama orders review of foreign attempts to hack U.S. election\n\nSamsung faces quandary after recalls: apologize or ignore at CES?\n\nAmid grousing from Verizon General Counsel Craig Silliman, who said breaches could \"impact\" the value of Yahoo, Yahoo’s reputation is likely to take a big hit, says Dr. Nir Kossovsky, CEO of Steel City Re, which insures companies against the financial impact of breaches and other damaging disclosures.\n\nOur friends, the bots\n\nThe hit TV show Westworld, about a futuristic park run by robotic \"hosts,\" foresaw a society increasingly intertwined, and dependent, on artificial intelligence, bots and automation. Sound familiar?\n\nArtificial intelligence is officially a craze — Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft are among those with aggressive plans. Virtual reality became more of a reality.\n\nDrones are popping up in all shapes and sizes — 7-Eleven has been regularly delivering goods to consumers in Reno. Amazon, meanwhile, made its first drone delivery in the United Kingdom this month and Google X delivered burritos at Virginia Tech in September; and Domino's delivered its first pizza in New Zealand in August.\n\nSelf-driving cars took to the streets in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and California. Fully autonomous cars won’t be available for a few years, but a Morgan Stanley study estimates they will lead to productivity gains of $507 billion annually as consumers spend less time commuting and more time in meetings, writing reports and other business tasks.\n\nBots were ubiquitous, especially in the spread of fake news.\n\n\"Autonomous technology and AI became mainstream in 2016 with self-driving Teslas and new virtual assistants like the Amazon Echo,\" says Matthew Howard, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners. \"While we now have a clearer picture of where this technology is headed, we’re still only in the first inning (for the second coming of) AI.\"\n\nThere was nothing fake, however, over fears on what AI and increased automation will do to the workforce. This is sure to draw the attention of Trump, who lambasted Apple for exporting jobs overseas and discussed jobs creation in the two-hour tech summit this month.\n\nAutomation will have a profound impact on jobs across all Fortune 500 companies — not just Silicon Valley, says Box CEO Aaron Levie. \"Tech is at the bleeding edge of the sphere on so many issues,\" he says. \"It will be extremely interesting to see\" how Trump's roundtable shakes out.\n\nZuckerberg can now talk to his AI, but it's still no Jarvis\n\nThe Trump effect\n\nSpeaking of the 45th president, his focus on immigration reform will undoubtedly pinch H-1B visas and heighten the urgency for increased STEM education, which was discussed at December's summit. What is unclear is how it might play into tech's stuttering attempts to become less homogenous by hiring more of the women and minorities who buy its products but have little role in their design. reconfigure diversity in workforce, a continued sore subject.\n\nThere are 500,000 computing jobs open in the U.S., with an expected 20% growth rate over the next decade — yet only 55,000 bachelor degrees in computer science were doled out in 2014, according to Code.org and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"It's more important than ever,\" says Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy, an online learning marketplace with more than 14 million students in 190 countries. \"Independent of what the administration does, let's be real: Jobs increasingly will be adversely affected by automation. Tech will create jobs, but they will be super high-end, most likely for the building and programming of robots.\"\n\nTech's impasse with the Trump administration over job creation seems inevitable, but there may be hope. In his meeting with the reluctant CEOs, Trump vowed to keep the channels of communication open and meet quarterly.\n\n\"There (was) a very strong, diverse representation of tech voices,\" says Box's Levie, who last week was named to the executive council of TechNet, a bipartisan political network of tech executives Participants, he said, were established companies with large market valuations that are likely to have a major say in how such key issues as jobs creation, immigration reform and STEM are shaped in the new economy over the next few decades.\n\n2017 and beyond will tell.\n\nMORE:\n\nTech's gilded glory didn't mean much to Trump's supporters\n\nPinterest: Diversity is more important than ever\n\nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/23"}]}

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

Phil Scott this week to write letters to bar owners in the state to remind them of COVID-19 compliance rules.\n\nThis comes after four Burlington bars received written warnings accusing them of breaking rules put in place through an executive order signed by Scott. These rules were set to ensure health and safety within bars during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nScott's letter also informs bar owners that the Department of Liquor and Lottery would be conducting compliance checks to ensure they are following the rules, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\nWeinberger has expressed concern about these violations, saying that COVID-19 transmission can easily occur in bars. He said the guidelines are restrictive, but they must be followed to ensure patrons' safety.\n\n\"I want to be clear: these are important businesses for Burlington,\" Weinberger said. \"They've been an important part of Burlington's economic successes, they're a part of the vibrancy of Burlington.

Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday.

All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday.

That left some fan favorites in the garbage heap of history.\n\nMcDonald’s gave us a gut punch when it announced the end of the McRib, the Choco Taco is being sent to the confectionery cemetery and sandwiches we didn’t know existed were already being disposed of (no offense, Ch’King, but it seems like it was you, and not us.)\n\nRestaurants and food manufacturers are constantly evaluating what’s selling and what’s not, so it’s not a surprise that these items are going away. But it doesn’t make their losses any easier for fans.\n\nHere’s what culinary creations left us in 2022.\n\nBurger King’s Ch’King\n\nThe Ch'King wasn't long for the world. Aleksandra Michalska/Reuters\n\nBurger King’s take on a fried chicken sandwich, dubbed the Ch’King, barely lasted a year. Launched in May 2021, the chain’s hand-breaded crispy chicken sandwich was quietly eliminated from nationwide menus just 15 months later. The reason: It was too hard to assemble for employees, a huge problem in a business where speed is key.\n\nThe Ch’King “was a great product that was difficult or challenging for teams to execute on,” Tom Curtis, President of Burger King North America, told CNN in September. The chain replaced it with a Royal Crispy Chicken sandwich, which offers “great flavor and consistency,” he said.\n\nChili’s Original Chicken Tenders\n\nChili's replaced its Original Chicken Crispers with something crispier, as pictured here. From Chili's\n\nFans were outraged online after Chili’s eliminated the original recipe of its chicken crispers from menus in the fall. The unique, tempura-battered tenders had been a staple on the chain’s menu since the 1980s.\n\nBut don’t fret: Chili’s still offers Crispy Chicken Crispers that are similar to the original, but offer a crunchier and juicier bite. Chili’s explained in a statement to CNN that the “menu change is part of our simplification and growth initiatives to reduce complexity” for its employees.\n\nChoco Taco\n\nRIP Choco Taco. Klondike\n\nThe beloved ice cream in a taco-shaped cone was discontinued in July after nearly four decades on sale.\n\nKlondike explained that the company has “experienced an unprecedented spike in demand across our portfolio” and that it had to make “very tough decisions to ensure availability of our full portfolio nationwide.”\n\nHowever, not all hope is lost for its return. “We’ve heard our fans, and we’re hoping to bring this favorite treat back to ice cream trucks in the coming years,” Klondike said a few weeks after the stunning announcement.\n\nHonest Tea\n\nRIP Honest Tea. Adobe Stock\n\nAfter about 25 years on shelves, Honest Tea’s parent company Coca-Cola announced it was eliminating the iced tea from its product lineup.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) took a 40% stake in Honest in 2008, and Coke acquired the brand outright in 2011. The company also sells Gold Peak and Peace Tea, and intends to focus on these brands as it says goodbye to Honest.\n\nThe move “will free up investment resources and supply chain capacity to better meet consumer needs,” a company executive said in a May statement.\n\nWeeks after Coke’s announcement, the founders of Honest Tea launched another bottled iced tea drink called Eat the Change.\n\nMcDonald’s McRib\n\nRIP McRib. David Paul Morris/Getty Images\n\nHope you enjoyed the McRib while it lasted. McDonald’s teased in a statement upon its October re-arrival that “this could be your last chance to taste it” because the chain confirmed that it won’t be sold nationally for a while following this promotion.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) first added the McRib to menus around Kansas City in 1981, and the chain pulled it from its menu four years later. But it has become a cult favorite among McDonald’s (MCD) loyalists in recent years. It was previously sold regionally before expanding to all of its US restaurants in 2020.\n\nWendy’s Vanilla Frosty\n\nWendy's vanilla Frosty will come back eventually.\n\nLet’s be clear: the Vanilla Frosty isn’t gone for good. But it did disappear this year so Wendy’s could change up the flavors of the beloved frozen treat.\n\nIt’s currently selling a peppermint Frosty in its place, which replaced the strawberry flavor that it sold over the summer. Wendy’s didn’t have an exact date when vanilla would return, but it did tease that more Frosty flavors might be added to its menu in 2023.\n\n–CNN’s Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2024/08/15/mcdonalds-collector-cups-adult-happy-meals-online/74818491007/", "title": "Collector cups from McDonald's adult Happy Meals are re-selling ...", "text": "It’s been less than a week since McDonald’s began selling adult Happy Meals with collectible cups, and already the drinking vessels have become a hot commodity on third-party e-commerce platforms.\n\nOnline listings for the collectible cups, which officially dropped Tuesday as part of McDonald's new Collector's Meal, have already appeared on websites like eBay and Mercari.

The conglomerate behind Skippy and Jennie-O turkey says it can’t make Spam fast enough and is increasing production capacity.\n\nSpam is a trending ingredient on TikTok and on the menu at fine-dining restaurants in coastal cities. In 2019, a limited-edition Spam pumpkin spice flavor sold out in minutes. (You can still buy it on Ebay, where it goes for up to $100 per can.)\n\nWhat is behind this phenomenon? Why does this slab of cooked pork that has long been stigmatized as fake meat, linked to wartime rations and hilariously spoofed on Monty Python now have cachet with foodies?\n\nSpam’s popularity in Hawaiian, Asian and Pacific Island cuisine has influenced its growth in the United States. As more immigrants came to the United States and fusion dishes and ethnic cuisines entered the cultural mainstream, Spam has reached new, younger foodies, say Hormel, food analysts and researchers.\n\nEdgy and clever advertising campaigns also have helped Spam attract a broader customer range than the Baby Boomers who grew up eating it, sometimes reluctantly.\n\n“Spam has undergone a reputation makeover,” said Robert Ku, an associate professor of Asian and Asian American studies at Binghamton University and the author of “Dubious Gastronomy: Eating Asian in the USA.” “A lot of celebrity chefs have been Asian and Asian American, and reintroduced Spam to a new audience.”\n\n‘Miracle meat’\n\nMore than 100,000 visitors stream into the Spam museum every year in Austin, Minnesota, with stories to tell about Spam and recipes to share, said Savile Lord, the manager of the museum in the brand’s hometown. Visitors most often ask her and other museum “Spambassadors” how Spam got its name and what the heck is in it.\n\nA family peruses the history of Spam at the Spam museum. Josh Noel/Minneapolis Star Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images\n\nSpam first hit shelves in 1937 as a 12-ounce, 25-cent, convenient and long-lasting protein in a tin can during the lean years of the Great Depression. Spam contained nothing but pork shoulder, chopped ham, water, sugar and sodium.\n\nIt was a concoction of George Hormel and his son, Jay, meatpackers in Austin. The Hormels had been working on the “problem of canning a nonperishable pork product for a good many years and at last we solved it,” Jay told The New Yorker in 1945.\n\nThey offered a $100 prize for the best name for the food. It needed to be short for display purposes and to fit on one-column newspaper advertisements. It also had to pronounceable in any language.\n\nThe brother of a corporate executive threw out “Spam,” a combination of “spice” and “ham,” at a party, and Hormel “knew then and there that the name was perfect.”\n\nFrom the beginning, Spam was marketed as a time-saver and a food for any meal: Spam and eggs. Spam and pancakes. Spam and beans, spaghetti, macaroni and crackers. Spamwiches.\n\nA pie made with Spam-brand canned meat, potatoes, scallions, and cream of mushroom soup during the 1950s or 1960s. Tom Kelley/Getty Images\n\n“Never have you imagined a meat could turn into so many interesting uses. Morning, noon or night – cold or hot – Spam hits the spot!” read one early advertisement. Spam was a “miracle meat,” the company told consumers in newspaper spots and radio ads.\n\nAnd then came the United States’ entrance into World War II in 1941, the decisive moment in Spam’s growth.\n\nAt many Pacific outposts, which had little refrigeration or local sources of meat, American and Allied troops relied on the canned meat that could be stored away for months and eaten on the go.\n\nHormel says more than 100 million pounds of Spam were shipped overseas to help feed the troops during the war. Uncle Sam became known as Uncle Spam, much to the dismay of troops forced to eat it every single day.\n\n“During World War II, of course, I ate my share of Spam along with millions of other soldiers,” Dwight D. Eisenhower later wrote to Hormel’s president. “I’ll even confess to a few unkind remarks about it – uttered during the strain of battle.”\n\nFor the citizens of conflict-wracked countries in the Pacific struggling with hunger and famine during the war and rebuilding years, however, Spam was a symbol of access to American goods and services. Sometimes, it was the only protein source available. After US troops left, Spam remained, becoming an ingredient in local dishes.\n\n“Spam became part of Asian culture,” said Ayalla Ruvio, a consumer behavior researcher at Michigan State University who studies identity and consumption habits. “It represented a piece of America. It’s like Coca-Cola or McDonald’s.”\n\nAmerican troops also introduced Spam in Korea during the Korean War in the early 1950s, and Budae Jjigae (Army Stew) became a popular Korean dish. Spam also remains a common ingredient in dishes almost anywhere US soldiers were stationed, such as Guam, the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan.\n\nIn Hawaii, where the US military has long been a major presence, more Spam is consumed per person than any other state. It’s stacked on a block of rice and wrapped in seaweed to make Spam musubi and sold at fast-food chains like McDonald’s in Hawaii. There’s even an annual Waikiki Spam Jam festival.\n\nSpam musubi and tacos\n\nMany US soldiers returning from World War II vowed never to eat Spam again, and the brand became linked to rationing and economic hardship. But Spam has appealed to new consumers in the United States in recent years.\n\nSpam musubi, a common Japanese lunch dish that was created in Hawaii. Glenn Asakawa/The Denver Post/Getty Images\n\n“When I first started getting into the brand, we started to notice this transition to a stronger multicultural set of consumers,” said Brian Lillis, who has been product’s brand manager for six years. “They brought with them the traditions of utilizing the product in their home country or where maybe their ancestors came from.”\n\nHormel has worked with chefs at Korean, Taiwanese and Vietnamese restaurants to get Spam on menus. As more people have been introduced to these dishes, they go home and try to make their own versions, Lillis said.\n\nSpam highlights its versatility in dishes on social media and TV advertisements. There are ads for Spam and eggs, as well as Spam fried rice, Spam musubi, yakitori, and poke.\n\nSpam has made a comeback in the United States because Asian and Asian American chefs such as Chris Oh have tried to reinvent it in their own ways, said Ku, the Binghamton University professor. “They brought some of the culinary influences of Asia and the Pacific and upscaled it.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/14/thc-vaping-crisis-juul-labs-pax-labs-marijuana/3920362002/", "title": "THC vaping crisis: Juul marijuana sibling Pax Labs faces scrutiny", "text": "When Juul Labs and Pax Labs split from one company into two in 2017, they seemed destined to reach new heights.\n\nJuul would conquer the e-cigarette industry. Pax would dominate the marijuana vaping business.\n\nTheir fortunes, however, quickly diverged. Juul found itself under fire for its alleged role in getting kids hooked on nicotine after pitching itself as a safe alternative to cigarettes; Pax largely escaped scrutiny as the burgeoning cannabis market made the company irresistible to investors.\n\nBut that honeymoon period might be ending for Pax.\n\nLess than six months after backers plunged $420 million into Pax, the San Francisco-based company that makes vaporizers and empty pods is staring down a national health crisis that threatens to engulf both companies.\n\nSocial Security raise:Social Security cost-of-living increase will raise benefits 1.6%\n\nIs your clunker ready to be junked? When's the right time to replace your old car?\n\nFederal authorities are tracking an outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses, about 75% of which have been tied to products containing THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Authorities say half of the THC products tested so far also included vitamin E acetate.\n\nThere’s no proof any of Pax’s products have caused injuries. Its vaping devices are shipped to preapproved suppliers who fill the pods with cannabis leaves or oils, including THC products, to be vaped.\n\n“No PAX products have been involved in any of these cases,” the company said in a statement on Sept. 11. “While the cause is yet to be determined, none of the brand partners who fill and distribute our pods use Vitamin E acetate in PAX formulations, and all pods are subject to rigorous state regulatory compliance and testing. We select our partners with careful diligence.”\n\nBut on Oct. 4, the Food and Drug Administration advised Americans to immediately cease vaping THC products of any kind, including items bought from seemingly trustworthy companies.\n\nThe agency also advised people not to “modify or add any substances such as THC or other oils to products purchased in stores.”\n\nThose recommendations thrust the company's business model into crisis mode, said Marianne Udow-Phillips, executive director of the University of Michigan's Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation, which uses data analysis to advise policymakers and practitioners on health issues.\n\n\"There is great risk for Pax right now,\" she said. \"The problem is that we don’t really know yet – the science isn’t there – what is causing all these illnesses.\"\n\nPax has a lot at stake. The privately held company’s annual revenue is about $262 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Pax said last month it had sold more than half a million devices used to vape “oil concentrates,” which include products containing THC. In April, the company was valued at $1.7 billion, according to investment tracker Crunchbase.\n\nFacing questions over the exact nature of the illnesses, Pax announced the formation of a “health advisory board” in late September.\n\n“Amid growing concern about the risks – and prevalence – of illicit cannabis, our top priority at PAX remains consumer safety,” the company's newly appointed CEO, Lisa Sergi, said in a statement Sept. 25, days after the sudden departure of CEO Bharat Vasan.\n\nPax says only preapproved \"brand partners\" are authorized to provide vaping liquids or flower for its devices. But social media reports and videos unearthed by USA TODAY show some users are hacking Pax products to use their own homemade THC oils.\n\nIn one YouTube video with more than 56,000 views, a user named “Vape HowTos” demonstrates a technique on how to use oils that were not intended for the Pax Era.\n\n“You can save money by refilling your Pax Era Pods instead of buying new ones,” Vape HowTos says in a description accompanying the video.\n\nRobert Jackler – a vaping watchdog and Stanford University professor and otologist-neurotologist who specializes in complex ear diseases – questioned how Pax could reach the conclusion that its products have not been tied to any illnesses.\n\n“We don’t know whether Pax pods are injuring people,” he said.\n\nDianne Gleason, head of communications for Pax, declined both an interview request from USA TODAY and an offer to respond to written questions.\n\nInstead, in response to a separate question on the nature of the Juul spinoff, she provided a statement on \"significant misreporting\" about the move. She said the former Pax Labs Inc. changed its name to Juul Labs Inc. on June 30, 2017, and concurrently spun off its marijuana business as a separate company that assumed the name of its predecessor, becoming the new Pax Labs.\n\n\"Since it spun off PAX in 2017, JUUL has not held any ownership interest in PAX, and the companies have operated as completely separate entities,\" Gleason said.\n\nWhen the spinoff occurred, there were no indications of an outbreak ahead. But in recent months, lung injuries tied to vaping have killed at least 26 people and sickened 1,299 as of Oct. 8, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe agency said on Oct. 4. that the majority of patients who got sick from THC vaping did so after using “prefilled cartridges obtained from informal sources.”\n\nThe CDC also specified its data is unclear on whether the cause is “THC itself or a substance associated with prefilled THC cartridges, such as a cutting agent or adulterant.”\n\nPax has largely escaped scrutiny as watchdogs and federal investigators primarily trained their sights on Juul and other nicotine-focused vaping companies. (Juul is now facing a criminal investigation and a potential federal ban on nicotine vaping flavors.)\n\n“These tragic illnesses are focusing legislative attention on nicotine e-cigs,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said on Twitter last month. “At what point do they also instigate efforts to reign in dangerous THC and a proliferation of unregulated cannabis vape products, especially national brands of CBD vape hardware?\"\n\nOn Friday, Gottlieb singled out Pax for its role in “instigating” the vaping of TCH.\n\n“The device isn’t what’s killing people, it’s what’s in the liquids. Why the devices are significant is that their promotion is popularizing the activity of vaping THC,” he said in a text message to USA TODAY. “Pax spends a half a billion marketing devices for vaping THC (and) guess what happens? More people vape THC.”\n\nPax did not respond to a request to comment on Gottlieb's statement.\n\nWhat are pods filled with?\n\nOn May 2, 2018, then-Pax CEO Bharat Vasan took the stage at a Milken Institute conference in Beverly Hills, California, to discuss the company’s booming opportunity in marijuana vaping.\n\nVasan was careful to note the company was only making the technology that enables consumers to vape pods filled with cannabis leaves or oils.\n\nThat’s because marijuana continues to exist in a murky legal state: legal in some form in 39 states as of September 2019, according to workplace compliance firm Disa Global Solutions, but illegal federally. The arrangement allows the company “to deliver a good experience without the complexity of trying to figure out exactly what the pods are filled with,” Vasan said.\n\nWhile Pax only authorizes certain providers to supply cannabis products for its pods, consumers have figured out ways to hack the pods to insert their own blends. In one YouTube video, a user named Stoner Stuff shows how to use a syringe to refill Era pods with THC oil from other sources.\n\n“I’ve tried it – it hits well, it works great,” Stoner Stuff says in the video posted March 22.\n\nPax pod-hacking is especially concerning to health experts because the ramifications of vaping marijuana are still poorly understood.\n\n“We just don’t know the long-term effects,” said Jackler, the Stanford professor.\n\nHe rejected the suggestion that Pax should escape blame for people misusing its product because the company \"had no idea\" this could happen.\n\nVasan declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a blog post on his exit.\n\n“Leading PAX and driving its mission to establish cannabis as a force for good, has been the privilege of a lifetime,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat are long-term effects?\n\nIt’s not fair for anyone to suggest Pax could be responsible for lung illnesses, said Pax and Juul shareholder Kurt Sonderegger.\n\n“It’s pretty clear this is from black-market THC cartridges,” said Sonderegger, who once served as vice president of marketing for Pax Labs. “I don’t think there’s any real problems” with Pax products.\n\nThe CDC said Oct. 10 that \"no single product or substance has been linked to all lung injury cases\" but warned users to steer clear of THC products altogether \"to avoid potentially harmful effects.\"\n\nErika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy at the American Lung Association, said one concern with vaping “is that it may be an accumulated impact” from long-term use. \"The dangers of inhaling chemicals in your lungs” should not be underestimated, she added.\n\nIn its statement introducing the health advisory board, Pax pledged to explore “vaporization safety, mental health and medical applications,\" and noted that it “PAX Labs does not manufacture, produce or sell cannabis.”\n\nBut Scott Schlesinger, a lawyer who has sued Juul and Pax on behalf of teenage clients, said the issue with Pax is “they look the other way and (say), ‘Here, you fill it’” to avoid legal scrutiny.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Jayne O'Donnell contributed to this report.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2023/12/16/quaker-oats-granola-product-recall-salmonella/71943056007/", "title": "Quaker Oats issues nationwide granola product recall for salmonella", "text": "Quaker Oats is recalling dozens of its granola bars and granola cereals because they may be contaminated with salmonella.\n\nThe company, which is part of PepsiCo, announced the recall Friday of some of its granola bars and granola cereals, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/05/charged-lemonade-panera-bread-second-death-lawsuit/71811055007/", "title": "Panera's Charged Lemonade linked to man's death, lawsuit states", "text": "Fast-causal chain Panera Bread has once again found itself the target of a lawsuit based around its highly caffeinated Charged Lemonade drinks.\n\nFor the second time this year, legal action has been filed against the restaurant alleging that the lemonade drinks caused the death of a customer who consumed them. The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleged that 46-year-old Dennis Brown of Fleming Island, Florida, suffered a cardiac arrest on the way home from his local Panera, where he drank three Charged Lemonades.\n\nAccording to the suit, Brown generally avoided drinking significant amounts of caffeine and did not consume energy drinks as a rule, thanks to his diagnosis of high blood pressure. Brown, who was known to frequently stop by the Panera Bread after his shifts at a supermarket, was also diagnosed with an unspecified chromosomal disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, said the lawsuit.\n\nAnother death linked to Panera's Charged Lemonade\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC, which also represents the family in the case of Sarah Katz who likewise allegedly died after consuming a Charged Lemonade drink. In it, Brown's family claims he did not know the drinks contained caffeine and had been consuming them consistently in the six days leading up to his death.\n\nThe drinks are also included in Panera's line-up of eligible items for their \" Unlimited Sip Club,\" which Brown was a part of. It's a membership that allows patrons who pay a subscription fee to refill drinks at no cost.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Panera Bread denied any wrongdoing, saying; \"Panera expresses our deep sympathy for Mr. Brown's family,\" but that, based on its investigation, the company believes \"his unfortunate passing was not caused by one of the company's products.\"\n\n\"We view this lawsuit, which was filed by the same law firm as a previous claim, to be equally without merit. Panera stands firmly by the safety of our products,\" it continued.\n\nPrior lawsuit filed over Panera Charged Lemonade\n\nFamily files lawsuit:Panera Bread's ‘Charged Lemonade’ being blamed for student's death\n\nThis is the second lawsuit accusing Panera of improperly labeling or informing customers of the contents of the Charged Lemonade drinks. A few months ago, the chain was hit with a similar filing after the family of Sarah Katz, a 21-year-old University of Pennsylvania student, claimed the college student's death in 2022 due to cardiac arrest was caused by the highly caffeinated drink and improper labeling.\n\nKatz had a heart condition called long QT syndrome type 1, which caused an irregular heart rhythm, so she avoided energy drinks. According to the lawsuit, a large Charged Lemonade has 390 mg of caffeine in it, far more than what can be found in drinks like Monster or Red Bull. Instead, it was advertised as a \"clean\" drink with the same amount of caffeine as a dark roast coffee.\n\nKatz drank the charged beverage \"reasonably confident it was a traditional lemonade and/or electrolyte sports drink containing a reasonable amount of caffeine safe for her to drink,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nPanera Bread changed the labeling on Charged Lemonade\n\nPanera later changed labels on the product after the first suit was filed, saying in a statement to NBC News they had \"enhanced our existing caffeine disclosure for these beverages\" out of \"an abundance of caution,\" adding that the company was \"saddened to learn this week about the tragic passing of Sarah Katz.\"\n\nThe chain's website advertises the \"charged sips\" under a menu section with a description reading, \"Naturally flavored, plant-based, and Clean with about as much caffeine as our Dark Roast coffee.\"\n\nClicking one of the three available flavors leads to a page with an image of the lemonade overlayed with a large \"contains caffeine\" sign at the bottom. The \"about\" section again says the drinks are, \"Naturally flavored, plant-based, with about as much CAFFEINE as our Dark Roast Coffee.\"\n\nFollowing this is an additional warning that reads: \"Use in moderation. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women.\"\n\nWhile ad material for the lemonades still compares the caffeine content to that of the brand's coffee, the nutrition information lists the \"regular\" lemonade size as having 260 milligrams of caffeine and the \"large\" as having 390 mg. The Katz lawsuit compared this to the listed 214 mg in the regular-sized dark roast coffee and 268mg in the large, noting the difference.\n\nReporting contributed by Sarah Al-Arshani, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2023/06/08/these-restaurants-and-sweet-shops-deliver-icy-treats-to-beat-the-summer-heat/70298522007/", "title": "Best ice cream, gelato, shaved ice shops in Palm Beach County", "text": "Summer is here again and it's going to be 90 degrees or more for the next three months.

Before that he worked in his family's ice cream business there. Back in the day, as father and son would fetch milk to make their ice cream, Hoyuela would tell his father that milk from one cow in particular produced the best ice cream. That cow's name was Rosa.\n\nHoyuela said Rosa Ice Cream makes all of its ice cream in house, using only natural ingredients and no salt or eggs. The shop offers more than 30 flavors at a time.\n\nRosa carries the basic must-haves, such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and pistachio, but staff also ventures outside the box with varieties including apple crisp, horchata, red wine and avocado.\n\nTwo of their most popular ice creams are carrot cake and peanut butter. They also make a special ice cream for Guanabanas called \"VT.\" It has cookie dough, brownie, chocolate and caramel and is very popular.

Thousands of people have attended via livestream the speaker series with world-class experts on different aspects of improving the quality of life in a community. More and more we hear community members using the terminology and ideas of these experts at public meetings.”\n\nCivicCon stands for Civic Conversation, and over the past five years CivicCon has hosted 60 nationally renowned speakers who have shared best practices on everything from urban planning, to affordable housing, to opioid addiction.\n\nAnd over the years, citizens have taken many of those ideas and run with them, championing things like urban bike lanes, community gathering spaces and attainable infill housing.\n\nFrom an Escambia County resident who organized a digital \"citizens watch,\" to a stalwart environmental advocate who been monitoring our local waters ways for decades, to a pastor who traveled to Egypt to educate the world on the environmental and racial injustices plaguing a Pensacola neighborhood, the CivicCon Awards will honor 19 individuals and organizations who embodied CivicCon ideals in 2022 and beyond.\n\nThe awards event and holiday party is 6 p.m. Dec. 5, at The Rex Theatre.

Palafox Street in downtown Pensacola in 2014, according to information from Pensacola's Downtown Improvement Board. The building, which opened in 1910 as a furniture store and transitioned to a theater in the 1930s, was shuttered in 1977 and stood largely vacant until Generation Church acquired it in 2012.\n\nToday it's a vibrant 400-seat theatre that serves as a home to Generation Church and a venue for community theatre, seminars and as of this years features a full coffee shop in the lobby.\n\nPensacola Off-Road Cyclists\n\nThis nonprofit organization — which is also lovingly referred to as P.O.R.C. — has a 20-plus year history of building and maintaining trails for our community.

He recently returned from trip to a United Nations conference in Egypt where he help he shared Rolling Hills' plight on the national stage.\n\nChris Wilde\n\nWilde was the engine behind revitalizing the Dunmire Woods Neighborhood Association, which had discontinued meetings even before the pandemic. During the past year, “she approached neighbors one at a time either by phone, door-to-door or email to evangelize what the association could be, how it might deepen bonds among neighbors, improve parks and shared spaces and contribute to overall safety,” her nomination said.\n\nShe ultimately launched the association with overwhelming support from her neighbors, getting paid membership from 95 of 103 homes.\n\nThe Safe Streets and People-Centered Transportation Award\n\nCycleSports Bicycles\n\nCyclesports Bicycles, co-owned by Brian Stone and Tom Pilcher, is \"the oldest bike shop in town and it's virtually a ministry for homeless and low-income people who come in and out all day long to get minor repairs done on their bikes for free or at very low cost,” it's nominator wrote.\n\nThe shop is located in an area adjacent to a day labor office, homeless shelter and various government and medical services.\n\n“Brian and Tom and their staff always provide a friendly face to people whose lives are often very difficult, helping them all with dignity and respect and helping them keep their bicycles going so that they can get work, shopping and all of their daily needs,” their nomination said.\n\nThe Ride Squad\n\nThe Ride Squad was created to help manage the Bike Pensacola Slow Rides so that the rides are safe and efficient. The squad has a few dozen members and for each ride about 10–15 members ride along wearing yellow safety vests to help hold intersections open to allow riders to proceed through without stopping. If a rider has a mechanical or medical issue, at least one Ride Squad member pulls over with them to provide any necessary assistance. That way, no rider is ever left behind.\n\nGovernment Transparency Award\n\nJacqueline Aimee Rogers\n\nRogers manages Escambia Citizens Watch, a Facebook group with more than 10,000 followers. The group started 10 years as a forum for people to learn about and discuss importance issues around governance of Escambia County, the city of Pensacola and the state of Florida.\n\nHer nominator wrote, “She also has taken an active role in trying to hold county government accountable to the public they are supposed to be serving.”\n\nThe Equity Award\n\nTeniade Broughton\n\nBroughton is referred by her nominator as our area’s “biggest equity advocate in public office.” She was elected to the Pensacola City Council two years ago, but Broughton has long been a voice for equity in our community.\n\nShe is one of our area's foremost historians on local African-American heritage and culture. Broughton hosted a Black history tour known as “Highlights in Black,” was heavily involved in efforts to preserve the historic home of one of the city's most influential Black businessmen John Sunday, and was involved in the Equal Justice Initiative's project to collect soil from lynching sites around the country.\n\nThe Kukua Institute\n\nThe Kukua Institute blends the arts and sciences to helps students, entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators get their dreams off the ground.\n\nDeveloped and led by Lloyd and Robin Reshard and Lloyd Reshard Jr., the institute was created as a place to grow and share the cultural, intellectual and economic abilities and contributions of African Americans.

The Mougeys, the American Heart Association and other local leaders teamed up last year to co-found Heart of Pensacola to tackle health and nutrition locally. Together, they provide 500 kids weekly with book bags containing healthy snacks and foods.\n\nThey also provide Baptist Hospital, Health & Hope Clinic, Community Health Northwest Florida and the Studer Community Institute with boxes of fresh produce, fruit, vegetables and whole grains, which are picked up by Manna Food Pantries and distributed to families. Since September 2021, over 800 boxes and 6,000 backpacks have been distributed in the community.\n\nBest New Addition to Downtown Pensacola Award\n\nThe old Coca Cola building renovation\n\nDavid Fetter and Bill Wunnenberg, owners of Industrial Energy Services Inc. and Illumadyne, an LED lighting company, purchased the old Hygeia Bottling Work building and renovated into a state-of-the-art facility that is bringing character and jobs to the community.\n\nBuilt in 1936, the building housed the bottling company until 1967 and had been vacant for several years. The restored building is now office space for their two companies,.\n\nUWF Historic Trust Museum Plaza\n\nThe Museum Plaza is a new multi-use and educational community space in downtown Pensacola that helps tell the story of Pensacola’s rich history.\n\nThe plaza serves as a central connection point between the Pensacola Museum of History at the University of West Florida, Pensacola Children’s Museum, Voices of Pensacola multicultural center and the Historic Pensacola Village, while doubling as an outdoor classroom that helps the public better understand the historic landscape.\n\nOne nominator wrote, the “UWF Historic Trust Museum Plaza is a great example of reclaiming a former parking lot for a wonderful green space available for festivals, concerts or just to hang out.”\n\nThe Strong Towns Award\n\nMount Lily Studios\n\nMount Lily Studios is being built by a partnership of young Pensacola developers consisting of John David Ellis, Jordan Yee, Alistair McKenzie and Jamaal Warren. Their project is to turn the old Mount Lily Baptist Church on North A Street into six affordable studio apartments, and they say their target market is working-class people. The target rent is $750 a month if construction costs allow.\n\nThe Founding Member Award\n\nBrian Wyer\n\nBrian Wyer, president & CEO of the Gulf Coast Minority Chamber of Commerce, was nominated by several people, including a CivicCon Award winner in 2021, Theresa Blackwell, who says “There is no more dependable and congenial presence at CivicCon functions than Brian Wyer. He is also the most seen person at various and sundry government functions. Brian also has volunteered for numerous county selection committees such as the one for the OLF-8 master planner.\"\n\nAnother nominator noted that Wyer is active in over 30 community organizations, where he consistently champions a message of diversity and equity.\n\nThe CivicCon Award\n\nD.C. Reeves\n\nD.C. Reeves recently was elected Pensacola’s mayor, but he also has very deep roots with CivicCon. He was one of the original organizers of CivicCon and coordinated many of the early speaker events. He also was a major participant in working with SCAPE, a New York design company that created the Downtown Pensacola Waterfront Framework Plan.\n\nHe is an entrepreneur and founded Perfect Plain, a downtown brewery that he recently sold after being elected mayor. He has a strong vision of how Pensacola can become a better place to live for its residents — much of it learned from five years of CivicCon speaker events.\n\nThe CivicCon Volunteer Award\n\nJoe Leccese\n\nJoe Leccese was a volunteer at the earliest CivicCon sessions. He was a faithful volunteer from September of 2017 through January of 2020. Of course, the pandemic shut down in-person events for many months and the speakers were pushed to virtual platforms.

It stops next to a building held up by faith and rusty nails.\n\nA brother and sister more than 5,000 miles from home climb out of the car, eager to explore what they had realized while speeding by was one of their target destinations along historic Route 66.\n\nHackberry General Store\n\nHackberry General Store was a must-see destination for Sergio and Andra Goder of Barcelona, in the midst of a four-month American vacation.\n\nSergio says that getting kicks on Route 66 is a rite of passage for Spaniards visiting the American West. Friends expect to see his social-media posts filled with iconic images from the famous highway.\n\nAs he and his sister sped along a lonely stretch of blacktop carved through the high Arizona desert, Sergio blinked, nearly missing one of the highway's most emblematic stops.\n\nBecause at 65 mph, the store and former garage appears to have lost its battle against time.\n\nYet nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n“It came out of nowhere,” Sergio says as he browses the store's large selection of Route 66 license plates, signs and T-shirts. “If we had missed it, that would have been bad.”\n\nHe noticed two things as he sped by: the Hackberry General Store sign, and the fact that its patchwork structure was free of the chain-link fencing that sealed off some abandoned structures he’d seen.\n\nIf not for a reclusive artist, a nostalgic businessman and a retiree who couldn’t let an icon slip away, the Hackberry General Store might have been another victim of Interstate 40, which for years made Route 66 irrelevant.\n\nBecause of them, the store not only survives, it thrives.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary.\n\nAt the crossroads of 'middle' and 'nowhere'\n\nHackberry General Store is the only sign of civilization for miles. Its rusted signs boasting of things that haven’t been there for decades (gas, oil, the Greyhound bus) seem to serve a dual purpose — setting the mood and holding up the building.\n\nThe store hunches quietly behind two vintage gas pumps whose state of disrepair is not obvious enough to keep some visitors from pulling up to them. Before this was a general store, it was a service station and garage.\n\nInside the store, vintage and modern license plates upholster the ceiling, with room remaining for the additions mailed or delivered in person by patrons.\n\nPatches and currency from around the world blanket one wall, workers taking time each month to post the latest additions. Europe is heavily represented. A recent surge in South American tourists has been noticed.\n\nVisions of a vibrant Route 66 burn brightly amid the photos, paintings and other decor on the nostalgia-bearing walls. A re-creation of a 1950s diner with polished chrome furniture, a jukebox and black-and-white-tile flooring reminds travelers of a time when America's lifeblood pulsed along the highway.\n\nVisitors captivated by a bygone era browse shelves filled with tremendously popular souvenirs. Nine out of 10 customers hail from other countries. They snap up items representing this likely once-in-a-lifetime trip.\n\nBut they didn't come just for the T-shirts and magnets and license plates. They want to experience a slice of Americana, where the open road promises a journey between destinations.\n\nTourists wander behind the store to check out the garage, where mechanics once worked feverishly to get broken-down cars and trucks back to hauling people and their dreams to California. Most of the tools and car parts date to the 1940s and '50s, such tempting targets that the property owners reluctantly had to put up a 4-foot-high metal barrier.\n\nSlightly farther out, Ruby and Lisa Marie graze behind a fence until carrot-waving tourists get their attention. The resident mules gently pluck the carrots from skittish fingers as cameras roll, another American moment captured for social-media sharing.\n\nWhen it’s time to go, the tourists return to their rental cars or motorcycles or tour buses. Soon they are following Route 66 wherever it may lead, as millions have done before them.\n\nA dilapidated roadside gem\n\nJohn Pritchard lost count of the number of times he had driven his 1957 red Corvette past the dilapidated outpost while visiting his vacation home in Lake Havasu City. For 15 years the oddity caught his eye, but it seemed just another roadside stop worn down by inattention.\n\nUntil one day in the late 1990s when he noticed someone inside.\n\nThat’s when he met Bob Waldmire, an artist/cartographer/historian who purchased the property years earlier, reopening the business in 1992 offering Route 66 souvenirs as well as tourist information. Given Waldmire's roots — his father ran a hot-dog stand on Route 66 in Illinois — he preserved the store in its ramshackle state.\n\nFor Pritchard and his wife, Kerry, it was love at 30th or 40th sight. After some negotiation, the couple were the proud owners of the only store within 10 miles.\n\nArmed with the perfect motive to retire, Pritchard moved his wife and two sons from Tacoma, Wash., to Arizona. The store provided the two things Pritchard was looking for: a hobby and plenty of space for his expansive collection of Route 66 memorabilia.\n\nIt seemed like destiny for the Class of '66 graduate and longtime fan of the Mother Road.\n\nFueling a passion\n\nWhen Pritchard opened the Hackberry General Store in 1998, it was part souvenir stand, part museum and all passion. He covered the walls with black-and-white photos of stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood, whose prime coincided with that of Route 66.\n\nVintage gas pumps, still in their broken-down state, went up outside, as did metal signs that years ago had lost their battle with the elements, bullets or both. Pritchard installed his ode to a 1950s diner, where visitors could relax and enjoy the snacks and drinks for sale.\n\nLike Waldmire, he left the exterior as is, hardly ready for its close-up unless it was with a wrecking ball.\n\nBut that was the key to the store's charm.\n\nThe rundown look was a beacon to nostalgia-seeking travelers, as was Pritchard's '57 Corvette parked outside. He even put up a “Corvette Parking Only” sign, should any Corvette-less drivers get ideas.\n\nIt wasn't long before Hackberry General Store attracted all sorts of attention.\n\n“We had a Playboy photo shoot,” Pritchard says. “American Airlines did a travel story on us. We were on the Arizona Highways TV show. It got so famous in that first year or two.”\n\nCanine vagabonds also welcome\n\nThe Route 66 flotsam and jetsam that found a home at Hackberry included more than old signs and license plates. A handful of strays landed there as well.\n\nPritchard opened his heart and his home to dogs who came from who knows where looking for who knows what. Each now is buried under a large shade tree just west of the store.\n\nThere’s Abigail and Molly and Daisy and Bully, but it’s Max who will always occupy a special place in Prtichard’s memories. The golden retriever was just a pup when he limped toward the front door on Christmas Eve, setting off a motion detector. Pritchard saw the cuts on the dog’s front leg and knew he needed a vet.\n\nKnowing he’d have to wait until morning, Pritchard slept with the dog on a couch just inside the front door, bringing comfort if he couldn’t bring relief.\n\nFor the next dozen years, Max would climb off that couch to greet visitors until he could climb no more, becoming a part of scrapbooks and Facebook posts all over the world.\n\nThe crowds kept coming\n\nMax was just one of the many reasons people came to Hackberry General Store, Pritchard says.\n\n“On a summer day, we would get two or three tour buses at once,” he says. “People would be elbow-to-elbow, a line going around the store. Some nights after I locked the doors, there’d be a bang at the door and a motorcycle club would be outside asking me if I was closed. I’d stay open another hour or two until they were ready to leave, knowing they’d come too far to be turned away.”\n\nHis hobby had evolved into a demanding business. In 2015, at age 71, Pritchard decided it was time to sell and give up those 50-hour weeks. His two sons had established their own lives far from Hackberry, dashing any hope of keeping the business in the family.\n\nStill, he wasn’t about to sell to just anyone. It had to be someone who shared his drive, his passion. It had to be someone he trusted to keep the lights on and doors open, even for those who showed up after business hours.\n\nHis answer was behind the counter.\n\nWhere Hackberry greets the world\n\nShortly before 2 p.m., six days a week, pickup trucks pop up on the other side of Route 66, rolling across the highway when the coast is clear.\n\nTires kick up dust as they roll across the general store’s parking lot, stopping next to the phalanx of mailboxes along the roadway shoulder.\n\nAn unmarked white SUV appears from the west, passing by a series of international flags fluttering in the wind before it pulls in behind the mailboxes. As a uniformed postal worker feeds the boxes from mail-laden bins, people clamber out of their pickups and exchange pleasantries as they wait.\n\nThus starts the closest thing to a social gathering in Hackberry, a community of 70 people or so scattered across several square miles of high desert.\n\nWhen Amy Franklin started working at Hackberry General Store in 2006, she came to appreciate the mail’s arrival. At times her neighbors would come inside for snacks or drinks, or to pick up packages. (Pritchard had agreed to hold them, saving parcel drivers the lengthy, bone-jarring rides along unpaved roads.)\n\nThe store had evolved into Hackberry’s unofficial community center, where residents could mingle with the world, or simply catch up on what the neighbors were doing.\n\n“It’s one of the things that make the store such a cool place,” Franklin says.\n\nThe decision to sell the store\n\nWhen Pritchard, her boss and close friend, decided it was time to retire, Franklin made an offer neither could refuse. She named a price and Pritchard stuck out his hand.\n\n“I knew the books,” Franklin says. “He knew I knew the books. Deal.”\n\nWhen Franklin entered the store on Jan. 4, 2016, she had the same thought she did when she saw the store for the first time 17 years before.\n\n“Oh my God, this is so cool,” she thought in 1999. Now she added, “And I own it.”\n\nWhen the Chicago resident retired to Hackberry, she had no intention of owning a business. But when boredom drove her to seek a part-time job, the general store fit her requirements of flexible hours and short commute.\n\nThe cool factor, Franklin says, was a bonus.\n\nHer appreciation for the ramshackle station deepened as she greeted customers from all over the world. Franklin saw the wonder in their eyes as they took one photo after another. They told her how they had saved for years to drive Route 66. She remembered the tears in one man’s eyes as he said he could finally cross off the destination that had been at the top of his bucket list for as long as he could remember.\n\nEven so, she wasn’t ready to take the reins when Pritchard told her he was putting the store on the market. But when she saw her boss hesitate to sell until he found just the right buyer, she feared he might walk away, allowing the store to meet a fate so many had before.\n\n“It’s too much of an icon,” she says. “It would be like taking the Golden Gate out of San Francisco.”\n\nPreserving the time-worn charm\n\nPerhaps the wrong scale for the right sentiment, but Franklin knew she was ready to take the keys and the responsibility.\n\nMore importantly, she agreed to retain the charming post-apocalyptic look that visitors expected.\n\n“(Pritchard) told me to make it pretty, but not too pretty,” she says. “Keep it clean, but not too clean.”\n\nFranklin has since replaced the bathroom floors, using remnants from a previous project and thus maintaining the architectural spirit. And two new dogs now greet customers, a couple of Australian shepherd pups still learning to share the couch inside the front door.\n\nOtherwise the Hackberry General Store still looks as if assembled by glue gun, an escapee from 1956 complete with working pay phone and no cell service within 5 miles.\n\nWhere time, at least over a few acres, remains frozen for those who enjoy a rare peek into the rear-view mirror.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhere: 11255 Route 66, Kingman, AZ\n\nWhen: 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily.\n\nDetails: 928-769-2605, hackberrygeneralstore.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/11"}]}

The Adkins Avenue fire was 35% contained and had shrunk from its largest size of 1,400 acres, or just over 2 square miles, to 840 acres.\n\nThe Adkins fire, believed to have been started by a homeowner burning trash that got out of control, destroyed two structures, and damaged another 12 homes late Friday. Officials said Saturday they were not aware of any damage caused by the Bertha fire, but it crept toward Bear Creek Sunday, threatening the community of 2,000 consisting of mostly elders.\n\nIn his second trip to Bay County this weekend, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news conference Sunday afternoon that the Bertha Swamp Road fire is \"a big boy and is raging very quickly.\"\n\n\"Today's the perfect day for these types of fires to move, unfortunately, (because) you have very dry conditions, and you have a lot of wind,\" DeSantis said. \"We have deployed at the state level four firefighting engine strike teams (that) are assembled to support local firefighting resources ... and they can do both structural and wildland protection.\"\n\nLocal officials said Monday that no first responders have been injured while fighting wildfires in Bay County, correcting a weekend statement from DeSantis, who said there had been reports of injuries.\n\n\"Contrary to national media reports, there are no fatalities and no injures (from) the wildfires in Bay County,\" a post on the Bay County, Florida Emergency Services Facebook page states. \"All first responders are safe.\"\n\nIn a separate conference Saturday, DeSantis also said eight homes had been engulfed by the Adkins Avenue Fire, but officials remain adamant that only two are confirmed destroyed so far.\n\nNEWS DEVELOPING INTO TO THE EVENING:For an update later tonight, sign up for the Evening Briefing.\n\nA third fire broke out Sunday afternoon, which has grown from 40 to 163 acres as a result of high winds and dry weather conditions, the Florida Forest Service-Chipola said Sunday via Twitter. Evacuations are underway for the Clifford Chester Sims State Veterans Nursing Home.\n\n'One thing after the other'\n\nBay County was hit hard by Hurricane Michael in 2018, which was directly responsible for 16 deaths and about $25 billion in damage in the U.S., and left behind 72 million tons of destroyed trees that have provided fuel for the Bay County wildfires, according to the Florida Forest Service.\n\n\"After Hurricane Michael, you had a massive amount of this basically dried tinder that was left in its wake, and so these fires were something people have been discussing for many years now,\" DeSantis said Saturday. \"And so this was not a surprise given that was sitting there, and you have very low humidity and the winds, and so it's been kind of a perfect storm.\"\n\nLike other families in the eastern Bay County area, Paul and Laurie Shuman were getting settled into a new residence after losing their home during Hurricane Michael in October 2018.\n\nOn Saturday, they were once again stifled with panic and uncertainty as they watched glimpses of their home go up in flames through ADT security camera system videos.\n\nBy the time the couple arrived as close to their home as they safely could — about a mile out — the home was charred to pieces, with only the garage door, part of the brick frame, and the frame to the pool covering still standing. They lost everything.\n\n\"When you talk about starting over, there's starting over and then there's starting from the beginning. In three years, I've lost two houses,\" Paul Shuman said, adding he also lost his job in that time period after the county closed the incinerator at which he had worked for 25 years. \"It's one thing after the other.\"\n\nLocal authorities said they didn’t know when residents would be able to return to their homes.\n\n“It is NOT safe to return home at this time. Please be patient as first responders battle these dangerous fires,” Bay County officials posted online.\n\nThere are nearly 150 wildfires burning about 19 square miles throughout Florida, the Florida Forest Service said in a Sunday news release.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/21/california-weather-forecast-storm/71997293007/", "title": "A stunning storm: Historic downpours, evacuations reported in ...", "text": "A slow-moving Pacific storm prompted evacuations Thursday in cities and beach towns along California's southern coast as streets were submerged beneath floodwaters.\n\nThe cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme — both in Ventura County, west of Los Angeles — issued evacuation orders for some coastal areas and at least one shelter was opened for residents fleeing their homes. The Oxnard Fire Department has executed water rescues and, along with the police department, has asked residents to stay off the roads due to widespread flooding. There have not been reports of any injuries or deaths. A brief tornado warning was issued for Ventura County overnight.\n\nThe brunt of the storm damage appeared to be in the beachside city of Port Hueneme, according to the Ventura County Star, part of the USA TODAY Network. Roughly 60 homes in a senior community there were evacuated overnight.\n\nCrews there were working to clear drains and keep the water moving as the rain continued to fall throughout the morning, said Port Hueneme City Manager James Vega. A damage assessment also was ongoing. “We had just a massive amount of rain very quickly, and it overwhelmed our drainage system,” Vega said.\n\nA 'dramatic' storm\n\n“This is a genuinely dramatic storm,” climate scientist Daniel Swain, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an online briefing. “In Oxnard, particularly, overnight there were downpours that preliminary data suggests were probably the heaviest downpours ever observed in that part of Southern California.”\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford told the LA Times that “the frequency of this kind of event is on the order of once in every thousand years.\"\n\nIn an advisory, weather service meteorologists said at least 2-6 inches of rain had fallen over the Ventura County area. An additional 1-4 inches was expected to fall by the afternoon. Meteorologists anticipate rock and mudslide activity on and below canyon and mountain roads, leading to “significant travel delays.”\n\n“It was a very, very significant amount of rainfall being produced in a short amount of time,” Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist in charge at the weather service's office in Oxnard, told the Ventura County Star. Rainfall rates – which can cause flooding at 1 inch per hour – reached as high as 3 inches per hour early Thursday, he said.\n\nThe storm was not over: In all, some 27 million people live where a flood watch remained in effect Thursday afternoon, including much of the Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ At Los Angeles International Airport, 40 flights have been delayed and one canceled as of 1:30 p.m., according to FlightAware.us.\n\n◾ The Oxnard Union High School District, which has schools across Ventura County, remained open despite the storm conditions Thursday morning. Oxnard and Hueneme elementary and middle schools are on winter break, according to the districts' websites.\n\n◾ About 20 residents of a senior community in Port Hueneme were evacuated early Thursday, county Firefighter Andy VanSciver told the Ventura County Star. About 10 were rescued in a tactical rescue vehicle.\n\n◾ Oxnard Fire Department reported cars stuck in flooded roadways and several water rescues. There have not been any reports of injuries or deaths in Ventura County. \"Many of the streets and intersections are heavily impacted by flooding,\" read a post on X by the fire department. \"Please stay off the city streets for the next several hours until the water recedes. Standing water can cause vehicles to stall and may become trapped.\"\n\nSanta Barbara under flash flood warning\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash food warning for south Santa Barbara County that'll remain in effect until 4 p.m. local time. Meteorologists urged the estimated 233,800 people in the area to move to higher ground and avoid driving through flood waters.\n\n\"This means that flash flooding is occurring or imminent,\" read a statement from the Santa Barbara Police Department. \"A flash flood is an extremely dangerous, sudden, violent, and fast-moving wall of water. ... If you are in one of these areas, go to the innermost room of your home or to higher ground such as a second floor.\"\n\nWeather in Los Angeles to pick up through the evening\n\nLos Angeles will be hit the hardest by rain and strong winds beginning Thursday afternoon and continuing into the evening, according to AccuWeather. Through the night and into Friday, the area between San Diego and Palm Springs will be drenched, raising concerns over potential flooding.\n\nCoastal areas in Los Angeles and San Diego are expected to receive 2-5 inches of rain, while mountainous areas will get around 5-10 inches, according to the NWS. Wind gusts around 25-40 mph are expected, but some could reach up to 55 mph.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, 1.5 inches of rain was recorded at Los Angeles International Airport, according to AccuWeather. Of that amount, 0.72 of an inch of rain fell on downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThis is the the area's first El-Niño influenced storm, one that's fueled by an atmospheric river of moisture, the National Weather Service said. It's expected to be the biggest rainstorm for the region since Hurricane Hilary dumped up to half a foot of rain in August, AccuWeather forecasters said.\n\nStorm first caused flooding throughout Northern California, tornado in Oroville\n\nThe same storm has been drenching areas in Northern and Central California into midweek while remaining largely offshore over the Pacific. Parts of Sacramento flooded, with entire roadways under water, as the storm moved southeast Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nOroville, a city about 65 miles north of Sacramento, experienced a tornado on Tuesday with winds of up to 90 mph and which lasted two minutes, according to the NWS.

And more is yet to come later this week as another powerful storm will rev up by Friday, bringing more frigid air and snow to the East Coast, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe combination of up to 3 inches of rain over highly saturated and snow-covered ground elevated the risk of flooding, especially along low-lying and coastal areas throughout the mid-Atlantic and New England, forecasters said.\n\nOver 189,000 utility customers across New York State, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were without power Wednesday afternoon. Many school districts delayed the start of classes or canceled them because of the storm.\n\nOn Tuesday, the storm brought blizzard conditions, heavy rain and powerful winds to over 30 states and more than 2 million square miles. At least five deaths and several injuries were reported across the Midwest and Southeast. At least three tornadoes were confirmed across the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday with wind gusts as high as 106 mph.\n\nMeanwhile, dangerous blizzard conditions that peaked on Tuesday persist in the Pacific Northwest, where heavy snow fall has made for treacherous travel conditions along mountain roads in the Cascades and Olympics.\n\nThe coldest air of the season will move into the central U.S. through the weekend as a cold front shifts south and high pressure builds to the north, according to the weather service. High temperatures in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains are forecast to reach 10 to 20 degrees below zero on Friday and Saturday, and wind chills could exacerbate hypothermia and frostbite risks.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 15,000 flights were delayed across the nation Wednesday, and about 1,300 were canceled as the storm continued to move across the Northeast, according to FlightAware. Airports in Denver, Chicago and Miami accounted for the most travel delays and cancellations.\n\n∎ Over 150 rivers throughout the Atlantic Coast were at their flood stage, according to the weather service.\n\n∎ Amtrak canceled dozens of trains across the mid-Atlantic region and up through Maine on Wednesday, citing impacts of the immense winter storm that passed across the Northeast. Several of the canceled trains were in major metropolitan areas, including New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nGet a grip on winter driving:How to prepare for snow and ice on the roads.\n\nEvacuation order lifted after partial dam break in Connecticut\n\nA mandatory evacuation order prompted by a partially damaged dam was lifted Wednesday after hundreds of people were forced to flee their homes, the Connecticut Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security said.\n\nOfficials would be monitoring the dam through the night, the agency added.\n\nThe evacuation zone stretched for several miles along the Yantic River from the town of Bozrah to Uncas Falls in downtown Norwich, a city about 45 miles northeast of New Haven.\n\n“The City Manager has determined that the Yantic River Flood Zone must be evacuated to protect the life and safety of residents in the area,” said a statement from Norwich Public Utilities.\n\nAn emergency shelter was opened at Kelly Middle School in Norwich, where the Red Cross was stationed to help the hundreds of people who had to leave their homes.\n\nAround 7 a.m., Norwich Public Utilities announced the dam had partially collapsed. The company said Wednesday afternoon power was restored after cutting it off for about 5,000 customers to avoid “potentially catastrophic” infrastructure damage.\n\nNorwich Public Utilities said the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection would oversee stabilizing the damaged infrastructure, and a coffer dam would be installed to hold back water and “allow for further investigation and repair.”\n\nAt 12:15 p.m., the Yantic River was measured at 12.8 feet, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The river’s flood stage is 9 feet.\n\nWeather service confirms rare EF-3 tornado hit Florida\n\nFour tornadoes, including a rare and powerful EF-3, slammed Florida on Tuesday, the National Weather Service confirmed after a preliminary damage survey Wednesday.\n\nAn EF-1 tornado slammed southwest Jackson County around 6 a.m. local time Tuesday, the weather service said, uprooting several trees and damaging some sheds in its seven-minute span. Minutes later, an EF-2 tornado in central Jackson County injured seven people, flipped over mobile homes and tore off roofs, according to a preliminary assessment.\n\nThe weather service also confirmed an EF-3 tornado and EF-2 tornado hit Bay County, both spawning from the same parent storm.\n\nDon Van Dyke, a meteorologist at the weather service in Tallahassee, Florida, told USA TODAY the tornadoes were fueled by an unusually strong cold front, lots of wind shear and a moist and unstable airmass from the Gulf of Mexico. He noted EF-3 tornadoes were rare for the area, while lower-scale twisters were more common.\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records show Florida only had 41 EF-3 tornadoes between 1954 and 2022.\n\nTornadoes are classified on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which ranges from zero to five. It takes into account estimated wind speeds, observed damage, and damage verified in weather service surveys after tornadoes.\n\nAn EF-3 tornado has wind gusts ranging from 136 to 165 mph. Its winds can destroy entire stories of well-constructed houses, severely damage large buildings such as shopping malls, overturn trains, rip off bark from trees, blow away structures with weak foundations, and lift heavy cars off the ground.\n\nStorm kills at least 5 people, authorities say\n\nAuthorities said the large storm caused at least five deaths in Wisconsin, Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina on Tuesday.\n\nOne person was killed and four people were injured in Claremont, North Carolina, when a tornado hit Catawba County, damaging multiple homes in a mobile home park, county spokesperson Amy McCauley told USA TODAY. About 30 people were displaced by the storm, she said, and the American Red Cross was assisting with shelter efforts. The weather service preliminarily determined the storm was categorized as an EF-1 tornado, meaning it had 3-second wind gusts of 86 to 110 mph.\n\nPolice in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, say a man died during heavy rain when a tree fell on his car on a state highway in Jonesboro.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman died in Cottonwood, Alabama, after an apparent tornado touched down around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Houston County Coroner Robert Byrd confirmed to USA TODAY. Charlotte Paschal's mobile home was picked up by the storm and \"rolled\" three to four times, Byrd said.\n\nA second person in Alabama died Tuesday when a tree fell on the 68-year-old man’s car as he was driving down Crestwood Boulevard, Birmingham Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Clay Hendon told USA TODAY. The storm had mostly passed by the time the man was on the road, but soaked grounds from earlier rainfall and high winds likely pushed the tree to collapse, Hendon said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, treacherous road conditions amid intense snowfall led to a car wreck in Jefferson County that left one person dead.\n\nRescue response:Avalanche at Palisades Tahoe ski resort forces closures in area as crews conduct search\n\nSnowfall broke Des Moines record on Tuesday\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, saw a record 8.3 inches of snow on Tuesday, breaking previous records for Jan. 9 snowfall, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe previous record for Jan. 9 was 7.3 inches, set in 1957. Tuesday was the second day the storm dumped snow on Des Moines, which saw a total of 11.2 inches Monday and Tuesday.\n\nIowa may have its coldest Caucus Day ever on Jan. 15 with \"arctic cold\" en route to the state. By 6 p.m. on Monday, when people will be lining up to check-in before caucusing for Republican presidential primary candidates, temperatures are expected to be minus 1 to minus 5 degrees depending on which part of the state you're in. Wind chills in the evening could dip to nearly minus 20 degrees, meteorologist Brad Small said.\n\n− The Des Moines Register\n\nMaine flooding covers roads, submerges cars\n\nLarge swaths of Maine’s Atlantic Coast flooded early Wednesday as heavy rain poured across New England, melting snow banks and quickly raising the level of rivers and streams.\n\nStephen Oliver, a building contractor who lives and works in Hancock, a seaside town at the head of Frenchman Bay, said the storm surge had swelled over entire roadways and submerged cars.\n\n“There's a lot of flooding everywhere,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nOliver, 47, spent Tuesday afternoon covering building materials in tarps and installing extra braces on a house he’s working on near the coast. Multiple building sites lost power overnight, he said.\n\nCoastal communities may be inundated with up to 3 feet of water before the rain subsides, the weather service said. From Tuesday night to Wednesday morning, 1 to 4 inches of snow fell along Maine’s coastal towns and neighborhoods, while inland areas received snow totals in the double digits.\n\nThe York County emergency management department reported coastal flooding Wednesday morning, with water inundation of up to one foot in buildings in the village center of Kennebunkport and part of a road washed away in Biddeford, the weather service in Gray, Maine said.\n\nTwo previous storms also caused flooding and damaging winds in December, Oliver said. Weather this winter season has been “very unusual,” he said.\n\n“This is like the third instance where there’s been heavy wind and rain in the last few months,” he said, adding that he can’t remember a time when extreme weather struck the region with a similar frequency.\n\nSevere weather to continue: Bomb cyclone, arctic blast, East Coast snowstorm\n\nThe parade of snowstorms is just a teaser for what's to come. By Friday, cold air equivalent to true artic air will reach the central U.S., and many places will be unable to reach temperatures above zero degrees Fahrenheit by Sunday, according to AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter.\n\nA possible \"bomb cyclone\" blizzard − a winter hurricane − could cause an arctic blast courtesy of the polar vortex in the Midwest next week as well as the first real East Coast snowstorm in years.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the storm carrying the arctic air will continue to bring heavy snow, blizzard conditions and snow squalls throughout parts of the Pacific Northwest through Thursday before the system makes its way to the Midwest later this week.\n\nA polar vortex is just the beginning:January's weather forecast is chaotic and dangerous\n\nMigrants in NYC sheltered at a school during storm\n\nNearly 2,000 migrants were brought to a high school in Brooklyn, New York, on Tuesday ahead of the storm's intense wind and rain.\n\nThe 500 families had been sheltering in tents at Floyd Bennett Field, an airfield in southeast Brooklyn, only a few miles from James Madison High School, when they were picked up in buses Tuesday evening and dropped off at the school.\n\nThe school's students studied from home Wednesday.\n\n“This relocation is a proactive measure being taken out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals working and living at the center,” the New York City Emergency Management said in a statement. “The relocation will continue until any weather conditions that may arise have stabilized and the facility is once again fit for re-occupancy.”\n\nZachary Iscol, the commissioner of the city’s emergency management department, said at a news conference the migrants were relocated primarily “because of the high winds.”\n\nAround 5 a.m. Wednesday, when the storm had largely passed over the city and the strong winds had subsided, authorities began taking families back to the airfield.\n\nMigrants arriving to NYC:City adds restrictions to 'rogue' buses of migrants sent by Texas gov.\n\nPower outages surge across country\n\nWhile heavy rain moved out of the area early Wednesday, more than 140,000 are without power in New York State after gusts of up to 60 mph knocked over power lines and downed trees.\n\nMore than 100,000 utility customers in Pennsylvania and 80,000 in North Carolina were without power at about 6 a.m., according to a USA TODAY tracker.\n\nAreas throughout the Midwest, where snowfall has lessened since blizzard conditions swept over the region earlier this week, remained without power Wednesday morning. In Michigan, more than 44,000 utility customers had no power amid freezing temperatures.\n\nBy afternoon, things had improved somewhat. In New York, about 113,000 customers were still without power; 20,000 in North Carolina; and 28,000 in Michigan.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/25/helene-storm-hurricane-path-forecast-live-updates/75369769007/", "title": "Helene updates: Hurricane may hit Florida as Category 4", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on Hurricane Helene for Wednesday, Sept. 25. For the latest on the storm, see our story for Thursday, Sept. 26.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Hurricane Helene is now predicted to reach Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, part of a frightening forecast of 130-mph winds and high storm surge that brings a dire scenario for hundreds of miles of the state's coast as entire communities are forced to flee.\n\nHelene reached hurricane status Wednesday and was forecast to grow more powerful and dangerous before making landfall Thursday evening on Florida's Gulf Coast as a devastating Category 4 storm, up from an expectation earlier Wednesday that it would arrive as a Category 3 hurricane.\n\n\"Weakening is expected after landfall, but Helene's fast forward speed will allow strong, damaging winds, especially in gusts, to penetrate well inland across the southeastern United States, including over the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians,\" the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe NHC warned that \"a catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along portions of the Florida Big Bend coast, where inundation could reach as high as 20 feet above ground level, along with destructive waves.''\n\nThis is the “worst case for the Tallahassee region and Big Bend of Florida,” said Craig Fugate, former administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. “Storm surge will most likely set records along the coast.”\n\nThe highest landfall probability is somewhere along the eastern part of the Florida Panhandle − possibly the Big Bend area, the curve of Florida's peninsula around the Gulf of Mexico − late Thursday, AccuWeather forecasters said. Near where Helene makes landfall, general rainfall of 8-12 inches is expected, with 2 feet of rain possible in isolated areas.\n\nThe hurricane center warned in a 1 a.m. CDT update that Helene will bring catastrophic winds and storm surge to the northeastern Gulf Coast and that \"preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\"\n\nStorm tracker:See projected path of Tropical Storm Helene set to become a hurricane\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency in anticipation of Hurricane Helene's impacts later this week. The current track forecasts the center of the storm west of Virginia, but Youngkin said some parts of the state could see significant rainfall and flooding from outer bands of Helene.\n\n∎ Tampa International Airport said it will suspend operations at 2 a.m. Thursday because of the hurricane. The airport plans to reopen \"when safe to do so.\" The smaller, nearby St. Pete-Clearwater Airport will be closed Thursday and is scheduled to reopen Friday, according to its website. Orlando International Airport said on X that it remains open but some flights could be delayed or canceled for weather-related reasons.\n\n∎ While U.S. flights weren't seeing a major impact early Wednesday, 12% of flights to Cancun, Mexico, had been canceled and another 16% delayed as of 1:30 p.m. ET, according to online flight tracker FlightAware. Elsewhere, airlines have issued travel waivers, allowing customers to rebook flights along the hurricane's path without penalties, though cities, dates and terms vary widely. Details here.\n\n∎ The Tampa Zoo said it will close its door to the public Thursday and take measures to protect the animals from the approaching hurricane.\n\n∎ The University of Florida cancelled classes for Thursday, joining Florida State and Florida A&M universities, whose closures will last through the weekend.\n\n∎ Helene is the fifth hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, about the average number for the date, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. A typical season sees a total of seven hurricanes. If it lands as a Category 3 storm, this would be fifth consecutive year a major hurricane hits the U.S. mainland, which has only happened once before, Klotzbach said.\n\nHelene's explosive forecastone of the 'most aggressive' in hurricane history\n\nFlooding danger hundreds of miles inland, NOAA warns\n\nHelene's projected impact is so vast, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration took the rare step Wednesday of reaching out to news organizations to emphasize how much damage the hurricane figures to cause in inland locations well beyond the Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nNOAA pointed out Helene's wind fields extend up to 275 miles from its core, warning communities in the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia to prepare for \"catastrophic, life-threatening inland flooding.'' Urban areas in Helene's path, such as Tallahassee, Florida, and Atlanta − separated by more than 200 miles − along with Asheville, North Carolina, are at risk of major flooding, NOAA said.\n\n\"Even well before landfall, heavy rainfall will begin in portions of the southeastern United States and will continue to move northward into the southern Appalachians region through Friday, where storm total rainfall amounts are forecast to be up to 18 inches,'' NOAA said in a news release.\n\nHelene's core avoids Yucatan and may get stronger, scientist says\n\nIt appears the center of Helene is staying over open water and not hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Wednesday, according to Andy Hazelton, an associate scientist at the University of Miami’s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies and NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanic Meteorological Laboratory.\n\nBy staying over the water and not moving over land, the storm's core will be able to come together unimpeded, Hazelton posted on X. \"The stage is being set such that the higher-end intensity outcomes are possible depending on structure,'' he said.\n\nMillions under storm warnings in Southeast\n\nMore than 42 million people in Florida, Georgia and Alabama were under hurricane and tropical storm warnings, the National Weather Service said.\n\nHelene could also become Tallahassee's worst wind event in recorded history as 100 mph winds blast the Florida capital. Ryan Truchelut, founder of WeatherTiger and a hurricane forecaster for the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida, said Helene is a storm without precedent.\n\n\"Helene stands toe-to-toe with any of the threats that Florida has faced over the past 10 years or indeed really over hurricane history,\" Truchelut said.\n\nA month ago, Jody Griffis rode out Hurricane Debby in his Cedar Island home along the Big Bend coast. But as he secured his stilt home with shutters and siding Wednesday, he told USA TODAY he will heed the local evacuation order issued ahead of Helene.\n\n“My gut is telling me to get out,” he said.\n\nPossibility of 8-10-foot storm surge 'scares me,' bar owner says\n\nIn coastal Steinhatchee, a Big Bend town in Taylor County, Crabbie Dad’s bar owner Scott Peters supervised a crew loading beer, coolers and liquor into trucks Wednesday, moving it all to safety further inland.Peters, 46, said the storms that have hit the bar he’s owned for 19 years seem to keep getting stronger each season. The bar sits about 100 feet across First Avenue from where the Steinhatchee River empties into Deadman Bay.“We’re taking everything I can lift and move and things I didn’t take out last time that I learned a lesson from,” said Peters. “You take every storm as serious as you can because this is such a low-lying area. We’re basically at sea level.”As he spoke, a county emergency alert sounded on nearby cell phones, warning of dangerous storm surge and cautioning people to have three days of supplies on hand before the storm hits Thursday evening.Peters said he's worried that because Helene gained strength so rapidly, it may propel a huge storm surge toward shore. He said growing up in the area people used to have hurricane parties and ride out storms. But the recent string of more powerful hurricanes has convinced him that’s no longer a good idea.“If this thing comes in and goes over us as fast as they’re saying, we could get 8-10 feet of water. That’s what scares me,” Peters said. “The thing’s coming so damn fast we didn’t have time to prepare much.”\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nPacking up, hoping massive storm turns away\n\nIn Keaton Beach, about 65 miles southeast of Tallahassee, Mike Kicklighter lifted himself up with a piece of construction equipment so he could attach a remote camera to a telephone pole on his now-empty waterfront lot.\n\nKicklighter, 47, lives in Georgia and normally keeps a mobile home on the sandy lot but hauled it away for safety. His neighbor’s house sits on concrete pillars more than 20 feet tall.\n\n“I want to watch your house fall,” he joked to his neighbor as he tightened the strap holding the camera. In all seriousness, he said, they are closely watching the storm’s track, hoping it passes further west.\n\n“We’re all pitched to roll out,“ Kicklighter said Wednesday as they finished up packing and prepared to load an ice maker into the bed of a pickup. “The biggest worry was the surge, but we might have done all of this for nothing. I hope we did.”\n\n− Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat is rapid intensification and will it occur in Helene?\n\nRapid intensification is when a hurricane’s winds accelerate by 35 mph or more within 24 hours. Computer models indicate a high chance Helene will experience rapid intensification over the next 24 hours, Robbie Berg, a specialist at the hurricane center, wrote in a Wednesday morning forecast.\n\nHelene will be moving through an environment very conducive to intensification, with low wind shear and much warmer than normal sea surface temperatures. While the official forecast predicts sustained winds up to 125 mph on Thursday, Berg said those winds could be stronger if Helene \"rapidly intensifies more than forecast.\"\n\nBig Bend resident: 'I don't know if my house can take it'\n\nGriffis, 57, said he planned to leave with his wife for his brother’s house Thursday morning, likely after a long night of fortifying his own home.\n\n“Everything that I have of value will go with me,” he said, describing family heirlooms and photo albums. “If this thing gets up to 135-140 miles an hour, I don't know if my house can take it.”\n\nSteve Brown, 72, who lives just a few yards from the gulf in Cedar Island, spent the last 24 hours moving outdoor furniture into his home, which sits on stilts 21 feet above sea level.\n\nUnder a countywide evacuation, he plans to leave with his wife, Cindy, and their cat, Max, to a friend’s home in the nearby city of Perry. “People around here are busy,” said the retired schoolteacher. “It's not a frenzy. Everybody's been through this before, so they have a plan and they're just executing it.”\n\nResidents in southwest Florida brace for Helene\n\nIn Sarasota, Florida, hundreds of miles from where forecasters predict Hurricane Helene will come ashore, residents prepared for the storm Wednesday. Rick Munroe, owner of Sun Garden Cafe, brought in patio furniture and stacked sandbags in front of the doors. A long stretch of Florida’s coast, including western Sarasota, could be exposed to storm surge of up to 7 feet, according to forecasters.\n\n\"If you don't take them serious,” he said, speaking about hurricanes, “then you're foolish or you just moved here.”\n\nPaul Samuel, a local general contractor, said many of his clients are similarly concerned about the hurricane. One homeowner had him move much of the furniture on the bottom floor of their home to the second floor. Samuel plans to wrap up several projects by the end of the day, including one that requires the installation of seven windows and doors before the winds and water pick up.\n\n\"It'll be airtight by tonight,\" Samuel said.\n\n– Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nIncreased risk of tornadoes in Southeast on Thursday\n\nHelene was centered about 425 miles southwest of Tampa, Florida, on Wednesday at 11 p.m. ET, the hurricane center said. The storm was driving maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and moving north at 9 mph.\n\nTornadoes were possible late Wednesday on the western Florida Peninsula and southern Alabama, the hurricane center said. The risk of tornadoes expands Thursday across Florida and into parts of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nFlorida counties order evacuations ahead of Helene\n\nAt least 22 Florida counties have some form of evacuation order in effect.\n\nThree counties in the Big Bend coast, where storm surge could reach heights of 15 feet, issued mandatory evacuation orders for all residents and visitors in its jurisdiction. Officials in Wakulla, Franklin and Taylor counties – home to about 69,000 people – warned residents of the danger posed by the storm and urged them to take it seriously.\n\n“Hurricane Helene is predicted to be a catastrophic and life-threatening storm system,” the Taylor County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. “This system will be unlike anything we have experienced to date. A curfew is effective from sunset to sunrise. Repeat, this is a MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDER for everyone.”\n\nLeon County, home to Tallahassee, ordered the evacuation of residents from mobile and manufactured homes because of the threat of high winds. \"Seek shelter no later than 8 a.m. Thursday,\" an emergency alert from the county read.\n\nSeventeen other counties stretching across the western coast of the state, from the panhandle to just south of Sarasota, have announced mandatory or voluntary evacuations, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Across the state, officials announced closures of government offices and facilities as well as public schools and several major universities.\n\nHelene forecast is a ‘nightmare' scenario for parts of North Florida\n\nRick Minor, a county commissioner in Leon County, urged residents to take the approaching storm seriously.\n\nIn an email to constituents Tuesday night, Minor said he was briefed by Leon County Emergency Management officials, who said that if the current track holds, the county will take a direct hit.\n\n\"On Thursday we'll face about six hours of sustained winds of 74-110 mph, leading to thousands of downed trees, more than a hundred blocked roads, hundreds of damaged structures, and many, many days of extended power outages,\" he said. \"But we mustn't panic − fortunately, we all have enough time to carefully plan and prepare.\"\n\nFor those living in Wakulla, Franklin and Taylor counties, National Weather Service forecasters offered a grim wakeup call hours after emergency managers ordered all county residents to evacuate: \"This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously.\"\n\nIsland deluges will bring flood, landslide risks\n\nThe prediction of heavy inland rain from Hurricane Helene has triggered a rare \"high risk\" area for excessive rainfall Thursday for portions of the southern Appalachians, the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center announced Wednesday.\n\nThe entire region was bracing for a deluge from Helene: \"Overall, 5 to 10 inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches is forecast over the Southeast,\" the prediction center said.\n\nBecause of the expected rain, \"considerable\" flash and urban flooding is forecast across portions of Florida, the Southeast, southern Appalachians and the Tennessee Valley through Friday. Widespread minor to moderate river flooding is also likely, and isolated major river flooding is possible.\n\nThe rain will also increase the risk of landslides across the southern Appalachians, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nWill Helene hit Mexico and its beaches?\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Cabo Catoche to Tulum, Mexico, including Cozumel. Additionally, there was a tropical storm warning in effect for Rio Lagartos to Cabo Catoche, the U.S. hurricane center said.\n\nOn the forecast track, the center of Helene was expected to move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico later Wednesday and Thursday, according to the hurricane center.\n\nHelene is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 4-8 inches over western Cuba, the Cayman Islands and the northeast Yucatan Peninsula, with isolated totals around 12 inches, bringing a \"risk of considerable flooding,\" according to the hurricane center.\n\n− Gabe Hauari\n\nWhat is storm surge and what makes the Gulf vulnerable during Helene?\n\nAlong with powerful wind speeds and high rainfall amounts, another deadly hazard is a major concern for the western coast of Florida: storm surge.\n\nIn the open ocean, hurricane winds push water toward the center of the storm and instead of piling up, the water spirals downward and flows outward.\n\nAs the water is pushed downward, some is pushed out to sea and some is pushed toward the coast. As the storm approaches land and shallow water, the ocean floor blocks the outflowing water, causing the ocean to surge onto land.\n\nForecasters predict the Helene will wallop the Big Bend coast of Florida with a surge of water as high as 15 feet, while other coastal areas, such as Tampa Bay, could see 8 feet of water. The storm is expected to rapidly intensify into a major hurricane as it churns over the warm waters of the Gulf.\n\nAmong the factors making coastal communities along the Gulf of Mexico more vulnerable to piling water is its continental shelves that extend well over 100 miles from the shore. On the Atlantic coast, narrower shelves with steep slopes produce a lower surge.\n\n– Javier Zarracina, Ramon Padilla, Stephen J. Beard, Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nDeSantis urges Florida residents to prepare for Helene\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Floridians should prepare for a potential major hurricane after he expanded his state of emergency declaration to 61 counties.\n\n\"Right now you do have time, so take advantage of that time,\" DeSantis said. \"Review your plan and make sure you’re executing your hurricane preparedness plan.\"\n\n\"Don’t get wedded to these cones. You could be out of the cone and still have major impacts.\"\n\nHelene, expected to intensify rapidly,prompts hurricane warning for Florida Gulf Coast\n\nHelene disrupts Gulf oil production\n\nU.S. oil producers scrambled Monday to evacuate staff from Gulf of Mexico oil production platforms as the second hurricane in two weeks was predicted to tear through offshore oil-producing fields.\n\nOil companies BP, Chevron, and Shell have begun evacuating offshore staff, and several have paused some production. Just two weeks ago, Hurricane Francine roared across the Gulf of Mexico, peaking as a Category 2 with 100-mph winds as it made landfall in Louisiana.\n\nHelene would be Florida's 9th major hurricane hit since 2000\n\nThe storm is forecast to become a major hurricane, a Category 4, before approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAccording to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, eight major hurricanes have made landfall in Florida since 2000: Charley and Jeanne in 2004; Dennis and Wilma in 2005; Irma in 2017; Michael in 2018; Ian in 2022; Idalia in 2023.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; William L.

Ron DeSantis warned Monday that the entire Gulf Coast of Florida should be prepared for Hurricane Ian, saying storm surge could affect much of the coast because of the size and track of the storm.\n\nMeanwhile, Ian was rapidly intensifying Monday as the massive storm hurtled toward Cuba and Florida, prompting a swath of hurricane watches and the first evacuations along Florida's west coast. More evacuations are expected as Ian draws closer.\n\nIan was forecast to become a major hurricane, Category 3 or greater, as soon as late Monday, AccuWeather said. The storm could ultimately reach Category 4 status, which means sustained winds from 130 mph to 156 mph. The governor noted Ian is about 500 miles wide.\n\n“Floridians up and down the Gulf Coast should feel the impacts of this,\" DeSantis said Tuesday during a press conference at the state Emergency Operations Center. “This is a really, really big hurricane at this point.”\n\n“The impacts are going to be far and wide,\" the governor added, noting that even if the eye of the storm passes well west of Naples, as currently forecast, that region will still see storm surge.\n\nTropical Storm Ian: Gov. DeSantis urges vigilance as hurricane threat looms for Florida\n\nLive Updates:Hurricane Ian intensifies; Tallahassee, Big Bend in the cone\n\nWeatherTiger:With a possible Cat 4 Hurricane Ian incoming, model split keeps Florida guessing\n\nMajor worries about Ian impact on Tampa Bay region\n\nIn a second press conference in Pinellas County later in the day, DeSantis and officials from throughout the Tampa Bay area said they are concerned that Ian could be the hurricane the region has long dreaded.\n\n“This could be the storm that we have all feared so we advise everyone in the Tampa Bay area to please take this seriously… please understand that these evacuations are very serious,\" said Attorney General Ashley Moody. \"You need to make preparations now.\"\n\nWith many low-lying communities, the Tampa Bay region is particularly vulnerable to storm surge.\n\n“The prospect of having a hurricane come on shore in the Tampa Bay area is real,” DeSantis said.\n\nAnother 2,500 Florida National Guard members were called into duty for Ian, bringing the total to 5,000, and 2,000 more are being deployed to Florida from nearby states.\n\nDeSantis suspended tolls on major roadways across Florida to help with the evacuation, which will escalate Tuesday as more mandatory evacuation orders are issued.\n\nPinellas County began evacuating Monday and is planning more evacuations Tuesday. Storm shelters began opening throughout the Gulf Coast Tuesday.\n\n“I can't stress enough: When we ask you to evacuate you need to evacuate,\" said St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. \"Our first responders will not be able to rescue you after winds reach a certain level and you will have to fend for yourselves.\"\n\nWelch said Ian reminds him of Hurricane Charley, which was headed for the Tampa Bay area in 2004 before taking an unexpected turn into Punta Gorda and leveling that community.\n\n\"I don't remember feeling this way about the potential impact of a storm since then,\" Welch said of Charley.\n\nAsked if there's enough time to evacuate everyone and whether uncertainty about the storm's path has hurt the evacuation effort, DeSantis said: “I do think they’ve given enough time to be able to safely evacuate.\"\n\nWidespread power outages are expected from Ian. DeSantis said thousands of lineman are being staged to respond to the storm.\n\n“There is going to be an interruption of power, so just plan on that,\" DeSantis said.\n\nGasoline supplies are continuing to flow into the state. The governor urged people not to take too much gas.\n\n“They’re constantly resupplying the fuel... there’s no need to panic buy fuel… we are continuing to bring it in,\" DeSantis said.\n\nAsked about reports of storm-related supplies being sold out at Home Depot stores in Florida, a Home Depot spokesperson told USA Today Network-Florida that the “inventory of products may vary by store, but our merchandising and supply chain teams are working to quickly replenish in-demand items.”\n\nHow Florida plans to handle heavy traffic volume from Floridians evacuating from Ian\n\nFlorida’s top emergency management official said he expects more traffic on Florida roads because more Hurricane Ian evacuation orders are expected to be issued Wednesday for residents in counties in the Tampa Bay region, and north and south of the area.\n\n“We’re going to start having traffic issues” on Wednesday as motorists drive out of the area, Florida Emergency Management Direct Kevin Guthrie told CNN on Tuesday night.\n\nHe said the state is likely to employ an “emergency shoulder use” strategy to add more lanes to handle the heavy volume of traffic due to Ian.\n\nHe encouraged motorists to visit the Florida Department of Transportation website to learn about the state’s “emergency shoulder use.” The website notes the different interstates and highways that could be expanded before the storm strikes.\n\nLike other state and local officials, Guthrie is urging Floridians in low-level areas, trailer and manufactured homes, to follow mandatory evacuation orders.\n\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie urged Gulf Coast residents to finish up their storm preparations.\n\n“Do not panic,\" Guthrie said. \"There is still time to get your preparations in order and safely evacuate in necessary.\"\n\nGuthrie said people should know their evacuation zone and listen to local authorities, who already have begun ordering evacuations in some areas.\n\nTampa mayor fears 'near worst case scenario'\n\nTampa mayor Jane Castor said she and local officials in her region fear “a near worst case scenario” following the latest report by the National Hurricane Center that predicts Ian may bring a storm surge of as much as 10 feet.\n\n“We could handle the wind if it came through quickly, but … we are already saturated in the Tampa Bay area,” Castor told CNN. “And we have a unique situation geographically with the bay being very shallow.”\n\n“It’s a near worst case scenario for our area,” she said.\n\nHillsborough County ordered a mandatory evacuation of residents living in coastal areas, and those in trailer and manufactured homes, at 2 p.m. Monday, a decision impacting an estimated 300,000 residents.\n\nTampa resident getting out of town\n\nTampa resident Charlene Cleary told CNN Monday that she’s facing a mandatory evacuation and has already made plans to go to Orlando, where she has hotel reservations to ride out the storm with her pet dogs and kids.\n\n“We're used to it by now being a Floridian, so we kind of have our protocol in place,” she said.\n\nShe's among 300,000 county resident being told to evacuate.\n\n\"This [storm] worries me a little more than usual,\" she said. \"I think our safest bet always is to just get out of town.\"\n\nLandfall in Florida likely for midweek\n\nPart of Florida's Southwest coast to nearly all of North Florida is inside the five-day Ian forecast cone. Landfall is increasingly likely in Florida midweek, AccuWeather said. Some evacuations were ordered Monday in coastal Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. The county suspended classes through Thursday to prepare schools to serve as shelters for evacuees.\n\n“Please treat this storm seriously. It’s the real deal. This is not a drill,” Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said Monday in Tampa.\n\nSome evacuations were ordered Monday in coastal Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. The county suspended classes through Thursday to prepare schools to serve as shelters for evacuees.\n\nPinellas County ordered mandatory evacuations effective 6 p.m. for those living in evacuation zone A and in mobile homes, officials announced on Twitter. That evacuation zone includes all beach communities and low-lying coastal areas along Tampa Bay, the Intracoastal Waterway, and rivers and inlets. Mandatory evacuations of zones B and C will go into effect at 7 a.m. Tuesday, the county said. Residents can check whether their home is in an evacuation zone at storm.pinellascounty.org.\n\nDeSantis: Warns to operate portable generators outside the home\n\nDeSantis also cautioned Floridians about using portable generators, saying more people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning than from hurricanes because they failed to keep the generators outside their homes.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates about 70 consumers die annually year from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by portable generators.\n\n“Poisonous carbon monoxide from a portable generator can kill you and your family in minutes. CO is an invisible killer,” says the commission.\n\nThe commission strongly advises those using portable generators operate them at least 20 feet from their home and direct the exhaust away from the home. It says generators should never be placed inside a home, garage, basement, crawlspace, shed, or on the porch.\n\nCrist criticizes DeSantis for statewide property insurance crisis\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist slammed Gov. Ron DeSantis Monday as the “worst property insurance governor in Florida history” and urged him provide emergency, 90-day property insurance coverage for homeowners who were dropped by their “failing companies.”\n\nCrist’s attack on DeSantis comes only days after state regulators asked a judge to place a property-insurance company in receivership, making it the sixth Florida property insurer declared insolvent this year amid widespread financial problems in the industry, the News Service of Florida reported.\n\nThe Florida Department of Financial Services sought to be appointed receiver for FedNat Insurance Co., which canceled 56,500 policies in May and reached an agreement to transfer about 83,000 policies to another company in June.\n\nThose insolvencies have contributed to massive growth in the number of customers pouring into the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp., which was created as an insurer of last resort. As of Sept. 16, Citizens had 1.055 million policies, more than double the number from two years earlier, the News Service of Florida reported Monday.\n\nCrist says that average property insurance premiums have risen from under $2,000 — when DeSantis took office in 2019 — to more than $4,200.\n\n“Ron DeSantis is the worst property insurance governor in Florida history, period,” said Crist in a campaign statement.\n\n““[He] let these insurance companies double Floridians rates and they’re still going belly up when homeowners need them most,” he said. “You pay and pay and pay, and the insurance company isn’t there for you in the end anyway.”\n\nFEMA announces major deployment of federal resources, staff for Hurricane Ian\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday it is prepositioning supplies and personnel in Florida, Alabama and Georgia in preparation for Hurricane Ian.\n\n“This will allow us to get help where it needs to be as soon as possible,” the agency said in a written statement to media.\n\nThe agency has more than 4,000 reservists available to deploy and, if necessary, more than 7,500 Surge Capacity Force members are ready to be deployed. Other FEMA preparations include:\n\nA National Disaster Medical System and two health and medical task forces to Florida, with more on standby.\n\nMore than 52 ambulances at the Orange County Convention Center.\n\nTwo Urban Search and Rescue Teams and an Incident Support Team readied to assist Florida. One is in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nAbout 3.5 million liters of water and 3.6 million meals at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. There are also more than 1 million liters of water, more than 480,000 meals and more than 7,200 cots in Alabama.\n\nThree Incident Management Teams have been deployed to Atlanta. Another, as well as a Mobile Emergency Response Support team, are in Tallahassee.\n\nThree Mobile Communications Operation Vehicles are additionally on the way to the Maxwell Air Force Base.\n\nThe National Response Coordination Center in Washington, D.C., and the Region 4 Response Coordination Center in Atlanta have also been activated.\n\nA U.S. Army Corps of Engineers power restoration team is deploying to Craig Field in Alabama. FEMA ordered four generator packs, with a total of 117 units.\n\nFuel supplies are available at Georgia’s Robins Air Force Base.\n\nContributing USA Today Network-Florida government accountability reporter Douglas Soule and USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor Sergio Bustos.\n\nFollow Herald-Tribune Political Editor Zac Anderson on Twitter at @zacjanderson.

MARKS, Fla. – Helene weakened to a post-tropical cyclone as it swept through the Southeast on Friday but the storm still wielded enough power to inflict historic flooding across multiple states, causing 33 deaths and millions of power outages.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday near Perry, Florida, with 140-mph winds, making it the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851. Overturned boats, flattened homes and a vista of floodwater several-feet-deep were revealed at dawn across the storm-weary region.\n\nIn Steinhatchee, a coastal town just miles from where Helene made landfall, John Kujawski drove a golf cart with his wife, Jamie Lee, over debris and around downed trees, horrified at the damage. The town of some 500 people took on 9.63 feet of storm surge, a record.\n\n“This is overwhelming,” Lee said. “I don’t think it’s sunk in.”\n\nFor several hours, the storm maintained hurricane strength as it pushed inland across northern Florida and into Georgia. By 5 p.m. ET, the weather service said Helene had weakened to a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm crossed into Kentucky and was about 50 miles south-southeast of Louisville.\n\nFlood alerts urging people to seek higher ground were active across parts of the Carolinas and the Atlanta area, where communities have been inundated with up to 10 inches of rain, according to the weather service. Hundreds of water rescues were underway across the Southeast amid the torrential rain and continued coastal flooding in western Florida. Meanwhile, more than 4.5 million utility customers were without power from Florida to Virginia.\n\nTrack the storm:Map Helene's forecast path through Georgia\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Tornado warnings were active across eastern North Carolina and southern Virginia Friday afternoon as Helene pushed further inland, according to the weather service. Flash flood and tropical storm warnings were active throughout northeast Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\n∎ Helene is tied as the 14th most powerful hurricane to hit anywhere in the U.S. since records have been kept and the seventh most powerful to slam into Florida, according to National Hurricane Center data.\n\n∎ More than 900 U.S. flights were canceled and more than 3,300 flights were delayed by Friday afternoon, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website.\n\nDam failure in Tennessee prompting emergency evacuations was false alarm\n\nA reported \"catastrophic\" dam failure that triggered an emergency evacuation for the entire downtown area of Newport, Tennessee, Friday afternoon was a false alarm, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.\n\nCocke County officials urged all residents to flee the area around 3 p.m. ET Friday after reports that Walters Dam had failed. State emergency management officials said around 4:40 p.m. that Duke Energy, which owns and operates the dam, informed them it was still standing.\n\n\"There is no longer a risk of an imminent dam failure for Walters Dam on the Pigeon River,\" the National Weather Service office in Morristown confirmed on X at 4:45 p.m. \"Major flooding continues, however. Continue to heed evacuation orders from local emergency management and law enforcement. Do not drive into flooded or closed roads.\"\n\nThe dam scare comes as nearby rivers continue to rise from the effects of Helene. The Pigeon River at Newport rose to nearly three times its flood stage Friday afternoon, and it's expected to reach 23 feet before receding this evening. The French Broad at Newport was expected to reach more than double its flood stage by the end of the day. By 1:45 p.m., it had reached over 17 feet with another 6 feet expected.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee said is urging residents to follow directions from local officials.\n\n“As Tennessee continues to experience severe weather and flooding from Hurricane Helene, we are monitoring conditions and urge Tennesseans to follow local guidance for key resources, safety information and community updates. Maria and I continue to pray for all impacted Tennesseans.”\n\n-Tyler Whetstone and Allison Kiehl, the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\n'We have nothing': Florida home washed away by Helene\n\nFrom the posts she saw on Facebook about her Steinhatchee neighborhood, Lynn Padgett knew the damage might be dire at the house she’s called home for 41 of her 48 years.\n\nShe just didn’t expect it would not be where she had left it Thursday.\n\nThe house was located in a riverside neighborhood alongside other homes. Helene's surge of water pushed it off its foundation and relocated it to the edge of a wooded area just down the way.\n\n\"This is the fourth time the river has flooded (the house) and the first time it’s washed my house away,” she said, chuckling, as she sat in her car with five Dachshunds and a cat. Another cat, Muffin, had climbed up a tree in fright.\n\nShe’s not laughing because it’s funny; not only does the Jiffy Food stop manager’s home not have flood insurance, but it’s not insured for wind either.\n\nThe Jiffy store she works at in Steinhatchee is flooded out, too, she said. She was waiting in her car, hoping the water would go down enough so she could get to her house where she lived with her husband, 64; her father, 67, who uses a wheelchair; and her 18-year-old son.\n\n“Laugh, cry, I don’t know what to do,” she said. “We have nothing.”\n\n-Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nDozens rescued from roof of hospital 'engulfed' by floodwater\n\nMore than 50 patients and staff were rescued after being stranded on a hospital rooftop as floodwaters quickly rose at Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin, Tennessee, on Friday afternoon, Sen. Bill Hagerty said.\n\n\"Everyone has been rescued safely from the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin,\" he said. \"More trouble on the horizon for East Tennessee communities. Please stay safe and thank you for your prayers!\"\n\nFloodwaters from the rapidly rising Nolichucky River and high winds prevented ambulances, rescue boats and even helicopters from reaching the hospital earlier, according to a statement from Ballad Health.\n\n\"The hospital has been engulfed by extremely dangerous and rapidly moving water. The situation at the hospital is very dangerous,\" the statement said.\n\nBallad Health said that at about 12:30 p.m., 54 people were on the roof and seven were in rescue boats. Water has also intruded into the hospital, the statement said. The rescue was complete by about 4:15 p.m., according to Hagerty's post.\n\nVirginia State Police said its aviation units were helping with the rescues and posted a photo on social media showing the building surrounded by high floodwaters.\n\nBig Bend resident maintains resolve to build back up after Helene\n\nHer riverside home is destroyed, eight of the 24 riverside rental units she owns were flooded, and the electrical system powering the riverside marina building may have been fritzed.\n\nAnd still, Danielle Norwood, 59, owner of the Sea Hag Marina that fronts the Steinhatchee River, was smiling somehow as she pointed to a concrete floor that had crumbled.\n\n“I think I’m stunned at this point, I can’t release a lot of emotions,” she said. And then she paused.\n\n“We’ll build back,\" she said. \"We’re those kind of people.”\n\nThe build-back is familiar territory for Norwood. Last year's Hurricane Idalia destroyed $1 million worth of docks and flooding shorted out the building's electrical system. To avoid a repeat, Norwood moved the electrical system to a second floor in the building, but Helene's nearly 10-foot storm surge appears to have shorted it again.\n\nOn the floor below, a wooden bar was still standing; however, the TVs above it had a line across the screen showing how far the water had risen.\n\nThe good news for Norwood is that Helene's fury spared the feral cats who prowl the marina grounds — and the docks that were so badly torn up by Idalia.\n\nRead the full story here:In Florida's Big Bend, officials start rescues, assessing damage post-Hurricane Helene\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nOver 4.5 million homes and businesses across the eastern U.S. were in the dark Friday afternoon as Helene pummeled the region with powerful winds and heavy rain.\n\nBelow are the outage totals from Florida to Virginia as of 5 p.m., according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker.\n\nSouth Carolina: 1,090,035\n\nGeorgia: 1,009,435\n\nFlorida: 732,847\n\nNorth Carolina: 825,173\n\nVirginia: 242,010\n\nKentucky: 200,927\n\nTennessee: 125,307\n\nWest Virginia: 77,475\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track widespread outages from Helene in the state\n\nFlorida sheriff says coastal area looks like 'a war zone' in Helene's wake\n\nOfficials in Florida's Pinellas County – hundreds of miles from where Helene came ashore – painted a grim picture when describing the storm's impact on its coast.\n\n“I would just describe it, having spent the last few hours out there, as a war zone,” said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri at a news conference Friday morning.\n\nHe said roads were impassable and that debris and damage were widespread: \"It’s going to take awhile before that area gets back to any sense of functionality.”\n\nAlong the Pinellas County coast, storm surge overnight reached over 8 feet – ”something we’ve never seen before” said Cathie Perkins, director of the county's emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nDeath toll rises as Helene batters Southeast\n\nAt least 33 people have died as Helene unleashed dangerous weather conditions across multiple states in the Southeast, according to authorities and media reports. Officials have said they expect the death toll to keep rising as they go door-to-door in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nIn Florida, at least seven deaths have been attributed to the storm. In Pinellas County, which encompasses Clearwater and St. Petersburg, five people suffered storm-related deaths, said Cathie Perkins, director of emergency management, at a news conference Friday.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters a person died in Dixie County, along the Big Bend coast, after a tree fell on a home. On Thursday night, a person was killed in a storm-related traffic fatality in Ybor City in Tampa, the governor said.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said at a news conference Friday that 11 people were killed during the storm, including a first responder.\n\n\"One of our finest lost his life trying to save others,\" Kemp said.\n\nAt least 13 people had died during the storm across South Carolina, the Charleston-based Post and Courier newspaper reported, citing local officials. Of those, two people were killed by trees that had fallen on their homes, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office and coroner's office told local media outlets. Two firefighters in Saluda County were also killed, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Two people died in Newberry County, Sheriff James Lee Foster said in an email. Four others died in Aiken County, Coroner Darryl Ables told USA TODAY by phone.\n\nIn North Carolina, a 4-year-old was killed and others were injured in a wreck on Thursday that occurred as Helene's outer bands were slamming the state. In Charlotte, North Carolina, a person died and another was hospitalized after a tree fell on a home just after 5 a.m. Friday, according to the Charlotte Fire Department.\n\n“This was a storm related death,” Battalion Chief John Lipcsak, a spokesperson for the fire department, told USA TODAY.\n\nPotential dam failure triggers evacuations in North Carolina\n\nIn Rutherford County, North Carolina, officials issued evacuation orders after major flooding in the area pushed a dam to the brink of failure.\n\nRutherford County Emergency Management on Friday morning announced that \"catastrophic\" flows of water along the Broad River began overtopping the Lake Lure Dam, located about 35 miles southeast of Asheville. As a result, a mandatory evacuation order was issued impacting areas downstream, including River Creek Campground and homes in the Green Hill, Cleghorn and Union communities.\n\n\"RESIDENTS BELOW THE LAKE LURE DAM NEED TO EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\" county emergency officials warned on Facebook. \"DAM FAILURE IMMINIENT!! EVACUATE TO HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY!!\"\n\nPower outages, road closures abound in North Carolina, Georgia\n\nTowns across the Carolinas and north-central Georgia were battered through Friday morning as Helene swept over the region, leaving entire parts of Atlanta underwater and triggering evacuation warnings.\n\n“All the apps on my phone kept screaming that there were flash flood warnings all night,” said Paul Thatcher, 38, owner of Franklin Terrace Bed and Breakfast in Franklin, North Carolina, about 70 miles southwest of Asheville.\n\nA nearby mountain highway was ordered closed Friday because the edge of the road bank eroded away, causing the edge of the asphalt to break away, sliding down the valley, officials in Macon County, North Carolina, said on Facebook.\n\nIn Elberton, Georgia, near the state’s border with South Carolina, the Samuel Elbert Hotel lost power overnight and regained it around 10 a.m. Friday, front desk associate Deborah Morrison told USA TODAY.\n\nOn her way to work Friday morning, Morrison said she saw four homes damaged by fallen trees. One road in town was completely washed out around 6 a.m., and other roads were closed because of downed power lines or trees, she said. Traffic on some roads had to alternate using a single lane in either direction, leading to lines of cars, Morrison said.\n\n“Everybody’s weathered it pretty fair, there’s no panicking going on,” Morrison, 63, said.\n\nHurricanes can produce tornadoes for days\n\nAs Helene tore through the Southeast on Friday, tornadoes were a growing concern.\n\nWhile tornadoes don’t typically get the same attention as hurricanes' ferocious winds or perilous storm surge, twisters are always one of the clear and present dangers as storms make landfall and trek inland.\n\n\"Hurricanes can produce tornadoes for two or three days after they move inland,\" said Roger Edwards, a lead forecaster at the Storm Prediction Center, who specializes in tornadoes. The highest risk warning the center has ever issued for a tornado situation related to a hurricane was for the third day after Hurricane Ivan made landfall in Alabama in September 2004. Forecasters were confident there would be a lot of super cells in Virginia, Maryland and even in the southern Pennsylvania area.\n\nNOAA posted a tornado watch at 8:05 a.m. for portions of North Carolina, Eastern South Carolina, Southern Virginia and coastal areas nearby until at least 6 p.m. Friday. The tornado threat from Helene would shift northward, through an area about 110 miles on either side of a line from 40 miles west-southwest of Florence, South Carolina to 20 miles northeast of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the agency said.\n\nSevere thunderstorms with hail were also possible, the agency said.\n\n– Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY\n\nCoastal Florida town slammed by hurricane – again\n\nBefore Friday morning’s light showed boats in yards, homes shredded and docks thrown from the river into roads, 22 members of the Florida State Guard Special Missions Unit were wading through the mud on the south side of Steinhatchee River’s banks, looking for anyone who needed rescuing.\n\nHurricane Helene struck Thursday evening, making landfall not far away in Perry. In Steinhatchee on Friday, what was dry land only hours earlier was submerged in 40 to 50 inches of water, said Jordon Bowen, commander of the unit, as he gazed down a road that now looked more like a river.\n\n“We have four different skiffs cruising through the neighborhood,” Bowen said, scanning the southeast side of Steinhatchee. “We’re searching all the area to make sure no one’s out there.”\n\nSo far, no one needed help. The search effort also included the National Guard, the Coast Guard, Taylor County sheriffs and Florida Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 2. However, the overall situation looks bleak, according to Bowen.\n\n“It’s destroyed,” Bowen said, indicating an area that’s about the size of 27 football fields. “Not accessible, debris, lots of hazards, downed power lines, houses cut in half.\"\n\n– Anne Geggis, Palm Beach Post\n\nPerry resident: 'I've had worse'\n\nOutside Perry, Florida, longtime resident Donna Parker, 80, watched as her grandson cut up a toppled palm tree with a chainsaw.\n\nParker has lived in her house since 1985 and has never left for a hurricane, the names of which she can still rattle off.\n\n\"The wind, it was bad. But I’ve had worse. We’ve really had worse. I’ve had it where my whole front yard was a lake,” she said.\n\n“A lot of prayers, I tell you, when the wind come up. But the good Lord looked after us.”\n\nIs there another hurricane brewing after Helene?\n\nWhile Helene was smashing into Florida, a new hurricane was coming to life in the Atlantic. Hurricane Isaac formed Friday morning far out in the ocean, almost 1,000 miles from Bermuda, the hurricane center said.\n\nAlthough the hurricane is moving east across the open Atlantic far from land, swells generated by Isaac are affecting portions of the coast of Bermuda and could spread into the Azores by this weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nElsewhere, forecasters were also watching a weather disturbance in the central Atlantic Ocean, one that has a 90% chance of becoming a named storm within the next couple of days. \"A tropical depression or storm could form today while the system moves generally westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"The system is then forecast to slow down and turn north-northwestward by this weekend.\"\n\nIf it gets a name, it would be called Tropical Storm Joyce. As of Friday morning, the system poses no threat to any land areas.\n\nFinally, ominously, forecasters were also turning their attention back to the Caribbean Sea, where yet another system appears to be brewing in a similar location to where Hurricane Helene formed. \"Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for slow development while the system moves generally northwestward, potentially entering the Gulf of Mexico by the end of next week,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nThat system, if it strengthens to a storm, would be called Tropical Storm Kirk.\n\n– Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nMan and his dog rescued from sailboat, taken to hospital\n\nIn Sanibel, Florida, a U.S. Coast Guard Air Station crew rescued a man and his dog after his sailboat became disabled and started taking on water off the Florida coast.\n\nCrews found the disabled boat 25 miles off the island's coast after a mayday call came in Thursday.\n\nA photo posted on X shows the Coast Guard rescuing the pair near a disabled vessel as high waters swirl around them.\n\nOfficials said the boater and the dog were airlifted to Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers.\n\nThe storm came the closest to the barrier island around 3 p.m. Thursday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\nIs Disney World closed for Hurricane Helene?\n\nTheme park-goers awaited official updates Friday morning announcing what parts of Walt Disney World may be closed.\n\nWalt Disney World in Orlando was open Thursday, but a few parts of the massive theme park were closed because of to Hurricane Helene, including the Typhoon Lagoon water park and miniature golf course. Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party was also canceled for Thursday, the Fort Myers News-Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nDisney World has closed less than a dozen times for hurricanes and national emergencies since its opening in 1971, according to the News-Press.\n\nTampa Bay residents say Helene inflicted 'complete devastation'\n\nIn Tampa Bay, residents said they saw vanished beaches, boats that ran into homes and businesses on fire.\n\n\"Complete devastation and loss here,\" Vikki Hudson, who lives in Largo about three miles from the coast, told USA TODAY on Friday. \"The beaches are gone. Everything is under water. Boats pilled on top of houses and yards.\"\n\nHudson said Gulf Boulevard, which runs the St. Petersburg coastline from Pass-A-Grille historic district north to Clearwater, was \"completely under water.\"\n\nHudson, who lives about 20 minutes from Treasure Island Beach where her two businesses are − The Island Girl Tiki Bar and The Island Girl Beach Rentals − said she has not been able to check on either because bridges are closed because of widespread flooding.\n\n\"We don’t know anything yet, we cannot get to any of the barrier islands,\" Hudson said.\n\n– Natalie Alund, USA TODAY\n\n'The worst I’ve seen': Water rescues underway across Florida\n\nAuthorities in communities up and down the west coast of Florida said they were conducting water rescues on Friday as storm surge continued to inundate coastal areas.\n\nIn Pasco County, communications manager Tambrey Lane, said state and local agencies working together had rescued at least 135 people from rising waters as of 7:30 a.m. Friday, though she added that number might be as high as 200 or more.\n\nCrews were still out as of 8:30 a.m. and rescues were ongoing, Lane said, and some areas remained inaccessible to rescue crews. More than 54,000 homes were under a mandatory evacuation order west of Interstate 19 and about 4,000 more homes east of the highway.\n\n“It’s really bad,” said Michelle Welsh, an emergency communications officer with the county. “I think it’s the worst I’ve seen.”\n\nWelsh, who’s lived in the area since 2007, said her single-wide trailer had no power, but her home, fortunately, was intact.\n\n– Phaedra Trethan, USA TODAY\n\nFlorida city powers down sewage plant, asks residents not to flush or shower\n\nResidents in a section of St. Petersburg, a city of 261,000, were told not to flush toilets or take showers after the city shut off power at a sewer treatment plant.\n\nThe city said it made the “difficult decision” in order to “protect the plant from unprecedented storm surge,\" in a statement released Friday morning.\n\n“Impacted residents/businesses should not drain water, take showers, do laundry or flush toilets,” the city said. “Draining water will cause sewage to back up into homes/businesses.”\n\nMorning light reveals damage in the wake of Helene\n\nDawn broke Friday morning over a battered and sudden Big Bend region of Florida after hurricane Helene roared ashore overnight.\n\nThe sharp smell of pine filled the air, an artifact of the hundreds of snapped trees lining roads between St. Marks and Perry. Emergency workers flooding into the area, wove around downed trees along U.S Highway 98 as sheriff deputies, limited access, and patrolled for possible looting.\n\nIn the tiny community of St. Marks, about 20 miles south of Tallahassee, floodwaters had reached the front of the U.S Post Office building, about 3/10 of a mile from the St. Marks River, which flows into the Gulf a few miles downstream.Some residents had planned to ride out the storm in their homes or aboard fishing boats tied up at the marina. They could not be immediately reached Friday morning, although cellphone service in the area was working.\n\nRescues ongoing in Atlanta as Helene drenches Southeast\n\nAuthorities in the Atlanta metro area conducted rescues early Friday as Helene raced through the state, drenching a vast swath of the Southeast in multiple inches of rain.\n\nAbout 25 people were rescued from a flooded apartment complex north of downtown Atlanta, multiple outlets reported, citing the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department.\n\nNearby Peachtree Creek entered major flood stage, reaching a height of more than 23 feet. Flood watches and warnings were active across the state of Georgia, where all counties are under a state of emergency declared by Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nAbout 4-6 inches of rain have fallen throughout north-central Georgia, including Atlanta and its surrounding counties, according to the weather service in Peachtree City, south of Atlanta. Forecasters say an additional 2 inches could fall throughout the morning hours.\n\nHundreds took to shelters in Tallahassee ahead of Helene\n\nAmber Handlin sat in front of her Lab mix Duckey in a makeshift shelter at the Leon High School gym. They were among the 546 people and 60 pets were in Leon County shelters Thursday afternoon.\n\nHandlin lives in her car and has no friends or family nearby, and with several counties in the area under mandatory evacuation orders, she and the dog were both anxious as the storm approached.\n\nSydney Walter, Jacob Walsh and 1-year-old Graylan live near Florida State University's campus. \"We're like nope, we are not even going to try it,\" Walter said. \"I said, I have a baby so I'm not risking anything.”\n\nThe family, which is expecting a new member, decided to shelter at Leon's gym, citing its proximity to their home, the security it offers − and the most persuasive push, the mom said, was Gov. Ron DeSantis' encouragement.\n\n– Alaijah Brown, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nRead the full story:Public schools sheltering local evacuees from Helene\n\nHelene causes flash flood emergency in North Carolina\n\nIn Mitchell and Avery counties in western North Carolina, officials declared a flash flood emergency warning residents of “catastrophic flooding.”\n\nOfficials reported major flooding throughout both counties as rainfall in excess of 7 to 10 inches closed roads, flooded bridges, inundated homes and businesses. Water rescues were ongoing throughout the region, according to the weather service.\n\n“This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW! Life threatening flash flooding of low water crossings, small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses,” said the weather service in nearby South Carolina.\n\nNational weather radar\n\nFlorida boaters ride out Hurricane Helene\n\nAs Helene pummeled northwest Florida with over 100 mph winds and surges of water several feet high, Philip Tooke managed to punch out a terse but frantic message from his phone as he sat riding out the storm – not in his house, but on his boat.\n\n“Lost power,” he wrote from St. Mark’s, 30 miles south of Tallahassee and 20 miles away from where Hurricane Helene hit the mouth of the Aucilla River. But, he adds: \"Still floating.\"\n\nTooke, the 63-year-old owner of a local seafood market, and his brother remained aboard their fishing boats as Helene lashed the area. The pair are among the Floridians who took to the water for their survival. They did so despite evacuation orders made ahead of the Category 4 hurricane and grisly warnings that foretold death for those who stayed.\n\nRead the full story here:Floridians ride out Hurricane Helene\n\n– Michael Loria, Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY\n\nHead of FEMA to take first-hand look at Helene impacts\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will visit Florida on Friday to assess the impacts of the storm and report back to Biden.\n\nCriswell said she would fly as close as she could to Tallahassee and meet with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his team. The FEMA leader said she would like to take an aerial tour if possible so she can see the damage for herself.

For the latest news on the storm, read USA TODAY's live updates for Friday, Sept. 27.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Hurricane Helene made landfall Thursday night carrying catastrophic 140 mph winds as the first known Category 4 storm to hit Florida’s Big Bend region since records began in 1851.\n\nHelene made landfall at about 11:10 p.m. ET near Perry, Florida. Hours later, the system weakened to a Category 1 storm and continued to produce hurricane-force winds as it moved toward Georgia.\n\nBy 3 a.m. ET, the National Hurricane Center said Helene had sustained winds of 80 mph. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee said further weakening is expected as the storm moves inland.\n\nAt least one fatality in Florida was blamed on the hurricane so far, authorities said. Officials feared more fatalities would be discovered on Friday, though it would likely be several hours before any rescue personnel could head out to help those in need.\n\nThe storm has already forced closures of schools, airports, and roadways across Florida after Helene rapidly intensified within hours Thursday as it moved through the Gulf of Mexico. More than 70,000 people across four counties – Franklin, Taylor, Liberty and Wakulla – fled under mandatory evacuations as forecasters painted a grim picture of the potential destruction ahead.\n\n\"This will not be a survivable event for those in coastal or low lying areas,\" Wakulla County Sheriff Jared Miller said in a Facebook post. \"There has not been a storm of this magnitude to hit Wakulla in recorded history.\"\n\nForecasters warned that strong, damaging winds will \"penetrate well inland\" across the southeastern U.S. The hurricane center urged people to remain sheltered until Helene fully passed their area, warning that the center of a hurricane is deceptively calm, as hazardous winds rapidly intensify once the eye passes.\n\nHelene is expected to turn northwestward and slow down over the Tennessee Valley on Friday and Saturday. In anticipation of the storm’s sprawling impact, President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations ahead of Helene's landfall for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama to mobilize federal emergency management resources.\n\n“Helene is a very dangerous hurricane and could become a ‘once-in-a-generation storm’ across western South Carolina and North Carolina, as well as northern and eastern Georgia,” said AccuWeather senior director of forecasting operations Dan DePodwin.\n\nNews about our planet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Climate Point newsletter.\n\nHurricane Helene tracker:See projected path of 'catastrophic' storm as Florida braces\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp confirmed early Friday that two people died after a suspected tornado touched down in Wheeler County, about 88 miles southeast of Macon. Emergency management authorities in a neighboring county, Jeff Davis county, urged people to shelter-in-place due to high winds in the area.\n\n∎ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed one hurricane-related fatality late Thursday. A car driving on Interstate 4 in Tampa was hit with an overhead road sign.\n\n∎ Helene is the 4th U.S. landfalling hurricane of 2024. Only five other years on record have had four or more hurricane landfalls: 1886, 1909, 1985, 2005 and 2020.\n\n∎ Asheville, North Carolina, more than 400 miles from the landfall location, got 8.34 inches of rain over 26 hours from Wednesday until 4 p.m. Thursday, according to National Weather Service data. The estimated 1-in-1,000- year rainfall for 24 hours in that location is 7.25 inches.\n\n∎ The Florida Highway Patrol closed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which links St. Petersburg to Bradenton, after winds at the span reached 60 mph and conditions deteriorated.\n\n∎ Florida State and Florida A&M Universities canceled classes but opened their doors to students and Tallahassee residents. The American Red Cross was using FAMU’s Al Lawson Center on campus as a shelter open to the general public; FSU was opening a refugee facility at the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center on Thursday to registered students who live off-campus.\n\nHow much damage could Helene do?\n\nIt's too early yet for detailed damage reports from the counties that Helene ripped across. But the National Hurricane Center says Category 4 storms threaten well-built framed homes with \"severe\" damage, potentially losing both roofs and walls. Most trees are snapped or uprooted and power poles are downed.\n\n\"Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months,\" the hurricane center says of Cat 4 storms.\n\nMore than one million utility customers in Florida were without power by midnight, according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker. The number was expected to rise as Helene moved further inland.\n\nIn addition to hazardous winds, the system is expected to bring tornadoes, life-threatening storm surge and rainfall to large swaths of the Southeast, with widespread totals of 6 to 12 inches. Isolated areas could be deluged with 20 inches of rain.\n\nAt midnight in Tallahassee, the storm had significantly intensified, with sheets of rain gusting from the sky. Electricity service in some of the city flickered intermittently.\n\nRainfall was also lashing Georgia, South Carolina, central and western North Carolina and portions of Tennessee. Atlanta, hundreds of miles north of Florida's Big Bend, was under a tropical storm warning.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and the Carolinas have declared states of emergencies as the fast-moving storm barrels through the Florida coast.\n\n\"We will likely avoid the brunt of this storm, but it is still expected to bring flooding, high winds and isolated tornadoes,\" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. \"Take proper precautions and monitor local forecasts.\"\n\nIn central Georgia, local news outlets reported that two people were dead after a mobile home overturned in a suspected tornado Thursday.\n\n– Christopher Cann, Doyle Rice\n\nLearn more on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale and the dangers of storm surge.\n\n'They’ve got to get out': Some residents ignore evacuation order\n\nFor some people, even the threat of \"unsurvivable'' storm surge is not enough to convince them to leave their homes. A Florida official from Helene's projected path finds that quite frustrating.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, whose jurisdiction covers St. Petersburg and Clearwater, admonished residents who refuse to heed an evacuation order when he held a Thursday morning news conference as Helene zeroed in on Florida's northwest coast.\n\n“We’ve got a problem, and the problem is that way too many people in Zone A aren’t listening,” Gualtieri said. “We’ve been out there this morning, there’s just way too many people in the area.”\n\nA storm surge of 5-8 feet is predicted for the county, putting residents of barrier islands and low-lying coastal areas in danger.\n\n“They’ve got to get out,'' Gualtieri said, \"and there’s going to reach a point where you’re on your own because we’re not going to get our people killed because you don’t want to listen to what we’re saying.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nSheriff takes grim tack with evacuation holdouts\n\nIn Taylor County, Florida, where Helen’s storm surge is forecast to reach 15 to 20 feet high, the sheriff’s office posted a message Thursday morning for residents who weren’t heeding the county’s mandatory evacuation order.\n\n“If you or someone you know chose not to evacuate, PLEASE write your, Name, birthday and important information on your arm or leg in A PERMANENT MARKER so that you can be identified and family notified,” the message said. The post also asked residents staying behind to send an email to the office with their names, addresses, contact information and the number of people and pets at the location.\n\nThe small rural county on the state’s gulf coast was the site of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall in August 2023 and Hurricane Debby’s landfall in August.\n\nGene Taylor, a former public official in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, when Hurricane Katrina made landfall there in 2005, has another message he gives to people considering riding out a potentially deadly storm surge. “Have life jackets and an ax, in case they have to chop through the attic roof to get out.”\n\nMany people were rescued from rooftops when the water rose after Katrina and in other locations after severe flooding.\n\n− Dinah Pulver Voyles and Doyle Rice\n\nHead of FEMA to take first-hand look at storm impacts\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will visit Florida on Friday to assess the impacts of the storm and report back to Biden.\n\nCriswell said she would fly as close as she could to Tallahassee and meet with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his team. The FEMA leader said she would like to take an aerial tour if possible so she can see the damage for herself. Afterward, she is prepared to move up to Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, also expected to be heavily affected by Helene.\n\n\"Me being on the ground helps me validate some of the damage more quickly, so we can get major declarations in place faster,\" she told reporters at a White House briefing Thursday, adding the agency has the resources it needs to respond to this disaster.\n\nCriswell said FEMA has aggressively deployed resources in advance of Helene's arrival and advised those likely to be impacted to do the same, both in Florida and across inland locations far from the storm's landfall.

They're going to give you the best information that you can do for your specific situation. Those decisions can save lives.\"\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nDespite pleas from grown children, couple choose to stay\n\nAs the storm rolled closer to the coast, a small number of people in St. Marks made last-minute preparations amid steady rain and increasing wind.\n\nJohn and Melissa Hines, who own and operate the Sweet Magnolia Inn near the water’s edge, piled all of the furniture on their ground floor onto tables and moved a massaging armchair onto the landing. They were planning to stick around until the storm hit, then relocate to their son’s apartment about a mile up the road on higher ground.\n\nLegend has it their pre-WWII building was built using old railroad tracks from the line that used to serve the area, and it has withstood multiple hurricanes, John Hines said, though different storms have left their marks.\n\n“The building will remain. What we have to work with after remains to be seen,” he said Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe couple have four children, and the three who do not live nearby have been urging them to leave the area more quickly, Melissa Hines said. One of them, she said, even called their pastor in Ohio, who then reached out to add his encouragement.\n\n“Our faith is great,” Melissa Hines said, explaining why they aren’t seeking safety further from the storm. “Our pastor called and said, ‘Your kids are worried, you need to be wise. Stop being so stubborn.’ So we are going to leave but we’re going to stay close to home.”\n\nHelene could bring three times the rain it takes to cause landslides\n\nHelene is forecast to bring as much as 15 inches of rain to western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Mountains − well over the accepted threshold of 5 inches needed to trigger dangerous and potentially deadly landslides.\n\nAccording to Brad Johnson, environmental science professor at Davidson College north of Charlotte, \"Scientists established some thresholds in North Carolina in the wake of the 2004 Peeks Creek landslide, the deadliest in North Carolina in 60 years.\"\n\nThat slide, triggered by rains from Hurricane Ivan, killed five people. Johnson's group looked at weather data from that slide and found that 5 inches was roughly the threshold for landslides to occur, he said.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nManatees could be left stranded by Hurricane Helene\n\nFish, birds and other animals are all impacted differently by storms, depending on their habitat, food sources and other factors, wildlife experts told USA TODAY.\n\nManatees may become stranded or injured by debris from Hurricane Helene. In years past, they have been discovered after hurricanes in a dry bay, in a golf course pond and a retention pond. However, larger sea creatures like sharks and whales have likely been able to swim away from Hurricane Helene quickly, according to the National Ocean Service.\n\nAfter Hurricane Idalia in 2023, flamingos from Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula ended up in the U.S., in places they had never been seen before, including Missouri and Kansas.\n\nWhen fish die during a hurricane, the most common reason is low oxygen levels in water that has been pushed up from the bottom and may contain lethal hydrogen sulfide. Also, if there are long stretches of cloudy days amid a storm, oxygen-producing organisms and plants can't photosynthesize, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nRiding it out on a fishing boat\n\nIn Saint Marks, 30 miles south of Tallahassee where two rivers meet before emptying into Apalachee Bay, a handful of residents and business owners watched the water rising by several inches every 30 minutes on Thursday. Stone crab fisherman Philip Tooke, 63, stood on the dock of his family owned Saint Mark’s Seafoods, watching the rain and for signs the wind direction was changing.\n\nHe’s had head-height floodwaters beneath his building several times over the years, but he's worried what a 15-foot storm surge would mean. He and his brother planned to ride out the storm aboard their fishing boats.\n\n“I feel sorry for them to the east, but if we don’t get that direct hit we’ll be OK,” Tooke said. “It ain’t got ‘bad bad’ yet. It will be by tonight. It’s not going to be pleasant down here.”\n\nFlights canceled, airports closed\n\nNearly 1,200 U.S. flights were canceled by early Thursday because of Hurricane Helene, according to FlightAware. Tampa International Airport, St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport and Tallahassee International Airport in Florida all announced they will be closed for the day, but the storm's impacts extend beyond its projected path. Airlines began offering travel waivers earlier this week so customers could reschedule their plans around the storm.\n\nAnyone whose flight was canceled is eligible for a refund under Department of Transportation rules. Federal laws do not require airlines to compensate travelers for delayed flights, but carriers have committed to various degrees of compensation for significant delays within their control.

Because some are staying through the storm, so will he. His church is fresh from a roof repair done Wednesday in preparation for Helene. Now, he says, it's ready to keep anyone dry who needs a place to stay as the hurricane bears down on their town.\n\n\"We're going to trust the Lord − no matter,\" Nawlin said. \"He didn't ask us to understand everything. Just trust.\"\n\nMost Florida schools cancel classes\n\nMost Florida schools were closed Thursday ahead of Hurricane Helene’s landfall, according to Florida Today, part of the USA TODAY Network. The Florida Department of Education issued a news release with a list of school closures, and the department said it’s working closely with districts to get them the resources they need to resume normal operations as soon as possible.\n\nThe University of Florida in Gainesville was closed Thursday, and Florida A&M University and the New College of Florida closed earlier this week, through Friday, according to the education department’s statement. At least 33 other colleges and universities are temporarily shutting down their campuses, according to the Florida Department of Education.\n\nDozens of school districts across the state are also closed, affecting K-12 students, as the entire state is blanketed in hurricane and tornado watches.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nFlooding begins along southwest, central Florida coast\n\nFloodwaters began to inundate roads along the central and southwest coast of Florida on Thursday morning. In communities including Fort Myers Beach, Sarasota, Venice, Bradenton and several in the Tampa Bay area, officials have announced road closures as heavy rain and storm surge lead to flooding along coastal and low-lying areas.\n\nSanibel city spokesman Eric Jackson, citing widespread flooding across the Lee County island, urged people not to drive on flooded streets. Molly McCollum, a meteorologist with the Weather Channel, captured video of fish swimming on a street in downtown Sarasota.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expects a surge of water several feet high to come ashore along most of the western coast of Florida, with the highest level – 15 to 20 feet – projected to wallop the panhandle and Big Bend coast.\n\n– Christopher Cann, USA TODAY; Dave Osborn, Naples Daily News; Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nCouple in their 80s decide to hunker down\n\nTaylor County Sheriff Sgt. Lee Harden's SUV pulled over Thursday at a home in the Steinhatchee coastal community, in the direct path of Hurricane Helene, after spotting a couple outside a home. Stan Ridgeway, 87, told the officer he's staying.\n\n\"I have to let you know ...\" Harden began, reciting the details about the expected surge. Ridgeway said he knew.\n\nLater, sitting in his living room, with his wife Jean, 81, Ridgeway said he bought his century-old house with its high elevation in mind. Floodwaters from Hurricane Idalia last year did not reach his home. Jean Ridgeway noted that this is the third hurricane since 2023.\n\n\"We didn't use to get hurricanes here,\" she said, then jokingly added: \"I think they discovered this place and they liked it.\"\n\nLesson learned, residents evacuate Horseshoe Beach\n\nHorseshoe Beach has become a ghost town ahead of Helene's anticipated landfall, the last few residents of the coastal community making final preparations before evacuating inland. The town was devastated by Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Aug. 30, 2023, causing major damage to the eastern Big Bend and Nature Coast. Now it faces the prospect of a 10- to 15-foot storm surge. Or worse.\n\n\"We're just trying to get the heck out,\" Judy Paradis said as she and her husband, John, loaded their cars.\n\nAfter last year's experience, residents took the evacuation orders seriously, Judy said. The Paradises had just made Horseshoe Beach their permanent home last year after vacationing in the coastal town for several years. They said they have \"survivor's guilt\" because their elevated condo was spared when so many people lost everything.\n\n\"We try not to complain because we still have our home,\" John said.\n\nFlorida power outage map:Track outages as Hurricane Helene approaches from Gulf of Mexico\n\nSandbox sand pressed into service as storm approaches\n\nEmergency shipments of hurricane supplies have been flowing in all week at the Home Depot in Town ‘n’ Country, a community of more than 85,000 residents bordering the northern shore of Tampa Bay. By Thursday morning, the store’s supply of filled 50-pound sandbags had dwindled from 16 pallets to 3½ pallets, store manager Erica Jarmon said. In fact, those remaining bags were filled with play sand intended for children’s sandboxes.\n\n“Some customers are even using bags of soil out in the garden department. Getting creative – whatever kind of barriers they can actually use,” Jarmon said, standing alongside her remaining sandbags. Other hurricane supplies: included generators, gas cans, flashlights, sump pumps, extension cords, blue tarps, plywood and more, Jarmon said.\n\n“Fans are another big one, especially for mold, mildew, just trying to get any wet walls dried faster,\" Jarmon said. \"Bleach is another big one after the fact.\"\n\n− Rick Neale, Florida Today\n\nLongtime resident listening to Helene warnings\n\nThe usually bustling Sea Hag Marina on Florida's targeted Big Bend coast was mostly deserted Thursday ahead of Helene. Bobbi Patterson, 85, was moving anything that could get soaked − rugs, chairs, a sofa − from her home on the Steinhatchee River to another one she owns across the street. Patterson planned to evacuate to a motel in Gainesville. Her daughter, Susan Merritt, 63, was helping.\n\nIn the 40 years Patterson has owned her riverfront bungalow, it's flooded twice. She said the media tends to overhype storms, but she's taking this one seriously. Still, she said she hates to think she and her daughter were hauling furniture across the street for nothing.\n\n\"It's pretty much stripped,\" she said of her home on the river. \"It better be something happens.\"\n\nKatrina survivors wary of Helene\n\nIf a house was built after 2004, according to Florida building code, it will be likely to withstand 115-mph winds. But if a home was built before 2004, Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie urged people to \"make decisions on solid information.\"\n\nWith catastrophic storm surge expected along Florida's coast, northern Gulf Coast residents Gene and Margaret Taylor understand better than anyone about the tragedy storm water can bring. As Hurricane Katrina approached in August 2005, the Taylor family fled their Gulf-front home in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, heading miles inland to his brother's home. The now-legendary hurricane pulverized their home and community with a record-breaking 28-foot-storm surge.\n\nGene Taylor first thought his bare street looked like it did \"when the French first arrived\" in Mississippi during the late 1600s. \"We could never have imagined the house would be gone,\" he recalled.

The National Weather Service has issued heat warnings and advisories from Southern California to Washington, Idaho and Wyoming as triple-digit temperatures are expected across multiple states.\n\nIn Southern California, the Hawarden Fire, just 4 miles south of downtown Riverside, began on Sunday afternoon and grew over 520 acres, forcing residents to leave their homes as the fire rapidly expanded. Three homes were destroyed in a roaring blaze that was captured on video by local news crews.\n\nRiverside Deputy Fire Chief Steve McKinster said at a news conference Monday that four other structures were damaged and that 1,500 homes are in the surrounding area. Damage assessments were set to begin Monday morning, he said. One firefighter has sustained a minor injury, McKinster said.\n\nAnother wildfire in Riverside County, the Eagle Fire, broke out on Sunday and spread across 1,600 acres, triggering evacuation orders that were eventually downgraded as firefighters were able to contain at least 50% of the blaze and stop its \"forward progress,\" according to Cal Fire. The blaze began in the city of Corona, about 18 miles southwest of Riverside. Several locations remained under evacuation warnings through Monday morning.\n\nIn Humboldt County, west of Redding, several areas were under evacuation orders as the Hill Fire burned over 5,580 acres since last Tuesday. The blaze, which has been contained by 7%, caused at least five injuries, according to Cal Fire. In Lake and Colusa counties, the Ridge Fire prompted officials to evacuate some residents as the flames spread across 2,500 acres since Saturday, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought the former Soviet states’ Europe-leaning cultures into sharp focus.\n\nHowever, the road to marriage equality in Estonia has not been a smooth one. When it comes to the rights of LGBTQ+ people, the Baltic states have often been “in Russia’s shadow”, said NBC News.\n\nEstonia is often heralded as a liberal nation, but it still remains “in the lower half of the ranking in legal protections for queer people”, according to LGBTQ+ advocacy group ILGA-Europe, the broadcaster added.\n\nWhile same-sex marriage is “legal in 19 European countries”, said BBC Newsround – with Estonia set to bring this to 20 – this is not the case “in central European countries which were once under communist rule and members of the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact alliance”, Reuters reported.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nCritics say Estonia is a nation rooted in its anti-LGBTQ+ past and struggling to move on from the Soviet era. Same-sex relationships were a criminal act, “punishable by up to ten years in prison”, until the law was revoked in May 1992, less than a year after the country declared independence from the collapsing Soviet Union.\n\nEven after this, same-sex couples were subject to discrimination, viewed as “second-class citizens” or “beaten up” due to their orientation, said Estonia World’s Sten Hankewitz.\n\nThis reputation has been difficult for Estonia to shrug off, and there remains resistance to same-sex marriage from some factions of Estonian society, namely those with religious or socially conservative views.\n\nIn May, a conservative think tank backed by 59 public figures asked “the parliament not to change the concept of marriage”, ERR News reported. The petitioners suggested “there is no overriding support for such a change”.\n\nThe Estonian Orthodox Church condemned the decision, saying that “those who claim they are championing ‘freedom and love’ are in fact destroying it”, said Orthodox Christianity.\n\nThe tension does not only apply in Estonia. Its Baltic neighbours Latvia and Lithuania also have same-sex partnership bills currently stuck in their parliaments.\n\nThere has also been backlash across Europe regarding same-sex partnerships, marriage and families. Under Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government in Italy a “crackdown” is taking place, The Times reported. Lesbian mothers raising families in the country “risk being erased from official records and ordered to change the surnames of their children”, said the newspaper.\n\nPoland remains “the worst country to be gay in the EU”, Politico added, “behind Romania and Bulgaria” in the latest ILGA-Europe rankings for rights.\n\nCloser to Estonia, Russia is notorious for its anti-LGBTQ+ stance, and has recently expanded a so-called “gay propaganda law” in place since 2013, which “outlaws all mention of LGBTIQ-related topics in the media”, said openDemocracy.\n\nSome have suggested the latest law change in Estonia could be a reaction to developments in Russia. Social Democrat MP Eduard Odinets said: “Same-sex marriage makes it clear to the Russians that we are not on their side,” CNE News reported.\n\nMore than half (53%) of Estonians support same-sex marriage, according to a recent report from the Estonian Human Rights Centre. This is 6 percentage points higher than it was in 2021, while only 34% of Estonians supported marriage equality in 2012.\n\n“My message [to central European countries] is that it’s a difficult fight,” Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, told Reuters, “but marriage and love is something that you have to promote.”\n\n“It’s like the state is finally accepting me,” Annely Lepamaa, a 46-year-old lesbian, told Reuters. “Until now, I needed to fight for everything.

They are among the couples who had filed lawsuits earlier this year challenging the state law than bans same-sex marriage and the recognition of gay marriages conducted legally in other states.\n\nA three-judge panel from the federal appeals court in Chicago ordered the unique recognition for the Munster couple a day after it announced plans to expedite the appeal of U.S. District Judge Richard Young's ruling last week that found Indiana's ban unconstitutional.\n\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor who has been tracking same-sex marriage legal cases across the country, said this is the first case he is aware of in which a federal appeals court has ordered a state to recognize the marriage of a gay couple while an appeal is pending.\n\nSince December, federal judges have struck down laws similar to Indiana's ban in more than 10 other states, and those cases are now being appealed.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Sandler and Quasney have had the distinction of being the only gay couple in Indiana to have their marriage legally acknowledged by the state.\n\nIn April, Young issued an emergency order requiring the state to recognize the couple's marriage last year in Massachusetts. But that recognition ended late Friday, when a panel from the 7th Circuit ordered a stay of Young's ruling last week while the state appeals his decision.\n\n\"It is time for the state of Indiana to leave Niki and Amy in peace and not subject them and their marriage to any more stress and uncertainty as this case proceeds,\" said Paul D. Castillo, staff attorney for Lambda Legal, a national gay-rights legal firm that represented the couple in its lawsuit against the state.\n\n\"We're thrilled that the court ruled in favor of this family as Niki battles stage four ovarian cancer. We will continue to fight until no family in Indiana needs to worry about their marriage being stripped away from them and all Hoosiers have the freedom to marry.\"\n\nThe couple had argued that lack of recognition for their marriage would endanger Sandler's ability to collect Social Security and other death benefits. Quasney was diagnosed with ovarian cancer five years ago and has since gone through chemotherapy. The couple's two daughters, ages 1 and 3, are Sandler's biological children.\n\nSandler told The Indianapolis Star that she and Quasney were pleased with Tuesday's ruling but wish it applied to all same-sex couples.\n\n\"It means a lot to Niki and I that the panel of judges took the time to read about — carefully read about — our situation and realize that our marriage doesn't harm anybody in the state of Indiana,\" Sandler said.\n\n\"Protecting our marriage helps us, but also, we're only one family in Indiana. There are other families that are facing hardships just like us, and we're looking forward to the day when everyone has their marriage recognized in the state.\"\n\nAttorneys from Lambda Legal had filed a request Monday seeking an emergency order granting the couple recognition. A spokeswoman criticized Attorney General Greg Zoeller, who is leading Indiana's push to overturn Young's ruling.\n\n\"Attorney General Zoeller's callous disregard for this family's circumstances is heartless, cruel, and unbecoming of a public official charged with representing the interests of all Hoosiers,\" Camilla Taylor said. \"He is taking steps that no other attorney general anywhere in the country has in fighting to deny respect to the marriage of only one couple facing very significant health issues.\"\n\nZoeller's office issued a statement Tuesday indicating he sympathized with the couple and wished there was some wiggle room under the law to help them.\n\n\"The state has extensively researched this matter and sincerely wishes it found a provision within our state's statutes that would allow for some extraordinary relief or humanitarian exception to the rule of law that would grant what petitioners request,\" Zoeller said. \"If this court can find an exception that would apply, this circumstance surely warrants its use.\"\n\nSpokeswoman Staci Schneider said the attorney general's office respects the court's ruling in this matter and would have no further comment at this time.\n\nThe decision to expedite the appeal issued late Monday will speed up the process by about six weeks, with the final deadline for filing documents moved from Sept. 19 to Aug. 5.\n\nTobias, the law professor tracking same-sex marriage cases in federal courts across the U.S., said the appeals court order to grant recognition to Sandler and Quasney is not necessarily an indication of how the court will rule in the appeal.\n\n\"I thought they made a very persuasive argument,\" he said, \"but I guess I would not read too much into it. It seems like the just and fair result to this one couple involved. Even a judge who thought that a ban should be upheld might find an exception justified in this particular case.\"\n\nHe did say, however, that Judge Young's earlier order, which had granted recognition of their marriage, may have helped sway the appellate panel.\n\n\"Why deny it to them?\" he noted.\n\nThe appellate court's decision to expedite the case could be more significant, Tobias said.\n\nHe said the 7th Circuit will probably be the fourth appeals court to rule on the issue. That could put it in the mix with others for Supreme Court review.\n\n\"If the 7th Circuit were to issue (its opinion) after too many others or after too much time had passed, the opinion may miss out on being the one reviewed,\" he said.\n\nStar reporters Jill Disis and Kristine Guerra contributed to this story.

They viewed their vows as an important step toward not only formalizing a loving commitment but also finally achieving equal footing with other legally married couples.\n\nBut those newlyweds now find themselves front and center in a complicated and uncertain battle over just what their marriage means. And that equality they seek? It's not that simple.\n\nConsider:\n\n• The state's largest health insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, is advising some employers that they may — but don't have to — cover the same-sex spouses of their employees.\n\n• State revenue officials were still scrambling to determine the ruling's tax implications and whether the new couples would be covered.\n\n• Issues such as hospital visitation rights, death certificates and adoptions also may still depend on state or local interpretations of the law.\n\n• And newlyweds have reported problems at local Social Security offices when they attempted to do something that other married spouses take for granted: change their names.\n\nSteve Sanders, a law professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law in Bloomington, said same-sex couples who married, expecting to enjoy all the rights and privileges afforded to married male-female couples, could find themselves facing long waits or even having to return to court to sort out their rights and status.\n\nThat uncertainty moving forward is such that Sanders said he would advise same-sex couples against rushing to marry.\n\n\"I can sympathize, and I certainly understand the impulse,\" he said, \"but I personally think it's a mistake.\"\n\nThe status of those marriages and the validity of the licenses of other couples who had not yet been officially married was further clouded with the stay issued late Friday by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.\n\nThe stay, which was expected, halts any further same-sex weddings for now, and probably will continue to do so until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the various federal court opinions, including that by U.S. District Judge Richard Young last week. Young's ruling in Indiana mirrored others that contend state laws that deny or don't recognize same-sex marriages violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n'What do we do now?'\n\nBecoming legally married in Indiana is, in effect, a three-step process. First, a marriage license must be obtained. Then, a marriage ceremony must be performed by an officiant such as a clergy member, judge or certain municipal officials such as the clerk. The couple must then return their license — signed by the officiant — to the clerk to be recorded.\n\nThat process, coupled with the timing of the ruling and stay, has left many, including Vicki Gordon of Logansport and her partner, Kim Zeller, in a particular legal limbo.\n\nThey planned to marry in a ceremony Saturday. They obtained their marriage license Friday — legally in their minds and, at the time, the eyes of the law — but called off the wedding. She said they have other friends in the same position.\n\n\"We're all just wondering 'what the heck' and 'what do we do now?' \" Gordon said. \"I've done a lot of research online in the last day and I'm afraid if we go ahead that we and the person who officiates could be arrested or face a big fine.\"\n\nAlso potentially in limbo, those who obtained licenses issued before the stay, but that had not yet been returned and recorded by the clerk.\n\n\"We just don't know,\" said Angie Nussmeyer, spokeswoman for Marion County Clerk Beth White, who took an early lead in issuing licenses. \"We have attorneys looking into it and hope to know more next week.\"\n\nStill, given the myriad legal questions that have ensued in other states, many Hoosiers, such as Mickey Rogers, who married his husband, Mike Barclay, at the Marion County Clerk's office Wednesday, said they went into their new marriage expecting things to get complicated.\n\n\"Our plan is to wait it out and see what the courts do before we take any more major steps formalizing things,\" Rogers said. \"We'll wait for things to settle before pressing the issue. We're patient. We've waited 10 years and we can wait a little longer.\"\n\nKen Falk, legal director for the ACLU of Indiana, which brought one of the lawsuits that prompted Young's ruling, said there should be no question.\n\n\"Our position is that these couples were legally married at the time,\" he said, \"and that they are legally married now.\"\n\nBut the experiences of more than 1,500 gay couples who married between court rulings and stays in other states tell a different story.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said couples who were married before the stay was issued will find themselves in legal limbo that could linger for a year or more.\n\nBased on what has happened in Utah, Michigan and Wisconsin, where more than 1,500 couples wed before stays were issued, Tobias said the Indiana newlyweds are likely to receive federal benefits, such as Social Security and filing joint federal income tax returns.\n\nBut during the appeal, they are not likely to have their marriages recognized in Indiana. That could affect everything from state taxes and adoptions to hospital visitation rights and death certificates.\n\n\"Until the legal question is finally settled, we really don't know what their status will be,\" Tobias said. \"We've seen all these people getting married and hoping things will work out, and they probably will, but we just don't know that yet.\"\n\nStays in other states\n\nIt will likely require a determination from the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the contentious legal debate over same-sex marriage, and that action could be a year or more away.\n\nIn California, the marriages of gay couples who wed in 2008 — after the state Supreme Court struck down a state ban as unconstitutional and before voters passed a referendum that temporarily stopped the marriages — were still recognized as valid by the state.\n\nBut that is the exception. In more recent cases, states have denied benefits to couples married during short windows before appeals were filed.\n\nIn Michigan, about 300 gay couples were married after a federal judge struck down that state's ban on same-sex marriage in March, said Rana Elmir, deputy director of the ACLU of Michigan.\n\nBut days later, after a stay was granted, Elmir said the couples had their hopes and joys dashed. The governor announced that, while their marriages were legal, they would not be recognized for the purposes of state benefits.\n\nThe ACLU filed a federal lawsuit in April seeking to force the state to fully recognize those marriages. Because of the governor's refusal, Elmir said, the families are precluded from enjoying the many benefits of marriage in Michigan, including providing health insurance to spouses, jointly adopting children and ensuring the financial stability of their families.\n\n\"What we're saying is the state is obliged to extend the protections of marriage to these couples,\" she explained. \"The state can't just say these marriages are void and treat these couples like they are second-class citizens.\"\n\nClint McCormack and his husband, Bryan Reamer, are among the eight Michigan couples named in the ACLU lawsuit.\n\n\"For three hours it felt great to be married and on equal ground with straight couples,\" he said. \"We knew immediately that we would get married if given the opportunity in order to protect our children. Now, it's like they've pulled the rug out from under us.\"\n\nMcCormack, who is raising 13 children with his husband, said the state's refusal to recognize their marriage has been hardest on their children. He said it has been particularly devastating to the four they are raising as their own, but legally have been adopted by just one parent. The opportunity to have both spouses listed as parents on adoption records was one of the motivating factors in their decision to rush to the altar after the Michigan ban was struck down.\n\n\"To put children through this kind of stress is inexcusable and unforgivable,\" he said. \"How do I explain that our family isn't recognized to my 5-year-old? Or my 8-year-old?\"\n\nIn Utah, where about 1,300 couples married in late December and early January, the state has refused to acknowledge their marriages for all purposes but income tax calculations, said John Mejia, legal director for the ACLU of Utah. He said the state taxing authority found that the couples who were legally married on Dec. 31, which was before the stay was issued, could file joint state tax returns.\n\nMejia said he has heard a few complaints about the Utah couples accessing federal benefits. One involved the Social Security office refusing to change a name because it was a same-sex marriage — a complaint similar to one made last week to the office of Indiana Congressman Andre Carson, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Wagner.\n\n\"To these families, every day of waiting is another day of their rights being denied,\" Mejia said. \"They can't get birth certificates. There are questions about hospital visitation and retirement benefits. This isn't some hypothetical legal discussion. These are everyday issues faced by all families and, without clear action, it really does have an impact on their lives every day.\"\n\nEmployers uncertain\n\nIn the wake of the marriages in Indiana, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest private insurer, issued guidance to employers on Thursday that said same-sex spouses are eligible to be added to a subscriber's policy. \"However, due to federal law we believe that employers may determine, based on the terms of their group health plans, whether to recognize same-sex spouses. Anthem will follow their directive accordingly,\" the statement said.\n\nTony Felts, an Anthem spokesman, said the statement applied to self-insured plans, which make up about two-thirds of Anthem's accounts. Federal rules require fully insured plans to treat same-sex spouses the same as opposite-sex spouses, he said.\n\nThe statement from Anthem came as a shock to Mike Moffatt of the Indianapolis office of Littler Mendelson, the nation's largest employment and labor law firm.\n\n\"I've not seen or read anything that would support that conclusion,\" he said. \"To me, it's a gray area.\"\n\nHe's advising clients that provide spousal benefits to include same-sex spouses.\n\n\"Employers need to look at it as a cost-benefit analysis rather than a legal issue,\" he said. \"How many employees would this impact for an employer? My guess is, very few. Then you ask, what's it going to cost to add a couple people to my medical plan versus the cost of litigation in an area that's gray and that I may lose?\"\n\nKaty Stowers, an advisor and general counsel at First Person, an Indianapolis benefits consulting firm, said employers also have to take into account other factors such as employee morale, recruitment and retention.\n\nShe doesn't expect many businesses to object to same-sex spousal benefits on moral grounds. But many that now exclude same-sex spouses, she said, are likely to wait to change their requirements until the next open enrollment period.\n\n\"With the uncertainty around 'Is this going to stand?' a lot of employers are considering just taking a wait-and-see approach, rather than making a mid-year change,\" she said. \"The way we're interpreting it at this point is that this ruling doesn't require an immediate change.\"\n\nBob Dittmer, a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Revenue, said Friday that staff were working to review all department policies and procedures \"to fully comply with the court's order.\" But that was before the stay. How the department will now proceed was unclear Saturday.\n\nCouples persevere\n\nStill, many Indiana gay couples who made the historic plunge last week went into their marriages knowing of the potential pitfalls — and for reasons other than insurance or other benefits.\n\n\"We're going into this with eyes wide open,\" said Michael Jacobs, 53, who was standing in line to get a marriage certificate at the Marion County clerk's office on Friday with his partner, Chuck Bruce.\n\nBruce, 52, said they could handle the delayed state tax benefits and other lack of equal footing with straight couples. It's the attitude behind the inequality, he said, that really bothers them.\n\n\"(A stay) would be stating in some way that what we're doing is not right,\" he said, \"and I do have an issue with that.\"\n\nKathy Coffee, 49, said she and her partner, Marti Sayre, 54, held a commitment ceremony nearly 12 years ago. \"That's when we were married in our hearts,\" she explained. \"Today is when we were legally married. Our love is going to continue to last.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possible impact of a stay, she confessed, \"We're somewhat ignorant about that. This is all new to us.\"\n\n\"Financially I know it will make a difference federally and I hope it will at the state level, too,\" she said.\n\n\"But emotionally,\" Sayre added, \"it won't change a thing.\"\n\nCall Star reporter Tony Cook at (317) 444-6081.

It was not clear how many foreign diplomats and U.N. employees with pending U.S. posts will be affected by the policy change.\n\nTwelve percent of the 193 U.N. member states represented in New York allow same-sex marriage, according to Samantha Power, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who served under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Trump administration said the new policy is more consistent with the Supreme Court ruling in 2015 that legalized same-sex marriage. The heterosexual partners of foreign diplomats and U.N. employees are also not eligible for U.S. visas.\n\nCritics of the move argued the policy would create hardship for gay couples from countries that ban same-sex marriage or offer only civil unions. Those who marry in the USA to secure their visa status could face criminal proceedings once they return to their home nations.\n\n\"Those not yet in the country will need to show they’re married to secure a visa, potentially forcing those living in countries without marriage equality to choose between a posting at UN headquarters or family separation,\" Akshaya Kumar, deputy U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in a blog post.\n\nUN Globe, which advocates for non-discrimination of LGBTI staff at the United Nations and in its peacekeeping operations, said it was an \"unfortunate change in rules, since same-sex couples, unlike opposite-sex couples, have limited choices when it comes to marriage.\"\n\nPower, the former ambassador, described the policy in a tweet as \"needlessly cruel and bigoted.\" The State Department said the rule change would promote equal treatment. It said it recognized that not all countries permit same-sex marriage and it was prepared to work with individual cases to find a solution for those not able to marry.\n\nBut Diane Klein, a legal scholar at the University of La Verne who first wrote about the policy change in a blog post in July, said: \"What remains unclear, both to employees inside affected agencies, and to legal commentators from the outside, is whether visa holders who marry their partners in the U.S., but whose marriages would not be recognized by their home countries, will enjoy continuing access to these partner visas.\"\n\nOn Friday, nearly 120 House Democrats signed and sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressing him and the administration to reverse what they say is a discriminatory policy.\n\n“The United States must maintain its historical moral leadership on all human rights issues, including those affecting LGBTQI people,” wrote the lawmakers. “This policy sends the wrong message that the U.S. is not welcoming of all people.”\n\n“It also needlessly excludes UN personnel, and places an unnecessary burden on diplomats from countries that do not currently allow same-sex marriage. We urge the State Department to reconsider its decision,” the lawmakers added.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who was among the lawmakers to sign the letter, said it is “particularly offensive that [the administration] would dare announce this policy in the name of equality.”\n\n“Progress has been made in this country despite, not because of, this Administration,” he said. “Secretary Pompeo should swiftly reverse this decision and lift the burden on partners of foreign diplomats coming from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal.\"\n\nMore:Court: Korean-born girl must leave USA because she was adopted by her Kansas uncle a year too late", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2014/10/17/arizona-gay-marriage-ruling/17431229/", "title": "Arizona gay marriage legal; couples marry immediately", "text": "Alia Beard Rau and Mary Jo Pitzl\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John Sedwick rules Arizona%27s marriage ban unconstitional.\n\nAttorney General Tom Horne now must decide whether he will appeal.\n\nArizona is now among more than 30 states to allow same-sex couples to marry.\n\nArizona on Friday joined the historic tide legalizing the unions of same-sex couples that has swept the nation, expanding gay rights in a direction many never thought they would see in their lifetimes.\n\nTearful couples, some with children in tow, lined up at clerks' offices around the state to be among the first to get marriage licenses. Some brought along their clergy, hastily reciting their vows on courthouse steps. They had waited long enough, they said.\n\nAs rulings around the country have toppled laws banning same-sex couples from marrying, Arizona's law appeared doomed. A federal judge ruled Friday morning that Arizona's law banning gay marriages was unconstitutional, but it wasn't official until Attorney General Tom Horne announced a few hours later that he would not appeal.\n\nLegal experts say the fate of Arizona's law defining marriage as only between one man and one woman is now sealed. A ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court reinstating marriage bans is unlikely. The high court last week declined to take cases challenging laws in five states, in effect directing them to begin issuing licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\"I can't conceive of them overturning gay marriages that have now occurred all over the country,\" said attorney Dan Barr, one of the attorneys in a lawsuit challenging Arizona's law. \"The Supreme Court would not have done what they've done if that's what they were going to eventually do.\"\n\nHorne conceded the same during his news conference, saying the possibility of reversing a ruling last week from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals striking down marriage restrictions in two other states was \"zero,\" as is the likelihood of the Supreme Court taking up the case.\n\n\"I think this is over,\" he said.\n\nOpponents of gay marriage, including Gov. Jan Brewer and Catholic bishops, criticized the judge's decision.\n\nArizona was the 31st state in the nation to legalize marriage for same-sex couples.\n\nSimultaneous with his announcement, Horne sent letters to Arizona's 15 county clerks instructing them to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\"Effective immediately, the clerks of Arizona county Superior Courts cannot deny a marriage license to any otherwise eligible licensees on the grounds that the license permits a marriage between persons of the same sex,\" Horne wrote in his letter.\n\nMaricopa County clerks' offices quickly began issuing licenses to same-sex couples at all its locations. Some offices already had couples waiting in lobbies as Horne addressed the media, said Chris Kelly, deputy clerk of the Maricopa County Superior Court.\n\n\"We had been planning for several months,\" including seeking advice from officials in other states on their marriage-license transition, Kelly said.\n\nCouples can now choose the wording on their licenses from among the words \"bride,\" \"groom\" or \"spouse.\"\n\nPhoenix made city judges available to perform marriage ceremonies in Mayor Greg Stanton's conference room Friday afternoon. Stanton passed out banana butter cream cake to the newlyweds.\n\nBy day's end, officials at the Maricopa County Clerk's Office estimated that they had issued nearly double the daily average of 77 marriage licenses. Figures for Arizona's 14 other counties weren't available.\n\nAmong the first to legalize their relationship were Karen Bailey and Nelda Majors of Scottsdale, who were plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits challenging Arizona's law. They've been together for nearly 57 years and for years felt they had to hide their relationship, even from the children they raised.\n\n\"I have no words to express how I feel. It's wonderful,\" Majors, 76, said as the couple emerged from the clerk's office.\n\nShawn Aiken, one of the attorneys in the two Arizona lawsuits challenging Arizona's ban, also celebrated Friday morning's historic developments.\n\n\"These couples from across Arizona bravely stood for equality for themselves, their families and over 21,000 other gay and lesbian couples living in Arizona today,\" he said in a statement. \"Allowing my clients to marry causes no harm to heterosexual married couples or anyone else.\"\n\nThe Rev. Eric Ledermann, pastor at University Presbyterian Church in Tempe, who attended Horne's news conference, headed immediately to the San Tan and San Marcos courthouses in Chandler to preside over marriages.\n\nLedermann said Horne \"lost with dignity.\"\n\n\"I never thought this day would come,\" Ledermann said. \"I'm fairly new to Arizona, and my impression is that Arizona doesn't jump onto these bandwagons quickly. I just didn't think it would come — I didn't think we'd be able to move this quickly.\"\n\nOthers celebrated but said a court ruling would not eliminate discrimination and prejudice in their lives overnight.\n\nThe first same-sex couple to get a marriage license Friday at the Maricopa County San Tan Justice Court in Chandler said they had to hide their names for fear of job discrimination. \"I feel bad because we're so proud, but we can't take any chances,\" one of the women said.\n\n\"I'd like people to know how much it means to now have our relationship recognized the same as everyone else's,\" she said, pausing as she started to weep. \"It's not about the gender of the person, it's about who you love.\"\n\nLawsuits challenging Arizona's ban have been moving through the legal process for nearly a year, but developments over the past two weeks brought the issue to a swift conclusion.\n\nEarly last week, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the five cases from other states. A day later, the 9th Circuit declared laws banning same-sex couples from marrying in Idaho and Nevada violated couples' rights to equal protection under the 14th Amendment.\n\nArizona is part of the San Francisco-based circuit. But before conceding that the ruling applied to the state's marriage law, Horne sought an opinion from the Arizona federal court judge overseeing two lawsuits specifically challenging it.\n\nEarly Friday morning, U.S. District Judge John Sedwick ruled that the 9th Circuit opinion did apply to Arizona.\n\nIn deciding not to appeal Sedwick's decision, Horne on Friday cited a legal rule that says it is unethical to file appeals simply to delay a court proceeding.\n\n\"I believe this (gay marriage) should be a decision of the people, not of the judiciary,\" he said. But pursuing further appeals would be futile, he said.\n\nBut, he said, Arizona's fight to protect voters' decision in 2008 to define marriage as between one man and one woman had been worth it.\n\n\"I fought a good fight,\" he said.\n\nWhile Horne oversaw the defense of Arizona's law, the Christian legal defense group Alliance Defending Freedom represented the state in court for free.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom has become the legal muscle defending much of the conservative legislation pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, including the traditional definition of marriage.\n\nOver the past decade, the National Christian Charitable Foundation has given more than $1.5 million to the Center for Arizona Policy and $31 million to Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nThe foundation's donors are anonymous, but records have shown they've included executives connected to Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby, both of which have taken positions against same-sex couples marrying.\n\nWhile many celebrated, supporters of Arizona's marriage law expressed disappointment.\n\nArizona's Catholic bishops issued a statement saying the court's decision \"reflects a misunderstanding of the institution of marriage.\"\n\n\"As Catholic bishops, we remain committed to affirming the truth about marriage and its goodness for all of society,\" they said in a statement. \"It is our fervent hope that the Supreme Court will eventually reconsider the issue of marriage in the future.\"\n\nBrewer, whose staff consulted with Horne in recent days, issued a statement before he made his announcement. The governor, a vocal advocate of traditional marriages, said that with its decision, the court was eroding the people's power and overstepping its boundaries. Brewer noted that Arizona voters in 2008 approved a state constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman.\n\n\"Now, with their rulings, the federal courts have again thwarted the will of the people and further eroded the authority of states to regulate and uphold our laws,\" Brewer's statement said.\n\nCenter for Arizona Policy President Cathi Herrod, whose organization has been the ban's most vocal defender, said she was grieving.\n\n\"I am heartbroken for a country and a state that has had the redefinition of marriage forced upon them by an out-of-control federal judiciary,\" Herrod said in a statement. \"Today, we grieve. We grieve for the children who now have no chance of growing up with a mom and a dad. We mourn the loss of a culture and its ethical foundation. We mourn a culture that continues to turn its back on timeless principles.\"\n\nRepublic reporters Mary Jo Pitzl, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Anne Ryman and Dianna M.

But the judge emphasized that his ruling was specific to that couple, who had married July 11 in Maryland. One of the men has a fatal disease and wanted his partner to be buried next to him in the family's plot in a historic cemetery.\n\nBourke and De Leon, both now 55, wed in 2004 in a ceremony overlooking Niagara Falls. The couple already had been together for nearly two decades and met as students at the University of Kentucky. They already had two children.\n\nHaving children made the couple realize the limitations they faced because they weren't married.\n\nTo adopt their children, one had to be the official adoptive parent and the other a legal guardian.\n\nDe Leon, a database administrator at General Electric, became the adoptive parent. Bourke, an applications consultant at Humana, filed separate paperwork to become the children's legal guardian. They decided to marry in Canada to add another layer of legal protection for their 15-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl.\n\nThe suit is the first challenge to Kentucky law since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law blocking married same-sex couples from receiving the same benefits as heterosexual spouses, exactly one month ago.\n\n\"That was probably the most hopeful day we've had in our 31 years of being together,\" Bourke said.\n\nShannon Fauver and Dawn Elliott, law partners in Louisville, said the Supreme Court ruling also was encouraging and decided that someone should challenge Kentucky's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. So, the partners began looking for a couple to work with on a lawsuit and found De Leon and Bourke.\n\n\"We thought somebody should do it,\" Fauver said. \"It's our duty as lawyers to try to right wrongs when we see them.\"\n\nThe lawsuit narrowly seeks to have Kentucky recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere and offer those couples the same benefits available to all married couples in Kentucky. The suit does not seek to have gay marriages performed in the state, a step that she said likely would need a separate lawsuit.\n\nNews of the men's lawsuit gives hope to nurse Bridget Pitcock of Louisville, who recently married her partner in Maryland.\n\nWhile she said that she and her partner, Meg Hancock, have a marriage that federal authorities recognize, that \"still doesn't guarantee us a lot right now.\"\n\nPitcock said she and Hancock want the rights other married couples have, including being able to file taxes jointly.\n\nElliott said marriage would allow same-sex couples to protect their children if one partner lacks health insurance and prevent children from being removed from their home if something happened to the biological or legally recognized parent.\n\nChallenges to same-sex marriage bans have filed in recent weeks in Arkansas, New Mexico and Pennsylvania. The American Civil Liberties Union has said challenges also are expected in Hawaii, Michigan, Nevada and Virginia.\n\nKentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, state Attorney General Jack Conway and Jefferson County Clerk Bobbie Holsclaw are named as defendants in the suit. Officials at the Kentucky Attorney General's office and the governor's office said they have not seen the lawsuit but plan to review it.\n\n\"It's sad to see these people keep pushing this agenda because the state has spoken on this issue,\" said state Rep. Stan Lee, a Republican from Lexington, Ky., who has fought unsuccessfully to end partnership benefits for gays at Kentucky universities. \"If we live in a Christian nation, then we need to stand by the moral absolutes,\" including that marriage is determined by God to be between one man and one woman.\n\nMartin Cothran, a spokesman for the Family Foundation of Kentucky that backed the same-sex marriage ban, said the two men have \"a hard case to make.\"\n\nCothran noted that voters passed the amendment in 2004 by an overwhelming margin.\n\n\"We would oppose any effort to change what Kentuckians decided on that,\" he said.\n\nBourke is no stranger to challenging restrictions on gays and lesbians. In February he started an online petition urging the United Way to denounce the Boy Scouts' ban on gays as Scouts or leaders. It targeted the United Way because it is a major financial contributor to the Boy Scouts.\n\nBourke was an assistant scoutmaster for his son's Scout troop for several years until he was forced to resign after informing Scout leaders about his sexual orientation. His role had included coordinating and supervising camping trips and helping boys achieve merit badges.\n\nHis 15-year-old son, Isaiah, is close to becoming an Eagle Scout, he said.\n\nJessie Halladay also writes for The (Louisville, Ky.)

And that opinions have changed, and they will keep changing.\n\nThe trends are clear. The end of this story is as easy to predict as the conclusion of any Chicago Cubs season. It’s just too bad that we can’t skip to that ending, bypassing more months and years of political grandstanding, divisiveness and wasted energy?\n\nTo those insisting that Indiana continue to spend it resources, time and energy defending the state’s law prohibiting same-sex marriage, all I can do is quote a question often posed by the late Joan Rivers: Can we talk?\n\nCan I be blunt? Because while I know it’s hard to accept, here is the reality: It’s over.\n\nLet me repeat: it’s over. It is time to move on. It’s time to accept that same-sex marriage before long will be a legally accepted right, and a largely non-controversial one, here and elsewhere in this great country. Liberty and freedom, and the right to pursue happiness, will rule.\n\nIt’s time, Gov. Mike Pence, to remember that every day you get to lead this state is an honor, and with that honor comes a responsibility to make sure you are doing everything you can to address the state’s many challenges, from education to the economic struggles of so many Hoosiers. There’s simply no way to focus all of the state’s energy on those things when you and other leaders continue to push a divisive and losing social cause sends a message of unfairness to thousands of our fellow citizens.\n\nI’m not sure what else needs to happen to make clear where the story of gay marriage is heading, or where it already is.\n\nPolls have repeatedly told the tale: A growing acceptance of such marriages has emerged, and an even greater opposition to anti-gay laws and amendments has taken hold. Every year, new young voters enter the system, part of a generation that will make recent changes in voter opinion even more striking.\n\nCourt ruling after court ruling has struck down laws such as Indiana’s. Twenty-one rulings have come down in the past year, and the opponents of gay marriage have won all of one of them. As for Indiana’s law, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court was particularly blunt, almost mocking the state’s arguments by calling them “implausible.”\n\nEven in the conservative Indiana state legislature, there has been growing pushback to a proposed amendment that would put the state’s prohibition into the constitution. And business and education leaders in Indiana have begged lawmakers to move on, to stop making the job of luring and retaining smart young students and workers harder than it already is.\n\nAlthough only a few hundred same-sex Hoosier couples were able to marry earlier this summer, before a stay was put on a ruling that struck down Indiana’s law, same-sex marriage is already legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. More will join that list.\n\nStill, the governor and certain other leaders rushed to put out statements after this week’s court ruling that promised to extend this drama and to take it to the U.S. Supreme Court. That’s not surprising; they don’t seem to understand the reality of the situation.\n\nIt’s over.\n\nNo, as one man asked me on Twitter this week, that doesn’t mean anyone has to forfeit his or her principles, views, ideals or opinions. That doesn’t mean anyone has to do anything — other than accept that while this long and tortured debate will continue to work its way through courtrooms and legislatures, the old days, the old laws and the old public opinion poll results aren’t coming back.\n\nAnd while that is a great thing, it would be nice to see it convince those state leaders fighting a losing cause to put their energies to better use. It’s over. Let’s move on.\n\nYou can reach me at matthew.tully@indystar.com or at Twitter.com/matthewltully.​", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/05"}]}

This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday New York's mayor has been indicted on federal criminal charges. Plus, we have the latest on Hurricane Helene and we discuss what Zelensky is pushing for when it comes to long-range missiles for Ukraine.\n\n♦\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted on federal criminal charges according to multiple reports, after authorities raided the homes of his top aides and confidants earlier this month, in what appeared to be part of a major corruption investigation. The charges against Adams were unclear as the indictment remained sealed last night, the New York Times and Fox News reported, both citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The indictment is likely to be unsealed today when Adams may appear in court, according to the Times. Adams, in a video statement released yesterday, called the charges entirely false. The mayor's administration has been under federal scrutiny over the last year for a separate probe on possible illegal foreign donations from Turkish officials during Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign. The Times previously reported on Monday that federal prosecutors submitted grand jury subpoenas to City Hall, Adams, and his campaign in July, demanding information related to Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea, and Uzbekistan. In recent weeks, other top city officials have resigned amid multiple federal corruption investigations. Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned on September 12, a week after investigators from the US Attorney's office in Manhattan seized his mobile phones. Caban was among several of the mayor's aides and confidants who received federal search warrants earlier this month.\n\nHurricane Helene is predicted to reach Florida as a category four this evening. The storm reached hurricane status yesterday and was forecast to grow more powerful and dangerous before making landfall on the state's Gulf Coast. The National Hurricane Center warns that a catastrophic and deadly storm surge is likely along parts of Florida's Big Bend Coast, and the center said the storm's speed will likely allow it to penetrate inland across the southeast. Several Florida airports have closed today, including Tampa International, and several universities have canceled classes.\n\nYou can stay up on all the latest today and through the rest of the week with usatoday.com.\n\n♦\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is pressing Western allies for permission this week at the United Nations General Assembly to use US guided weapons to strike deep inside Russia. I spoke with USA TODAY Pentagon correspondent Tom Vanden Brook about what that might mean for the conflict in Ukraine, Russia, and beyond. Howdy, Tom, how are you today?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nTaylor, I'm good. Good to be here. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for helping on The Excerpt. So what exactly, Tom, is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pushing for this week at the United Nations General Assembly?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nHe's looking for permission to use missiles with a far longer range than he currently has so that he can strike deep inside Russia to help prevent some of these attacks that are devastating Ukrainian infrastructure in residential neighborhoods.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, really, how would this functionally shift Ukraine's strategy on the battlefield, Tom?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, it would allow Ukraine to hit deep inside Russia, which is a concern for Western allies because it's another of the red lines that Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn saying that if it's crossed, that it'll drag NATO nations into the war in Ukraine. So that's part of this issue with a big part of the consideration for Western allies, in particular the Biden administration.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo we'll talk about the US part of this equation in a second, but have we seen Ukraine push deeper into Russia previously during this conflict, send long-range missiles, and if so, how did that go?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nNot Western-supplied missiles, Taylor, they don't have the range currently with Western missiles to hit deep inside Russia. They can do it with their own home-built drones, but there are restrictions in what the US has put on weapons that it is sending to Ukraine as how far they can hit inside Russia, right along the border right now. And Western allies like Great Britain and France want to allow some of their weapons to go in deeper as well. But those weapons have guidance systems on them that are US-designed and made, and unless the US provides permission for that, they can't use those missiles for deep strikes as well.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nOn the US side of things, Tom, what are the calculations really for the Biden administration and the Pentagon on this decision?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nThere are a few different things. The main one obviously is that this would cross a red line and prompt Vladimir Putin to attack a NATO ally, and an attack on a NATO ally is an attack on all of them. So it could draw the US and the West into a much broader war that nobody wants to see. Secondarily to that, there just aren't that many of these missiles in US stockpiles. Number one, to make a difference on the battlefield for the Ukrainians, and then as well, we just can't draw down the stocks that we have here so that they're available for other contingencies, say in Taiwan, for instance. So those are some of the considerations that the White House and the Pentagon are considering right now.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd I think we're at what, two and a half years of this war at this point? What could be the broader downstream impacts going into next year and beyond of this decision for Ukraine and Russia and also, Tom, the United States?\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nWell, the hope if you're on the Ukrainian side is that this would be enough to prompt Russia to enter into negotiations that would allow Ukraine to recover some of the ground that it's lost to Russia. About 20% of Ukraine is now occupied by Russian troops. At the moment, it's a war of attrition, and the time is on Russia's side. If those missiles start striking deeper inside Russia, a senior US official told me, there would be a consideration perhaps on Putin's part to want to negotiate further because it would be bringing this war home to Russian citizens who haven't really seen it so far.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Tom Vanden Brook covers the Pentagon for USA TODAY. Thank you, Tom.\n\nTom Vanden Brook:\n\nThanks, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe US, France, and several allies called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border, while also expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza after discussions at the United Nations yesterday. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati has expressed hope that a ceasefire can be reached soon to end fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, but fighting continues. Israeli airstrikes overnight hit some 75 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including weapon storage facilities, the Israeli military said. In the latest deadly strike, at least 23 Syrians were killed when Israel hit a three-story building in the Lebanese town of Younine, the town's mayor told Reuters. Dozens of projectiles were fired from Lebanon, some of which were intercepted with the rest falling on open ground, said the Israeli military.\n\n♦\n\nUS officials and lawmakers yesterday said that Iran is trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump, as well as members of his former administration, and the current Biden administration, as payback for the killing of an Iranian general and other hardline policies. The comments came after Trump's disclosure earlier this week that he had been briefed by the office of the Director of National Intelligence about Iran's real and specific threats against him. Republican Senator Mike Rounds, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he hadn't seen any indication Iran had anything to do with two alleged assassination attempts against Trump. But he said he thinks there's clear evidence that Iran, \"Has made it clear that they intend to. If they could, they would try to assassinate the former president.\" Iran has denied trying to assassinate US officials, but the Justice Department has launched numerous investigations and prosecutions into such efforts, including into plots against former Trump National Security Adviser, John Bolton. US officials have been issuing public warnings about Iran's desire for vengeance since shortly after General Qasem Soleimani was killed.\n\n♦\n\nSeveral key election officials say they're prepared to certify 2024 presidential election results if county governments go rogue. I spoke with USA TODAY democracy reporter Erin Mansfield for more. Erin, thanks for hopping on today.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Erin, what do election officials say in these swing states about potentially suing counties over refusing to certify election results?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nIt has become a trend since 2020 that a lot of local officials, usually at the county level, will go rogue and decide that they don't want to approve election results for reasons that really aren't relevant to whether or not that vote should be certified or approved. And we've seen cases in other states where election officials have sued, for example, a Secretary of State suing a county saying, \"No, you have to do this.\" So I spoke with election officials in most of the swing states last week. The ones in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin generally said that they were prepared to sue a county that decided to stand in the way of election results.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you touched on this a bit Erin, but what really led up to this point? Why do officials say this might be necessary?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nSo what we've seen since 2020, that was the election that former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed was stolen from him, but we know factually President Joe Biden won. We have seen people, usually at the county level, who are supposed to do a very administrative task where they just sign off on election results, essentially comparing one column to another, making sure the numbers match. But what they have decided to do, and these arguments are often based in some sort of misinformation about the 2020 election, the one that Donald Trump talks about quite a bit. They say, \"No, we're not going to certify these.\" And it's an outgrowth of what happened on January 6th, 2021 when folks showed up to the capitol, some violently, trying to stop the certification of an election, or change it to be certified for another candidate, the one who lost. So what's happening is this battle has not actually ended, it's just moved down to the local level, it's in people's backyards.\n\nAnd so what states are saying is, \"Well, counties have to do what they're told. They don't get to just decide whether or not an election was valid based on some thoughts about maybe a voter role, or some guidance they didn't like from the state, that's not their place.\" So what's happening, and what has happened before, is states will bring counties to court so that the court can say, \"You have to do your job.\" Certifications will start November 6th, that's the day after the election. So it's something I'm keeping my eye on and it sounds like other people are keeping their eye on too. And they did confirm in several of these states that they will take someone to court if they have to make sure that the legitimate election is upheld.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you mentioned in the piece, Erin, lawsuits are not the only potential remedy here. What other options do state election officials have to ensure election results are certified properly?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nSo in Michigan, for example, the state can actually step in and certify if the county won't. So they don't even have to go to court, they just do it. That's actually true in Colorado as well, not a swing state, but a state that we've seen a similar movement related to fighting election certification. North Carolina has a different remedy, and in 2023, last year, the State Board of Elections actually stepped in and removed two members from a local board of elections, that was in Surrey County. So that's just a different remedy from the process that they were talking about in Pennsylvania and Arizona. But this was a question we wanted to ask up front to know what we might be able to expect. In Georgia, Secretary of State Raffensperger, he said that might not be necessary to actually engage with a county that doesn't certify, but he did say, \"At the end of the day, we'll make sure every county follows the law and follows the constitution.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nErin Mansfield covers democracy for USA TODAY. Thank you, Erin.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThere have now been not one but two assassination attempts on Donald Trump. Both candidates now speak behind bulletproof glass at outdoor events, and after falsely claiming that Haitian immigrants are eating pet dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, shooting and bomb threats have skyrocketed. Is incendiary campaign rhetoric to blame, or is political violence just the new normal here in America? Tune in right here after 4 P.M.

Hamas’ armed wing posted video purporting to show its fighters emerging from tunnels and firing rockets at Israeli tanks east of Gaza City.\n\nLess than a week after launching a modified ground incursion from three fronts, Israeli forces have made considerable headway. “We are located at the gates of Gaza City,” said Brig Gen. Itzik Cohen, commander of the 162nd Armored Division.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis intensified and the war's combined death toll reported by Palestinian and Israeli authorities climbed above 10,000, but in a rare peaceful development, Egypt allowed hundreds of foreign passport holders and dozens of seriously injured Palestinians trapped in Gaza to flee through the Rafah crossing.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said multiple Americans left Gaza and others are expected to follow suit in the coming days, but did not specify how many made it out. Department spokesman Matthew Miller said about 400 U.S. citizens are seeking to leave the territory, and along with their family members, the total trying to exit is close to 1,000.\n\n“We do expect to be able to get all our Americans out. It will take time,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “This was the first step.”\n\nContributing: Michael Collins\n\nDozens killed in Israeli airstrike:Hamas commander among the dead in Gaza\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Connectivity was gradually being restored after civilians in Gaza faced another major cut to communications and internet services, according to Paltel, the main telecommunications provider. Internet and communication services have been repeatedly interrupted in Gaza and humanitarian aid agencies have warned that blackouts severely disrupt their work.\n\n∎ After being interrupted by a protester calling for a cease-fire during a fundraiser in Minneapolis, President Joe Biden said there should be a humanitarian halt of the war. “I think we need a pause,” Biden said in response. “A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.”\n\n∎ Jordan, an important U.S. ally in the region, recalled its ambassador from Israel and told Israel’s ambassador to remain out of the country because of the war \"and the humanitarian catastrophe it is causing,” Deputy Prime Minister Ayman al-Safadi said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to travel to Jordan on Friday after first meeting with Israeli officials.\n\n∎ The government of Cyprus said it is working toward sending ships loaded with medical supplies, food and clothing to Gaza after its president, Nikos Christodoulides, got the OK on Tuesday during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n∎ U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “is appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza,” including the killing of Palestinians by Israeli airstrikes in the Jabaliya refugee camp Tuesday and Wednesday, his spokesman said.\n\n∎ The Palestinian death toll has reached 8,805, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 130 Palestinians have been killed, authorities there said. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, most of them civilians killed in the first hours of the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage, Israeli authorities say. About 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nInside an American family's fight:Family desperate to free their loved ones held hostage by Hamas\n\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency reports 70 staff members dead\n\nIn a report issued Wednesday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNWRA, said the number of its workers killed in Gaza rose to 70.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, three additional UNRWA staff have been killed, bringing the total to 70 UNRWA colleagues killed since 7 October,\" the report states.\n\nUNWRA also reported that more than 690,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in 149 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip. The agency reiterated that available aid remains insufficient and providing humanitarian assistance continues to be a challenge due to lack of fuel, ongoing bombardment, and widespread destruction of infrastructure.\n\nUNRWA’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, crossed into Gaza on Wednesday and met with Palestinians and aid groups. In a statement that followed, Lazzarini called for a humanitarian ceasefire and \"urgent\" fuel deliveries to Gaza.\n\n“Our calls are falling on deaf ears. A humanitarian ceasefire is long overdue,\" Lazzarini said. \"Without it, more people will be killed, those who are alive will endure further losses, and the once vibrant society will be in grief, forever.\"\n\nPalestinian dual nationals, the injured among Gaza escapees\n\nAmong those escaping Gaza through Egypt were 335 foreign passport holders, mostly Palestinian dual nationals but also some foreigners, according to Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority. In addition, 67 critically wounded Palestinians and their companions were evacuated for treatment, and some personnel from aid organizations got out as well, Abu Omar said.\n\nEgypt is concerned about taking in Palestinian refugees whom Israel might not allow back after the war, and also about a mass exodus from Gaza that could bring Hamas members and other extremists to its population. Egypt has supported Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007.\n\nMore than 2 million Palestinians remain trapped in Gaza, many exposed to the Israeli airstrikes that followed the brutal attack by Hamas militants on Israeli border communities Oct. 7.\n\n\"The situation in shelters remains critical, with very limited assistance available and no additional space to accommodate the increasing number of internally displaced people,\" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees said in a statement.\n\nThe UNRWA said more than 670,000 Palestinians living in about 150 UNWRA shelters across Gaza are \"facing deteriorating humanitarian conditions and health and protection risks.\" The organization itself is grappling with extreme danger, saying 70 of its workers have died in the war.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes target refugee camp for second day\n\nIsraeli airstrikes again hit apartment buildings in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a Hamas stronghold near Gaza City, causing an undetermined number of deaths and injuries, the Hamas-run government said. The Israeli military said it had \"significantly expanded\" ground operations in the area.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in a tweet it \"eliminated'' Muhammad A'sar, describing him as the chief of Hamas’ anti-tank missile unit in Gaza and the leader of attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians.\n\nWednesday's assault came a day after a flurry of Israeli airstrikes on Jabaliya caused dozens of casualties, flattened apartment buildings and killed what the Israeli military said was a Hamas commander and numerous militants who had established headquarters in the camp. The buildings tumbled when Hamas tunnels beneath them collapsed, Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Wednesday.\n\n\"These once again demonstrate how murderous terrorists use civilians as a ‘human shield,’ civilians whom we have called upon to evacuate for their own safety,\" Hagari said.\n\nThreats against Jews, Arabs and Muslims up since war started\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday's arrest of a Cornell University student for threatening Jewish students illustrated Justice Department coordination with local law enforcement to combat hate crimes.\n\nPatrick Dai, 21, of Pittsford, N.Y., was charged with posting threatening messages in an online discussion calling for the deaths of Jewish people. One post said “gonna shoot up 104 west,” referring to a dining hall that caters predominantly to Kosher diets located next to the Cornell Jewish Center.\n\nGarland noted a “significant increase in the volume and frequency” of threats against Jewish, Arab and Muslim communities nationwide since the start of the Israel-Hamas war Oct. 7.\n\n“As this arrest shows, we are focusing our efforts on confronting and disrupting illegal threats wherever they arise,” Garland said Wednesday at a Washington seminar for a program he initiated called “United Against Hate.” “The Justice Department has no tolerance for violence or unlawful threats of violence fueled by antisemitism or Islamophobia.”\n\nKristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, said reported hate crimes remain at the highest levels in more than a decade. Prosecuting the cases is a top priority, and more than 80 defendants have been charged since January 2021, she said.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nReporters Without Borders files war crimes complaints against both sides\n\nReporters Without Borders said Wednesday that it has filed a complaint for war crimes committed against some of the 34 journalists killed since the war began. The complaint includes eight Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza and one Israeli journalist in Israel. The group says the deaths justify an investigation by the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe complaint says the Palestinian journalists were killed − and two others wounded − in bombings of Gaza. The Israeli journalist was killed during Hamas’ attack in southern Israel the day the war began. Other deaths are still being investigated and could draw war crime complaints, the group said.\n\nThe group also cites the\" deliberate, total or partial, destruction\" of the newsrooms of more than 50 media outlets in Gaza.\n\nWhite House developing plan to combat Islamophobia\n\nThe Biden administration is developing a national strategy to combat Islamophobia amid skepticism from many Muslim Americans, the Associated Press reported, citing people briefed on the matter. AP said the the White House originally was expected to announce plans to develop the strategy last week but was delayed partly because of concerns from Muslim Americans that the administration lacked credibility given its zealous support of Israel.\n\nThe launch has been anticipated since the administration in May released a national strategy to combat antisemitism that made passing reference to countering hatred against Muslims.\n\nLebanon prime minister calls for five-day cease-fire\n\nNajib Mikati, leading Lebanon's paralyzed government, called Wednesday for a five-day cease-fire for humanitarian purposes as Hezbollah and Israeli troops continue to clash along Lebanon's border. Mikati, struggling to keep the war from expanding into his country, said the pause would accommodate prisoner exchanges and allow for talks aimed at ending the fighting.\n\n\"The decision to go to war today is in Israel's hands,\" Mikati said.\n\nIsrael, which has steadfastly rejected previous calls for a cease-fire, said Wednesday that its military had intercepted a surface-to-air missile launched from Lebanese territory toward an Israeli drone. In response, Israeli aircraft struck the \"origin of the missile launch, as well as the terrorists who carried out the launch,\" the military said.\n\nClashes on the Lebanon-Israel border have also wounded Lebanese civilians, according to human rights agencies.\n\nTwo Lebanese shepherds were injured Wednesday and are now missing, according to a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping force on the border. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said the Lebanese army had requested assistance from peacekeepers to evacuate two people near the border.\n\nThe Israeli army suspended fire to allow the Lebanese army and UNIFIL to search for the shepherds but Tenenti said they could not be found.\n\n“Due to the darkness and presence of land mines in the area, the search will have to resume in the morning,” Tenenti added.\n\nAnd human rights group Amnesty International said civilians in southern Lebanon have also been injured by Israeli forces using shells containing white phosphorus.\n\nHostage crisis brings war home to Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn resident Alana Zeitchik's life has been in turmoil since Oct. 7, when her mother called in a panic, worrying about the fate of six Jewish family members in Israel taken hostage by Hamas. Zeitchik’s days have been a mix of news and social media hits ever since. Trips to the United Nations. Meetings with lawmakers. Long-distance texts and voice messages to her family back in Israel desperately trying to find their relatives.\n\n\"I can't wrap my brain around it. My mind goes to like the worst torture film I've seen, so I just can't do it,\" said Zeitchik, 38.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/07/israel-netanyahu-says-at-war-as-hamas-palestinian-militants-launch-surprise-attack/71098144007/", "title": "Updates: Israel says it is 'at war' as Hamas launches surprise attack", "text": "Israel and Palestinian militants are at war after stunning and deadly surprise attacks by Hamas that coincided with a major Jewish holiday and the 50th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Yom Kippur war. It was one of the most significant attacks on Israel in decades, with militants infiltrating 22 towns and army bases by land, air and sea, on motorbikes and by parachutes and motorboats.\n\nHundreds of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed, and thousands more on both sides injured .Perhaps dozens of Israelis have been kidnapped in a dramatic and unprecedented move, setting off a panicked scramble among Israelis trying to track down their loved ones. The attacks are being referred to as Israel's 9/11.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of a long war ahead, and retaliatory military strikes were leveling building in Gaza, a Palestinian territory on the Mediterranean Sea controlled by the Palestinian military group Hamas. In Northern Israel, Israel and Hezbollah militants from Lebanon exchanged fire, signaling that the battle that started Saturday could evolve into a broader regional conflict.\n\nThe attack appears to have caught Israel off-guard on Simchat Torah, an important Jewish holiday filled with dancing and partying. It has also revived memories of the 1973 war, in which Israel’s enemies launched a surprise attack on Yom Kippur.\n\n\"We are at war, and we will win it,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIn Saturday afternoon remarks from the White House, President Joe Biden condemned the attacks, which involved dozens of gunmen and thousands of rockets. Biden pledged that U.S. support would not waver as Netanyahu promised a crushing response.\n\nBiden calls attacks on Israel 'appalling'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Hamas’ surprise assault on Israel was “appalling” and condemned the Palestinian militant group’s attacks on civilians as “unconscionable” in Saturday afternoon remarks in which he pledged that U.S. support would not waver.\n\n“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people. Full stop,” Biden said. “There's never a justification for terrorist attacks.”\n\nBiden’s remarks came after gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas infiltrated southern Israel, launching thousands of rockets overnight and into the morning.\n\nBiden reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel’s security in a call earlier on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Members of the president’s Cabinet were also in touch with their Israeli counterparts following the attack.\n\n“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage: the world is watching,” Biden said in remarks that appeared to refer to Iran.\n\nThe U.S. president said he had also spoken with King Abdullah II of Jordan on Saturday and U.S. members of Congress.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat is Simchat Torah? Religious holiday celebrations interrupted by attacks\n\nThe attack on Israel by Hamas forces coincided with the Jewish religious holiday Simchat Torah.\n\nSimchat Torah, which means \"the joy of the Torah,\" is “supposed to be a day of rejoicing when Jews celebrate completing the end of the Torah cycle and beginning again,\" said Ruth Franklin, a Jewish writer and a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature.\n\nSimchat Torah is part of the holiday Shemini Atzeret. In Israel, they are celebrated on the same day and often referred to interchangeably. For Jewish people outside Israel, Shemini Atzeret is usually a two-day celebration, with Simchat Torah occurring on the second day.\n\nAt one synagogue about 90 minutes north of the epicenter of the attacks, half the people celebrated and danced with the Torah while the other half arrived in their uniforms and left their neighborhoods to serve, said Yael Eckstein, president and CEO of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.\n\nShaya Lerner, director of Israel Affairs at the Anti-Defamation League, said many Jewish people let their guard down and celebrate on Simchat Torah.\n\n“I think there was an intentionality in having this attack because of the historic significance and it's a day of letting down your guard and celebrating the Jewish Torah and not being prepared for this sort of conflict,” Lerner said.\n\n- Jeanine Santucci and Krystal Nurse\n\nEmergency UN Security Council meeting called\n\nAs rockets and gunfire continue, world leaders will convene as soon as Sunday to address the latest conflict in Israel.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting at the behest of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said he was “shocked” over the attacks.\n\n“Brazil will spare no efforts to prevent the escalation of the conflict,” he said in a Saturday post to X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe Brazilian leader emphasized how the international community must, “work to immediately resume negotiations” that will lead to an economically viable Palestine which can coexist “peacefully with Israel within safe borders for both sides.”\n\nBrazil assumed the rotating presidency over the 15-nation Security Council this month, which gives it the authority to call such a meeting.\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nDeath toll rising\n\nAs the world digests what looks to be one of the widest attacks against Israel in almost a half-century, the death toll is rising.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, there were reports that more than 250 people have been killed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.\n\nAround 200 Palestinians have reportedly been killed in a combination of retaliatory shootouts or airstrikes, according to the Gazan Health Ministry.\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat is the Palestinian group Hamas?\n\nHamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, is a militant group that is also one of the two main Palestinian political parties. Its political arm governs more than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHamas, whose main power base is located in Gaza, has been designated a terrorist organization by dozens of countries, including the U.S., because it is committed to the destruction of Israel. It has used suicide bombings and rocket attacks against Israeli civilians as part of that aim.\n\nIt was founded by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization with ties to Egypt. Iran provides Hamas with financial, material and logistical support and it also cooperates with Hezbollah, another Iran-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group, based in Lebanon.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\n“A colossal intel failure … I’m stunned”\n\nMarc Polymeropoulos, a former longtime senior CIA operations officer on the Middle East and elsewhere, questioned how Israel, with its first-class intelligence-gathering network, could have missed signs of such an impending attack.\n\n“Israeli intel has sophisticated technology...that blankets the West Bank/Gaza,” Polymeropoulos said in reference to Israel’s human intelligence and signals intelligence networks. “It's their raison d'etre. How this happened – the colossal intel failure – is incomprehensible. Having worked with Israelis, plus time in West Bank and Gaza, I'm stunned.”\n\n“I'd add, what about the US IC? ....and Egyptian intelligence?,\" he said, referring to the U.S. intelligence community. Other Arab services? Jordanians, Saudis and Qataris?” Polymeropoulos asked on X. “Did absolutely ever(y) intel service in region miss this? So many questions.”\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nIsrael confirms civilians and hostages taken by Hamas\n\nHamas militants who crossed over the border into Israel early Saturday have taken civilians and soldiers as hostages, the Israeli military's top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirmed in a briefing with reporters. Hagari did not specify how many, though he did say some have been killed.\n\nIn the past, Palestinian militants have used Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips to secure the release of their own fighters held by Israel. In one notable case, that of the Israeli solider Gilad Shalit, Israel released more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to secure his freedom in 2011.\n\nShalit had been held for almost five years.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nMore:What was the Yom Kippur War? Why Saturday surprise attack on Israel is reminiscent of 1973\n\nWhat was the Yom Kippur War?\n\nThe Yom Kippur War of 1973 took place after Israel had expanded its territory increasing tensions with neighboring Arab states, according to American University. On Yom Kippur - or the Jewish holy day of atonement - Egyptian and Syrian forces launched a surprise attack against Israel.\n\nThe war lasted for three weeks and ended after the United Nations Security Council called for a ceasefire, according to Britannica.\n\n“For Israel, even though they controlled more territories than at the start of the war, it was nevertheless a major political defeat, and the country was reeling from the loss of life on a scale it had not experienced since 1948,” said Boaz Atzili, an associate professor at the school of international service at American University, in a news release.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore:On their nation's 75th anniversary, Israelis ask: Is this still a democracy?\n\nFormer US security officials decry attack, question whether Israel missed key warning signs\n\nFormer U.S. national security and counter-terrorism officials expressed shock at the scope of the assault, and the coordination it must have required. They also questioned whether it was a colossal intelligence failure by the Israel government.\n\n\"Today's attack by HAMAS on Israel is unprecedented given the scope and complexity of the operation into Israel. Rather than a single terrorist attack, this was a complex operation that involved commando teams and rocket attacks against multiple targets,” Javed Ali, a former senior U.S. counterterrorism official at the FBI, White House and National Security Council in the Trump administration, told USA TODAY.\n\n“As a result, it must have required deliberate planning over a long period of time, and could have involved coordination and operational support from Iran, which has long provided the group with weapons and money,” Ali said. “Lastly, given the broad nature of the operation, the fact that Israel appears to have lacked advance warning is surprising, given Israel's excellence in intelligence and domestic security.\"\n\nOthers were even more critical of Israel for missing signs of an impending assault.\n\n“To call this an intelligence failure is too simple. Every single piece of defense — air, land, water – failed. It is inexplicable to those of us who have worked with them or know their capacity,” tweeted Juliette Kayyem, a former top Department of Homeland Security official.\n\n“This attack is HUGE. Hostages taken. Civilians and soldiers mass executed. It could lead to a regional war,” tweeted Malcolm Nance, a former 36-year U.S. intelligence and counterterrorism official.\n\nThe attack could also raise questions about whether the U.S. government missed key warning signs.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nHow will protests affect Israel's ability to fight Hamas?\n\nThe Hamas attack on Israel comes as reservists in Israel's military have for months skipped training and taken part in protests over Israel leader Benjamin Netanyahu's attempt to force through controversial reforms to the country's justice system, including curbing the powers of its Supreme Court.\n\nIsrael relies on its reservists to train younger military personnel and to generally keep the country combat-ready in a neighborhood where it faces many security threats outside and inside its borders. And Israeli officials and members of its military and security establishment have previously expressed alarm that these protests could damage its ability to deal with a major security threat.\n\nHowever, leading members of reservist protests groups said Saturday they would be joining the fight.\n\n\"We call on anyone required to stand up for the defense of Israel immediately and without hesitation. At this moment, the most important thing is the security of our country's citizens,\" said Brother and Sisters in Arms, one such group, in a statement.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUS leaders condemn attack\n\nAcross the U.S. many elected officials waking up to Saturday's news denounced the actions by militants, who launched an early morning assault on southern Israel.\n\n“The cold-blooded massacre of innocent civilians being committed by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists is shocking, despicable, and an act of war,” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n“Israel has every right to defend its citizens and the United States must stand by our ally.”\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said Saturday morning he was “deeply saddened and alarmed” by reports coming out of Israel.\n\n“We must condemn terrorism in all its forms,” he said. “Praying for the victims of this disturbing violence and that peace may prevail.\"\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who was recently ousted as speaker of the House, called Israel the \"strongest ally in the Middle East\" for the U.S. in a social media post.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Israeli civilians are being slaughtered by Hamas terrorists,\" he said. \"We condemn these attacks, stand with our dear ally, Israel, and support its right to defend itself in this war.\"\n\n- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRelated:Israel's military reservists have transformed a political crisis into a security one\n\nWhat is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\n\nIt's one of the world's most enduring and intractable conflicts that connects to a century of competing claims to land, borders and rights in a region of deep historical and religious significance.\n\nThe United Nations in 1947 tried to divide the-then British Mandate of Palestine into separate Arab and Jewish states. A year later, when the state of Israel was created, the first Arab-Israeli War broke out. Ever since Israel's victory and following several other wars, Palestinians have gradually been displaced from territory that they also see as their rightful homeland.\n\nAs this displacement has happened, Palestinian militants groups have sprung up, sometimes joining but also sometimes in opposition to, Palestinian political groups.\n\nHamas, for example, has both a political and militant wing.\n\nToday, tensions between Israel and Palestinians have continued to simmer in East Jerusalem (which Palestinians claim as a future capital), the Gaza Strip (a Palestinian enclave on the Mediterranean Sea) and the West Bank (the main bulk of current-day Palestinian territory that is effectively controlled by Israel).\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\n'We understand that this is something big'\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought several wars since 2007. However, it is rare for its fighters to infiltrate Israel on this scale and this appears to be the biggest attack by Hamas on Israel in years.\n\nMillions of Israelis were seeking safety in bombers shelters and safe rooms. There were reports in Israeli media that Palestinian militants were holding Israelis captive in Ofakim, a southern town.\n\n\"We understand that this is something big,” Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli army spokesman, told reporters.\n\n- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhy is Hamas attacking Israel now?\n\nMohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, said that the start of what he called “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,” was in connection to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam.\n\nThe site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.\n\n“Enough is enough,” Deif, said in a recorded message, as he called on Palestinians from east Jerusalem to northern Israel to join the fight. “Today the people are regaining their revolution.”\n\n'With rockets we somehow feel safer'\n\nIn Nahal Oz, a kibbutz about 2.5 miles from Gaza, terrified residents who were huddled indoors said they could hear constant gunfire echoing off the buildings as firefights continued even hours after the initial attack.\n\n“With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” said Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter and mother of three in Nahal Oz.\n\nWorld reaction to Hamas attack\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron : \"I strongly condemn the current terrorist attacks against Israel. I express my full solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones.\"\n\n: \"I strongly condemn the current terrorist attacks against Israel.

For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our live updates file on the war for Wednesday, March 13.\n\nThe first humanitarian aid ship using a new maritime corridor departed Cyprus on Tuesday and headed to Gaza, where more than 2 million people face an increasing threat of starvation and reports of malnutrition-related deaths are rising, according to health officials and aid organizations.\n\nThe vessel, towing a barge with 200 tons of food collected by World Central Kitchen − a nonprofit founded by celebrity chef José Andrés − carries the first shipment of aid sent by sea to the war-torn territory since the war started. While its load of rice, flour and protein is not near enough to head off a famine, officials said many more ships will take the same journey in the coming days and weeks.\n\n\"The departure of the first ship is a sign of hope. We will work hard together for many more ships to follow,\" said Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. \"We will do everything in our power for aid to reach Palestinians.\"\n\nLast week, the EU, U.S. and other allies announced the maritime route from Cyprus, an island on the eastern Mediterranean Sea about 200 miles from Gaza. This first shipment, which was initially scheduled to depart Friday, is being transported by the Spanish nonprofit Open Arms. When it gets close to Gaza in about two days, two smaller vessels will tow the barge to a jetty being built by World Central Kitchen and distribute the food in the ravaged north, the group said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced during his State of the Union address that U.S. troops will construct a floating pier on the coast of Gaza that could deliver 2 million daily meals. A ship with equipment for the dock's construction left for Gaza over the weekend. U.S. officials have said it would take weeks and about 1,000 troops to build the structure.\n\nAcross the enclave, a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is on the brink of famine, according to the U.N. The food shortage and exorbitant prices for what's available are especially dire in the north amid Israel's restrictions on aid coming into Gaza. Over the last several weeks, more than two dozen people in the territory, including toddlers, have suffered malnutrition-related deaths, according to health officials.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The World Food Program said it delivered Tuesday enough food to Gaza City for 25,000 people, calling it the \"first successful convoy to the north since 20 February'' and calling for more direct entry points into the battered area.\n\n∎ Israel said it brought a six-truck convoy with humanitarian aid directly into northern Gaza on Tuesday evening as part of a pilot program to study the feasibility of providing more food to the region.\n\n∎ Nine people were killed and dozens injured when Israeli forces opened fire on crowds trying to get access to aid trucks in Gaza City's Kuwait Square, Reuters reported, citing Palestinian health officials.\n\n∎ Negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage deal remain stalled. Majed Al-Ansari, spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, said Tuesday an agreement is not close. CIA Director William Burns said in a House hearing \"there’s still the possibility'' of a deal, but many obstacles remain.\n\n∎ The Palestinian Red Crescent Society, an independent aid group, said in a statement Tuesday there's been a concerning rise in \"attacks and violations\" targeting its medical missions in the occupied West Bank. The group has documented about 446 \"violations,\" and 98 specifically targeted medical crews.\n\nDual U.S.-Israeli citizen was killed on Oct. 7, Israeli military says\n\nThe Israeli military on Tuesday said Itay Chen, a 19-year-old soldier with dual Israeli-American citizenship who was previously believed to be held hostage in Gaza, is dead.\n\nChen was killed Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza, where it is currently located, the Israeli military said. Chen served in the Israeli Army's 75th Battalion. He is survived by his parents and two brothers.\n\nIn an opinion article published in USA TODAY, Ruby Chen described his son as \"a fun-loving kid who loves playing basketball with his brothers.\" The elder Chen had met with U.S. officials including President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and called on them and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure the release of hostages, including his son.\n\nBiden said in a statement Tuesday he was \"devastated\" to learn of Itay Chen's death and said he will continue working to bring the remaining hostages home.\n\n\"Today, as we join Itay’s parents, brothers, and family in grieving this tragic loss, we keep this reminder close to our hearts,\" Biden said. \"And I reaffirm my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: we are with you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home.\"\n\nOn Monday, Ruby Chen said in a statement: \"Our hearts are broken. We loved him so much, and we would have done anything to bring him home alive,\" Haaretz reported.\n\nUS touts six-week truce, says it could become 'more enduring'\n\nThe White House is highlighting the possibility that the proposed six-week cease-fire may turn into a longer peaceful stretch as it tries to restart stalled negotiations for a truce between Israel and Hamas and the release of hostages.\n\nHamas leaders insist on a permanent cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, which Israel refuses as Netanyahu vows to crush the militant group. Israel has agreed to a 40-day truce and a 10-to-1 ratio in the release of Palestinian prisoners for 40 hostages held in Gaza, Reuters reported.\n\n\"A ceasefire is on the table today for six weeks, to be built on into something more enduring, if Hamas would simply release women, wounded and elderly,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Tuesday.\n\nNetanyahu maintains Israel will 'finish the job in Rafah'\n\nNetanyahu continues to reiterate his public position that Israel will bring its offensive against Hamas into the southern city of Rafah, although he hasn't provided a timeframe.\n\nThe beginning of Ramadan, once regarded as an unofficial deadline for the Rafah invasion, took place between Sunday and Monday without a major operation, to the relief of the estimated 1.4 million Palestinians sheltering in and around the border city.\n\n\"We will finish the job in Rafah while enabling the civilian population to get out of harm's way,\" Netanyahu told a conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee − a pro-Israel lobbying group − in a video address.\n\nThe U.S. and multiple aid organizations have strongly voiced their opposition to the invasion.\n\nIsrael strikes targets in northern Lebanon; at least 2 dead\n\nA pair of Israeli airstrikes hit targets deep in northern Lebanon on Tuesday, killing at least two people and injuring at least 20 others, the Associated Press reported, citing a Lebanese security official.\n\nThe strikes, which destroyed a warehouse, came after more than 100 rockets were fired toward northern Israel, the Israeli military said on X. Iran-backed Hezbollah militants and Israel have exchanged strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border since the war started, and they have escalated in death toll and damage, raising fears of a larger regional war. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it also hit two targets in Syria used by Hezbollah.\n\nOver 300 people have been killed in Lebanon since the war began, including 240 Hezbollah members, Al Jazeera reported. The Israeli military says about 20 people have been killed in attacks from Lebanon. The cross-border exchanges have led to evacuations on both sides: About 80,000 Israelis were evacuated from the north in the first weeks of the war, and about 90,000 people have fled southern Lebanon.\n\nU.S. intelligence report says Netanyahu's government may be in jeopardy\n\nAn annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community said Netanyahu and his far-right coalition may be \"in jeopardy\" after the war in Gaza.\n\n\"Distrust of Netanyahu’s ability to rule has deepened and broadened across the public from its already high levels before the war, and we expect large protests demanding his resignation and new elections,\" the report said. \"A different, more moderate government is a possibility.\"\n\nThe assessment put together by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence comes amid increasing friction between the Biden administration and Netanyahu on Israel's offensive and visions of a postwar Gaza. Netanyahu also faces cracks in Israel's leadership and dwindling popularity at home.\n\nEarlier this month, Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival on Israel's War Cabinet, met with U.S. officials in Washington without Netanyahu's authorization, leading the prime minister to rebuke him, according to the Associated Press. In polls released last month by Israeli news channels 12 and 13, Gantz's party led Netanyahu's Likud in Knesset seats if an election were to take place, Haaretz reported. Another recent poll found that a plurality of Israelis believe Netanyahu is intentionally delaying a hostage deal for political reasons.\n\nThe intelligence report also said Israel will probably face \"lingering armed resistance from Hamas for years to come, and the military will struggle to neutralize the group's underground infrastructure.\" Netanyahu, however, maintains that victory will come just weeks after an invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza. His government's stated goal in the war is the complete destruction of Hamas.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/07/history-of-israel-and-palestine-conflict-and-the-latest-hamas-attacks-war-in-gaza-in-maps/71098600007/", "title": "History of Israeli and Palestinian conflict and the latest conflict in ...", "text": "Intense fighting is raging in Israel and Gaza after Hamas militants launched thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrated Southern Israel. \"We are at war, and we will win it,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. The fight may be the worst since 2021, but it's part of a complex, bitter conflict that reaches back to the first world war.\n\nThe dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nBoth Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories and to the ancient city of Jerusalem, “one of the most bitterly contested cities on earth,” according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire controlled the region for about 400 years before its defeat, along with Germany, in World War I. Britain was given control of Palestine by the League of Nations in 1920, under an order called the British Mandate.\n\nIn 1917, the British government signaled its support for the establishment of a Jewish state in Israel with the Balfour Declaration.\n\nWhile the declaration stated support, it also said that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestinian territories, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.”\n\nJewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities during the interwar period and during World War II. By the end of the Holocaust, more than 6 million European Jews had been murdered, and many survivors were left stateless.\n\nAs the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.\n\nIn 1929, 67 Jews were killed in the Hebron massacre, part of Palestinian riots against Jewish immigration in Palestine.\n\nDisputed territory\n\nGaza: Also known as the Gaza Strip, it’s the home to about 2 million Palestinians, many of them displaced after leaving or being driven from Israel during the War of Independence.\n\nWest Bank: Smaller than Delaware, the West Bank is east of Israel. About 3 million Palestinians live there, most of them Muslim Arabs. The West Bank contains a number of Jewish holy sites, which are visited by thousands of pilgrims every year.\n\nEast Jerusalem: Jerusalem itself is a divided, disputed city. It was cut in two after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Israel controlled the western portion and Jordan controlled the east. Israel captured the entire city in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\nThough Jerusalem's ownership is disputed, Israeli officials claim it as the undivided capital of Israel. In 2017, the Trump administration moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital.\n\nHowever, most nations do not acknowledge Jerusalem as belonging to either Israelis or Palestinians.\n\nWho's fighting?\n\nHamas\n\nHamas is the largest Palestinian militant group and has fired rockets from Gaza at Israeli cities in the fighting.\n\nIt was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and hasand has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2006, then wresting militarily control from another leadership group in 2007. It's committed to the destruction of Israel and is considered a terrorist group by the U.S., the U.K. and other nations.\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces\n\nThe IDF is the combined armed forces of Israel, including army, navy and air force. It was established in 1948, two weeks after Israel declared itself a state.\n\nInternational community tries, fails to bring peace\n\n1947: The U.N. votes to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states and make Jerusalem an international city. Arabs reject the plan, which is later dropped.\n\n1948: After the British Mandate expires on May 14, the Jewish People's Council meets in Tel Aviv and establishes the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognizes the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later.\n\n1949: The Armistice Agreements is a U.N.-mediated attempt to bring peace to Palestine. Israel signs agreements with Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon to reach a formal peace treaty within six months, but the effort ultimately fails.\n\n1956: Egypt nationalizes the Suez Canal and bars Israeli ships from using it and the Straits of Tiran, another shipping route. Israel, aided by Britain and France, invades Egypt. The Soviet Union, an ally of Egypt, threatens nuclear retaliation, and the U.S. pressures British, French and Israeli forces to withdraw. The U.N. deploys a peacekeeping force.\n\n1964: The Palestine Liberation Organization, a group with the goal of uniting Arab groups and liberating the Palestinian territories through armed struggle, is formed in Egypt.\n\n1967: The Six-Day War grows out of the Suez Canal conflict. Egypt orders the U.N. force to leave, closes the Straits of Tiran to Israel again, and plans a secret attack against Israel.\n\nIn a preemptive strike, Israel attacks Egypt and later Jordan and Syria, capturing Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nShift in the state of Israel\n\n1973: The Yom Kippur War starts with Egypt and Syria attacking Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. The war is an attempt to reverse the defeat of the 1967 war.\n\nCaught unaware, the Israelis counterattack and win. The U.S. helps secure disengagement agreements from combatants, laying groundwork for future peace efforts.\n\n1979: The Camp David Accords, an Israeli-Egyptian peace deal, is set up by President Jimmy Carter and signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\n1979: Israel begins gradual withdrawal from the Sinai.\n\n1987: Palestinians stage the first of two uprisings, or intifadas, in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, using mass boycotts, civil disobedience and attacks on Israelis. More than 50 Israeli civilians are killed. The intifada lasts more than five years, ending in September 1993.\n\nThe Israeli military kills 1,070 Palestinians, including 237 children, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. Jewish settlers kill 54 Palestinians. The U.S. and the U.N. criticize Israel's use of lethal force.\n\n1991: In response to the intifada, the Madrid Conference, a historical gathering of all participants in the Arab-Israeli conflict, is chaired by the U.S. and Russia.\n\n1993: Oslo I, known as the Declaration of Principles, is signed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It establishes a timetable for a Middle East peace process.\n\n1995: Oslo II is signed, a second agreement in which the Palestine Liberation Organization recognizes the state of Israel and Israel allows Palestinians limited self-government in Gaza.\n\n2000: President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gather at the Camp David summit, a meeting intended to end hostilities. It ends without an agreement.\n\nPalestinians, frustrated over failures to create a Palestinian state, begin the second intifada in September, which lasts until February 2005.

The fighting ends on Jan. 18, 2009, with 1,440 Palestinians and 13 Israelis killed.\n\n2012: Israeli forces kill Ahmed Jabari, a Hamas military chief, in a missile strike. The strike is part of an Israeli operation to eliminate weapons and militants in Gaza. Hamas says the killing has \"opened the gates of hell.\"\n\n2014: Hamas kidnaps and kills three Israeli teens in the West Bank, igniting the Gaza War, in which rocket attacks and airstrikes kill 2,251 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. A senior Hamas leader praises the kidnapping and says it was intended to spark a new Palestinian uprising.\n\nThe war lasts 50 days and ends with a truce. A U.N. report says both sides may have committed war crimes, which Israel and Hamas dispute.\n\n2017: The Trump administration says it will move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, in effect an official U.S. recognition of Israel's claim to the city. The embassy is relocated in 2018.\n\n2018: Protests break out on the Gaza-Israeli border as the U.S. Embassy is relocated.

Palestinians and Jews begin attacking one another, and Israeli police raid the mosque on May 7.\n\nThe raid, on what's considered a holy Muslim site on one of the holiest nights of Ramadan, is viewed by Muslims as an insult.\n\nHamas and other militants fire rockets into Israel from Gaza on May 10. Israel counterattacks with airstrikes.\n\nA ceasefire went into effect on May 21. It lasted until June 16, when Hamas sent incendiary balloons – helium balloons or kites with flammable devices attached – across the Gaza border into Israel.\n\nThe devices caused 20 ground fires in fields near the border, according to the Israeli fire brigade. Hamas launched the devices after Israeli officials permitted ultranationalist demonstrators to march in Jerusalem.\n\n2022: In the spring and summer of 2022 Israel experienced a string of terrorist attacks that led it to take what it described as preemptive action, including airstrikes targeting senior commanders and weapons depots, against Iran-backed militant groups such as Islamic Jihad.\n\nAt least 44 Palestinians, including 15 children, were killed in three days of violence in August 2022.\n\n2023: In January too this year, Israel launched the first of two raids against the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, where it said Palestinian militants and activists were hiding out.\n\nThe second raid, in July 2023, saw Israel send about 1,000 soldiers, backed by drone strikes, to Jenin to demolish what it characterized as a militant \"command center.\"\n\nOctober 2023: In the biggest offensive in years, dozens of gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas infiltrate southern Israel in a stunning surprise attack that coincided with a major Jewish holiday.

He dismissed the Israeli military claims that it had provided an escape route.\n\n“No one can get out. No one can come in,\" Abusada told Al Jazeera. \"People who tried to evacuate the hospital, they were shot at in the streets.\"\n\nPalestinian officials say thousands of civilians have taken refuge among patients and staff, but Israeli officials accuse Hamas of concealing a command post in the hospital compound. Hamas denies it. The regional directors of three U.N. aid agencies issued a statement urging immediate international action to end the attacks on Gaza hospitals.\n\n\"The world cannot stand silent while hospitals, which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death, devastation and despair,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Israeli military said troops would assist in moving dozens of babies out of the besieged hospital. But an Israeli government spokesman said international aid agencies have \"actively put Palestinian civilians’ lives at risk\" by failing to support Israel's orders to evacuate northern Gaza weeks ago. Eylon Levy said the agencies now are \"endangering everyone by requiring a hasty evacuation in the middle of ground urban warfare.\"\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry has put the Palestinian death toll since the war began at more than 11,000. Israel says more than 1,200 Israelis have lost their lives, the vast majority on Oct. 7, the day militants swept into Israeli villages in a murderous rampage that stunned the world.\n\nUS pushes for release:U.S. 'actively engaged' in negotiations with Israel, Qatar, Hamas to free hostages, top Biden aide says\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Thousands of marchers joined lawmakers in Paris to rally Sunday against a surge in anti-Semitism in France since the conflict in the Gaza began.\n\n∎ The European Union called for immediate pauses in hostilities, establishment of humanitarian corridors and immediate release of hostages.\n\n∎ The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees is currently sheltering 618,000 people in 97 facilities, three of which were recently opened in Rafah, according to a Sunday update from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The agency said the number of displaced people in south Gaza continues to increase and over 1.5 million people in Gaza are estimated to be displaced.\n\n∎ Clashes between Lebanon’s Hezbollah group and Israeli military intensified along the Lebanon-Israel border on Sunday. According to Israel's military and rescue services, seven Israeli troops and 10 other people were injured by rocket blasts and shrapnel in an attack by Hezbollah.\n\nNewborn among dead:Medical devices lose power at Gaza's largest hospital\n\nGaza hospitals in dire conditions: Al-Shifa hospital 'not functioning as a hospital anymore'\n\nUnited Nations regional directors and World Health Organization said in a statement that more than half of Gaza’s hospitals are closed.\n\nAfter losing communication with Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest hospital, the WHO said Sunday that it was able to restore communications with staff at the hospital. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the situation \"dire and perilous.\"\n\n\"It's been 3 days without electricity, without water, and with very poor internet which has severely impacted our ability to provide essential care,\" Ghebreyesus said on X, formerly Twitter. \"Regrettably, the hospital is not functioning as a hospital anymore.\"\n\nGhebreyesus added that patient fatalities have increased significantly. The area around Al-Shifa Hospital has been under \"constant gunfire and bombings,\" according to Ghebreyesus.\n\nWith inadequate supplies, fuel, and electricity, incubators at the hospital have been idle and the Gaza Health Ministry said about 36 babies are at risk of dying. The hospital’s last generator ran out of fuel Saturday, causing the deaths of three premature babies and four other patients, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nIsrael's military said it coordinated with hospital officials and placed 300 liters of fuel near Shifa overnight for an emergency generator.\n\n“Sadly, they haven’t taken the fuel yet,” spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said. He added that if this fuel doesn’t work, they will seek “other solutions for the babies.”\n\nBut Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qidra, told Al Jazeera that “someone contacted the director and said they have 200 liters of fuel. These 200 liters give less than an hour to run the generator. ... This is a mockery towards the patients and children.”\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said there are 1,500 patients at Al-Shifa, along with 1,500 medical personnel and between 15,000 and 20,000 people seeking shelter.\n\nIs deal to free Hamas hostages close?\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that a hostage deal with Hamas could be near but declined to discuss details to avoid derailing the delicate negotiations. “I think the less I say about it, the more I’ll increase the chances that it materializes” he told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Netanyahu credited Israel's military pressure for getting Hamas to discuss the release.\n\n“That’s the one thing that might create a deal,\" he said. \"We will talk about it when it’s there. We’ll announce it if it’s achievable.\"\n\nThe hostage talks were drawing extensive and sometimes contradictory buzz. A Biden administration official confirmed a possible deal involving the release of about 80 women and children in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and teenagers held by Israel, NBC News reported. The official, which NBC did not name, acknowledged there is no certainty that any deal will come to fruition.\n\nBut Reuters reported that Hamas decided Sunday to suspend hostage negotiations because of Israel's assault on Al Shifa Hospital, a Palestinian official briefed on the hostage talks told the news service.\n\nChris Christie: Ceasefire wouldn't 'make any sense' for Israel\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Chris Christie, visiting Israeli communities shattered by the militant attacks last month, said he supported Israel's rejection of a ceasefire in Gaza. The Israelis can't be asked to stand down in the face of a violent threat against their people from Hamas, he said. The U.S. must stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" with its ally, he said.\n\n“To still be able to walk into one of these homes and smell the death, still, a month later, is something that I think the American people need to know,\" Christie said while touring the ruins of Kibbutz Kfar Aza.\n\nChristie told the Times of Israel that Israelis must fight until they are safe to \"come back and \"live here safely and securely. Until that comes, I don’t think calls for a ceasefire make any sense.\"\n\nNetanyahu rejects US plan for postwar Gaza\n\nNetanyahu has firmly rejected the Biden administration's vision for postwar Gaza, saying the Palestinian Authority that now administers the West Bank will not assume governance over the war-battered enclave. Israel will retain overall security control and retain the right to attack any \"terrorists who may pop up again,\" Netanyahu said Saturday.\n\nNetanyahu, who credited the Israeli attack on Gaza for pushing Hamas closer to a deal to free hostages, vowed not to \"cave\" to global pressure to cede control of Gaza to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n“There will ... not be a civil authority that educates its children to hate Israel, to kill Israelis, to eliminate the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu said. “There cannot be an authority whose leader still has not condemned the terrible massacre 30 days later.\"\n\nHezbollah leader calls for global protests against Israel, US\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called to increase global demonstrations against Israel over the war in Gaza but again declined to fully engage his militant group in support of Hamas. Nasrallah said only the U.S. and Britain are fully supportive of Israel in the war, noting that Western leaders who initially condemned Hamas over the Oct. 7 attack were now urging a cease-fire and called for international pressure to be directed at the U.S.\n\nNasrallah, in a translation by the Times of Israel, said Hamas supporters must be willing to extend the war to weaken Israel, saying the Israeli economy had suffered “tens of billions of dollars of losses … in spite of the $14 billion of military aid provided by the U.S.”\n\nWar makes choosing a US college more difficult\n\nThe strife on U.S. college campuses prompted by the war in Gaza has many Jewish and Muslim families drawing up a new set of criteria for which schools they hope their kids will attend next year. Over the next few months, exactly how college leaders navigate the protests and hate speech could have a notable impact on which campuses parents and students ultimately choose. For Jewish students in particular, the mayhem has the potential to accelerate a trend over decades of declining Jewish enrollment at the country’s most selective schools, where much of the controversy related to the war has been centered.\n\n“There’s a reckoning going on with Jewish families and inside many of these institutions,” said Naomi Steinberg, a private college counselor in Florida who works mostly with Jewish students and parents.

Meanwhile, Israel and Hamas presented conflicting narratives about why the truce ended.\n\n“It's because of Hamas that this pause ended,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “They were just simply unable, failed to produce a list of hostages that could help enable that pause extending.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden and the entire security council will remain engaged in negotiations, Kirby said, as the U.S. pushes for another pause and for the release of more hostages. Qatar, another international mediator along with Egypt, said it was working to renew a truce and expressed \"deep regret\" over the renewed combat.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said at least 178 Palestinians died and dozens more were injured in the hours after airstrikes resumed Friday, and Israel said it struck more than 200 Hamas targets.\n\n“The onus is on Hamas to be able to produce a list of hostages that that they can get out so that we can try to get this pause back in place,” Kirby said.\n\nIsrael initially halted the flow of humanitarian aid going into Gaza since resuming airstrikes Friday, but later allowed several dozen trucks of aid to enter at the request of the Biden administration, according to Israeli officials.\n\n“If Hamas truly, as they claim to do, care about Palestinians, they'll do what they can to come up with a list of hostages that can be exchanged so that that aid can continue to flow,” Kirby said.\n\nIsrael said it resumed fighting after Hamas \"violated\" the cease-fire and fired toward Israel. Hamas officials blamed the Israelis, saying they turned down offers to release elderly hostages as well as the bodies of hostages.\n\nDuring Israel's seven-day pause in fighting in Gaza, more than 100 hostages, all women and children including two Americans, were freed from Hamas captivity. Seven Americans, including one woman, remain unaccounted for.

Israel kind of rejected it. What is Biden's ...", "text": "It was sold as an Israeli-endorsed deal. But it was President Joe Biden − whose support for Israel in the Gaza war has tarnished his reputation with Arab American voters − who announced it.\n\nIt was described as a cease-fire proposal supported by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yet everything Netanyahu subsequently said about it was a mixed signal, and agreeing to it risks a revolt by ultra-nationalists who could topple his government's ruling coalition, leaving him vulnerable to legal woes the war has obscured.\n\nAnd it contained no clear identifiable solution to the one fundamental issue that both Israel and Hamas have appeared to be completely inflexible on after eight months of fighting: whether any cease-fire plan would be permanent and involve a complete withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.\n\nThe White House has said it has \"every expectation\" that Israel will, if Hamas does, accept the U.S.-backed cease-fire plan that Biden unveiled in a surprise speech last week. Hamas has yet to sign on to the deal. Here's what the plan involves and some of the calculations Netanyahu may have to make in deciding, or not, to back it.\n\nWhat was in the Biden truce proposal?\n\nBiden said the truce proposal was first outlined by Israel and then passed to mediators who brought it to Hamas. It contained three distinct phases. The first phase of the deal, characterized as a \"full and complete cease-fire,\" would last six weeks. During this time, Israel's military would withdraw from Gaza's densely populated areas and release an unspecified number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, as well as the remains of killed hostages. In return, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian assistance to Gaza would surge during this first phase, with 600 trucks being allowed into the enclave each day.\n\nThe second phase of the deal, as described by Biden, would see all the remaining hostages, including male soldiers, held by Hamas released. At the same time, Israel would withdraw its forces from Gaza. The third phase of the agreement would involve the reconstruction of Gaza. The war has resulted in massive devastation to Gaza's infrastructure. The proposal did not specify who would run Gaza during the third phase, or afterward. A previous agreement reached by Israel and Hamas, in November, allowed for a pause in fighting in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. The truce broke down after four days.\n\n30,000-plus lives lost:Visualizing the death and destruction of Israel's war in Gaza\n\nWas this Israel's idea? Or the United States'?\n\nOphir Falk, Netanyahu's chief foreign policy adviser, told the Sunday Times (of London) the deal as outlined by Biden was something Israel previously drafted and agreed to. But he also described Biden's announcement as a \"political speech,\" an apparent reference to Biden's poor standing with Arab American and other voters from his political base who want to see the war in Gaza end as quickly as possible.\n\nFalk said it was \"not a good deal,\" as outlined.\n\nHe added that there were \"a lot of details to be worked out.\"\n\nFor his part, Netanyahu, in two carefully worded statements released in the days after Biden's announcement, said \"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\nA 'nonstarter'?\n\nNetanyahu said Israel would not agree to any deal before those conditions were met. A \"nonstarter,\" he called it.\n\nSo was this a case of Netanyahu floating a plan to Biden that Israel's leader was never actually willing to accept?\n\nAmi Pedahzur, an expert on Israeli politics and security who teaches at the University of Haifa, said he had never before encountered a time in Israeli politics when there was \"so much spin\" going on in terms of teasing the government's thinking on the war and how to end it. However, he said he did not think Netanyahu was \"playing games\" by detailing a potential cease-fire plan to the U.S. that appears to cross some of his own red lines.\n\nPedahzur said one plausible explanation was that Netanyahu asked the U.S. to \"put it forward to see what response\" it would generate for his domestic audience, where polls show overwhelming support for any action that would lead to the freeing of hostages. Netanyahu faces growing pressure to secure the hostage's release from their families, and to end the war because of its impact on Palestinians. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to halt its assault on Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city. The International Criminal Court has applied for an arrest warrant for Netanyahu − as well as Hamas' leader − for alleged war crimes.\n\nThe White House has also dangled a threat to withdraw U.S. arms from Israel.\n\nPutin, Joseph Kony, Gaddafi's son:Rogue's gallery of international court fugitives\n\nStill, Nimrod Novik, a foreign policy fellow at Israel Policy Forum, a think tank, and a onetime adviser to Israel's late prime minister, Shimon Peres, had a different interpretation of Netanyahu's motivations. He said that \"those of us who have been following Netanyahu for decades have seen this mode of operation before.\"\n\nNovik said when faced with political obstacles and \"narrowing\" options Netanyahu almost always \"trusts the second party will be obstructionist.\" In other words, Israel's leader is counting on Hamas rejecting the Biden-announced plan, Novik believes. He said in the event Hamas comes back with a positive reaction to the proposal \"then we'll be at a fork in the road: either Netanyahu yields to the extremists in his government, in which case there will be a dramatic surge in public protests in Israel to the point where the country could be shut down.\"\n\nAlternatively, should he go for the Biden initiative, triggering the fall of his government, it is possible that a coalition of centrist opposition parties could come to Netanyahu's aid to keep him in power \"in the service of the national interest,\" Novik said. Though that would involve Netanyahu committing to \"a sea change in our Palestinian policy, a permanent cease-fire, normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia, scrapping judicial reforms\" and other measures that Israel's ultra-nationalists have opposed with his consent.\n\nWhat happens to Netanyahu if he loses the right-wing?\n\nThe White House has denied that there are any \"gaps\" between what Biden outlined on Friday and what Netanyahu's government put forward. \"We're confident that it accurately reflects that proposal − a proposal that we worked with the Israelis on,\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\nHowever, Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich both described the plan unveiled by Biden as \"reckless\" and tantamount to surrendering to Hamas. They have threatened, if Netanyahu accepts it, to withdraw their parties' support for him in Israel's Knesset, or Parliament.\n\nIf that happens Netanyahu's government could collapse, potentially triggering an election and dislodging him from power and exposing Netanyahu to face a litany of bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges − all accusations he denies − that his time in office has provided a degree of shelter from.\n\nIt's also possible that a coalition of centrist opposition parties could come to Netanyahu's aid to keep him in power \"in the service of the national interest,\" Novik said, though that would involve Netanyahu committing to \"a sea change in our Palestinian policy, a permanent cease-fire, normalization of ties with Saudi Arabia, scrapping judicial reforms\" and other measures that Israel's ultra-nationalists have opposed with his consent.\n\nA threat by Benny Gantz, a retired army general and political centrist, to leave Netanyahu's wartime Cabinet by June 8 if no plan for a post-war Gaza materializes would mean Netanyahu is further reliant on his far-right allies.\n\nRelated:Exclusive: Concern over Biden's stance on Israel-Hamas war rattles high-profile campaign donors\n\nAn idea for a deal. Now what?\n\nStill, Simcha Rothman, a lawyer and member of the Knesset from the far-right Religious Zionist Party, disputed the idea that Biden's announcement of the plan in any way applies pressure to Israel eight months into the war.\n\n\"If it's the Israeli offer he spoke about (on Friday), then why would he apply pressure to Israel to accept its own offer. That makes no sense,\" said Rothman. \"I see this as simply a political act, and not as an act that will help bring back any hostage any sooner. It's a big mistake, to say the least,\" he said of Biden's intervention.\n\nRothman said he suspected Biden was \"trying to interfere in Israel's politics, which is unacceptable.\"\n\nHe sidestepped a question on what would happen if Hamas were to accept the plan as revealed by Biden. Rothman's comments came as Biden said in an interview Tuesday that there is \"every reason\" to think Netanyahu is prolonging Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza for his own political gain and self-preservation.\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on that. There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden used the interview, with Time magazine, offer qualified support for Netanyahu. U.S. congressional leaders are working to finalize a date for Netanyahu to deliver a joint address to Congress, an event that could draw protests. Netanyahu addressed Congress in 2015, when he voiced concerns over a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nYotam Eyal, an Israeli lawyer who lives on land in the West Bank claimed by Palestinians, nevertheless said he too was against any deal with Hamas for now. \"It's not about the idea of a deal, it's more about the idea that we don't have a good deal that will stop Hamas. If we keep Hamas in power in Gaza we'll get Oct. 7. again and again and again,\" Eyal said of the day that saw Israelis attacked, murdered and kidnapped on Israel's southern border.\n\nSami Omar Zidan, a Gazan currently living in temporary housing in Cairo, Egypt, where he evacuated with his wife and daughter about a month ago, before Israel completely closed the border amid its assault on Rafah, said he also only sees endless cycles of violence. Deal or not, he said, he's not sure Israel's war will ever end.\n\n\"No matter what happens,'' he said, ''Israel never stops.''", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/06/05/israeli-war-updates-hamas-gaza/73981570007/", "title": "Israel war updates: Netanyahu does back cease-fire plan, US says", "text": "The latest proposed cease-fire deal drawing skepticism in Israel really did come from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and has its approval, a Biden administration official said Wednesday.\n\n“Israel’s a raucous democracy, so there’s a lot of talk and a lot of chatter, but the Israeli government has reconfirmed repeatedly, as recently as today, that the proposal is still on the table,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on NBC's \"Today\" show. \"Now it’s up to Hamas to accept it. The whole world should call on Hamas to accept it.”\n\nBiden did not consult with Netanyahu before making the announcement to make it harder for Israel to back out of the agreement, Reuters reported, citing three U.S. officials.\n\nLeaders of multiple Israeli political parties have threatened to drop out of Netanyahu's governing coalition if he strikes a deal before Hamas is thoroughly defeated.

Hezbollah took responsibility for the attack, claiming it was a response to recent deadly Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating why no alerts were triggered during the attack, but it didn't take long to respond, saying later in the day its warplanes hit several Hezbollah targets. \"The strikes included terrorist infrastructure in Naqoura and Matmoura, Hezbollah military structures in Ayta ash Shab, and a Hezbollah observation post in Khiam,'' said the Israel Defense Forces, whose artillery also fired at the militant group's targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Netanyahu visited the northern city of Kiryat Shmona and warned that Israel had prepared an “extremely powerful” response to the escalating attacks. Kiryat Shmona is one of a string of northern Israeli towns that have been mostly evacuated for months because of the attacks Hezbollah says are a show of solidarity for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n“Whoever thinks he can hurt us and we will respond by sitting on our hands is making a big mistake,\" Netanyahu said. \"We are prepared for very intense action in the north. One way or another, we will restore security to the north.\"\n\nNYT: Israel targeted US lawmakers with fake social media profiles\n\nA pro-Israeli social media influence campaign involving hundreds of fake profiles on Facebook and X primarily targeting Black members of Congress was financed by the Israeli government, the New York Times reported. The Times, citing multiple Israeli officials as well as some documents, said the $2 million covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs.\n\nThe effort was first revealed earlier this year by Fake Reporter, a disinformation watchdog group that said the accounts followed a pattern typical of \"foreign influence operations\" that frequently shared identical content. The Fake Reporter investigation, which did not tie the effort directly to the Israeli government, said much of the content was linked to fictitious news platforms. The content said university campuses had become unsafe for Jewish students, attacked the U.N.'s Palestinian aid agency and focused on crimes committed by Hamas during the Oct. 7 assault on Israel.\n\nFake Reporter said the effort was linked to STOIC, a Tel-Aviv based marketing agency, and that Facebook owner META had recently banned the accounts from the site. Meta did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nUS-built pier in Gaza may be back in use by week's end\n\nThe Pentagon expects to re-anchor its humanitarian-aid pier in Gaza by week’s end, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Wednesday.\n\nHigh seas and storms ripped the pier from shore and damaged it last week. The Biden administration had touted the pier as an alternative route to bring in food and medicine desperately needed by Palestinians caught in the fighting between Hamas and Israel.\n\nBut the effort to establish a maritime corridor was beset by problems from the start. Palestinians mobbed the first aid trucks after they left shore, preventing them from reaching distribution points. Of the 1,000 U.S. troops helping build the structure, three were injured, one of them critically. That soldier was recently flown from a hospital in Israel to an Army base in Texas where he remains in critical condition, Singh said.\n\nThe pier is being repaired in Israel. Before it was damaged, the floating dock funneled about 1,000 metric tons of aid to Gaza, Singh said. She also highlighted one bit of good news: The price tag for building and operating the pier, initially estimated at $320 million, has fallen to $230 million. Lower costs for trucks needed to ferry the aid and contributions from allies like the United Kingdom accounted for the savings, she said.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nMedical situation in Gaza is 'apocalyptic'\n\nThe bodies of at least 70 people have been brought to Al-Aqsa hospital since Tuesday following heavy Israeli strikes in central Gaza, Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday. Another 300 wounded people, the majority of whom are women and children, also have arrived at the overwhelmed hospital, the international aid agency said. The repeated mass casualty incidents in Gaza are unacceptable and the \"horrific toll on civilians shows the total disregard\" for human life, the agency said in a social media post.\n\n“With the insane escalation of violence in various locations in the Gaza Strip over the last 48 hours, and while the Rafah crossing point has remained closed for a month, the health system has been stretched to the point of collapse,\" agency medical coordinator Karin Huster said. \"The situation is apocalyptic.\"\n\nIsraeli lawmaker threatens to disrupt Netanyahu's ruling coalition\n\nIsraeli far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said his Otzma Yehudit Party will not vote with Netanyahu's fragile coalition in the Knesset until details of the latest cease-fire proposal are revealed. President Joe Biden said last week that Netanyahu's War Cabinet offered a plan for a permanent cease-fire in return for release of all hostages held by Hamas-led militants. Ben-Gvir opposes any plan to end the war before Hamas has been eliminated.\n\n\"As long as the Prime Minister continues to hide the details of the deal, Otzma Yehudit will disrupt his coalition,\" Ben-Gvir pledged in a social media post.\n\nAn Israeli peace plan that could be rejected − by Israel\n\nThe current peace proposal was framed by Biden as an Israeli offer, but now Israel may be balking. Netanyahu has sent mixed signals, and agreeing to it risks a revolt by ultra-nationalists who could topple his government's ruling coalition. The proposal contained no clear solution to the fundamental Hamas demand that any cease-fire plan be permanent and involve a complete withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza. Under the three-phase plan, all hostages would be freed by the end of the second phase.\n\nAlso not clear is the fate of Hamas under the plan. Netanyahu has pledged to destroy the militant group, and members of his ruling coaliton have threatened to abandon the prime minister if he backs down from that pledge.\n\nSimcha Rothman, a lawyer and member of the Knesset from the far-right Religious Zionist Party, said he suspected Biden was \"trying to interfere in Israel's politics, which is unacceptable.\"\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nThousands join Jerusalem Day Flag March\n\nThousands of mostly ultranationalist Israelis took part in the Jerusalem Day Flag March through the Palestinian section of the city, many chanting anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans, including \"Death to Arabs.” Police arrested 18 people for violent acts, according to the Times of Israel, which said extremists assaulted journalists and Palestinian residents.\n\nThe march celebrates Israel seizing East Jerusalem following the 1967 Six Day War. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the march was \"sending a message\" to Palestinians: \"Our Jerusalem. And with the help of (God), our complete victory.\"\n\nIn speeches, Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Israel to expand the war in Gaza and go after Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Times of Israel reported.\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh vowed Wednesday that \"our people will not rest\" until an independent Palestinian state is established with Jerusalem as its capital. Steffen Seibert, Germany's ambassador to Israel, expressed disgust with the march in a social media post.\n\n\"Scenes like this from Jerusalem today do not speak of the deep spiritual connection to the city that Jews have felt for thousands of years,\" he said. \"They speak of blind hate that these kids have been taught.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/05"}]}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at-home antigen tests take only minutes and are accurate and reliable when reporting positive results.\n\nHowever, PCR tests are more likely to detect the virus even when the patient is exhibiting no symptoms. Because of this, the FDA recommends two negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. Only a single PCR test is required by comparison.\n\nIf you need testing more quickly, there are other programs offering free or low-cost tests, including community-based testing sites.\n\nCOVID this holiday season\n\nAs colder weather approaches, flu and RSV season are concerns alongside coronavirus.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has said that COVID cases are likewise climbing through December, thanks in part to the fastest spreading new variant, JN.1.\n\nNow the second-largest source of COVID cases, JN.1 is highly contagious and prone to spreading rapidly, which isn't great news during a time when many are planning to host large gatherings.\n\nWorried about keeping your family safe? Besides vaccination, proper hygiene and precautions like wearing masks, testing is an important component to stopping the spread and keeping our more vulnerable loved ones infection-free.\n\nWondering where to get tested in advance of Christmas? We know sticking that cotton swab up your nose isn't the most fun activity to celebrate the holidays, but we can make things a bit easier when seeking out a test in the first place.\n\nBuying at-home tests\n\nTests are available for purchase at most pharmacies, including CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid, and many grocery stores such as Walmart. You can also order some online via Amazon, brick-and-mortar retailers with online shops and in some cases from the manufacturer's website itself.\n\nUnfortunately, insurance companies are no longer required to pay for COVID testing, which was once covered to the tune of eight take-home tests a month. Research from independent organization KFF found that at-home tests generally cost between $12 and $24 per pack, averaging in at $11 per test.\n\nWhile this may not seem a huge cost to some, it adds up quickly if you have to test often or are simply on a tight budget. However, it is often the quickest way to obtain a test on short notice or to stock up if you like to keep a few around the house.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that at-home tests are rapid antigen and not PCR tests, which are generally considered the most accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at-home antigen tests take only minutes and are accurate and reliable when reporting positive results.\n\nHowever, PCR tests are more likely to detect the virus even when the patient is exhibiting no symptoms. Because of this, the FDA recommends two negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. Only a single PCR test is required by comparison.\n\nCOVID variant JN.1 on the rise:Current symptoms to look out for\n\nFinding at-home tests for free\n\nIn November, the government launched another round of free COVID tests for U.S. households. If your household has not yet claimed yours through this program, you are entitled to four free at-home tests delivered directly to your home. If you did not receive the round made available in September either, you can place two orders and get up to eight tests.\n\nTo order online, visit COVIDtests.gov and fill out the form which asks for your full name and mailing address. The tests will then be shipped free via USPS to the provided location, including P.O. boxes. You will receive an order number and updates via email if you choose to input your email address.\n\nWhile insurance providers are no longer required to cover COVID-19 tests, many still do. Contact your provider to find an in-network pharmacy where you can get a certain number of tests either covered on the spot or reimbursed. Medicare beneficiaries are likewise still eligible for free tests.\n\nTesting sites and other community resources like libraries, food banks, schools and charities in your area may also have free at-home tests on offer.\n\nFinding testing sites\n\nThere are thousands of free testing sites still in operation around the country. These community-based resources offer antigen or PCR testing to every American, regardless of insurance status.\n\nThe Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) program run by the federal government continues to function, providing no-cost COVID-19 testing for people who are symptomatic or were exposed via an estimated 19,000 sites across the U.S.\n\nUsing the CDC No-Cost COVID-19 Testing Locator, you can simply enter your address or zip code, select a 5 to 100-mile radius in which to search and instantly receive a list of results.\n\nUninsured people and people who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, VA insurance, or who receive care from Indian Health Services can also receive free access to COVID-19 and flu testing, telehealth, and treatment through the Home Test to Treat program.\n\nIt's the flu season, too:How to not get yourself or others sick over the holidays\n\nOther ways to get tested\n\nIf you have a primary care physician or another doctor you regularly work with, you may contact them or pay them a visit for testing that is more likely to be covered by insurance. Urgent care and ER facilities likewise will test you in an urgent or emergency situation.\n\nPeople with disabilities can also contact the Disability Information and Access Line for help accessing a test or finding a test location.\n\nThere are likewise online services designed to help you find a one-off appointment for testing or offer other related telehealth care. Many insurance providers have some form of telehealth but the internet likewise has an abundance of options such as Zocdoc.\n\nCOVID this holiday season\n\nThe many gatherings that happen around the holiday season can pose an increased risk for transmission, meaning testing is a good idea even if you don't have symptoms before attending an event, gathering, or visiting an at-risk individual.\n\nIf you're concerned about COVID around your loved ones this holiday season, the CDC suggests a few precautions, including:\n\nTest as close to the time of the event as possible (at least within 1-2 days).\n\nIf you use an antigen test, follow recommendations for repeat testing to be confident in a negative result.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to find a free testing location or visit your doctor for a PCR test before visiting people with a higher risk for severe illness.\n\nConsider practicing social distancing or wearing masks during large gatherings, while traveling, or during other high-transmission events where at-risk people may be.\n\nKeep up to date on your COVID vaccines and boosters. Get your flu and RSV shots if you're able to as well.\n\nGet vaccines at least two weeks before holiday travel or gatherings.\n\nKeep up with handwashing and good hygiene practices.\n\nStay home if you are infected or have symptoms of illness.\n\nIf you have symptoms, test immediately.\n\nIf you are only going to take a single test, a PCR test will provide a more reliable negative test result.\n\nIf you use an antigen test, a positive result is reliable, but a negative test is not always accurate.\n\nIf your antigen test is negative, take another antigen test after 48 hours or take a PCR test as soon as you can.\n\nIf you do not have symptoms but have been exposed to COVID-19, wait at least 5 full days after your exposure before taking a test.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/09/29/expired-covid-tests-still-work/70986102007/", "title": "Free government COVID tests may work after expiration date, FDA ...", "text": "Consumers who've ordered free home coronavirus tests through a federal website could be in for a surprise: they might get kits with expiration dates that passed months ago.\n\nBut experts say you shouldn't immediately discard those tests.

Consumers also can call the agency's hotline at 1-888-INFO-FDA for more information.\n\nHow long have COVID test expiration dates been extended?\n\nThe FDA extends expiration dates when the manufacturer has data showing the test can deliver accurate results beyond the original expiration date.\n\nThe length of the extension varies by test maker for 37 approved home coronavirus tests, which are mostly \"antigen\" tests to detect a viral protein on the surface of the coronavirus. The shortest shelf life is four months for the 3EO Health COVID-19 Test. Tests from these six companies have the longest shelf life of 24 months: ACON Laboratories, Azure Biotech, Celltrion USA, GenBody, Princeton BioMeditech and Siemens Healthineers.\n\nThe shelf life for the popular Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self Test has been extended to 22 months. You can view the lot number of your Abbott BinaxNow test to find the updated expiration date.\n\nMy COVID test is beyond the extended expiration date. Can I still use it?\n\nThe FDA advises people to not use a coronavirus test beyond the extended expiration date. The test parts may degrade or break down, so kits used beyond the extended expiration date could give inaccurate test results, the agency said.\n\nMy home test was left outside in hot or freezing temperatures. Can I still use it?\n\nTest makers must perform stability testing to show the tests will work after being shipped in summer or winter. Still, extreme temperatures can affect test performance, the FDA said.\n\nIf you get a test kit that was delivered during hot or cold weather, you should bring the package inside to room temperature and not open it for a minimum of two hours. From there, consult the test's instructions. For example, if the control lines don't appear in the right locations, the test might not deliver accurate results.\n\nWhat can the antigen COVID tests detect?\n\nMost home tests are antigen tests that typically deliver results in about 15 minutes. Antigen tests are less sensitive than molecular PCR tests and less likely to detect the virus early in the infection, but experts say the tests can detect the virus when a person is infectious and likely to pass it to others.\n\nFor antigen tests, the FDA recommends consumers repeat testing following a negative result to reduce the risk an infection may have been missed. Those with symptoms should test again 48 hours after a negative test. If you don't have symptoms, the FDA recommends taking up to three tests over four-plus days with negative results, with 48 hours lapsing between each test.\n\nContributing: David Robinson, USA TODAY Network New York State Team", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/09/20/free-home-covid-tests-at-covidtests-gov/70913833007/", "title": "Four free home COVID tests at CovidTests.gov starts Monday", "text": "Consumers can once again get four free coronavirus home tests per household through the government-run website CovidTests.gov.\n\nThe Biden administration reopened the free test program beginning Monday, as the Department of Health and Human Services announced it will award $600 million to a dozen domestic coronavirus test manufacturers to shore up the government's supply of home tests.\n\nThe investment will deliver about 200 million new over-the-counter coronavirus tests, officials said.\n\nDuring four previous rounds, HHS secured and the Postal Service delivered more than 755 million tests free to households.

These tests are designed to give you results in less than 30 minutes from the comfort of your own home.\n\nBut if you have several boxes of them stored away, perhaps left over from winter’s Omicron surge or from the federal program that sends up to eight free tests to US households, you might wonder whether they’re safe and accurate to use beyond the expiration date on the package.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration, which authorizes these tests, says on its website that it “does not recommend using at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests beyond their authorized expiration dates. COVID-19 tests and parts they are made of may degrade, or break down, over time. Because of this, expired test kits could give inaccurate test results.”\n\nBut as manufacturers change the expiration dates for some tests, many are left wondering if it’s that simple.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, weighed in.\n\nCNN: What exactly are rapid antigen tests?\n\nDr. William Schaffner: Rapid antigen tests detect tiny, microscopic amounts of protein from the virus. So they actually detect the virus itself. These diagnostic tests quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. One of the main advantages of an antigen test is the speed of the test, which can provide results in minutes. However, antigen tests may not detect all active infections, as they do not work the same way as a PCR test.\n\nCNN: How do the FDA and the manufacturers of the tests decide expiration dates and when to extend them?\n\nSchaffner: Since it takes time for test manufacturers to perform stability testing, the FDA typically authorizes at-home Covid-19 tests with an expiration date of about four to six months from the day the test was manufactured, based on initial study results.\n\nOnce the test manufacturer has more stability testing results, such as 12 or 18 months, the test manufacturer can contact the FDA to request that the FDA authorize a longer expiration date. When a longer expiration date is authorized, the test manufacturer may send a notice to customers to provide the new authorized expiration date, so the customers know how long they can use the tests they already have.\n\nCNN: Can you use an expired test?\n\nSchaffner: A word of background: When the tests were first given the green light, when they were approved by the Food and Drug Administration, one of the things that the FDA asked the test developers to do is say, “OK, if I have the test at home and I have them on the shelf or on my bookshelf, for how long will they still be accurate?” A perfectly reasonable question. And of course, in the beginning when the tests were first developed, the manufacturers waited let’s say three months or six months, and then they went to the Food and Drug Administration and said, “here is the data.”\n\nThey showed that they still work after three months, and the FDA said “good,” and for those early tests, you put on that you have an expiration date of three months, but that’s just because that was the duration that was tested.\n\nNow, the same manufacturer keeps their tests on the shelf for six months, shows that they still work and goes to the FDA and says “they work up to six months,” and the FDA says “great.” Now, you can put six months on your box when you sell it.\n\nSo you could have gotten a test from the same manufacturer and a shorter and a longer expiration date, depending upon when the actual test was made and delivered to the store or sent to you by the federal government. We have tests now that have been shown to be good for a year and I think some probably even longer. In other words, these are very, very stable tests.\n\nNow, if I have a test that expired last week, will it still be accurate this week if I use it? And the short answer is yes. As long as you haven’t abused the test in some way, put it in a deep freeze or left it out in the sun or something like that. Sure. We can rely on the results of the test.\n\nCNN: Can people still access free testing in other places?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSchaffner: Many [testing sites] have closed, or they’re available to you in a much more restricted range of hours. And that’s obviously because of availability. Rapid tests are available. That’s taking a lot of the pressure off the testing locations where PCR testing was available, so that’s much less widely and quickly available. Your physician can still send off a PCR test to your health care provider, but it may take a week for the results to come back, and it will be paid for by your insurance. But if you’re looking for free testing, I think those testing sites have been much more restricted now than they once were.\n\nCNN: What’s the most important thing people should know in order to get accurate results for rapid tests?\n\nSchaffner: The instructions. I have found as I have looked at them – and I don’t pretend to have looked at every test box that’s out there – but I’ve looked at a number of them. The instructions are really very clear. They have illustrations, and my suggestion is do it exactly right. It’s not complicated, but do it exactly, no deviation, as the instructions say, and then you can be quite reliant on the results.", "authors": ["Dejania Oliver"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/01/19/free-covid-19-tests-available-now-what-you-need-know-get-yours/6566415001/", "title": "Free COVID-19 tests available now: What you need to know to get ...", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Americans on Tuesday flocked to the federal website COVIDTests.gov, which allows consumers to request free coronavirus testing kits.\n\nWhite House officials said the beta launch was designed to gauge its early-stage rollout. The official launch will come midmorning Wednesday and allow Americans to order four kits per address, to be delivered by the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nThe free tests anchor the Biden administration's testing reset as long lines and home test shortages have made it difficult for Americans to get checked for the highly contagious omicron variant that has ripped across the nation.\n\nThe federal government has purchased 500 million home tests to be mailed to households so people can test themselves at home without a lab. The administration expects to double the initial order for a total of 1 billion tests.\n\nBut the federally distributed tests are only part of the administration's effort to address long-standing testing shortages that have slowed the nation's response since the beginning of the pandemic. Consumers can also purchase home tests online or at a retailer and be reimbursed by their insurance company. The Biden administration also has asked insurers to make it easier for consumers to pick up a free home test through retail sites or pharmacies.\n\nThe home tests are meant to supplement the more conventional lab tests consumers get at testing sites, clinics or hospitals.\n\nAn average of about 2.9 million Americans got tested each day for the virus that causes COVID-19 over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University's testing tracker. About 1 in 4 tests were positive – an indication of how prevalent the virus remains nationwide, even as case counts and hospitalizations drop in states first hit by the omicron surge.\n\nThe test-ordering website attracted more than 700,000 visitors at one time on Tuesday afternoon – far more visits than any other federal website, according to analytics.usa.gov.\n\nSome say the website is a temporary reprieve, and consumers who reach their four-test limit will turn to their insurance companies to fill the gap even as retail test shortages persist and insurance companies scramble to meet the mandate.\n\nHow do I get my free COVID test?\n\nCOVIDTests.gov on Tuesday began processing a limited number of test orders. When consumers order the tests on the website, they are asked to enter their name and shipping address.\n\nThe website says there are \"tests for every residential address in the U.S. Please check back tomorrow if you run into any unexpected issues.\"\n\nOne potential glitch emerged Tuesday. Residents of condo and apartment buildings with a single address but multiple units said their orders were rejected, according to social media posts.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration can't guarantee \"there won't be a bug or two\" but that the tech teams across the administration and Postal Service are working on the launch.\n\nOfficials said tests, once ordered, would be mailed within seven to 12 days.\n\nCan I purchase my own tests?\n\nAnother new program requires health plans to cover the cost of home tests sold at retailers or online up to $12 per test.\n\nConsumers can either purchase the testing kits at no cost through their insurer or buy kits from a retailer and submit receipts to get reimbursed by their insurance company.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the initiative in December and unveiled policy details earlier this month. Beginning Saturday, insurers were required to cover up to eight home tests each month for each consumer covered by the plan.\n\nYet insurers and consumers are still figuring out details in what some warn could be a bumpy road for consumers.\n\nThe Biden administration has encouraged insurers to establish preferred places, such as a pharmacy, where consumers can pick up the tests without charge. Insurers also must reimburse consumers who buy their own tests up to $12 per test. Some test kits cost more, so consumers could have some out-of-pocket costs.\n\nA bigger challenge might be finding tests. The program has launched amid a persistent shortage of tests at stores and retailers even as manufacturers seek to ramp up supplies.\n\n\"It is just hard to see how this is going to go smoothly,\" said Ceci Connolly, president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans.\n\nIn addition to the nationwide test shortage, some smaller health insurance plans are scrambling to partner with pharmacies or retailers.\n\n\"Even with the best of intentions and a lot of resources being dedicated to this, they are having enormous difficulty providing COVID test kits to many Americans,\" Connolly said. \"There will not be enough (testing), and so we really worry that health plans will get a lot of the angry, frustrated, upset calls and complaints when they have no solution.\"\n\nDo home tests provide accurate results?\n\nHome tests are appealing because they don't need a lab and typically deliver results in about 15 minutes. These antigen tests detect proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus, Laboratory-based PCR tests detect a virus's genetic material, are more expensive and take longer to process.\n\nWhile lab tests are more sensitive and can detect traces of the virus over a longer period, advocates of antigen tests said the kits can more quickly alert someone who is infectious and at risk of passing the virus to others.\n\nDavid Walt, a Harvard Medical School professor of pathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said rapid antigen tests are useful but people should also be aware of limitations and should consider the likelihood the test results are correct.\n\nIf someone is exposed to COVID-19 and has symptoms but tests negative using a rapid antigen test, the person should repeat the test within two days, But if the same person tests positive, they should believe the results and isolate, Walt said.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administrations has granted emergency use authorizations for one dozen antigen home tests. Most of those kits contain two tests with instructions to repeat the tests, usually over about two days. The FDA said it continues to monitor how well these tests detect omicron.\n\n\"You absolutely can use these tests effectively if you know your pre-test probability,\" Walt said.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter at @kalltucker, or email at alltuck@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}]}

He needed to ...", "text": "Correction: This story was updated to further clarify which Boar's Head products were recalled.\n\nA Virginia family is remembering a beloved father, grandfather, community member, master hair designer and Holocaust survivor who they say died as a result of the ongoing listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head deli meats.\n\nThe outbreak, first reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on July 19, has resulted in at least 57 illnesses and hospitalizations, including nine deaths, across 18 states as of Aug. 28, according to the CDC investigation.\n\nThe spread of listeria has been connected to sliced deli meats distributed by the brand Boar's Head, which initially issued a recall for 207,528 pounds of its liverwurst on July 26. The company issued an expanded recall on July 30 to include every product made at the same facility where its liverwurst was produced, equating to about 7.2 million pounds.\n\nU.S. health agencies including the CDC and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been working in tandem with Boar's Head and other investigative agencies to determine the origins and scope of the outbreak.\n\nOn Aug. 8, the CDC reported a new death in an update on the investigation. This case, confirmed by the CDC as the third death in the outbreak, was that of Günter “Garshon” Morgenstein, an 88-year-old German native and pillar of his Newport News community. His family has spoken out to tell his story.\n\n'His parents hid him under floorboards'\n\nMorgenstein was born in Cottbus, Germany on June 29, 1936. Born to a Jewish family, he was forced to flee his native country as Nazi control over Germany grew.\n\n\"His parents hid him under floorboards,\" his son, Garshon \"Shon\" Morgenstein told USA TODAY.\n\nMorgenstein was a Holocaust survivor, having left East Berlin with just the clothes on his back in 1954. From what his son could recall, not all of Morgenstein's family members made it out alive.\n\nMorgenstein then traveled to Canada to meet up with his brother who had settled there ahead of him. He spoke no English at the time, he told the Oyster Point, a local newspaper in what would become his adopted hometown of Newport News, Virginia, in a 1999 article.\n\n\"My brother told me the only way I would learn English was not to hang around with Germans but instead to go to English versions of movies I had already seen in Germany and walk the streets trying to read the signs,\" he told the paper at the time. Evidently, the trick worked well.\n\nA master stylist and master of his community\n\nMorgenstein went on to build an over 70-year career in cosmetology, becoming a Master Hair Designer who worked with some of the most recognizable organizations in the biz, from Paul Mitchell to S&L. While still in Canada, he toured the country to teach at salons and speak at hair shows, spreading his motto of, \"The cut, the chemistry and the design.\"\n\nHis training started long before his time working with the likes of Tom Jones, Johnny Mathis, Engelbert Humperdinck, Sly and the Family Stone and Muhammad Ali. In fact, he took his first job in a barber shop back in Germany at around 13 or even younger, according to his son, where he lied about his age to secure a position sweeping the floor.\n\n\"He was a creative type of person,\" said Garshon. \"Doing somebody's hair, he thought of what style would look best on them to fit their face and created it.\"\n\nHe later moved to Virginia, where he became a U.S. citizen and did hair for about 50 years. He focused more on women's hair, his son said, because he liked the artistry of it.\n\n\"Being a stylist in the same city for around 50 years, he knew almost everybody,\" Garshon said.\n\nIt was in a salon where he met his wife, Peggy, in the 1960s. He told the Oyster Point in 1999 that \"Peggy was the queen of her class\" in 1962 and he was \"noted as the most eligible bachelor in Newport News.\"\n\nThe two married in 1972 and Peggy began working as his assistant in 1973. She brought in two daughters from a previous marriage and the couple later had Garshon together. Morgenstein continued his work as a stylist right up until he got sick.\n\n\"My dad was a completely extroverted person,\" Garshon said. \"He loved to go to, like, 7-Eleven and we would be sitting in the car and I would say 'See that guy standing outside, I bet you $5 you won't talk to that guy up there' and he was like 'Of course I will'...so he would go out there and talk to the guy for a couple of minutes,\" he reminisced. \"That was just like a silly thing that was so mind-blowing for me because he could talk to anybody. But that was just kind of his personality.\"\n\nHis dad had other endearing quirks too, Garshon explained, like collecting items on the roadside, enjoying the occasional scratch-off ticket or dedicating himself to driving his wife around everywhere she needed to go.\n\n\"He loved to talk to people, loved the grandkids,\" he said. \"Just a super duper people person. Even if he was going to the grocery store for a couple of items, my mom would always get mad because he'd be gone for, like, an hour and a half because he'd be in there talking to every single person because he knows everybody.\"\n\n'I never really got to say goodbye'\n\nOn July 8, Garshon got a call from his mother while he was in a different city on contract work. She said his father was having trouble breathing and they were headed to the emergency room. He was admitted for a hospital stay there, during which Garshon was able to speak to him a few times on the phone.\n\n\"I remember saying 'You need to hurry up and get home because, you know, I just started this job and you're not dying today' or 'You're not gonna die in there,'\" Garshon said.\n\nA few days later, on July 10, the medical staff considered sending Morgenstein home but Peggy told her son she didn't think it was a good idea to do so. They decided to stay. From there, Garshon said, things went downhill quickly and his dad was soon transferred to the ICU.\n\n\"They couldn't figure out what was going on with him, and they tried to do a bunch of different tests and then they started doing blood cultures,\" he said. \"So then it came back with a listeria and meningitis and I was like 'what the heck is that?'\"\n\nUSDA and CDC investigation documents and medical records reviewed by USA TODAY confirmed that Morgenstein tested positive for meningoencephalitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and/or infection of the meninges and brain, and bloodstream infection/sepsis.\n\nFurther testing confirmed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. Both conditions were attributed as \"Listeria meningoencephalitis/sepsis,\" meaning they were caused by the presence of the listeria pathogen, according to medical and investigative records. The mode of transmission was marked as foodborne.\n\nThe records also indicated some other underlying conditions. A copy of Morgenstein's death certificate reviewed by USA TODAY listed his immediate cause of death as Listeria meningoencephalitis.\n\nAfter finding out what his father was suffering from, Garshon and his family began combing back through his father's diet, trying to identify what could have delivered the pathogen. Many of these details were also listed on investigation records.\n\nHe was a fan of bagels and lox, cheese and only purchased Boar's Head deli meat. After Googling his father's diagnosis, Garshon came across a notice of the Boar's Head recall and the family began looking back through grocery receipts.\n\nIt was then they discovered that Morgenstein had purchased recalled Boar's Head liverwurst that matched the purchase-by date, lot number and production and consumption timeline of the outbreak. In the meantime, Morgenstein continued to deteriorate. He was given antibiotics but lost most of his ability to communicate, save for a few head nods and shakes.\n\nNearly 10 days in, doctors delivered the unfortunate news that even if he were able to pull through this, Morgenstein would have extensive and permanent damage that would require round-the-clock care. He would \"no longer be the person\" his family knew.\n\n\"My mom couldn't keep sitting there, watching him suffer anymore,\" Garshon said. \"And that was that. I think if he was a little younger, it might have been something that he would have been able to beat.\"\n\n\"I never really got to say goodbye when he was coherent,\" he added.\n\nMorgenstein died on July 18, 2024, 10 days after entering the hospital.\n\nHealth officials link third death to Boar's Head listeria outbreak\n\nHealth officials sent blood samples taken from Morgenstein to the CDC, which uses these samples to trace an illness's origin.\n\nA CDC spokesperson told USA TODAY that the CDC and state health departments use advanced laboratory methods, called whole genome sequencing, to determine if the listeria from a sick person is the same listeria making other people sick over the same time frame.\n\n\"State health departments verify death certificates and medical records for the cause of death to determine if a person’s foodborne illness led to them passing away. CDC only reports deaths in foodborne outbreaks if those deaths have been deemed attributable to the foodborne illness,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe CDC reported Morgenstein as the third confirmed death linked to the ongoing listeria outbreak on Aug. 8.\n\nBoar's Head responds to illnesses, deaths\n\nBoar's Head issued the following response to USA TODAY.\n\n\"We deeply regret the impact this recall has had on affected families. No words can fully express our sympathies and the sincere and deep hurt we feel for those who have suffered losses or endured illness.\n\nWe are conducting an extensive investigation in partnership with leading food safety experts to determine how our liverwurst produced at our Jarratt, Virginia facility was adulterated and to prevent it from happening again.\n\nAs soon as we learned of a possible health risk with our liverwurst, we immediately and voluntarily recalled it and then expanded our recall out of an abundance of caution to include additional products made at the same plant over the same period of time. We have paused production at this facility and will not resume until we are confident that it meets the standards our customers expect and deserve. Consumer health and wellness are, and always have been, our top priorities.\"\n\nThe human toll\n\nThe CDC told USA TODAY that recalls of this kind may seem more common than in the past because we have better methods of testing. Outbreaks themselves may not be on the rise, according to health officials, but the improved testing and tracing means widespread recalls and notices of foodborne illness and beyond certainly have been.\n\nWith a slew of warnings dominating headlines almost daily - from baby formula and deli meat to airbags and candles - the alarm bells can soon become another thrum in the background of our lives; ever-present but easy to forget.\n\nBut for families like the Morgensteins, those passing headlines represent something they can never recover − the immeasurable human toll − the one that can't be quantified by a data set, an infographic or even a rising death toll.\n\n\"(My dad) grew up in the Holocaust, so obviously he was a Holocaust survivor and that's part of the irony of the whole thing,\" said Morgenstein. \"Surviving something like that as long as he did, you know, only to (meet his end) by deli meat.\"\n\nThe family is seeking legal action related to Morgenstein's death.\n\nAnthony Coveny of Ron Simon & Associates, the office handling the family's case, told USA TODAY the firm has represented thousands of victims of foodborne illness, estimating the number of yearly food poisoning illnesses in the U.S. at 48 million, with about 3,000 of those dying as a result. These statistics are likewise reported by the USDA.\n\nWhat is the solution? If you ask Coveny and like-minded litigators, it's strict adherence to good manufacturing practices, known in the industry as GMPs, and steep payouts to victims when they're not followed. The CDC and regulating agencies focus on identifying, tracing, tracking and sourcing down the origins of spreading bacteria and advice on what foods not to eat.\n\nThe USDA and lawmakers look towards legislation for a solution, while environmental and animal activist groups decry the state of food production and consumption, specifically through the lens of animal-derived products, as a whole.\n\nWhether a talking point on a politician's track record, a success story on a lawyer's website or a truly monumental breakthrough in food science, one fact remains: no solution is as valuable as one that one that saves human lives.\n\nAs for the Morgensteins, any progress will be welcomed, even if it is supremely bittersweet. And even if that colossal change isn't imminent, Garshon said there's one thing he knows for sure: his dad would want his story shared.\n\n\"He would have wanted this, his story told,\" said Morgenstein. \"So I just have to try to be his voice.\"\n\nMorgenstein's spirit was powerful enough to convince even his introverted son to pick up the phone and try his damnedest to remind people it's not about how the story ended, but about how his dad lived it.\n\nToward the end of the interview, Garshon was asked to sum up his dad in just a few words.\n\nA long pause, a tear, a glance at the sky, as if waiting for one final answer from the dad who seemed to know it all.\n\n\"Somebody who I wish I was more like,\" he finally said. \"Just a really good person.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/09/16/boars-head-deli-meat-listeria-timeline/75253009007/", "title": "Boar's Head listeria outbreak timeline: Deaths, factory closure and ...", "text": "Boar's Head announced Friday that it would be closing its Jarratt, Virginia plant permanently in the latest news out of the multistate listeria outbreak that has killed nine.\n\nThe deadly outbreak was first reported July 19 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was followed by a recall of roughly 7.2 million pounds of product by Boar's Head. At least 57 people have been hospitalized as a result of the outbreak across 18 states, including nine deaths as of Aug. 28, according to the CDC investigation.\n\nThe Jarratt plant was identified as the source of the issue, prompting the company to close it and, in turn, put around 500 people out of work. This update, while major, is only one in the ongoing saga, which has resulted in a multi-agency investigation, several lawsuits and, and calls for a congressional investigation.\n\nHere's a timeline of what we know so far about the outbreak.\n\nThe human toll:His dad died from listeria tied to Boar’s Head meat. He needed to share his story.\n\nJuly 19: CDC announces listeria outbreak\n\nThe CDC announced that public health officials in several states and the U.S. Department of Agriculture were working in tandem with the CDC to track and collect data and samples in a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections, or listeriosis.\n\nInitially, the agency said the outbreak appeared to be associated with meats sliced at deli counters but did not have further information on the source.\n\nOn July 19, the CDC reported 28 cases of illness across 12 states, including two deaths and one sick pregnant person. The deaths occurred in Illinois and New Jersey.\n\nJuly 26: Boar's Head announces liverwurst recall; CDC update\n\nBoar's Head Provisions Co., Inc. issued a recall for more than 207,528 pounds of product, including all of its liverwurst products, due to potential listeria contamination.\n\nThe recalled ready-to-eat liverwurst products were produced between June 11, 2024 and July 17, 2024, and have a 44-day shelf life. The products were distributed to retail deli locations nationwide and are labeled with the establishment number “EST. 12612.\"\n\nBoar's Head recalled additional deli meat products that were produced on the same line and on the same day as the liverwurst, including ready-to-eat deli meat with establishment number “EST. 12612.” produced on June 27, 20424.\n\nThe same day, the CDC released new investigation information, reporting 34 illnesses linked to the outbreak across 13 states, including 33 hospitalizations and two deaths.\n\nJuly 26: First lawsuit filed\n\nA Missouri couple, represented by Law firm OFT Food Safety & Injury Lawyers, filed a complaint in St. Louis Circuit Court naming Boar's Head Provisions, Co., Inc. and Schnucks Markets, Inc. as defendants.\n\nThe complaint alleged that Patrick and Sue Fleming purchased Boar's Head liverwurst from their local Schnucks grocery store in June, resulting in a \"life-threatening Listeria infection\" for Sue, 88.\n\nThe suit alleged Fleming spent nine days in the hospital receiving “intensive treatment” before being transferred to a rehabilitation center where she spent another 11 days. Court documents said the couple suffered damages tied to the cost of medical treatment, as well as physical and mental pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, shortened life expectancy and damage to the marital relationship.\n\nThe 76 and 88-year-olds sought $25,000 in injuries and damages, accusing Boar's Head and Shnucks of multiple counts of negligence, as well as manufacturing defects and breach of implied warranty.\n\nJuly 30: Boar's Head expands recall\n\nBoar's Head expanded its recall to all products produced at the Jarratt, Virginia plant where the contaminated liverwurst came from.\n\nThe expanded recall added an additional 7 million pounds of meat and poultry products ranging from beef, bologna, ham, liverwurst and salami, among others. Now totaling 71 Boar’s Head and Old Country products made between May 10 and July 29, the recall swelled to cover about 7.2 million pounds.\n\nJuly 31: CDC update\n\nCDC issued an update along with the Boar's Head recall, still reporting 43 illnesses including one death.\n\nAugust 1: Class action lawsuit filed in New York\n\nA potential class action lawsuit against Boar’s Head Provisions, Co. Inc. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, accusing the company of “improperly, deceptively, and misleadingly labeled and marketed its products,” by failing the full extent of possible contamination by Listeria monocytogenes.\n\nThe plaintiff, Rita Torres, alleged that she and other “reasonable customers” would not have purchased Boar's Head liverwurst and other products had the company properly warned consumers about possible bacterial contamination. The suit called the initial July 26 recall insufficient and “deliberately designed to preclude the vast majority of customers from receiving a recall.”\n\nAugust 7: Pregnant victim files lawsuit\n\nA pregnant woman from Minnesota \"who nearly lost her unborn child\" filed a lawsuit against Boar's Head after she was infected by listeria from eating the company's deli meat sold at a Florida Publix, said OFT Food Safety & Injury Lawyers.\n\nFiled in the District of Minnesota, the first federal lawsuit of the outbreak sought \"an amount far greater than\" $75,000 and \"other relief as the court may find just and equitable.\"\n\nAugust 8: CDC increases number of dead and sick\n\nThe CDC released an update on the investigation, now reporting 43 people infected and hospitalized across 13 states, including three total deaths including one from Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia.\n\nThe CDC also confirmed the epidemiology of the outbreak and tied it to Boar's Head liverwurst.\n\nAugust 20: Most recent CDC update\n\nJust 12 days later, new numbers from the CDC reflected six more deaths and 14 new hospitalizations across 18 total states. This brought the number of deaths up to a total of nine and sick and hospitalized up to 57.\n\nOf the six new deaths, one occurred in Florida, one in Tennessee, one in New Mexico, one in New York and two in South Carolina. Infections also appeared in five additional states since the early August update, including Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nThese are the latest numbers the CDC has provided in the investigation.\n\nAugust 29: Boar's Head inspection records are released\n\nCopies of inspection reports filed between 2023 and 2024 by inspectors with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) were obtained by CBS News and other news sources, including USA TODAY, through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe records showed 69 reports of \"noncompliance\" at the Jarratt, Virginia plant, including reports of insects live and dead black and green mold, as well as mildew, dripping and standing water and other unsanitary conditions within the plant in the weeks leading up to the July recall.\n\nLater, more FSIS records were released dating back to January 2022 including reports of leaks and condescension dripping over areas with product, \"sludge,\" \"black smudges,\" \"slimy\" materials and other residues found on machines and in several rooms across the facility, \"putrid,\" \"off\" odors, \"thick and flaking rust\" in several locations including above production lines, and dirt, screws and trash were seen strewn on the floor of production areas.\n\nAugust 30: First wrongful death lawsuit filed\n\nThe first wrongful death lawsuit was filed against Boar's Head on behalf of the family of an 88-year-old Virginia grandfather, master hairstylist and Holocaust survivor who died after eating contaminated liverwurst.\n\nFiled in Sarasota, Florida, the suit explained that Morgenstein purchased later-recalled Boar's Head liverwurst on June 30, 2024, from his local Harris Teeter store and became ill after consuming it.\n\nHe was hospitalized on July 8 and was later found to be suffering from sepsis and listeriosis that was later traced by to Boar's Head meat by the CDC. Despite \"aggressive measures,\" he died on July 18 surrounded by his wife of 50 years and his son Garshon, who USA TODAY previously spoke to about his father's life and legacy.\n\nSeptember 6: Multi-million dollar lawsuit hits Boar's Head\n\nA new multi-million dollar lawsuit is filed by food safety attorney Bill Marler on behalf of Virginia resident Barbara Schmidt.\n\nThe suit alleged that Schmidt consumed Boar's Head liverwurst and subsequently became so ill, that she was admitted to the hospital and spent weeks there, including at least six days in the ICU undergoing \"invasive procedures that were necessary to save her life,\" and then rehab for roughly 10.\n\nPublic health officials determined that Schmidt had not only suffered a listeria infection but it was caused by the Boar's Head outbreak, court documents said. Accusing Boar's Head of multiple counts of negligence, breach of warranty, fraudulent concealment and breach of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, the lawsuit sought $1 million in compensatory damages as well as $10 million in punitive damages.\n\nSeptember 13: Boar's Head announces closure of Jarratt, Virginia plant\n\nBoar's Head announced the Jarratt, Virginia Boar's Head plant linked to the ongoing outbreak was closing permanently.\n\nAbout 500 union workers will be impacted by the closing, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 Union spokesman Jonathan Williams told USA TODAY. Additional employees in management were likely affected, too, but he was unsure how many were impacted, he said.\n\n\"Given the seriousness of the outbreak, and the fact that it originated at Jarratt, we have made the difficult decision to indefinitely close this location, which has not been operational since late July 2024,\" Boar's Head said in an email statement.\n\nThe company also said it would be permanently discontinuing its liverwurst products after investigations found the root cause of the contamination only existed at the Jarratt facility in the production of liverwurst.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/california/2024/08/30/has-deli-meat-listeria-outbreak-spread-to-california/75013123007/", "title": "These are all the states reporting sickness, deaths due to listeria ...", "text": "Six more people have died in America due to a listeria outbreak in over a dozen states linked to Boar's Head deli meat, the Centers for Disease Control reported on Wednesday.\n\nListeriosis infections from the recalled deli meat have also caused at least 57 hospitalizations across 18 states since the CDC investigation began on July 19, according to health officials.\n\nThis outbreak is the largest listeriosis outbreak since 2011, the CDC reported.\n\nHere’s what Californians should know.\n\nListeria outbreak 2024: Which states have been affected?\n\nThe following states have reported at least one person infected by the listeria outbreak, according to the CDC.\n\nThose are:\n\nArizona\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMinnesota\n\nWisconsin\n\nMissouri\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nTennessee\n\nGeorgia\n\nFlorida\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nVirginia\n\nMaryland\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNew York\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMassachusetts\n\nThe nine deaths linked to the outbreak were reported in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, New York and South Carolina.\n\nThe “true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” the CDC said.\n\nMore:Boar's Head plant linked to listeria outbreak had bugs, mold and mildew, inspectors say\n\nWhich Boar’s Head lunch meat, liverwurst products have been recalled?\n\nOn July 26, Boar’s Head recalled about 207,528 pounds of products, including liverwurst and other deli meats, according to the Department of Agriculture.

For now. For about a month and a half.\n\nThe country came within two hours of a federal government shutdown, but in a day with multiple twists Congress ultimately passed a temporary plan to keep the lights on until mid-November.\n\nA continuing resolution, the temporary stopgap measure, passed the House Saturday afternoon and the Senate Saturday night. President Joe Biden signed it shortly before midnight.\n\nThe work is not done, and lawmakers will return Monday to continue hashing out annual spending bills.\n\nCongress remains divided on the biggest fight in the shutdown showdown: providing more Ukraine aid. Democrats and some Republicans have called to approve more money to help Ukraine fight against the Russian invasion, but some Republicans want to stop providing aid and instead focus on securing America's southern border.\n\nSenate passes short-term stopgap, averting government shutdown\n\nThe Senate approved the House's short-term stopgap measure to extend government funding levels through Nov. 17 by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 88-9.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed it shortly before midnight, successfully averting a government shutdown.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill Senate Majority Chuck Schumer pass the deal too?\n\nAfter the House shocked the country and passed a short-term deal to keep the government's doors open until mid-November, all eyes are on the Senate to sign off on the measure.\n\nBut the Senate can't pass their own deal to avoid a government shutdown. Both chambers have to pass the same agreement to avoid a government shutdown, with the same details to keep funding flowing.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long is the government funded?\n\nLawmakers on Saturday passed a continuing resolution, which is a temporary funding plan that buys lawmakers more time to negotiate spending legislation for the country.\n\nThe continuing resolution House lawmakers passed keeps the government funded for another 45 days. While the Senate hasn’t voted on the legislation yet, they’re expected to take it up Saturday evening.\n\nIf at the end of that 45-day period Congress hasn’t come up with another temporary solution, or actually approved the dozen spending bills that would grant the government longer-term funding, the nation will be facing another government shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHouse Democrats take victory lap after chamber passes 45-day, short-term funding measure\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., celebrated the passage of the 45-day, short-term measure that will keep the government funded at current levels, saying “the extreme MAGA Republicans have lost.”\n\n“The American people have won. The extreme MAGA Republicans have lost,” Jeffries said at a press conference. “It was a victory for the American people and a complete and total surrender by right-wing extremists who throughout the year have attempted to hijack the Congress.”\n\nHouse Minority Whip, Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said McCarthy “admitted defeat,” when he put the measure on the floor.\n\n“Speaker McCarthy admitted defeat and asked Democrats to put out the fire that he and his party had started,” Clark said.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nIn significant step towards averting government shutdown, House passes 45-day stopgap measure\n\nThe House made significant progress towards averting a government shutdown, with lawmakers passing a short-term stopgap measure to keep the government funded for 45 days at current levels. The funding package includes President Joe Biden’s request for $16 billion in additional disaster relief funding, but omits his request for more U.S. aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe bill, which had to pass with two-thirds of the chamber, earned bipartisan support from Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWhile it is unclear if the Senate will approve the measure, the stopgap marks a significant shift in strategy from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to cooperate with Democrats, after his previous insistence on passing a stopgap bill along party-lines.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats: 'I think we won'\n\nHouse Democrats are largely expected to support a temporary measure to keep the government open with funding at current levels. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told reporters before entering the chamber that the stopgap \"is a bill that Democrats can support.\"While GOP lawmakers were consumed by infighting, House Democrats repeatedly urged House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to put the short-term deal on the floor. The 45-day extension, McGovern said, is a sign Democrats \"won.\"– Ken Tran\n\nHouse begins vote on stopgap measure\n\nHouse lawmakers are now voting on the 45-day short-term stopgap measure to keep the government open.If passed, the Senate will have to take up the bill and vote on it to avert a shutdown.– Ken Tran\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy before government shuts down\n\nThe White House said Friday that President Joe Biden will not meet with McCarthy to negotiate a deal before the government shuts down, demanding that House Republicans act to avoid a crisis of their making.\n\n“The conversation that needs to happen is between speaker McCarthy and his caucus,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nBiden plans to spend the weekend in Washington and will be in touch with members of Congress, the White House said. The House voted Friday afternoon to defeat a resolution backed by hardline Republicans to keep the government operating for 30 days in exchange for 30% cuts that the White House warned would be “devastating.”\n\n−Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman accused of pulling fire alarm in House office building\n\nAs Democrats worked to delay a vote on the stopgap measure, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., was accused of pulling a fire alarm in the Cannon House office building, according to Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., chair of the House Administration Committee.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Steil said \"an investigation is currently underway.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Bowman's office for comment.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow long was the longest government shutdown?\n\nThe longest government shutdown lasted 35 days. Spanning from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019, it is also the most recent federal shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was the third federal shutdown to occur during former President Donald Trump's administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n− Olivia Munson\n\nDemocrats on Senate floor urge colleagues to prevent shutdown, stand with Ukraine\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., on Saturday urged House members to stand with the people of Ukraine and provide aid to the country.\n\n“The Republican House leadership is not only trying to remove all assistance for Ukraine, but literally trying to prevent our Defense Department, our State Department and other agencies from transferring already existing funds to those necessary areas that are gonna be most in jeopardy if we walk away from Ukraine at this moment in time,” he said on the Senate floor.\n\n“We need to stand up for Ukraine,” he added.\n\nIn an effort to avoid a shutdown, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., also urged her colleagues to keep moving the Senate’s bipartisan continuing resolution forward.\n\nThe shutdown “will hurt our families. It will hurt our economy. And it will hurt our national security,” Murray warned.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHouse Democrats continue to stall vote to read through temporary measure\n\nIn a bid to buy more time for House Democrats to read a 71-page stopgap measure proposed by House Republicans to keep the government runing, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is using what is referred to as a \"magic minute\" to delay the vote.Under House rules, leadership is able to speak for an unlimited amount of time. McCarthy in November 2021 spoke for over eight hours to delay Biden's \"Build Back Better\" bill.\"Strap in, because this may take a while,\" Jeffries said on the House floor.– Ken Tran\n\nWill schools be affected by a government shutdown?\n\nMost K-12 schools won't be immediately impacted by a government shutdown. While schools across the country do receive some federal funding, the vast majority of their budgets come from their state and local governments.\n\nSchools that do use federal funding have mostly already received money for the 2023-2024 school year, Education Week reported.\n\nBut some programs for kids would be hit by a government shutdown. For example, Children from low-income families could lose access to Head Start preschool programs.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nLatest updates on government shutdown: McCarthy blames Dems\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Saturday afternoon said he's going to be \"the adult in the room,\" immediately pointing the finger at Senate Democrats, the White House and hardline House conservatives like Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., for why the shutdown threat continues.\n\nHe said the House is moving a 45-day continuing resolution that would keep troops paid, the Federal Aviation Administration funded and pay for disaster relief in Maui and elsewhere.\n\nAs House Democrats asked for more time to consider that bill, McCarthy questioned whether President Joe Biden and the White House are urging House Democrats to vote for or against the short-term spending measure.\n\nThe Senate, McCarthy said, has not done its work. But most of the shutdown threat has come from House Republican infighting. Senators will vote on their version of a continuing resolution Saturday afternoon.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nMcCarthy says he's not worried about losing his job\n\nA defiant and determined House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters early Saturday afternoon he's not afraid of Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., or other members of his right flank threatening to remove him.\n\n\"If somebody wants to remove me for putting Americans first then so be it,\" McCarthy said.\n\nGaetz has threatened to file a motion to vacate the speaker if McCarthy works with Democrats to pass a continuing resolution that would extend current funding levels, avert a shutdown and give lawmakers more time to work on spending bills.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nHouse Democrats delay vote, citing 'trust issues'\n\nHouse Democrats are delaying a vote on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's 45-day continuing resolution, a short-term measure designed to keep the government funded, in order to read the bill.House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said on the House floor there are \"trust issues\" with Republicans.To buy them more time to read the 71-page bill, Democrats filed a motion to adjourn. Democratic lawmakers have slowly been trickling in to the chamber to vote, further delaying the bill to peruse the stopgap measure.−Ken Tran\n\nHouse to vote on short-term funding measure\n\nExiting a conference meeting, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters a short-term stopgap measure will be considered on the House floor Saturday.The stopgap bill would maintain current government funding levels for 45 days and include President Joe Biden's request for disaster relief funding, but no additional aid to Ukraine.The measure, which will be considered under suspension to expedite the process, will require two-thirds of the chamber to be approved, meaning Democrats will have to support the measure.−Ken Tran\n\nStopgap measure likely to trigger motion to oust Speaker McCarthy\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy's move to vote on a 45-day short-term stopgap measure that would avert a government shutdown could inflame another fight in the House.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., could follow through on his threat to file a motion to vacate in an attempt to boot McCarthy from the speakership.\n\nThe stopgap, considered a \"clean continuing resolution\" would maintain current funding levels to buy more time for lawmakers to pass a more fleshed-out spending deal.\n\nGaetz has threatened to move to eject McCarthy from the speakership if he puts a clean stopgap on the floor and told USA TODAY Saturday morning his position has not changed and called the measure a \"white flag of surrender.\"\n\n\"It looks a lot like a white flag of surrender to me,\" Gaetz said, accusing McCarthy of surrendering to Democrats and President Joe Biden.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nIssa: Focus to 'mitigate' effects of a shutdown, not avert one\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., leaving a closed-door conference meeting Saturday morning, told reporters there are a handful of hardline conservatives who won't vote for a stopgap measure under any circumstances. The focus now, he said, is to mitigate the effects of a shutdown.House Republicans will look at what is \"passable\" on the floor, suggesting the House will vote to sustain troop pay and reauthorization for the Federal Aviation Agency first.\"It is our obligation to anticipate and do whatever we can to mitigate it,\" Issa said.– Ken Tran\n\nWhat causes a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown takes place when Congress is unable to pass a dozen annual spending bills that funnel money to government programs and agencies.\n\nA shutdown is likely when both chambers in Congress − the House and Senate − can’t come to an agreement on how much money to allocate to certain agencies or agree on certain spending provisions, putting federal agencies at risk. A partial government shutdown can occur if Congress is able to pass any of the 12 individual spending bills.\n\nWhen both chambers can't reach a compromise, funding levels expire and federal agencies must cease all non-essential function.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nWho is causing the government shutdown?\n\nThe biggest fight comes from a small group of House conservatives who have been impeding nearly all progress toward funding the government.\n\nThese House conservatives make up a small portion of the House GOP conference and represent a sliver of the country, but they have outsized power because of the razor-thin House Republican majority. The GOP has a four-seat majority, and these hard-line conservatives have been leveraging their critical votes to extract deep spending cuts that won't pass the Democratic-controlled Senate − or even some moderate GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe most vocal of this handful is Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who has threatened to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., if he works with Democrats to pass a continuing resolution that would avert a shutdown and give lawmakers extra time to pass spending bills.\n\nTheir refusal to entertain anything less than their demands has embroiled the House in chaos for the last few weeks.\n\n−Ken Tran and Rachel Looker\n\nWhen will the government shutdown start?\n\nThe U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.\n\nThe continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWould a government shutdown affect air travel and TSA?\n\nFlights will likely not be affected by a shutdown and TSA screenings should proceed normally. Transportation Security Administration agents and air traffic controllers are considered essential and will continue working, though they won’t be paid.\n\nHowever, during the 2019 shutdown, air traffic controllers started calling in sick at higher rates which might occur again this time around. The White House warned that a shutdown could risk delays for travelers.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also said in a press conference that air traffic controller hiring and training would be paused, which would impact the Department of Transportation’s efforts to address a shortfall in staffing.\n\n−Zach Wichter and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Social Security be paid during a government shutdown?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Yosemite or other national parks close if there is a government shutdown?\n\nThe Biden administration said Friday it will be forced to close the majority of national parks if the government shuts down at the end of the week resulting in funding to lapse.\n\n“Gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed” at national parks across the country, the Interior Department said in a statement. The public will be encouraged not to visit park sites during a shutdown.\n\nThe National Mall in Washington, Washington Monument and other park sites that are “physically accessible” to the public will remain accessible but staffing will vary site to site and not be guaranteed.\n\nThe National Park System has 425 individual sites that includes 63 national parks made up of iconic landmarks like the Grand Canyon National Park, Everglades National Park and Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\n-Joey Garrison\n\nWhat happens in a government shutdown?\n\nMillions of Americans would be impacted by a government shutdown.\n\nFederal workers would be furloughed without pay. \"Essential\" federal workers, such as those who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, would work without pay − but would receive backpay once a shutdown ends. Numerous subcontractors would be out of work and would not receive backpay.\n\nThe impact would stretch far beyond federal workers though. It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.\n\nHere are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:\n\nFunding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately\n\nFood stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that\n\nChildren from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs\n\nCollege students could see delays in their student loans\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work\n\nTravelers could see delays with receiving passports\n\nNational parks could close\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief\n\nAgencies that publish government data, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, will close up shop. That means investors and other market-watchers might not get to see the jobs report scheduled for October 6 or the monthly Consumer Price Index update on October 12\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission would scale back operations, potentially delaying work on initial public offerings, which require federal scrutiny.

It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding.That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency.And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in thelaw:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/01/government-shutdown-2023/70480762007/", "title": "Government shutdown 2023: What Congress is saying about ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Congress is out for its August recess but lawmakers will have a monumental task ahead of them when they return to Washington in September – funding the federal government.\n\nOnce lawmakers get back to Capitol Hill in mid-September, the House and Senate will be in session for roughly three weeks until the Sep. 30 deadline to pass a federal budget. On Oct. 1, a new fiscal year begins. If lawmakers cannot push through 11 out of 12 separate spending bills, after passing just one before the August recess, the country will face a government shutdown.\n\nHowever, lawmakers could pass a continuing resolution, which would avert a shutdown and fund the government at current levels until an agreed upon date.\n\nBut with a deeply divided Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate, it is unclear whether lawmakers can avert a shutdown in time. The outcome is even murkier with some Republicans from the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative lawmakers, either openly welcoming a shutdown or dismissing concerns about one.\n\n“We should not fear a government shutdown,\" Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., a member of the Freedom Caucus said at a press conference last week. \"Most of the American people won't even miss if the government is shut down temporarily.\"\n\nHere's how lawmakers are progressing in funding talks and how a government shutdown could affect you.\n\nWhat are House lawmakers fighting about?\n\nThe major fight on government spending is happening in the House, where Republicans hold a slim five-seat majority.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus have been demanding deeper cuts across the board from House GOP leadership after the debt ceiling negotiations between House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, D-Calif., and President Joe Biden. Hardline conservatives felt like they were left out of those conversations.\n\n“We gave up all that leverage,” Good told reporters last week about the debt ceiling negotiations. With the funding debate coming up in September, Good urged his colleagues to leverage a shutdown.\n\n“If (a government shutdown) is a requirement to break bad habits, so be it. And this town has a bad habits problem,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., another member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters last Tuesday.\n\nAnother sticking point for House conservatives is their insistence on leadership to vote on 12 separate bills funding the government as opposed to one large “omnibus” spending bill, a practice Congress has become accustomed to over past years. Voting on the 12 separate bills was a key concession McCarthy made to Freedom Caucus members in his pursuit of the speakership back in January − a position he won after 15 historic rounds of voting.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mo., another member of the Freedom Caucus, said he will refuse to approve any funding legislation until all 12 bills are moved out of committee so he can see the total cost of spending.\n\nWill Congress take steps to buy more time?\n\nOne option if Congress cannot come to a deal before Sep. 30 is to pass a continuing resolution, which will keep funding at or close to current levels to buy lawmakers more time at the negotiating table.\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., a key GOP leadership ally and negotiator during the debt ceiling discussions, said last Wednesday he would only consider a continuing resolution for a “limited time.”\n\n“It’s not my first preference,” Graves told USA TODAY, adding a continuing resolution would extend Democratic policies from last year's spending bill when Democrats still controlled the House which he said was not “in our interest.”\n\nEven then, it is uncertain whether a continuing resolution could pass. Some members from the House Freedom Caucus, including Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., have said they have no plans to support a continuing resolution. Other lawmakers, when asked, have avoided discussing the idea.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said lawmakers from both the House and Senate should start negotiations during the August recess to beat the Sep. 30 deadline.\n\n“We can be starting those negotiations over the August work period and then come back in September to finish what’s left,” he said during a press conference last week.\n\nWhat can pass in both chambers?\n\nHouse Republicans have been pushing through a litany of amendments with deeper spending cuts related to conservative culture wars, such as limiting abortion access for service members and blocking the VA from displaying pride flags.\n\nThe ambitious policy changes have little to no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. The White House has already issued a veto threat for one appropriations bill the House passed along party line votes last Thursday.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told USA TODAY Democrats won’t support spending bills if Republicans “put cultural stuff in there.”\n\n“They know that and they will be perceived as responsible for shutting down the government, which I think hurts them politically,” Hoyer said.\n\nHe added that a government shutdown is \"not just bad policy, it's stupid.\"\n\nCongressional Progressive Caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the country could see a shutdown because of the far-right GOP, adding that many amendments they are pushing for are stripping freedoms away from Americans.\n\n\"It's offensive,\" she said. \"It is not what the American people need and they have no interest in trying to legislate for what we actually need to do in this body.\"\n\nMcCarthy has dismissed concerns that the House’s spending plans have no chance in the Senate, telling reporters before the August recess that he met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to begin negotiations early to avoid a shutdown.\n\nWhat does a government shutdown do?\n\nIf the government shuts down, you can expect various government functions to slow down.\n\nBut every shutdown slightly differs. The Office and Management and Budget coordinates plans for a shutdown developed by each federal agency. These plans are updated on a rolling basis.\n\nThe OMB tells the agencies what functions must continue under certain exceptions, such as being considered essential or being a program that does not require annual authorization from Congress.\n\nFederal employees who do not work in services considered essential are prevented from doing their jobs and those who are considered essential see their paychecks paused. During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, around 800,000 federal employees were either furloughed or working without pay. After the shutdown ends, those employees receive retroactive pay for the length of the shutdown.\n\nSome of the services considered essential include flights, border patrol, Social Security and Medicare benefits. Workers involved in those services, such as air traffic controllers, work without pay.\n\nBut even those essential services could be impacted by a shutdown as well. During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, which lasted 35 days and was the longest shutdown, some TSA agents and air traffic controllers were unable to work due to financial limitations, resulting in crowded airports, flight delays and terminal closures.\n\nAmong other ways a shutdown could affect you:\n\nNational parks: Some national parks might close and others could offer limited services.\n\nSome national parks might close and others could offer limited services.

Food inspections: The Food and Drug Administration will have to halt food inspections, potentially impacting the country’s food supply.\n\nGovernment shutdown history: What happened in the past?\n\nThe past few government shutdowns have been over specific policy disputes. Heading into September, it is unclear what the main point of contention will be in Congress.\n\nDec. 2018 - Jan. 2019: This was the longest government shutdown in the history of the U.S., lasting 35 days. Former President Donald Trump pushed for funding for construction of a wall on the southern border but Democratic lawmakers refused to support any spending bill with provisions for a wall. Trump ultimately declared a national emergency to bypass Congress and finance the wall.\n\nThis was the longest government shutdown in the history of the U.S., lasting 35 days. Former President Donald Trump pushed for funding for construction of a wall on the southern border but Democratic lawmakers refused to support any spending bill with provisions for a wall. Trump ultimately declared a national emergency to bypass Congress and finance the wall. Jan. 2018: The government shut down for three days. Democratic lawmakers attempted to pressure Trump to protect recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The shutdown was resolved after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised Democrats to continue negotiations and hold a floor vote on immigration reform.\n\nThe government shut down for three days. Democratic lawmakers attempted to pressure Trump to protect recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The shutdown was resolved after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised Democrats to continue negotiations and hold a floor vote on immigration reform. Oct. 2013: The government shut down for 17 days. Republican lawmakers, who were heavily opposed to former President Barack Obama's then-new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, attempted to delay the implementation of the legislation. GOP leadership ultimately backed away from its fight as the shutdown progressed.\n\nIn the Senate, 'cooler heads will prevail'\n\nSeveral senators from both sides of the aisle, however, told USA TODAY they do not think a government shutdown is likely.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said there are “zero” chances of a shutdown.\n\n“We did a bill a couple of years back that guarantees all federal employees get paid if there’s a shutdown,” Kaine said. “So why would you shut the door and still pay people to not come into the office and serve their fellow Americans?”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she is “not planning on a government shutdown.”\n\n“Won’t happen,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “I don’t think anybody benefits from a government shutdown.”\n\n“Cooler heads will prevail,” he added.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/17/congress-government-shutdown-continuing-resolution/72241387007/", "title": "Is there going to be a government shutdown?

Lawmakers have less than three days to change course.\n\nA partial government shutdown will set in later this week if Congress fails to act, and a slew of other departments would close their doors for Americans next month.\n\nIt's not all bad news: Congress is gearing up to vote in the coming days on a bipartisan deal to temporarily avoid a shutdown. The measure – known as a continuing resolution – was unveiled over the weekend and would fund parts of the government until March 1 and the remainder until March 8.\n\nBut Republicans are still squabbling over a potential agreement and aiming their anger at House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Here's what you need to know about the looming government shutdown and what it means for your family.\n\nWhen is the next government shutdown?\n\nIf Republicans and Democrats can't come together, funding for federal transportation programs, housing and food plans and other resources will expire on Jan. 19. The deadline for the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Labor, State and Defense comes two weeks later on Feb. 2.\n\nThe government shutting down in two phases is unusual. When lawmakers last kicked the funding can down the road in November, they set up the tiered approach.\n\nHow can Congress keep the government open?\n\nTime has once again run out for Congress to pass a long-term solution. That means leaders have to approve temporary legislation to avert a devastating shutdown that would impact millions of Americans.\n\nJohnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced a bipartisan agreement on spending levels for the government – referred to as a topline number – on Sunday.\n\n“Because the completion deadlines are upon us, a short continuing resolution is required to complete what House Republicans are working hard to achieve: an end to governance by omnibus, meaningful policy wins, and better stewardship of American tax dollars,” Johnson said in a statement following the bill’s release, referencing the massive pieces of legislation that often get tied up in spending fights.\n\nLawmakers aren't out of the woods yet. The potential compromise still has to pass the House and Senate before President Joe Biden can sign it into law.\n\nWill House Republicans reach an agreement?\n\nIt's not clear that some of the most conservative lawmakers in Congress will support the latest push to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nA handshake deal between Johnson and Schumer announced this month, which largely resembled the agreement former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Biden struck last summer in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, immediately enraged the House’s right flank.\n\nThose members tried to pressure Johnson into backing out of the deal last week in an effort to win deep spending cuts. But the speaker stuck by the arrangement and on Sunday revealed the current continuing resolution that could buy lawmakers more time to hash out a longer-term funding package.\n\nBut even if some Republican lawmakers refuse to support the temporary measure, Johnson may not need their votes. House Democrats signaled they will support the bill, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., saying in a letter to his Democratic colleagues that he will support it to “avoid a disruptive partial government shutdown.”\n\nHow does a government shutdown impact me?\n\nA government shutdown means all officials and federal agencies that aren't deemed “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors. If the government does shut down, thousands of federal employees would be furloughed.\n\n\"Essential\" federal workers, which range from air traffic controllers to emergency personnel in national parks, would work without pay, but they would receive back pay once a shutdown ends. Some subcontractors for the government could be out of work and would not receive back pay.\n\nA shutdown can also have significant impacts on Americans who don't work for the federal government. For example, some food assistance benefits could be delayed, and certain food safety inspections could be put on pause.\n\nSecretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack warned in a news briefing in September that, if a shutdown does occur, funding for WIC – or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children – could suffer immediately.\n\nDepending on a person's location, they could also lose access to HeadStart programs for childcare.\n\nContributing: Riley Beggin and Sudiksha Kochi, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/22/government-shutdown-2024-congress-deadline/71958121007/", "title": "Government shutdown 2024: Congress fights as deadline approaches", "text": "WASHINGTON – Millions of Americans face the threat of another government shutdown next year that could hit federal workers' jobs, nutrition benefits and more as lawmakers struggle to reach a compromise on spending.\n\nCongress passed two stopgap measures in recent months that temporarily funded the government at the end of September and in November.

It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.\n\nHere are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:\n\nFunding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately\n\nFood stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that\n\nChildren from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs\n\nCollege students could see delays in their student loans\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work\n\nTravelers could see delays with receiving passports\n\nNational parks could close\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nU.S. Postal Service not affected by a possible government shutdown\n\nThe Postal Service is an independent entity generally funded by the sale of its products and services − not tax dollars − and it will not be impacted by a government shutdown, USPS said in a statement. Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.\n\n\"Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,\" the statement said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nBiden says government shutdown not ‘inevitable,’ urges House Republicans ‘do their job’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Americans need House Republicans to “do their job” as he held out hope Wednesday that a government shutdown can be avoided before the end-of-week deadline for congressional action.\n\n“I don’t think anything is inevitable in politics,” Biden said, speaking in San Francisco at the president’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which recommends federal policy on science and technology.\n\nBiden said a government shutdown would impact “vital work in science and health” including cancer research and food-safety policies.\n\n“The American people need our Republican friends in the House of Representatives to do their job: Fund the government,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWill military get paid in October?\n\nMilitary pay for millions of active-duty service members and reservists could dry up with a government shutdown – a major difference between the current threatened shutdown and previous recent suspensions of non-essential spending.\n\n“Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress appropriates funds available to compensate them for this period of service,” the Defense Department said in a September memo to Pentagon leaders preparing for a potential lapse in spending.\n\nBut the department said personnel would continue working regardless. Federal workers are traditionally reimbursed for lapses in funding once Congress agrees to resume spending, but the lapse in paychecks can be difficult for staffers without savings.\n\n“Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties,” the department said in a Sept. 12 announcement in preparation for a shutdown.\n\nThe government has about 1.3 million active-duty service members and 800,000 reservists.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWill a government shutdown affect flights?\n\nThe deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.\n\nFunding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold. However, the agents who you typically interact with at airports and seaports, and the controllers who oversee your flights are considered essential and will be working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nImpacts on those agencies have more to do with things like hiring and training. All the crucial safety functions like inspections and air traffic control continue.\n\nConsular operations in the U.S. and internationally will also continue normally “as long as there are sufficient fees” collected to support them, according to the most recent guidance from the State Department. “This includes passports, visas, and assisting U.S. citizens abroad.”\n\nThere could be economic repercussions, though. A government shutdown is estimated to cost the country's travel economy as much as $140 million per day, according to an analysis for the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nWould a government shutdown affect Social Security?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill a government shutdown affect food stamps and WIC?\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, will continue for at least the month of October, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a press briefing Monday. But he warned that “if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP.”\n\nFunding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − better known as WIC − will stop “immediately when the shutdown occurs,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has a contingency fund that may extend the program for a day or two, and some states may have leftover WIC benefits not spent that could extend the program for a week or so in that state.\n\n“But the vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available,” Vilsack said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat happens to the IRS in a shutdown?\n\nThe IRS may have to partially close starting this weekend if there is a government shutdown.\n\nWhile the agency initially said it would be able to continue operations and pay employees through a shutdown, the IRS reversed course last week, telling the National Treasury Employees their new contingency plan would include some furloughs.\n\nMillions of Americans are still waiting for their tax refunds from the last filing season, and there is concern a shutdown and IRS closure would escalate this backlog.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat is the deadline for the government shutdown?\n\nThe U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.\n\nThe continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the House will vote Friday on a continuing resolution, but it's unclear if it has enough votes to pass.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoes a government shutdown affect state employees?\n\nA shutdown could impact state employees whose employers depend on federal funds to operate and must shut down certain activities that the government has deemed non-necessary.\n\nIn this case, certain state employees could be furloughed until a shutdown passes.\n\nBut state employees who receive salaries from private employers who do not rely on federal funds wouldn’t necessarily be impacted.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nWhile a potential shutdown isn’t expected to have much of an impact on the stock market, experts say it has contributed to the S&P 500's more than 5% dip so far this month, to 4,275.\n\nIt's “one of the reasons why you've seen the market weaken,” according to Marc Zabicki, chief investment officer of LPL Financial. But after the potential shutdown begins, “I don't know that you're going to get any stark reaction from asset markets come Oct. 2 next week. I think it's already largely been built into prices.”\n\nWhile the looming shutdown is contributing to the recent market dip, it’s not the only driver.\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a \"lot of other items going on\" that are affecting the market, including higher interest rates, looming student loan payments, the United Auto Workers strike, rising oil prices and more, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\n“We're in a very volatile time now,\" Silverblatt said.\n\nThere have been six partial or full government shutdowns since 1990. While some were resolved in less than a week, the most recent in late 2018 and early 2019 lasted over one month.\n\nWhen looking at the S&P 500’s median performance one month after the shutdown compared with one month prior, the benchmark gained a median of 5.5% with positive returns five out of six times, according to a Wednesday note from Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey.\n\n“Like the people that occupy the chambers of Congress, past shutdowns have been a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,” the note reads.\n\nIn other words, the looming shutdown is \"more of a headline event than a bottom-line event,\" according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Past shutdowns, he said, left \"angered tourists more than disappointed traders.\"\n\nA Sept. 13 Wells Fargo report led by global strategist Gery Schollberg and analyst Jennifer Timmerman notes that while the S&P 500 tends to sag before and through the early part of longer shutdowns, “it did not take long for stocks to regain composure after the government reopened in each instance.”\n\n“This time, however, a shutdown risks aggravating other potential body blows to the economy … leaving stocks more exposed to volatility and to extended weakness.”\n\nThe report's authors said they believe a shutdown, if it does occur, has the potential to last at least a few weeks because of hardened positions in an increasingly polarized Congress.\n\n\"The longer it goes, the more difficult it will become economically and also from an asset market perspective,\" Zabicki of LPL said, adding that Washington's polarization \"increases the risk that something could go wrong.\"\n\nHowever, he said recent history shows that \"these are typically not long-lasting events.”\n\n− Bailey Schulz and Daniel de Vise\n\nWhat is a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown means all federal agencies and services officials don’t deem “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors.\n\nSome of those essential services include the U.S. Postal Service delivering mail and people receiving Medicare and Social Security benefits. Those will continue whether or not the government shuts down.\n\nBut so-called “non-essential” work can still have significant impacts for federal employees and Americans across the country. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, government food assistance benefits could be delayed and some food safety inspections could also be put on pause.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is the meaning of furloughed?\n\nA furlough occurs when an employee is required to take a mandatory and temporary unpaid leave of absence from their work. An employer can furlough employees to cut back costs or manage operations during a potential government shutdown.\n\nA furlough is different from a layoff, which are permanent terminations in which employees can’t return back to work.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen would a government shutdown start?\n\nA government shutdown would start Sunday if lawmakers cannot pass a federal budget or stopgap measure by Sept. 30.\n\nThe stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, would prevent an Oct. 1 shutdown by temporarily extending government funding.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will'\n\nA government shutdown, some Republicans say, is inevitable at this point given the time crunch Congress is facing and the gridlock between lawmakers.\n\nMcCarthy has committed to voting Friday on a stopgap bill to keep the government open, but even if House Republicans pass it along party lines, it’s a non-starter with the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nWhen asked if the two chambers could reconcile their differences ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline, Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., a senior appropriator, told reporters, “We all know the answer to that: No, there’s not enough time.”\n\n“Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will and I think conventional wisdom should tell you that,” Womack added. He said he hopes lawmakers could have an “epiphany” and avert a shutdown in the waning days.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nSenate blames fractured House GOP caucus for looming government shutdown\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning that McCarthy is aiming for a government shutdown by adhering to ultraconservatives in his party.\n\nHe encouraged the House speaker to work in a bipartisan way to pass a stopgap measure in the lower chamber and said the California lawmaker has “twisted himself into pretzels” to “avoid his responsibility of governing.”\n\n“Every bill House Republicans have pushed has been partisan. Every C.R. has been aimed at the hard right and every path they’ve pursued to date will inevitably lead to a shutdown,” Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell echoed Schumer’s call for bipartisanship, saying on the Senate floor Wednesday that shutting down the government “isn’t an effective way to make a point.\" For Congress to move forward on unresolved funding priorities, they must avert a shutdown, he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nWhat's the probability of a government shutdown?\n\nHold off on placing any bets. If lawmakers in the House and Senate can reach a compromise by Sept. 30 on a dozen bills that would fund the government, a shutdown is off the table. Congress could also pass a temporary measure to keep the government funded, known as a continuing resolution.\n\nBut both of those options are unlikely as of Wednesday afternoon. Lawmakers haven’t agreed on all 12 bills they would need to pass, and a group of conservative House Republicans have insisted on hardline spending cuts that have no chance of passing in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats.\n\nLast week, House Democrats and moderate Republicans appeared to start working on a fallback plan, but it’s not clear the rare bipartisan push would receive enough support to dodge a shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat are the 12 appropriation bills?\n\nIn order to fund the government, lawmakers must pass 12 appropriations bills – each tailored to a specific government function.\n\nThe appropriations bills are handled by their respective subcommittees in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. For example, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense steers the Defense spending bill, which provides funding for the Department of Defense and other related activities.\n\nIn previous years, Congress passed an “omnibus” package – a massive bill combining all 12 appropriations bills into one piece of legislation. The change this year is among the concessions House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made to hardline conservatives in his bid for the job in January when he promised to pass all 12 bills separately.\n\nHard-right lawmakers have argued a vote on each bill would allow for more transparency in the spending process. But with three days left before a government shutdown, it is virtually impossible for Congress to pass all 12 bills in time considering the House has only passed one of the 12 and the Senate hasn't passed any.\n\nThe only likely resolution to avert a shutdown is a short-term stopgap measure to keep the government open and buy lawmakers more time to move through the appropriations process.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nLatest updates on the government shutdown\n\nGOP lawmakers emerged from a closed-door weekly conference meeting Wednesday, deriding the Senate’s version of a temporary funding bill for its lack of border security provisions. It's the major sticking point for most House Republicans in the government shutdown fight who say any funding measure must include border security language.\n\n“The Senate is going to have to realize that the House is not going to move something that doesn't have border security at its core,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a key negotiator and chair of the centrist Republican Main Street Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nBut House GOP requests for an aggressive border security package have almost no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. That's why Johnson and other Republicans are pinning the blame on Democrats for refusing to cede to their demands even though the House has been consumed by GOP infighting for the past weeks in spending negotiations.\n\n“If they’re not willing to accept that fact, they are standing in the way of us funding this government,” Johnson said.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nWhat would happen if the government shuts down?\n\nIn a government shutdown, all federal agencies that are not \"essential\" — think U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security — would stop work.\n\nThis means thousands of federal employees would be on furlough and Americans would go without government benefits such as food and housing support.\n\nAir travel will be generally spared: Air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue working, though without pay. Travelers may also contend with longer wait times and flight delays.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long would the government shutdown last?\n\nGovernment funding is set to expire on Oct. 1. How long a potential shutdown would last depends on how soon the House and Senate are able to pass a new appropriations plan that President Joe Biden signs.\n\nThe length of past government shutdowns have varied, lasting from five days to 21 days.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-FL., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that if the departments of Labor and Education \"have to shut down for a few days as we get their appropriations in line, that’s certainly not something that is optimal.”\n\n“But I think it’s better than continuing on the current path we are to America’s financial ruin,” Gaetz said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow long was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019. Spanning 35 days, it was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was also the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n−Olivia Munson\n\nGovernment shutdown history chart\n\nOver the last five decades, there have been 21 federal shutdowns:\n\n1976 : Under President Gerald Ford.

Some lawmakers however, have introduced bills in the past to withhold pay for lawmakers during a shutdown. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced legislation doing just that last Wednesday.\n\n“I’m introducing legislation to block Member pay during a McCarthy shutdown, because it’s ridiculous that we still get paid while folks like TSA workers are asked to work without a paycheck,” Craig said in a statement.\n\nTheir staffers however, will not receive pay. Like other federal employees, Congressional staffers and aides considered essential work without pay and receive their paychecks retroactively after the shutdown ends.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMajority of Americans want Congress to prevent government shutdown: poll\n\nA Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found over 60% of Americans want Congress to compromise to avert a government shutdown.Americans polled reported they do not feel President Joe Biden or lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are looking out for Americans.According to the poll, 43% of Americans would hold Republicans most responsible for a shutdown. Others, 27%, place the blame on Biden while 21% are pointing fingers at Democrats.− Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/29/government-shutdown-2023-live-updates-latest-news/71000629007/", "title": "Government shutdown updates: What happens in a government ...", "text": "WASHINGTON−The shutdown countdown is on, and Congress has hours to avert a crisis that would impact millions of Americans.\n\nBut despite the dwindling time, feuding lawmakers are no less entrenched in their positions.\n\nA small group of hard-right Republicans who represent a sliver of America is set to send the entire country into a federal government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. Sunday − a situation that would disproportionately impact people who need the most help. Those who would feel the deepest losses include babies who rely on WIC benefits for formula, members of the military who would serve without pay, numerous federal workers who would be furloughed, travelers who wait in long TSA lines and more.\n\nHere's where things stand in the shutdown fight and what it means for you.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson proposes new stopgap measure\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Friday afternoon proposed his own solution to averting the shutdown: a 14-day continuing resolution – or stopgap measure – that has no policies attached.\n\nThe Senate’s current continuing resolution uses the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act as its legislative vehicle to pass in the upper chamber.\n\n“It’s a very common sense approach. It’s something we all ought to agree one,” Johnson said. His bill extends government funding for two additional weeks.\n\nBut Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee and played a key role in putting together the Senate’s current continuing resolution, objected to Johnson’s legislation calling it a “slap-dash” bill.\n\n“We can’t be back in this same situation in two weeks,” she said on the Senate floor.\n\nJohnson’s bill, because of Murray's objection, will have to go through the normal legislative process on the Senate floor. It is unlikely Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., would bring Johnson's bill to the floor for a vote given the Senate's other proposed version.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nWhen is the deadline for the government shutdown?\n\nThe U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.\n\nThe continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.\n\nThe House will voted Friday on a continuing resolution, but it didn't have enough votes to pass.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIs the National Weather Service impacted in a shutdown?\n\nForecasts from the National Weather Service will continue uninterrupted despite the shutdown, a spokesperson told USA TODAY Friday. \"Under a lapse of appropriation, the day-to-day operational work of the National Weather Service continues,\" said Sarah Teefey of the weather service.\n\n\"The work of the NWS is critical and necessary to protect life and property in the country and parts of the world through international agreements,\" she said. \"Weather service offices will continue to operate on their regular schedule.\"\n\nIn addition:\n\nNational Weather Service observations, forecasts and warnings, as well as decision support services, will continue uninterrupted.\n\nCritical functions such as repair of operational systems, like radars, will continue.\n\nRoutine equipment maintenance, model upgrades, new product development, and other longer-term improvements to service delivery will be delayed.\n\n−Doyle Rice\n\nIn another setback for McCarthy, House GOP fails to pass short-term spending bill\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy faced another setback Friday afternoon, as House Republicans failed to pass a short-term measure to avert a government shutdown.\n\nMcCarthy has been insistent on passing the GOP plan to better position House Republicans in negotiations with the Democratic-controlled Senate. But hardline conservatives, who have impeded almost all progress towards averting a shutdown, tanked the stopgap on the floor.\n\nDespite the little time remaining, Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., one of the hardliners, told USA TODAY he would like to see the House proceed with passing the 12 appropriation bills to avert a shutdown, as opposed to a temporary spending measure.\n\nRep. Chip Roy., R-Texas, one of the House’s ultraconservatives but a key negotiator who has attempted to bridge the gap between moderate GOP lawmakers and the hard-right, lambasted his fellow conservatives for taking down the stopgap bill.\n\n“We could have had time to get votes on more individual appropriation bills, passing a bill that secures the border,” a frustrated Roy told reporters Friday, referring to the border security provisions in the stopgap that failed. “But apparently that wasn’t good enough.”\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nPresident Biden won’t meet with McCarthy before government shuts down\n\nThe White House said Friday that President Joe Biden will not meet with McCarthy to negotiate a deal before the government shuts down, demanding that House Republicans act to avoid a crisis of their making.\n\n“The conversation that needs to happen is between speaker McCarthy and his caucus,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nBiden plans to spend the weekend in Washington and will be in touch with members of Congress, the White House said. The House voted Friday afternoon to defeat a resolution backed by hardline Republicans to keep the government operating for 30 days in exchange for 30% cuts that the White House warned would be “devastating.”\n\n−Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nOMB Director Shalanda Young blasts McCarthy for imminent shutdown\n\nShalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, accused McCarthy and House Republicans - by pursuing major spending cuts - of reneging on a bipartisan deal that passed Congress by wide margins in June to raise the debt ceiling and set spending limits.\n\nYoung said 30% cuts to many domestic services would eliminate 12,000 FBI agents, 1,000 ATF agents, 500 local law enforcement official and cut 300,000 children from the federal Head Start program and 1 million seniors from nutrition services. If a measure isn’t passed, the alternative is a potential cropping shutdown.\n\n“What kind of choice is that?” Young said. “We're doing everything we can to plead, beg, shame House Republicans to do the right thing. Don’t have this happen.”\n\nYoung also chastised McCarthy saying he won’t accept a paycheck during a shutdown \"political theater\" because members of Congress must get paid under the Constitution.\n\n\"Maybe he'll put it in a sock drawer, I don't know,\" she said. \"I will tell you the guy who picks up trash in my office won't get a paycheck That's real. And that's what makes me angry.\"\n\n−Joey Garrison and Francesca Chambers\n\nModerates try to avert shutdown: ‘We’ll do what we need to do’\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, a group evenly divided between centrist Democrats and Republicans, told reporters Friday that his coalition of lawmakers is looking to force a bipartisan solution on the floor to avert a shutdown.\n\nThe group, which includes 31 Republicans, has been privately discussing a fallback plan if Congress fails to pass a funding package to avoid a shutdown. The plan would effectively sidestep House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as speaker and force a vote on the House floor without the speaker’s approval. The archaic process, referred to as a discharge petition, would need the support of 218 members.\n\n“We gotta find a way to get the two-party bill on the floor. And we’ll see if it happens on its own. If it doesn’t, we’ll do what we need to do,” Fitzpatrick said.\n\nWhen asked if their bipartisan solution would be on the floor by the Sept. 30 deadline, Fitzpatrick said “we’ll find out.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nHow long was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019.

A partial government shutdown can occur if Congress is able to pass any of the 12 individual spending bills.\n\nWhen both chambers can't reach a compromise, funding levels expire and federal agencies must cease all non-essential function.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nWill Social Security be paid if there's a government shutdown?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill a government shutdown affect Medicare?\n\nMedicare benefits will continue, though there could be a delay in some payments.\n\nThe benefits are considered among essential services, along with air travel, Amtrak, Social Security payments and more.\n\n-Candy Woodall\n\nShort-term funding bill: What is a continuing resolution?\n\nThe House on Friday failed to pass a continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would buy time − 30 days − for Congress to do its main job of passing spending bills without a shutdown. But members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus voted against it.\n\nA Senate version of a continuing resolution will be up for a vote Saturday. It would give Congress until Nov. 17 to pass spending bills. But the Senate's bipartisan plan won't pass the House.\n\nLawmakers are no closer to averting a government shutdown.\n\n-Candy Woodall\n\nWill mail be delivered in a government shutdown?\n\nThe Postal Service is an independent entity generally funded by the sale of its products and services − not tax dollars − and it will not be impacted by a government shutdown, USPS said in a statement. Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.\n\n\"Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,\" the statement said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nHow does the government shutdown affect me?\n\nMillions of Americans would be impacted by a government shutdown.\n\nFederal workers would be furloughed without pay. \"Essential\" federal workers, such as those who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, would work without pay − but would receive backpay once a shutdown ends. Numerous subcontractors would be out of work and would not receive backpay.\n\nThe impact would stretch far beyond federal workers though. It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.\n\nHere are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:\n\nFunding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately\n\nFood stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that\n\nChildren from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs\n\nCollege students could see delays in their student loans\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work\n\nTravelers could see delays with receiving passports\n\nNational parks could close\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief\n\nAgencies that publish government data, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, will close up shop. That means investors and other market-watchers might not get to see the jobs report scheduled for October 6 or the monthly Consumer Price Index update on October 12\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission would scale back operations, potentially delaying work on initial public offerings, which require federal scrutiny.

But none will be paid unless an agreement on government spending or legislation authorizing military pay is reached.\n\n“If there is a shutdown in just a few days, our service members would be required to continue working but would be doing so without pay, and hundreds and thousands of their civilian colleagues would be furloughed,” Sabrina Singh, the Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, told reporters Thursday. “A government shutdown is a worst-case scenario for the department, so we continue to ask Congress to do its job and fund the government.”\n\n−Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden said it would be a \"disgrace\" to have unpaid troops in a shutdown\n\nPresident Joe Biden briefly weighed in on the looming government shutdown during a Friday retirement ceremony for Army Gen.

While it may seem like progress, the passage does not bring Congress any closer to averting a shutdown.\n\nHouse Republicans voted on four individual spending bills. The lower chamber passed the Defense, Homeland Security and Department of State and Foreign Operations bills, but failed to pass one on Agriculture spending.\n\nEarlier this summer, the lower chamber passed the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act which brings the grand total of spending bills passed in the House to four out of 12 total hours before the government will shutdown.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nWhile a potential shutdown isn’t expected to have much of an impact on the stock market, experts say it has contributed to the S&P 500's more than 5% dip so far this month, to 4,275.\n\nIt's “one of the reasons why you've seen the market weaken,” according to Marc Zabicki, chief investment officer of LPL Financial. But after the potential shutdown begins, “I don't know that you're going to get any stark reaction from asset markets come Oct. 2 next week. I think it's already largely been built into prices.”\n\nWhile the looming shutdown is contributing to the recent market dip, it’s not the only driver.\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a \"lot of other items going on\" that are affecting the market, including higher interest rates, looming student loan payments, the United Auto Workers strike, rising oil prices and more, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\n“We're in a very volatile time now,\" Silverblatt said.\n\n− Bailey Schulz and Daniel de Vise", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/26/government-shutdown-2023-live-updates/70968505007/", "title": "Government shutdown explained: Here's what it means for you", "text": "Editor's note: This page is the news on a potential government shutdown from Tuesday, Sept. 26.

Ten thousand kids could lose access to Head Start care programs, and some student loan borrowers could see disruptions.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nMcCarthy says House may vote on temporary solution Friday\n\nMcCarthy on Tuesday night said the House will look to pass their version of a stopgap measure with border security provisions toward the end of the week.\n\n\"We will move a continuing resolution, bring a rule to the floor to secure our border and keep government open,” he said.\n\nThe House speaker said regardless if the continuing resolution has enough votes to pass, the lower chamber will hold a vote on the stopgap measure with border security provisions. This will likely fall on Friday, he said.\n\n“I want to keep the government open. I want to do the job,” he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nWhen would a government shutdown start?\n\nA government shutdown would start Sunday if lawmakers cannot pass a federal budget or stopgap measure by Sept. 30.\n\nThe stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, would prevent an Oct. 1 shutdown by temporarily extending government funding.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy would there be a government shutdown?\n\nHold off on placing any bets. If lawmakers in the House and Senate can reach a compromise by Sept. 30 on a dozen bills that would fund the government, a shutdown is off the table. Congress could also pass a temporary measure to keep the government funded, known as a continuing resolution.\n\nBut both of those options are unlikely as of Tuesday morning. Lawmakers haven’t agreed on one of the 12 bills they would need to pass, and a group of conservative House Republicans have insisted on hardline spending cuts that have no chance of passing in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats.\n\nLast week, House Democrats and moderate Republicans appeared to start working on a fallback plan, but it’s not clear the rare bipartisan push would receive enough support to dodge a shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nSenate's continuing resolution would fund government through Nov. 17\n\nThe Senate’s continuing resolution released Tuesday evening funds the government through Nov. 17.\n\nSome of the funding listed in the package includes:\n\n$4.5 billion allocated to Ukraine\n\n$6 billion in emergency funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Disaster Relief Fund\n\n$2.9 billion for Federal Aviation Administration operations\n\nSenators are voting Tuesday evening on the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill, which will be used as the vehicle to pass the stopgap measure if it passes in the upper chamber.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nHouse GOP says Senate CR is dead on arrival\n\nShortly after the Senate released its bipartisan version of a short-term stopgap measure to avert a government shutdown, House conservatives said the bill is dead on arrival in the lower chamber. Any spending package, they say, has to include border security provisions.“If you want to continue federal spending, then you have to secure the border,” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., an ultra-conservative lawmaker and key negotiator in the House. “That is a position in the House that in my view, the members are not gonna yield.”Rep. Garrett Graves, R-La., a close McCarthy ally, echoed similar sentiments and told reporters House GOP lawmakers are “focused on leveraging this moment right now to force the White House into closing the border.”– Ken Tran\n\nConservative hardliners say no to any stopgap measure to avert a shutdown\n\nAs the country barrels towards a shutdown with limited time remaining for Congress to pass a funding package, the only likely resolution to avert a government shutdown is for lawmakers to pass a short-term stopgap bill – called a continuing resolution – to keep the lights on while lawmakers hammer out a deal.\n\nBut conservative hardliners, who have impeded McCarthy’s attempts to pass spending bills in demand for deep spending cuts, say they will not vote for a continuing resolution under any circumstances.\n\n“I think that we can’t continue to do DC’s status quo and expect we’re gonna get some type of change and reform,” Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., told reporters Thursday, emphasizing he would not support a stopgap measure on the House floor.\n\n“I’ll stay here late. I’ll stay here until two in the morning. I’ll work on Saturdays and I’ll work on Sundays,” Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., said, pushing for Congress to focus its work on the 12 appropriations bills needed to avert a shutdown.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhite House calls on House GOP to pass stopgap measure\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called on House Republicans to join the Senate in passing a continuing resolution, according to a statement Tuesday evening.“House Republicans should join the Senate in doing their job, stop playing political games with peoples’ lives, and abide by the bipartisan deal two-thirds of them voted for in May,” she said.- Rachel Looker\n\nRepublican senators have mixed response to stopgap measure\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Tuesday evening he plans to move to advance the Senate’s continuing resolution.\n\n“Most of us came here to legislate,” he told reporters. “The power of the purse is Congress’s most important power, but it’s a situation we find ourselves in habitually these government shutdowns.”\n\nOthers favor passing spending bills themselves over a stopgap measure.\n\n“I don’t think we ought to be passing the CR. I think we ought to take up and pass appropriations bills and we need to rein in some of this out of control spending that is driving rampant inflation that is hurting Texans and Americans,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said.\n\nSouth Dakota Republican Sen. Mikes Rounds said he thinks the upper chamber will be able to pass the remaining spending bills in the next six weeks with the extension in the stopgap measure.\n\n“I think it sends a powerful message to investors if they recognize that we’re actually doing our job, even if we’re a little bit late in getting it done,” Rounds said.\n\nBut the South Dakota lawmaker said regardless of the Senate's efforts, he is still anticipating a shutdown.\n\n“And I’m sorry to say that. I would hope that cooler heads will prevail, but at this point we have to be prepared for any short-term shutdown,” he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nDo national parks close in a government shutdown?\n\nIt depends on the park. During previous shutdowns, some national parks closed entirely, while others remained technically open but without staff to maintain them\n\nSome fell into disarray, with trash piling up and toilets overflowing.\n\nBut some park service employees, such as emergency medical personnel, would still be on the job during a government shutdown. However, services could be disrupted.\n\n– Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nSchumer: ‘The Senate will move forward first’\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday afternoon Senate Democrats and Republicans have worked together to move forward with a continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that will keep the government funded beyond Sept. 30.\n\n“This C.R. is a bridge, not a final destination. It will help us achieve our immediate and necessary goal of avoiding a government shutdown and move us away from the senseless and aimless extremism that has dominated the House so we can get to work on appropriations,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., urged his colleagues to support the stopgap measure.\n\n“Congress needs to extend government funding by the end of this week,” McConnell said.\n\nSchumer said the upper chamber will hold its first procedural vote to move forward with a stopgap measure this evening.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a continuing resolution?\n\nA continuing resolution is a stopgap measure that extends last year's spending levels for a designated period of time.\n\nQuestions remain as to what a stopgap could look like, or for how long it would extend spending levels.\n\nPrevious stopgap measures have extended funding to the end of the calendar year, but McCarthy has hinted at a shorter, one-month extension.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nDoes Congress get paid during a shutdown?\n\nMembers of Congress will still get paid during a government shutdown. Some lawmakers however, have introduced bills in the past to withhold pay for lawmakers during a shutdown. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced legislation doing just that last Wednesday.\n\n“I’m introducing legislation to block Member pay during a McCarthy shutdown, because it’s ridiculous that we still get paid while folks like TSA workers are asked to work without a paycheck,” Craig said in a statement.\n\nTheir staffers however, will not receive pay. Like other federal employees, Congressional staffers and aides considered essential work without pay and receive their paychecks retroactively after the shutdown ends.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat's a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown means all federal agencies and services officials don’t deem “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors.\n\nSome of those essential services include the U.S. Postal Service delivering mail and people receiving Medicare and Social Security benefits. Those will continue whether or not the government shuts down.\n\nBut so-called “non-essential” work can still have significant impacts for federal employees and Americans across the country. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, government food assistance benefits could be delayed and some food safety inspections could also be put on pause.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens when the government shuts down?\n\nIn a government shutdown, all federal agencies that are not \"essential\" — think U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security — would stop work.\n\nThis means thousands of federal employees would be on furlough and Americans would go without government benefits such as food and housing support.\n\nAir travel will be generally spared: Air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue working, though without pay. Travelers may also contend with longer wait times and flight delays.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nMilitary pay could dry up during shutdown: Pentagon\n\nMilitary pay for millions of active-duty service members and reservists could dry up with a government shutdown – a major difference between the current threatened shutdown and previous recent suspensions of non-essential spending.\n\n“Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress appropriates funds available to compensate them for this period of service,” the Defense Department said in a September memo to Pentagon leaders preparing for a potential lapse in spending.\n\nBut the department said personnel would continue working regardless. Federal workers are traditionally reimbursed for lapses in funding once Congress agrees to resume spending, but the lapse in paychecks can be difficult for staffers without savings.\n\n“Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties,” the department said in a Sept. 12 announcement in preparation for a shutdown.\n\nThe government has about 1.3 million active-duty service members and 800,000 reservists.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWhy would this looming government shutdown be different for the military?\n\nDuring three temporary shutdowns – in late 1995 into early 1996, 2013 and late 2018 and early 2019 – military salaries were paid during the broader lapses because military spending legislation was approved separate from overall government spending, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\nFor example, just before the 2013 shutdown began Congress approved legislation Sept. 30 to protect military pay and President Barack Obama signed it. The Pay Our Military Act covered pay and allowances for active-duty military and reservists, according to the report.\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2018, President Donald Trump signed a spending bill that included the Defense Department, which covered the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, according to the report.\n\nBut funding for the Coast Guard dried up Dec. 21, 2018, for the 35-day shutdown because the agency is funded under the Department of Homeland Security, the report said.\n\nThe Republican-led House considered voting on a defense spending bill earlier this month, but couldn’t agree on the rules for how to debate the measure amid opposition from renegade GOP members and Democrats.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nA government shutdown isn't likely to help the stock market, investment experts say, but it probably won't hurt much.\n\nStocks are already down on the month, partly in anticipation of a potential shutdown. The benchmark S&P 500 has fallen more than 5% in September, from 4,508 to 4,274.\n\n\"You're seeing it right now,\" said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac. \"There are a lot of things going on right now, and the government shutdown is one of those straws.\"\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, and the threat of a shutdown is but one of several factors dragging markets this month, Hirsch said.\n\nBut history suggests the market will ultimately recover.\n\n\"Historically, the market has pretty much ignored government shutdowns,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n\n\"There have been 20 since 1976, and whether you look at the week before the shutdown, the day before the shutdown, or the entire duration of the average nine-day shutdown, the market has gone nowhere, essentially.\"\n\nIn other words, Stovall said, the looming shutdown is \"more of a headline event than a bottom-line event.\" Past shutdowns, Stovall said, left \"angered tourists more than disappointed traders.\"\n\n−Daniel de Vise\n\nWill the government shutdown affect VA disability payments?\n\nU.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough said during a press conference last week that veterans' benefits will be available during the shutdown, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits. This includes disability payments.\n\nAfter previous shutdowns, the Veterans Affairs lobbied Congress to fund the department “on a two-year budget cycle that exempts the department,” according to Veteran.com.\n\nIn the appropriations bill passed last year, it notes that funding for the Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health Administration “shall become available on October 1, 2023, to remain available until expended.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow long would the government shutdown last?\n\nGovernment funding is set to expire on Oct. 1. How long a potential shutdown will last depends on how soon the House and Senate are able to pass a new appropriations plan that President Joe Biden signs.\n\nThe length of past government shutdowns have varied, lasting from five days to 21 days.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-FL., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that if the departments of Labor and Education \"have to shut down for a few days as we get their appropriations in line, that’s certainly not something that is optimal.”\n\n“But I think it’s better than continuing on the current path we are to America’s financial ruin,” Gaetz said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history?\n\nThe longest government shutdown lasted for 35 days from late 2018 to early 2019 under the Trump administration. It went into effect after the House and Senate failed to reach a compromise on a short-term funding plan to keep the government running through early next year.\n\nThe critical issue was that Senate Democrats opposed President Donald Trump’s $5.7 billion request for building a wall on the southern border.\n\nBefore that, the longest government shutdown lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and John Fritze\n\nMoody's says a government shutdown could hurt U.S. credit rating\n\nThe country’s credit rating could face additional pressure if the government shuts down next week, according to a new report from Moody’s Investors Service.\n\nWhile a short-lived shutdown would not impact government debt service payments and isn’t expected to disrupt the economy, Moody's said it would “underscore the weakness” of U.S. institutional and governance strength compared to countries with similar credit ratings.\n\n“In particular, it would demonstrate the significant constraints that intensifying political polarization put on fiscal policymaking at a time of declining fiscal strength,” Moody's report reads.\n\nIf the potential shutdown does drag on, it would \"likely be disruptive both to the US economy and financial markets,\" although Moody's notes that any government shutdown is more likely to be brief and concentrated in areas with a large government presence, like Washington, D.C.\n\n− Bailey Schulz\n\nWould a government shutdown impact travel?\n\nThe deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.\n\nFunding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold. However, the agents who you typically interact with at airports and seaports, and the controllers who oversee your flights are considered essential and will be working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nImpacts on those agencies have more to do with things like hiring and training. All the crucial safety functions like inspections and air traffic control continue.\n\nConsular operations in the U.S. and internationally will also continue normally “as long as there are sufficient fees” collected to support them, according to the most recent guidance from the State Department. “This includes passports, visas, and assisting U.S. citizens abroad.”\n\nThere could be economic repercussions, though. A government shutdown is estimated to cost the country's travel economy as much as $140 million per day, according to an analysis for the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for Medicare?\n\nMedicare benefits will continue, though there could be a delay in some payments.\n\nThe benefits are considered among essential services, along with U.S. mail delivery, air travel, Amtrak, Social Security payments and more.\n\n-Candy Woodall\n\nWhat agencies are affected by a government shutdown?\n\nAll agencies could be affected by a government shutdown.\n\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Agriculture, each agency will have a plan to stop its nonessential functions, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.\n\nAgencies also rely on each other during a shutdown. For example, the State Department’s U.S. Passport Agency will remain open during a government shutdown, so you should be able to get a passport if you need one. But if passport services are offered in a building near you that’s run by an agency that has shut down, you could have to look elsewhere.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDoes a government shutdown affect federal retirees?\n\nA government shutdown would have major consequences for hundreds of thousands of federal employees, but federal retirees will receive payments if lawmakers fail to keep the government open.\n\nThese retirement payments are one of several functions that won’t stop during a government shutdown, alongside Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nEmployees ranging from air traffic controllers to emergency personnel in national parks will also stay on the job, whether or not the government shuts down.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat will not be impacted by a government shutdown?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and members of Congress will continue to work and get paid, but their staff members who aren’t considered “essential” will be furloughed. The Supreme Court will also stay open, but federal courts could have to scale back functionality.\n\nBut what does essential mean? Think employees such as air traffic controllers and law enforcement officers. U.S. embassies and consulates would likely stay open, and you should still be able to get a passport and visa.\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to Washington D.C. or a National Park, monuments and other areas will likely stay open. However, maintenance of those areas may be delayed or canceled altogether.\n\nAnd as the holidays approach, a government shutdown also likely won't impact NORAD's beloved Santa Tracker.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill a government shutdown affect state employees?\n\nA shutdown could impact state employees whose employers depend on federal funds to operate and must shut down certain activities that the government has deemed non-necessary.\n\nIn this case, certain state employees could be furloughed until a shutdown passes.\n\nBut state employees who receive salaries from private employers who do not rely on federal funds wouldn’t necessarily be impacted.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/14/continuing-resolution-vote-government-shutdown-live-updates/71574152007/", "title": "House passes plan to temporarily avoid a government shutdown ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — Bipartisan House lawmakers approved newly minted House Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal to avoid a government shutdown − his first major test as the lower chamber’s leader.\n\nJohnson pushed a two-tiered, short-term measure to fund the government, referred to as a “laddered” continuing resolution, until deadlines in January and February. It's an unusual approach compared to previous stopgap bills, which extended all government functions until one deadline.\n\nA handful of ultraconservative GOP lawmakers said they would vote against the continuing resolution, which is called “clean” because it keeps government funding at current levels.\n\nBut a swell of Democrats supported the plan, ensuring its passage. While Democrats had reservations about the “laddered” approach, the bill included no spending cuts that conservatives demanded.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's coverage as lawmakers work to avert a government shutdown.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe stopgap measure will now head to the Senate floor where leadership on both sides have indicated they will support it.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday he plans to bring the continuing resolution to the Senate floor “as soon as possible.” He said the proposal includes provisions Democrats have pushed for: Averting a shutdown without including Republican-backed cuts to federal programs.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has also indicated he will support the stopgap measure when it comes to the Senate floor.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nHouse passes continuing resolution, lowering government shutdown odds\n\nThe House approved the short-term stopgap measure to fund the government and avert a shutdown, kicking the can down the road once again for Congress to pass a longer-term deal to keep the government’s doors open.\n\nThe stopgap bill led by newly installed House Speaker Johnson – referred to as a continuing resolution – passed the lower chamber by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 336-95..\n\nJohnson, R-La., and House Republican Leadership have touted the continuing resolution as a conservative victory, but the bill, which was Johnson’s first major test of his speakership, didn’t sail through the House without a lot of heartache from its hard-right members who were adamant that any funding plan include spending cuts or conservative policy additions.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nVote delayed to consider amendments to budget bill\n\nThe continuing resolution vote was delayed to consider 10 amendments to the House budget bill covering the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. Most of the amendments will be given two minutes for a vote.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the temporary funding measure shortly before 5:45 p.m.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhen was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019. Spanning 35 days, it was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was also the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n−Olivia Munson\n\nHouse Democratic leaders back Johnson's continuing resolution\n\nHouse Democratic leadership issued a joint statement supporting Johnson’s funding plan to avert a government shutdown, saying it is “devoid of harmful cuts and free of extreme right-wing policy riders.”\n\nWhile it was expected for Democrats to support the measure, the official statement significantly lowers the chances of a government shutdown. House Democrats have insisted any continuing resolution to extend government funding be “clean.”\n\nThe joint statement from House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California and Vice Chair Ted Lieu of California added that “it is time for House Republicans to finally work the Democratic Caucus and the Senate” on the appropriation bills ahead to fund the government long-term.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nUltra-conservative House Freedom Caucus balks at plan to avoid a government shutdown\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of lawmakers that make up the House's right flank, vowed on Tuesday morning that they will not support Johnson's plan to temporarily avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThe measure \"contains no spending reductions, no border security, and not a single meaningful win for the American People,\" the group said in a news release, adding \"Republicans must stop negotiating against ourselves.\"\n\n– Ken Tran and Marina Pitofsky\n\nGovernment shutdown travel impact: Here's what to know\n\nThe deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.\n\nFunding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold.

But what is a furlough?\n\nA furlough is a temporary leave of absence imposed by an employer, typically due to economic hardship, company expenses outpacing revenue or a lack of work. Affected employees are required to take time off work on a temporary basis, sometimes without pay.\n\nFurloughs can come in the form of reduced hours of work per day, fewer days of work per week or month or no work at all for extended periods of time.\n\nFurloughed employees are technically still employed and therefore do not qualify for things like severance pay but may be able to get temporary work elsewhere during their leave, depending on state rules and other policies.\n\n– Mary Walrath-Holdridge\n\nWhat happens during a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown takes place when Congress is unable to pass a dozen annual spending bills that funnel money to government programs and agencies.\n\nA shutdown is likely when both chambers in Congress − the House and Senate − can’t come to an agreement on how much money to allocate to certain agencies or agree on certain spending provisions, putting federal agencies at risk. A partial government shutdown can occur if Congress is able to pass any of the 12 individual spending bills.\n\nWhen both chambers can't reach a compromise, funding levels expire and federal agencies must cease all non-essential function.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nWhat are the chances of a government shutdown? Senate Republicans welcome temporary spending plan, prepare to support it\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., praised Johnson's leadership as the funding extension appears likely to pass this afternoon with bipartisan support.\n\n\"It's nice to see us working together to end a government shutdown,\" he said. \"I'm happy for him.\"\n\nAsked what is the likelihood that Senate leaders will agree to bypass the right to a filibuster in order to approve the funding agreement quickly, GOP Whip Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said \"there's a high level of interest in moving the process along\" and indicated he thinks the measure will \"pass fairly easily\" in the Senate.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWill mail be delivered in a government shutdown?\n\nThe Postal Service is an independent entity generally funded by the sale of its products and services − not tax dollars − and it will not be impacted by a government shutdown, USPS said in a statement. Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.\n\n\"Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,\" the statement said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nWhen will the House vote today?\n\nHouse lawmakers are expected to vote on the temporary plan to avoid a government shutdown at 4:15 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nIt's not clear whether Johnson or other Republican leaders will be able to gather enough support to pass the bill without help from Democrats, who haven't publicly confirmed whether they'll vote for the measure.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen would a government shutdown start?\n\nThe current government funding deadline is Nov. 17.\n\nThe original deadline was Sept. 30, but Congress kicked the can down the road with a continuing resolution. They extended funding to Nov. 17 in a bid to buy more time for lawmakers to pass a longer-term spending deal.\n\nBut time has run out for Congress to pass a more permanent deal by the November deadline, which is just three days away. That means members will have to kick the can down the road once again to avoid a shutdown.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDoes Congress get paid during a government shutdown?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and members of Congress will continue to work and get paid, but their staff members who aren’t considered “essential” will be furloughed. The Supreme Court will also stay open, but federal courts could have to scale back functionality.\n\nBut what does essential mean? Think employees such as air traffic controllers and law enforcement officers. U.S. embassies and consulates would likely stay open, and you should still be able to get a passport and visa.\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to Washington D.C. or a National Park, monuments and other areas will likely stay open. However, maintenance of those areas may be delayed or canceled altogether.\n\nAnd as the holidays approach, a government shutdown also likely won't impact NORAD's beloved Santa Tracker.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill schools be affected by a government shutdown?\n\nMost K-12 schools won't be immediately impacted by a government shutdown. While schools across the country do receive some federal funding, the vast majority of their budgets come from their state and local governments.\n\nSchools that do use federal funding have mostly already received money for the 2023-2024 school year, Education Week reported.\n\nBut some programs for kids would be hit by a government shutdown. For example, Children from low-income families could lose access to Head Start preschool programs.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho is affected by a government shutdown?\n\nIf lawmakers can't reach a compromise to avoid a government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed as the government stops all work deemed \"non-essential.\"\n\nWhen it comes to essential services, such as air traffic control and law enforcement, those employees keep working but do not get paid until the shutdown is over.\n\nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits would continue under a shutdown, but some food assistance programs could be delayed, or even see federal funding run out for Americans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky, Ken Tran\n\nWould a government shutdown affect air travel and TSA?\n\nFlights will likely not be affected by a shutdown and TSA screenings should proceed normally. Transportation Security Administration agents and air traffic controllers are considered essential and will continue working, though they won’t be paid.\n\nHowever, during the 2019 shutdown, air traffic controllers started calling in sick at higher rates which might occur again this time around. The White House warned that a shutdown could risk delays for travelers.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also said in a press conference that air traffic controller hiring and training would be paused, which would impact the Department of Transportation’s efforts to address a shortfall in staffing.\n\n−Zach Wichter and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican Rep. Tim Burchett says former Speaker Kevin McCarthy elbowed him on Capitol Hill\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., elbowed him in the back on Tuesday on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut the incident wasn't fueled by the looming government shutdown. Instead, Burchett said it may have been over his vote to oust McCarthy from his leadership post last month.\n\nMcCarthy told CNN that the hallway where he passed Burchett was tight, denying that he shoved or elbowed him.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Ken Tran\n\nWhat agencies are affected by a government shutdown?\n\nAll agencies could be affected by a government shutdown.\n\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of Agriculture, each agency will have a plan to stop its nonessential functions, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.\n\nAgencies also rely on each other during a shutdown. For example, the State Department’s U.S. Passport Agency will remain open during a government shutdown, so you should be able to get a passport if you need one. But if passport services are offered in a building near you that’s run by an agency that has shut down, you could have to look elsewhere.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nProgressive Democrat calls temporary spending plan a \"very big win\"\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., Chair of the House Progressive Caucus, said \"it's a very big win\" that the funding extension doesn't include any cuts from 2023 levels.\n\nSeparating the extension into two tranches \"makes no sense,\" she said, but it doesn't contain any conservative policies Democrats would immediately refuse, she said. Still, she plans to wait to hear from the rest of her caucus until she decides how she will vote on the measure.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nRepublican rebel who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy says it was ‘worth it’\n\nConservative rebels ousted former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy R-Calif., in October in part because he worked with Democrats to avert a government shutdown with a clean continuing resolution.\n\nBut Johnson’s plan, which is also clean, noticeably hasn’t drawn the same vitriol that led to McCarthy’s removal from his post.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, one of the eight GOP members who voted to oust McCarthy, said he would not be supporting Johnson’s government funding plan but said removing McCarthy was still “worth it” because “at the very least, you have a leader that’s honest with you.”\n\nCrane praised Johnson as “transparent” and said “that’s enough for me.” The new speaker, he said, gave him and his fellow hard-right colleagues reassurances that Johnson would still hear the conference’s right flank out on future legislative battles.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWill Social Security be paid during a government shutdown?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat does a government shutdown mean for Medicare?\n\nMedicare benefits will continue, though there could be a delay in some payments.\n\nThe benefits are considered among essential services, along with U.S. mail delivery, air travel, Amtrak, Social Security payments and more.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhat was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history?\n\nThe longest government shutdown lasted for 35 days from late 2018 to early 2019 under the Trump administration. It went into effect after the House and Senate failed to reach a compromise on a short-term funding plan to keep the government running through early next year.\n\nThe critical issue was that Senate Democrats opposed President Donald Trump’s $5.7 billion request for building a wall on the southern border.\n\nBefore that, the longest government shutdown lasted from Dec. 5, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic President Bill Clinton faced off over taxes.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and John Fritze\n\nRepublican lawmakers undecided on spending plan: ‘I don’t like it, but I want to support the speaker’\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas., said he was still undecided about whether he would support Johnson’s continuing resolution because it lacks any spending cuts or conservative policy additions.\n\nJackson lamented Johnson’s difficult position as the new speaker to lead a fractious GOP conference against a Democratic-controlled Senate and White House, describing his support as a balancing act between rallying behind Johnson and pushing for conservative victories.\n\n“I don’t like it but I want to support the speaker,” Jackson said, noting that he will have to figure out “how to make that work.”\n\n“I want to give him a chance,” he said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says he's 'heartened' by House Speaker Mike Johnson's effort – but cautiously\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told didn't immediately criticize Johnson's push on Tuesday.\n\n“Time is a luxury that neither side has,” he said in remarks on the Senate floor. “So far, I am heartened, cautiously so, that Speaker Johnson is moving forward with a CR (continuing resolution) that omits precisely the sort of hard right cuts that would have been non-starters for Democrats.”\n\nBut Schumer added that he hopes Johnson \"does not yield to the demands of the hard right\" during negotiations, including on spending cuts and other measures.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs the National Weather Service impacted in a shutdown?\n\nForecasts from the National Weather Service will continue uninterrupted despite the shutdown, a spokesperson told USA TODAY Friday. \"Under a lapse of appropriation, the day-to-day operational work of the National Weather Service continues,\" said Sarah Teefey of the weather service.\n\n\"The work of the NWS is critical and necessary to protect life and property in the country and parts of the world through international agreements,\" she said. \"Weather service offices will continue to operate on their regular schedule.\"\n\nIn addition:\n\nNational Weather Service observations, forecasts and warnings, as well as decision support services, will continue uninterrupted.\n\nCritical functions such as repair of operational systems, like radars, will continue.\n\nRoutine equipment maintenance, model upgrades, new product development, and other longer-term improvements to service delivery will be delayed.\n\n−Doyle Rice\n\nUkraine, Israel funding likely to be kicked down the road\n\nSome House Democrats raised concerns that aid funding for Ukraine and Israel could be forgotten as lawmakers push ahead with the funding extension.\n\nRep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., is the chair of the moderate New Democrat Coalition, a group of moderate House Democrats. She said her caucus has \"trust issues\" with House Republicans and she wants \"assurance\" that Speaker Mike Johnson will bring it to the floor.\n\n\"There's urgency to it. And that's what I think he needs to understand,\" she said.\n\nHouse Republicans passed a bill earlier this month to provide more than $14 billion in funding for Israel but it also included cuts to the Internal Revenue Service, dooming it in the Senate.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson: Temporary spending plan is not 'surrendering'\n\nJohnson disputed the notion that his government funding plan conceded to Democrats and failed to extract conservative policy wins.\n\n\"We're not surrendering, we're fighting,\" Johnson said at a weekly GOP leadership news conference, adding that House Republicans must pick their battles.\n\n\"You gotta fight fights that you can win,\" he said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWill Democrats vote for GOP plan to avert shutdown?\n\nProspects for House passage of the staggered funding extension looked good as Democrats emerged from a private meeting to discuss their plan.\n\nMultiple members expressed frustration with the likelihood of two additional fiscal cliffs, but said they could support it given the lack of conservative policy add-ons.\n\nAt least two-thirds of the House would be required to pass the extension this afternoon using the mechanism Republicans have proposed, a significant number of Democrats will be needed.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not say whether there would be enough votes from his caucus to make it happen.\n\n“Democrats have made clear that we are going to find common ground with our Republican colleagues on any issue in good faith whenever and wherever possible, but that we will also push back against their extremism whenever necessary,” he said. “That'll be the lens through which we evaluate the continuing resolution today.”\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nHow likely is a government shutdown?\n\nWhile Congress has found itself in a similar situation – up against the government funding deadline with just a few days left – members don't appear to be all that concerned about the prospects of a government shutdown.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, one of the House's most conservative members, said while he had \"serious\" reservations about voting for the clean continuing resolution, he will support it to avert a shutdown and help Johnson.\n\nHouse Democrats have also not ruled out voting for the bill and are currently meeting behind closed doors to discuss the stopgap.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nHow long does a continuing resolution last?\n\nThe two-phased continuing resolution would fund four of the 12 spending bills needed to keep the government open until Jan. 19. It would fund the remaining eight until Feb. 2.\n\nThe four appropriation bills funded until Jan. 19 are traditionally not controversial, funding parts of the government including public health, military construction, housing, transportation, agriculture and energy programs.\n\nThe remaining eight bills, which include funding for financial services, commerce and Homeland Security will be funded until Feb. 2.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nFreedom Caucus member suggests continuing resolution is a 'poor strategy'\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., a member of the Freedom Caucus who is against the continuing resolution, expressed disappointment at the government funding plan and said he won't \"join the status quo caucus.\"\n\nWhen asked if he has received any assurances from Johnson that House Republicans can extract conservative policy wins in other areas, Ogles dismissed that as a \"poor strategy.\"\n\n\"Surrender today to fight tomorrow seems like a pretty poor strategy,\" he said.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nWhat is a clean continuing resolution?\n\nHard-right Republican lawmakers have been pushing for a continuing resolution with spending cuts in an attempt to extract conservative policy wins.\n\nBut with a Democratic-controlled Senate and President Joe Biden in the White House, it is unlikely anything but a “clean” continuing resolution that extends government funding at current levels will be approved..\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow a government shutdown would affect you\n\nWhile there’s plenty to be resolved before the deadline Friday night, members have a powerful incentive to come to an agreement and avoid a shutdown.\n\nIf Congress can’t pass all 12 appropriations bills by the deadline, federal agencies must stop any work that isn’t considered essential.\n\nEssential services include air traffic control and law enforcement – those employees continue to work, but don’t get paid until the shutdown is over, so it could eventually lead to flight delays and other inconveniences if the funding gap stretched on and people stopped reporting to work, affecting more Americans beyond just federal employees.\n\nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits would continue, but other services could be delayed such as benefit verifications or the issuance of Medicare replacement cards. Passport and visa services would also likely slow down.\n\nFood assistance – the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program – could be impacted quickly, as backup funding would likely dry up quickly and require states to fund the program themselves until Congress approves a budget.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens in a government shutdown?\n\nMillions of Americans would be impacted by a government shutdown.\n\nFederal workers would be furloughed without pay. \"Essential\" federal workers, such as those who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, would work without pay − but would receive backpay once a shutdown ends. Numerous subcontractors would be out of work and would not receive backpay.\n\nThe impact would stretch far beyond federal workers though. It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.\n\nHere are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:\n\nFunding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately\n\nFood stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that\n\nChildren from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs\n\nCollege students could see delays in their student loans\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work\n\nTravelers could see delays with receiving passports\n\nNational parks could close\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief\n\nAgencies that publish government data, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, will close up shop. That means investors and other market-watchers might not get to see the jobs report scheduled for October 6 or the monthly Consumer Price Index update on October 12\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission would scale back operations, potentially delaying work on initial public offerings, which require federal scrutiny.

Schumer warned lawmakers last week that negotiations should be held in good faith and with bipartisanship in mind.\n\n“I implore, I beg my House Republican colleagues to follow the Senate’s lead, to recognize that time is short, and the only way to avoid a shutdown is through bipartisanship in both the House and Senate,” Schumer said at a weekly news conference.\n\nWhile the House is gearing up for what could be a drawn-out fight, the Senate already has teed up three out of the 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the government for a vote this week.\n\nBut in the House, hard-right lawmakers, which includes conservatives not part of the Freedom Caucus, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are making heavy asks of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. In exchange for the requests, they'll hypothetically help avert a shutdown.\n\nGreene said at a town hall that she would not vote to fund the government if the House does not hold a vote on an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, a prospect that some moderate Republicans have balked at.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., downplayed the effects of a shutdown in a post on X, formerly Twitter, last week: “If a temporary shutdown is more concerning to you than our $2 trillion deficit and $33 trillion national debt, I'd politely suggest you're part of the problem.”\n\nRelated:Congress returns after Labor Day. With it, Americans' fears of a government shutdown crisis\n\nHow a government shutdown could affect you\n\nEvery government shutdown plays out slightly differently, but generally, various government functions slow down in a shutdown.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget updates plans for a shutdown on a rolling basis developed by each federal agency. The OMB decides what functions are essential and must continue, even in a shutdown.\n\nFederal employees considered essential continue to work without pay. After the shutdown ends, those employees receive retroactive pay for the length of the shutdown. Other federal employees, however, are furloughed until Congress passes a spending package.\n\nEssential services include employees such as air traffic controllers and border patrol, as well as services such as Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nBut even some of those services could be affected by a shutdown. During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, some TSA agents and air traffic controllers did not work because of financial limitations, causing flight delays and terminal closures.\n\nWhen it comes to nonessential services, some national parks could have to close down or offer limited resources for the length of the shutdown. Some food safety inspections considered nonessential also could be delayed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}]}

State panel ...", "text": "The fate of plastic bags in New York — handed out by the billions by grocers, clothing stores, carry-out places and many other retailers — remains up in the air in the wake of a report by a state task force.\n\nNon-biodegradable throwaway plastic bags consume raw materials and clog landfills, recycling centers and waterways. They mar trees, farm fields and beaches and they injure, sicken and kill whales, fish, turtles, birds and many other species.\n\nThe six-member task force was charged last year with recommending a way to reduce their impact. But the panel's report, made public Friday, did not make any one recommendation.\n\nInstead, the members chose to lay out eight mutually exclusive options.\n\nThose options include a ban on “single-use” plastic bags, a per-bag fee charged to consumers who accept them, and a requirement that bag manufacturers fund a more aggressive recycling program.\n\nThe aim of the fee or ban measures would be to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable bags with them when they shop, or buy them at the store.\n\nIt will be left to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state Legislature to decide whether action should be taken.\n\nPersuasion may be needed. State lawmakers have introduced numerous bills in recent years calling for such things as an outright ban, enhanced recycling programs, a 5-cent-per-bag fee and a 3-cent rebate for each reusable bag a consumer brings to the store.\n\nNone have passed. However, the state Senate and Assembly did approve a measure last year that blocked New York City from imposing a 5 cent-per-bag fee there.\n\nCuomo signed the bill, saying he didn't like the way New York City's law was written, and created the task force shortly thereafter.\n\nSalvatore Fantauzzo, founder and chief executive of the popular pizzeria chain that bears his name, said his Webster-based company is working to eliminate the use of plastic bags as well as plastic foam containers.\n\n\"We're trying to find something cool, hip, recyclable and inexpensive,\" he said. \"That's the challenge.\"\n\nThe likely solution is cardboard boxes, similar to those that hold pizza, shaped to hold chicken wings and other food items that Salvatore's now sends out the door in plastic.\n\nThe company hopes the new recyclable containers will be in use by this summer, he said.\n\nAs a consumer, Fantauzzo spoke for the part of the population that relies on single-use plastic bags for groceries and other items.\n\n\"This Sunday I was walking out of Wegmans with six or seven bags, and I'm thinking to myself 'What a great idea they came out with these,' \" he said. \"How do you get rid of that?\"\n\nWegmans Food Markets cast doubt Tuesday on the value of charging for or eliminating single-use plastic bags.\n\n\"Unintended consequences come from banning anything. And, we are never in favor of adding fees or taxes to solve issues like these,\" said Jason Wadsworth, the company's manager of sustainability.\n\n\"We know from experience that it’s possible to reduce the use of single-use plastic bags by educating and reminding customers about reusable bags and to bring plastic bags back to our store for recycling. This coupled with greater use of plastic bags made from recycled plastic will have a much greater impact in the long run,\" he said.\n\nThe company has a very active program to collect and recycle plastic bags. It also sells re-usable grocery bags.\n\n\"The consequence of banning plastic bags is the increased use of paper bags, which is far more impactful on the environment,\" Wadsworth said, adding paper bags require more energy than plastic to produce, transport and recycle.\n\nAs the task force report notes, a dozen New York villages, towns and counties have enacted their own bans or fees without interference by the legislature.\n\nAll are in Long Island, Westchester County or Ulster County. The largest municipality to act is Suffolk County, whose 5-cent-per-bag fee became effective Jan. 1.\n\nThe state task force was made up of the state's environmental commissioner, a state senator and an Assemblyman, and representatives from the New York State Association of Counties, the New York League of Conservation Voters and the Food Industry Alliance.\n\nNew Yorkers use an estimated 23 billion plastic bags a year, according to the task force. Their report documents damage done by the bags, discusses laws in place in other states and nations, and presents pros and cons of each option.\n\nFor instance, the task force reported that per-bag fees do reduce the use of plastic bags, but could impose a financial hardship on lower-income people. An outright ban would reduce usage, too, but would result in consumer complaints and force retailers to begin stocking reusable bags.\n\nThe eight options they laid out:\n\nStrengthening the current bag recycling law, which requires larger retailers to accept and recycle used plastic bags.\n\nMaking bag manufacturers responsible for a program to recycle single-use bags.\n\nInstituting an unspecified fee on each single-use bag accepted by the consumer.\n\nInstituting a unspecified flat fee on a consumer that accepts plastic bags, regardless of the number of bags taken.\n\nInstituting a fee on both plastic and paper bags.\n\nBanning single-use plastic bags.\n\nBanning plastic bags and instituting a fee on paper or other alternative bags.\n\nMaintaining the status quo.\n\nSORR@Gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/01/07/fort-collins-developments-windsor-loveland-the-ranch-montava-foothills-mall/4103863001/", "title": "Fort Collins developments: Updates from Foothills mall to RainDance", "text": "COVID-19 hasn't paused the number of residential and commercial projects planned in Northern Colorado, but it has slowed down exactly when residents will see new buildings rise out of the ground.\n\n2021 appears to be shaping up as a \"prep\" year, in which several planned projects wait for final approval or complete preliminary work before full construction can begin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/06/first-spouse-dolls-snowstang-sand-sculpture-news-around-states/40770471/", "title": "First Spouse Dolls, Snowstang: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov.

Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy plans to introduce the bill during the next legislative session, The Anchorage Daily News reports. Tribes would be asked to enter into agreements with the state called compacts to operate the schools, education officials say. The state education department plans to hold a series of community meetings this month and in early 2020 to hear Alaska residents’ comments and questions, officials say. The schools would be open to all students and “offer a unique, culturally rich combination of Western and millennia-old tribal educational models,” the education department says.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: It’s taken 17 years, but the City Council has chosen a location and is moving forward with opening a Latino cultural center. The council voted Wednesday to build the center, which will support Latino arts and culture, in the north building of Margaret T. Hance Park downtown. But the years­long debate over the proper location continued during the meeting, with some suggesting the city find a spot more relevant to the Latino community. Councilman Carlos Garcia said the location did not meet the needs of the growing Latino community, which is expected to surpass 50% of the state’s population by 2020, according to a city-commissioned study. Councilwoman Thelda Williams stressed that the vote Wednesday marked the furthest the project has been able to get in 17 years and warned against further stalling.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the state attorney general’s request to prohibit a judge who demonstrated against the death penalty from handling any cases involving her office. In a 4-3 decision, justices rejected the request by Attorney General Leslie Rutledge to remove the cases from Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen’s court. The court did not elaborate on the reason for its decision. Griffen was prohibited from handling execution cases in 2017 after he participated in an anti-death penalty demonstration the same day he blocked the state from using a lethal injection drug. Rutledge asked in September that the order on execution cases be expanded to include all civil cases involving her office. She accused Griffen of regularly yelling at attorneys from her office when they appeared in his court. Griffen has denied any claims of bias.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The governor on Wednesday blamed the Trump administration for withholding data needed to release $650 million in state aid to combat homelessness. California’s cities and counties have been waiting since June for the money approved by the Legislature. But state law says the money can only be distributed based on federally approved homelessness counts for 2019. Most California communities submitted their homeless counts months ago. But the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has not yet approved them. Gov. Gavin Newsom called the delay “politicized roadblocks put up by the Trump administration.” Instead of waiting, Newsom said his administration has collected preliminary homeless data from California communities. Based on those numbers, Newsom said the state will open applications involving as much as $500 million of the money.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State transportation officials unveiled plans Wednesday for a bus system that will shuttle skiers and snowboarders from Denver to three resorts in an effort to ease traffic congestion exacerbated by a recent population boom. Gov. Jared Polis said during a ceremony at Denver’s Union Station that the “Snowstang” service, which begins Dec. 14, will be “really convenient” and “super easy.” “We know that by providing more alternatives for people to go in buses or other ways of getting there, we can also have an impact on reducing traffic during peak times,” he said, standing across the street from three 51-seat buses equipped with restrooms, power outlets, Wi-Fi and luggage racks. The Colorado Department of Transportation will run the service to Loveland Ski Area, Arapahoe Basin and Steamboat on Saturdays and Sundays throughout winter, as well as the Martin Luther King Jr. and Presidents Day holidays.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Over a dozen people gathered Wednesday in front of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in the city to protest the nearly 2-year-long detention of a Connecticut immigrant marked for deportation. Mayor Luke Bronin joined the wife of Bakhodir Madjitov and others to support the Uzbek immigrant and father of three children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. “I’m living in pain with broke bones since my third child was born; I can neither work nor live peacefully,” his wife, Madina Madjitov, said at the rally. “I don’t think I can provide normal life without my husband for my children.” Diana Blank, one of the man’s lawyers, said he was granted in November two temporary emergency stays of removal by federal courts. He originally had a final order of removal of no later than Dec. 2. It’s unclear now how soon he could be deported.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A bear has caused an uproar after running through the streets of the First State’s biggest city. Police spent part of Thursday morning trying to catch the animal while bystanders rushed to get a look. Some residents were told to shelter in place. But by 11:15 a.m., police said the bear had left their jurisdiction. It’s unclear where the animal went, but it caused widespread excitement in a city and a state that rarely see bears. During the morning, the bear was seen in a backyard and in an alley. People later spotted it on railroad tracks behind a grocery store and then moving toward a park. Wilmington police said they had planned to tranquilize the bear. But they also warned that they might have to shoot it if the animal came to close to people. The sighting in Wilmington comes after drivers reported seeing a bear crossing major highways earlier in the week.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new D.C. Council proposal looks to create equity among parent teacher organizations in the district, WUSA-TV reports. Councilmember David Grosso has introduced a bill that would create an equity fund to benefit PTOs in the D.C. public school district. The bill’s language dictates that after a PTO expends more than $10,000 in a school year, it will be charged an “equity fee” of 10 cents for every additional dollar it spends. The monies collected from those fees will then go toward the equity fund, which would then be equally distributed to other PTOs in the district. PTOs often raise funds on the behalf of schools to finance field trips and extracurricular activities. According to Grosso’s office, last year 75% of D.C. elementary schools did not report having any PTO revenue.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: It took artist Leandro Erlich two years and 330 tons of sand to create his largest work of art to date – a giant traffic jam, made entirely of sand. Erlich was commissioned by the city of Miami Beach to create the work, which was unveiled during Art Basel. The surreal traffic jam depicts 66 life-sized sculptures of cars and trucks stuck in an imaginary traffic jam on the oceanfront of popular Lincoln Road. The installation is meant to suggest a future relic, like a contemporary Pompeii, and alludes to Miami’s fragile position in the large universal canvas, touching on climate crisis and rising sea levels. The installation cost over a million dollars, but the city paid $300,000 thanks to sponsors and donations. It will remain on display until Dec. 15.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some Georgia State University students are demanding that the mayor remove a prominent downtown statue of a 19th century newspaper editor who called for maintaining white supremacy in the South. Henry Grady advocated for a “New South” after the Civil War. A plaque on the statue, erected in 1891, describes him as a patriot. But Grady also campaigned against equality for freed slaves, saying that “the supremacy of the white race of the South must be maintained forever.” “Let us be clear in recognizing that Grady, as a journalist, promoted racism,” several student groups wrote in an editorial Tuesday in Georgia State’s student newspaper. “Grady, as an orator, promoted racism. And Grady was certainly no patriot – he was simply a racist.” They want the statue relocated to the Atlanta History Center, but if Georgia law won’t allow that, they’ll accept a new marker explaining Grady’s beliefs.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State health officials have investigated dozens of adult residential care homes in the state after receiving reports that the facilities were operating without licenses. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports that the state Department of Health has received 114 complaints about unlicensed homes, and 74 remain open. Officials say state legislators passed a law last year authorizing the department to investigate and enter unlicensed care homes amid plans to crack down on these facilities. State officials say they have entered and inspected 52 homes so far with plans to issue 13 notices of violation to illegal operators. Officials say some residents of these homes have lost thousands of dollars because health insurers do not cover unlicensed facilities. Department officials say there likely are not enough licensed facilities for residents.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is the least-regulated in the nation, Gov. Brad Little said Wednesday. The Republican said he’s cut or simplified 75% of Idaho’s administrative rules this year and leapfrogged ahead of South Dakota as the least-regulated state. State officials said they base the state’s least-regulated status on information collected by George Mason University. Little said he’s eliminated more than 30,000 restrictions and some 1,800 pages of regulations. Little had sweeping authority to eliminate thousands of rules after state lawmakers fought over the administrative rules process and failed to renew them before adjourning in April. Little said the cuts to regulations will help the economy. “Folks, when you reduce friction on entrepreneurs, good-paying jobs will follow,” the governor declared.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Hundreds of artifacts belonging to Abraham Lincoln and his family will remain in the state’s hands with the refinancing of a loan used to buy them. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Foundation says it has refinanced the 2007 loan it used to purchase 1,500 items from collector Louise Taper. The foundation voted last year to seek an auction house to prepare selling some of the items in the collection, which includes a stovepipe hat purportedly belonging to Lincoln, if it couldn’t pay off the $9.2 million remaining on the loan by this fall when the note came due. But the foundation says it negotiated a three-year extension with Lake Forest Bank and Trust at a lower interest rate. In addition to the hat whose authenticity has been challenged, the collection includes the bloodied gloves Lincoln wore to the theater the night he was shot.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University President Mitch Daniels apologized Wednesday for recent remarks in which he described an African American scholar as “one of the rarest creatures in America.” “I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students,” Daniels wrote in a letter sent to the Purdue chapter of the NAACP, Purdue’s Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff, the Black Student Union and other groups. “The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved.” Daniels made the comment Nov. 20 after a meeting with Purdue Student Government leaders when students asked Daniels to follow up on his thoughts about what Purdue was doing to promote diversity on campus and to make underrepresented minority students feel welcome.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A man convicted of delivering meth two decades ago should have been added to the state’s database of felons banned from voting, but an embarrassing clerical error instead listed the police force that busted him. The inclusion of the Des Moines Police Department among the names of murderers, drug dealers and other disenfranchised criminals is just one glaring example of the mistakes, wrongful additions and omissions that make the 103,000-entry database unreliable, a review by the Associated Press found. “Holy cow!” Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek said as he was alerted to the error. “You would think there would be an audit with something as important as voting.” The database, which is part of the state’s 14-year-old voter registration system, helps determine a person’s eligibility to cast a ballot, run for public office or serve as a public official.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Death typically brings two options – burial or cremation – but a third option could be on the horizon in the state. The Kansas City Star reports that something called promession, the creation of a Swedish biologist, would allow the body to be cryogenically frozen and vibrated into tiny pieces. Proponents say it holds the potential to make burial more environmentally friendly. Promession has been used on pigs but so far has not been tried on humans. Still, the company pursuing the idea sees Kansas as fertile ground for the new method. That company, Promessa, has one of its few U.S. representatives based in Overland Park. Meanwhile, a state lawmaker may introduce a bill in 2020 to clear the way for the new method.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Abbey of Gethsemani has been added to the Kentucky Natural Areas Registry. The Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves said in a statement that it was recognizing the abbey’s historic stewardship of more than 1,500 acres of land in Nelson County. The voluntary designation is designed to recognize stewardship and awareness of the ecological significance of a property, state officials say. Landowners don’t relinquish any rights but agree to protect the area as best they can. Abbot Elias Dietz said he looks forward to collaborating with state officials to preserve and enhance natural areas such as grasslands and glades. Properties on the registry must have habitat for plants or animals that are rare or have a declining population, or they must contain an outstanding example of a Kentucky ecological community, such as an old-growth forest, wetland, glade or prairie.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A parish commission has approved funding to remove a Confederate monument during a special budget meeting. The Caddo Parish Commission allocated $500,000 to remove the 30-foot-tall marble and granite Confederate monument in downtown Shreveport that was erected in 1905 on the north side of the Caddo Courthouse lawn. Although the commission has the funding to remove the statue, there’s still a legal battle brewing between the parish and the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The organization filed a temporary restraining order against the parish and the commission, halting the removal of the statue, and during Tuesday’s meeting continued speaking out in opposition of the statue’s removal. A judge ruled Nov. 29 that neither the parish nor the commission could move the statue, for now. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 13.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s independent U.S. senator says blueberry growers need help from the federal government to survive the Trump administration’s trade battle with China. Sen. Angus King says the value of Maine’s wild blueberry exports to China is on pace to drop by nearly 97% since 2017. Maine is America’s producer of wild blueberries, which are smaller than cultivated blueberries and are widely used in frozen and processed products. King says it’s unfair that Maine wild blueberry growers haven’t been included in President Donald Trump’s farm bailout programs. He says the blueberries are “an iconic Maine agricultural product” that has “lost a piece of its future.” The Maine wild blueberry industry is facing other difficulties outside the trade dispute with China. Prices for the fruit have been much lower than they were earlier this decade. The size of the harvest last year was also the lowest in more than a decade.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Four chambers of commerce in the state are endorsing a plan to build a $10 billion high-speed maglev train between Baltimore and Washington. The chambers of commerce for the city of Baltimore, Baltimore County, northern Anne Arundel County and Prince George’s County voiced support for the first phase of the project Wednesday. The high-speed train would help economic development and local business opportunities, the groups say. It could connect the two cities in 15 minutes along a 36-mile route. The project is currently under review by federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Federal Railroad Administration. The four chambers of commerce serve more than 1,500 member organizations, representing cities, agencies and businesses throughout portions of central Maryland.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A proposed ballot question that would overhaul the state’s electoral system has cleared another hurdle on the way to next year’s ballot. The group Voter Choice for Massachusetts is pushing what is called a ranked-choice voting system. On Wednesday, the group said it has submitted more than enough voter signatures to move the question along. Under the proposed system, voters have the option of ranking candidates on the ballot in order of their preference. If a candidate garners a majority of first-place votes, that candidate wins. If no candidate receives a majority of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who ranked the eliminated candidate as their first choice will have their vote count instantly toward their second choice. The process repeats until one candidate receives a majority of the vote and wins.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state is opening its surplus store for a one-day sale Saturday. The shelves will be stocked with goods from police, airports and colleges, and property no longer needed by state government. The goods include computers, phones, knives, sporting goods, desks, chairs and even fashion accessories. The store in Lansing will be open from 8 a.m. to noon. Cash and credit cards will be accepted. More information is available online. Online shoppers can bid 24 hours a day at Michigan.gov/MiBid.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State budget officials projected a $1.332 billion surplus in the current two-year budget period Thursday, setting up contentious debates for the 2020 legislative session on whether to save the extra money or spend it, possibly to cover tax cuts. Budget Commissioner Myron Frans credited the surplus to a better-than-expected finish to the last budget period, a rosier revenue forecast and a modest decrease in estimated spending. He said the extra revenue will also boost the state’s separate budget reserve – a cushion against economic downturns – to $2.359 billion. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and Democratic legislative leaders joined Frans in urging a cautious approach to using the money, given that the forecast predicts slower economic growth over the next four years and doesn’t account for inflation in program costs. But they agreed the forecast shows the state can afford to pass a sizable public works borrowing package.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: William Carey University is waiving tuition for a professional development course in an effort to combat the state’s teacher shortage. The university said in a statement that the course can be used to renew a Mississippi Educator License. It begins in January and lasts five weeks, news outlets report. The class will be taught online, Dr. Teresa Poole told WHLT-TV. Poole says anyone can apply, but preference will be given to practicing teachers and those who have licenses that are about to expire. There is a $85 application fee. The deadline to apply is Jan. 8, and the course begins the following Monday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri has received a $500,000 grant that will help it restart a law clinic dedicated to investigating possible cases of wrongful conviction. KMIZ reports the grant from the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice will fund the MU Innocence Clinic. The money will pay for DNA tests on evidence involved in cases where eyewitnesses may have misidentified a suspect. Law professor Rodney Uphoff says the school will partner with the Midwest Innocence Project, a law firm that specializes in exonerating inmates who may actually be innocent. Students in the clinic will review cases of the firm’s clients to interview witnesses in the case and identify possible pieces of evidence for testing. Eight students will work in the clinic during the 2020 spring semester.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: National park officials have announced plans for the selective slaughter of between 600 and 900 Yellowstone bison this winter to help manage population numbers. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports the officials expect most of the animals to be taken by hunters or shipped to slaughter. Some would stay alive in corrals or under park quarantine. Officials say the exact number of bison expected to be culled out of the estimated 4,900 depends on the winter migration. State, federal and tribal agencies managing bison say the winter plan was finalized Tuesday under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, a day after a judge rejected an attempt to block bison hunts this year. Officials say the plan includes putting 110 bison into brucellosis quarantine to produce disease-free bison.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Madonna Rehabilitation Hospitals is planning a $57 million expansion on its Lincoln campus and expects to begin construction in the spring. The project is a planned three-story, 112,000-square-foot patient wing that will also add 59 new rooms to replace ones that were built in the early 1970s, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Madonna currently has 120 patient rooms, about half of which were upgraded and modernized in 2000. Hospital officials said at a news conference Wednesday that the new rooms will be bigger and more modern than current ones, allowing patients to be more independent and providing more room for staff and families. Construction will develop in phases and is expected to be completed by January 2023.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state’s two public universities saw significant spikes from 2017 to 2018 in reports of sexual violence, according to annual data going to the Nevada System of Higher Education board. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the tally says rape, fondling, stalking, and domestic and dating violence went up at the University of Nevada, Reno and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Police chiefs from both campuses attributed the numbers to an increase in reporting by students. “We’ve gone too long with people not feeling comfortable with reporting,” said Todd Renwick, police director at UNR, Truckee Meadows Community College, Western Nevada College and the Desert Research Institute in Reno. He said an Office on Violence Against Women grant was used to hire an in-house coordinator to field sexual assault cases, help victims file police reports and Title IX complaints, and connect with outside resources.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is taking steps to salvage federal money for schools that provide mental health counseling, speech therapy and other services to students, Gov. Chris Sununu and other state officials said Wednesday. The Medicaid to Schools program allows schools to be reimbursed by the federal government for services provided to Medicaid-eligible students. While it once applied only to special education students, the state expanded the program in 2017, and it now covers thousands of students from virtually every district. The program is in jeopardy, however, because under new federal guidance issued in July, those providing the services must be licensed by a medical board, not just credentialed by the state Department of Education. To address that issue, Sununu signed an executive order Wednesday to temporarily speed up the licensing process, and bipartisan legislation is being drafted to create a permanent change.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The Ocean Casino resort has hired a female CEO, one of a small handful of women leading casinos or casino companies nationwide. Terry Glebocki was named CEO this week after serving in the job in an interim capacity since August. She has more than 30 years of financial management experience and recently served as the casino’s chief financial officer. Glebocki previously worked for Tropicana Entertainment and Trump Entertainment Resorts. Ocean is the only one of Atlantic City’s nine casinos to be led by a woman. Glebocki says maintaining profitability and increasing revenue are her top goals. She also says she reads every social media post she can find from customers about the casino.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Commerce Department is awarding the city a $1.2 million grant to help with redevelopment of its historic rail yards. Commerce Department officials were joined by Mayor Tim Keller and others in announcing the funding Wednesday. They say the award is expected to create more than 300 jobs and generate $9 million in private investment. The federal grant will be matched by local funds. Efforts to revitalize the rail yards began more than a decade ago with the creation of a special advisory board, and the city adopted a master plan for the 27-acre site in 2014. One portion is now used for a popular weekend market that features local vendors.Aside from attracting new retail, office and hospitality businesses, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the grant could lead to expansion of Albuquerque’s film industry.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: One of the brightest signs of the holiday season has come to light. The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree was officially turned on Wednesday night, at an event featuring celebrities including Idina Menzel, Lea Michele and Ne-Yo among the performers. The tree, a Norway spruce that’s more than 60 years old, stands 77 feet tall and was lit up in colorful Christmas lights before 10 p.m. It was on the property of Carol Schultz in the village of Florida, New York, and was cut down last month. The tree was decorated with miles of lights, with a huge Swarovski crystal star at the top. It stays in place until Jan. 17, when it will be taken down and donated to Habitat for Humanity to help build homes. There’s been a tree in Rockefeller Center at Christmastime since 1931. The holiday lighting has been broadcast since 1951.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: A second town in the state has canceled its Christmas parade over concerns about possible protests of a float celebrating the Confederacy. Leaders in Wake Forest had said last week that the town’s parade would go on and include the Sons & Daughters of the Confederacy despite a planned demonstration. That decision changed once police learned that the number of expected protesters had grown from 10 to 200 people, Police Chief Jeff Leonard says. The entire parade has now been canceled for safety reasons. This would have been the 72nd year of the parade, news outlets report. “We aren’t happy telling kids they can’t attend or participate in this year’s parade – but it’s better than trying to explain to a parent whose child was injured despite so many warning signs,” the chief said. The town of Garner also canceled its Christmas parade this year over fears that a float sponsored by the Sons of Confederate Veterans would be “targeted for disruption.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Burleigh County will hold a special meeting next week to take comments on whether it should resettle additional refugees. County commissioners postponed action on the matter at a meeting Monday after an overflow crowd showed up to address the issue. A recent executive order by President Donald Trump stated that new efforts to resettle refugees would have to receive permission from state and local governments. Gov. Doug Burgum announced last month that the state would continue to receive refugees as long as local governments agreed. The public will be able to voice opinions next Monday on whether to allow Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota to continue resettling refugees in the county. Commissioners could vote on the matter at the special meeting Monday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The governor wants lawmakers to drop bills that would prohibit local governments from forbidding the use of plastic bags. Gov. Mike DeWine opposes a pair of bills offered by fellow Republicans that would forbid municipalities and counties from banning single-use plastic bags by groceries and other stores. Some local governments, including Cuyahoga County and the Columbus suburb of Bexley, are trying to regulate the use of plastic bags in an effort to reduce litter and plastic waste in landfills. Some lawmakers and business groups say the local bans make it harder for grocers and other businesses to operate. DeWine said Wednesday that it would be a mistake for state lawmakers to override local government decisions. State government should allow allow local communities to do “what they think is best,” the governor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The State Department of Health has asked for less money in its proposed budget. Oklahoma Commissioner of Health Gary Cox asked legislators this week to decrease his agency’s funding by 1.5%. The Oklahoman reports the current state budget allocates $60.8 million to the department. Cox says he needs $56.2 million for fiscal 2021. Cox says he aims to minimize administrative costs and maximize services. He says he will eliminate unnecessary jobs and combine employee duties. He also notes that he plans to add nurses and other positions to work at local health departments. Lawmakers grilled Cox during Monday’s budget hearing, saying his proposal is confusing and counterintuitive because the public needs the funds. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Cox in September to lead the department.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Conservationists have successfully bred the extremely rare, federally threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly in captivity, a potential breakthrough for saving a species that once was found in coastal regions from California to British Columbia but is now reduced to five isolated populations, the Oregon Zoo says. The captive breeding resulted in 269 silverspot caterpillars that will be released into the wild once they transform into butterflies. “This is a really exciting breakthrough,” says Tia Perry, a keeper in the butterfly conservation lab. Perry says wild silverspots lay their eggs in the Oregon Zoo lab each year, but this is the first time a female butterfly bred in captivity. At the request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the zoo’s lab held back 22 pupae from this year’s butterfly release, and one of the resulting female butterflies mated in captivity with a wild male.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Owners of alligators and other dangerous reptiles will be required to register their pets with the city under an ordinance approved this week. The ordinance requires owners of alligators, crocodiles and venomous snakes to store and transport their pets in escape-proof containers. The owners must also provide the city with a list of each reptile they own. Rooms and buildings housing the animals also must be posted with notice that they contain reptiles. City Councilwoman Darlene Harris, who sponsored the bill, said regulations are needed, particularly after a number of loose alligators appeared in the city in recent months. At least four alligators were captured from May to October in the city and surrounding municipalities, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports. First-time violators could face a $300 fine per reptile. Repeat offenders could be assessed a fine of $10,000 per reptile.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: The University of Rhode Island’s College of Business has received the largest gift in the institution’s history, school officials announced Wednesday. Former Hasbro Inc. Chairman and CEO Alfred J. Verrecchia made a donation of $15 million with his wife, Gloria, to his alma mater to create a scholarship for students, a fund for students seeking competitive internships, a faculty chair and professorship, and an emerging technology fund. The gift will offer support to students who have secured internships but do not have the financial backing to pursue them. The faculty position will focus on artificial intelligence and business analytics. The technology fund is intended to provide the tools students will need to prepare them for their careers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A recently discovered letter that could implicate a former Greenville County sheriff and his team in the 1975 murder of a deputy and his father is missing. Greenville police found the letter in a stack of documents while cleaning out storage lockers at the Law Enforcement Center in April 2018 and subsequently lost it, according to a statement the department sent Thursday. The letter appeared to be addressed to late Sheriff Cash Williams from one of his mistresses and indicated he was involved in the murder of Frank and Rufus Looper, as well as framing the man ultimately convicted in the slayings, Police Chief Ken Miller told the Greenville Public Safety Review Board during a July meeting. In a statement sent Thursday, the Greenville Police Department said it has been unable to find the evidence after searching investigator work stations, case files, and storage areas.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem’s husband has reached another milestone in his role as first gentleman, albeit a very small one. Bryon Noem has been memorialized in the First Spouse Doll Case, where dolls are displayed with the attire that the spouse – and, in one instance, sister – of every South Dakota governor wore at their inauguration. The dolls date all the way back to one showing the dress worn by Margaret Wylie, the wife of South Dakota’s first governor, Arthur Mellette. Every doll is displayed in a series of cases in the South Dakota State Capitol. Bryon Noem’s doll is the first one not to be wearing a dress, instead sporting a miniature tuxedo and bow tie. It is also the only doll with a head, which Sandy Rhoden, who spearheaded the project, said had no special meaning.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennesseans are invited to visit the governor’s mansion this holiday season for self-guided tours. This year’s decorations are themed “Songs of the Season,” with each tree decorated to represent a different classic Christmas carol. Visitors may also bring donations to benefit several nonprofits from around the state. “Bill and I consider it a great privilege to be celebrating our first Christmas at the Tennessee Residence,” first lady Maria Lee said in a news release. “We are delighted to open the doors of Tennessee’s home and share in the joys of the season with our fellow Tennesseans.” The free holiday tours begin Friday. Reservations are required. More information about the tours and suggested donations for charity can be found online.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of children adopted from the state’s foster care has reached a four-year high, and just over half of the kids were adopted by family members, according to data released Wednesday by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. “This is certainly great news and affirmation that our year-round adoption efforts are paying off,” said Kristene Blackstone, an associate commissioner for Child Protective Services, an arm of DFPS. All told, more than 20,000 children left Texas foster care during the 12-month period that ended Sept. 1. However, only 6,107 found permanent homes through the adoption process. Of those, 3,095 were placed with family members. Both numbers are all-time highs, officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A massive open-pit copper mine in the Oquirrh Mountains southwest of the city will remain open through 2032 after the owners announced a new $1.5 billion investment. Rio Tinto announced Tuesday that it will invest $1.5 billion in the Bingham Canyon Mine due to increasing demand for copper in electric vehicles and renewable power technologies. Closures of other mines have also affected supply and made the investment make sense, Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a news release. The investment will extend the mine’s operations an additional six years beyond the previously anticipated shutdown in 2026. A 2013 landslide at the mine that carried enough rock, dirt and debris to bury New York’s Central Park under 66 feet of rubble set back production and triggered layoffs. The mine still employees 1,900 people.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has announced his annual State of the Union essay contest for the state’s high school students. It’s the tenth annual contest in which students describe a major issue facing the country and how to address it. The contest coincides with the president’s annual State of the Union speech to the joint session of Congress each January. Students must submit their 250-500 word essays by Jan. 8. A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers will judge the essays. The 10 finalists’ essays will be entered into the Congressional Record. Finalists also will be invited to be interviewed about the topic they covered. “We need our students to help find solutions for the problems that face our country as they are our future leaders,” Sanders says.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A commission assigned to research racist laws from the state’s past recommended Thursday that dozens of them be repealed, including measures that resisted desegregation, prevented black voters from casting ballots and prohibited interracial marriage. While most of the measures are outdated and “have no legal effect,” they are still enshrined in law, the nine-member commission of attorneys, judges, scholars and community leaders wrote in an interim report. Although “some of these acts were rendered null and void by an amended Virginia Constitution, by landmark civil rights cases or legislation, it’s clear that they are vestiges of Virginia’s segregationist past that still sit on the books,” Chief Deputy Attorney General Cynthia Hudson, who chairs the commission, said at a news conference in Richmond. “We should not afford them the distinction of that official status.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a voter-approved $30 car tab measure will remain on hold while a legal fight over the initiative’s constitutionality plays out. The Washington State Attorney General’s Office filed an emergency motion Monday saying Washington voters’ wishes were being “stymied” by a King County Superior Court judge’s decision to stop Initiative 976 from taking effect. On Tuesday, initiative sponsor Tim Eyman and his allies filed their own request to vacate the lower court’s injunction and move the case to the state Supreme Court. That was dismissed by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Voters last month approved I-976, the statewide measure that calls for lowering many vehicle registration fees to $30, rolling back car-tab taxes that fund Sound Transit and doing away with local car-tab fees. Much of the measure had been set to take effect Thursday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: After a photo surfaced of state correction officer trainees giving what appears to be the Nazi salute, state officials quickly suspended some employees, and the governor ordered the firing of those involved. The image, showing a more than two dozen trainees with their arms raised and faces blurred, was released Thursday by the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety. Before the photo was made public, the agency’s secretary, Jeff Sandy, released a memo describing the image of Basic Training Class Number 18 as “distasteful, hurtful, disturbing, highly insensitive, and completely inappropriate.” He wrote that the picture “betrays the professionalism I have seen time and time again displayed and practiced by our brave correctional employees.” Sandy’s memo ordered all copies of the picture destroyed or taken out of circulation to prevent them from spreading.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: Workers will install a Christmas tree outside Pine Grove Cemetery’s Grand Avenue gate, a symbol of hope and resilience as the cemetery and the community contend with deep grief. The tree honors Patty Grimm, the cemetery’s general manager, who was shot and killed there Oct. 3. But cemetery leaders hope the tree can be used to help everyone in the community cope with loss during the holidays. Two others were wounded at the scene. Rosemelia Short, who is related to an employee at the cemetery, was hospitalized, treated and released shortly after the incident. William Buhse, who oversaw the cemetery’s work crew, was seriously wounded and is now undergoing long-term rehabilitation, says Pat Haskin, who is volunteering to help manage the cemetery until a new manager is hired to replace Grimm.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The U.S. Department of Energy has announced plans to partner with the University of Wyoming for further research on how to trap carbon dioxide before it leaks into the atmosphere. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the federal agency and university researchers plan to study the economics and technology behind carbon capturing at two of the state’s coal-fired power plants. Officials say research would begin at the Dave Johnston power plant in Glenrock and the Naughton power plant in Kemmerer. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon says he has remained committed to the state’s coal assets, as it produces about 40% of the nation’s coal despite declining demand nationwide and increasing interest in renewables and natural gas.

Trussville City Schools Superintendent Pattie Neill’s contract was scheduled to expire June 30, 2026, but her attorney renegotiated the pact that will now end Oct. 31, 2023. Neill will be paid through that date but will no longer be in charge of the district, which is in a suburb of Birmingham, al.com reports. “It provides us an opportunity to move forward; it provides us an opportunity to have a fresh start,” Trussville City Board of Education Vice President Kim DeShazo said of the negotiation involving Neill. “I am looking forward to our city being in the news for the things that we have to celebrate because Trussville City Schools does have a lot to celebrate and a lot to be thankful for ... I’m looking forward to the next chapter.” The board named Interim Superintendent Frank Costanzo as the district’s acting superintendent as the system begins the search for Neill’s permanent replacement. Since Sept. 30, Neill had been on a 60-day leave of absence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said Wednesday that he is satisfied with Alaska’s ballot counting process and that there are no plans for a statewide hand-count audit of a race like the one he called for two years ago. Meyer oversees elections in Alaska and after the 2020 general election announced plans for an audit of votes on a statewide ballot initiative that narrowly passed. He cast the audit, conducted after the race was certified, as a way to address questions that had been raised about the validity of election results tied to vote tabulation equipment used by the state. The audit affirmed the passage of the initiative, which ended party primaries and instituted ranked-choice voting in general elections. This year’s elections were the first held under the new elections process. Meyer and Division of Elections Director Gail Fenumiai held a briefing with reporters Wednesday, ahead of next week’s election. Meyer said he is “satisfied that the process works and that there’s enough checks and balances in place that if something isn’t quite right, we’ll catch it soon.” In an interview with the Associated Press, Meyer said that with the 2020 review, “we were able to show folks that the machines worked correctly.” He said it has been frustrating to see people get misinformation from social media or from online videos.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A planned research center operated by the University of Arizona will get a $150million allocation of federal money via the state, officials announced Wednesday. The designation comes from money the state received through the American Rescue Plan Act, C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Gov. Doug Ducey, wrote in an email. The funds will go to the UA Health Sciences’ planned Phoenix-based Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies, which will be part of the downtown, 30-acre Phoenix Bioscience Core campus. There are no current cost estimates for the project, UA officials said Wednesday. The Phoenix Bioscience Core includes several education, health care and research entities, including the Arizona-based Translational Genomics Research Institute, the UA College of Medicine Phoenix, and the Dignity Health-Cancer Institute at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center. The Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies intends to advance immunology research in four areas: cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and real-time immune system monitoring, UA officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: Two former Crawford County deputies fired over excessive force complaints had requested a public hearing Wednesday in efforts to clear their names, but they didn’t show up, the sheriff’s office reports. Neither Levi White nor Zack King appeared at the sheriff’s department lobby Wednesday. Instead, a woman showed up to make accusations that she, too, has been roughed up during an arrest by White. White and King were caught on video making a rough arrest of Randal Worcester on Aug. 21. The video taken by a bystander showed White, King and a Mulberry police officer, Thell Riddle, beating Worcester after a convenience store clerk in Alma claimed Worcester threatened her. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith, who previously represented Worcester, said he is now represented by another attorney in Oklahoma City. Powell is now representing Tammy Nelson, who said on Aug. 21, she was at her home, where she was involved in a civil matter that resulted in a heated argument that didn’t go well. White was sent to the call, where things escalated for the worse, she said. “I was just attacked by him and violated and thrown to the ground,” Nelson said. She was arrested and jailed on complaints of obstruction of a government operation and harassment. Powell said he has heard from other clients with such complaints.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Delays in testing evidence from sexual assaults have been a lost opportunity for investigators and a source of frustration for victims for years, prompting state officials to announce Tuesday that they have created a way for survivors to track the progress of linking their rape kits with DNA evidence. California is also the first state to hire a sexual assault evidence outreach coordinator, Sarai Crain, who will work with investigators, medical facilities and others to help track and process sexual assault evidence. The new online tracking system was required under a law approved by state lawmakers last year. It follows a 2017 California law that requires law enforcement agencies to submit the evidence for testing within 20 days and requires crime labs to test the evidence within 120 days or provide reasons for any delay. The goal is to end the backlog of rape kits by local agencies, make sure they are tested quickly once they are submitted, and keep survivors better informed, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. Of nearly 6,400 kits collected in 2020, 90% were analyzed by May 2021, according to an annual report by the attorney general’s office. The rest were in various stages of processing. About half the tests found DNA that was compared to other DNA on the FBI’s database, and nearly 800 resulted in “hits.”\n\nColorado\n\nIdaho Springs: The Colorado city of Idaho Springs said Wednesday it has agreed to pay $7 million to a 75-year-old man who said an officer used a stun gun on him without warning and dragged him from his apartment after a dispute with a neighbor, causing a stroke that left him with permanent injuries. Michael Clark alleged in the federal civil rights suit filed last year that he suffered numerous health problems after Officer Nicholas Hanning used a Taser on him in his home in Idaho Springs, causing Clark to lose consciousness, fall and strike his head. Clark also accused Hanning of putting a knee on his neck, depriving him of oxygen and increasing his risk of death. Hanning, who was fired after the May 2021 encounter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and relinquished his right to serve as a law enforcement officer in Colorado. He was sentenced in January to two years of probation and community service. The Idaho Springs statement said the city admits no liability but is settling the case “for economic reasons and to bring closure to all involved.” It did say the city and Police Chief Nate Buseck “acknowledge the poor judgment that led to the use” of the Taser against Clark, which Buseck previously described as unacceptable. “He is wheelchair bound and now forever dependent on his family and doctors to survive,” Clark’s attorney, Sarah Schielke, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A man who was linked to the sexual assaults of four women in 1984 by information on a genealogy database was convicted Wednesday of all eight kidnapping charges against him. A state jury in Hartford took less than an hour of deliberations to unanimously convict Michael Sharpe after a five-day trial. He faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 9. Sharpe, 71, who had been free on a promise to appear in court, was detained after the verdicts because a judge set a new bond at $2.5 million. At least two of the victims were in the courtroom and wept after the verdicts were announced, The Hartford Courant reports. Sharpe’s public defender, Dana Sanetti, said in her closing argument Tuesday that the only evidence connecting Sharpe to the attacks was his DNA, which was only “a piece of the puzzle,” Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Sharpe, of Marlborough, was once the chief executive officer of a group that ran the Jumoke Academy, a tuition-free charter school in Hartford. Prosecutors said he broke into the women’s homes in four different towns and sexually assaulted them at gunpoint in June and July of 1984. Investigators found DNA evidence at the homes, but no matches could be found at the time, and the cases went cold.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A big change is coming for the state’s surf-fishing car tag program: There will be no cap on the number of permits issued for 2023, according to an announcement from State Parks Director Ray Bivens on Wednesday. Yes, that means people don’t have to rush to the computer or Delaware State Parks’ gates to snag those coveted surf-fishing tags that allow drive-on beach access. No longer crushed by the “sold out” announcement from State Parks, anyone who wants a surf-fishing tag can now get one. Still, there was a reason the cap was put in place − to protect the natural resources and manage crowds. That’s where another change comes in. After a stakeholder group met this spring, State Parks announced it will be piloting a new reservation system for 36 of the busiest days during the season. The pilot reservation system and lifting of the cap come after the demand for surf-fishing permits has continued to grow in recent years and peaked at unprecedented heights in the past two years. In 2020, the maximum 17,000 tags sold out in just a few months, prompting the state to release an additional 1,000 tags. Eager anglers and beach enthusiasts lined up overnight for a chance to get one of these extra permits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Internationally renowned chef Gordon Ramsay teamed up with Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday for a friendly cooking competition at his newly opened restaurant in the nation’s capital, WUSA-TV reports. Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips opened Oct. 25 in The Wharf area of the city. The location is the third in the franchise, his take on the classic English street food. The menu ranges from classic fish and chips to chicken, shrimp, “dirty chips” and Gordon’s signature shakes: Sticky Toffee and Biscoff. During the competition, Bowser got to try her hand at one of the signature shakes with the help of Ramsay. The famed chef and the mayor competed against Deputy Mayor John Falcicchio and chef Christina Wilson, who won season 10 of Ramsay’s reality show “Hell’s Kitchen,” to see who could make the best Biscoff shake. The Ramsay-Bowser duo claimed victory. There could be a chance for a rematch in the future, as restaurateur Ramsay is not stopping with the Fish & Chips location in D.C. He is also opening his wildly popular Hell’s Kitchen restaurant, inspired by the show of the same name, on The Wharf as well in early 2023. Until then, the Fish & Chips location in D.C. is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday-Saturday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida State University held a memorial service on campus Wednesday evening to remember the victims of the 2018 yoga studio shooting in the city. The service marked four years since the mass shooting took place at Tallahassee Hot Yoga, where Scott Paul Beierle killed two women, 21-year-old Maura Binkley and 61-year-old Nancy Van Vessem, and injured five other victims before killing himself. A key part of the service was the announcement of a new initiative called “Florida State United: One Voice Against Hate,” which aims to bring more awareness to hate crimes through research and education. “As Maura and Nancy exemplified in their lives, love is the most important work we can do,” Jeff Binkley, Maura Binkley’s father, said to the FSU and Tallahassee community as they were gathered near the Integration Statue on campus. “Always remember that only love can conquer hate.” Maura Binkley was a senior at FSU double majoring in German and English, and Van Vessem was a chief medical officer at Capital Health Plan, as well as a former faculty member at FSU’s College of Medicine. Signs were placed throughout the area with phrases such as “A Voice for Safety,” “A Voice for Peace” and “A Voice for Freedom.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state agency has stopped accepting applications from people seeking assistance with their rent payments, saying money from the federally funded aid program has begun to run out. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs posted an announcement on its website last week that the agency is no longer taking rental assistance applications, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The news caught housing advocates off guard and left some tenants scrambling to pay rent with little warning, said Lindsay Siegel, director of housing advocacy at Legal Aid of Atlanta. “The DCA put some tenants in a pretty bad position,” Siegel said. “If they knew they were running out of money, they should have told them so they could plan.” The federal government put $46.5 billion into an emergency rental assistance program in 2020 in hopes of averting spikes in evictions and homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Treasury Department reported a year ago that several states and large cities had already exhausted their share of the funding. Now Georgia is getting close to running out of rental assistance money, prompting the Department of Community Affairs to suspend applications, agency Commissioner Christopher Nunn said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The ground is still shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating it could erupt. Scientists say they don’t expect that to happen right away, but officials on the Big Island are telling residents to be prepared. Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest – that title goes to Mauna Kea – but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass. It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is currently erupting from its summit crater. Kilauea is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean. Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. In written history, dating to 1843, it has erupted 33 times. The Big Island is mostly rural and is home to cattle ranches, coffee farms and beach resorts. Mauna Loa’s eruptions differ from Kilauea’s in part because it is taller. Its greater height gives it steeper slopes, which allow lava to rush down its hillsides faster than Kilauea’s. Its enormous size may allow it to store more magma, leading to larger lava flows when an eruption occurs. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has more than 60 GPS stations on Mauna Loa taking measurements to estimate the location and the amount of magma accumulating beneath the surface. There’s also a thermal webcam at Mauna Loa’s summit that will identify the presence of heat. And satellite radar can keep track of ground swelling and deflation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A high-profile attorney who has defended in state and federal courts some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation is among the latest attorneys to quit state employment. Former Deputy Attorney General Megan Larrondo is one of eight attorneys and a handful of other staffers who have left or are leaving the Idaho attorney general’s office following Raúl Labrador’s win over five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the Republican primary in May. More departures are expected. Information obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request shows that Larrondo’s job ended Monday. Court documents filed Friday in both U.S. District Court in Idaho and the Idaho Supreme Court show filings requesting Larrondo be removed as attorney of record in the state’s abortion cases. The state and federal courts have yet to make final rulings in those cases. Labrador, a former U.S. representative who has said voters are looking for an aggressive, conservative attorney general, has promised to make the office more partisan should he win in next week’s general election. In a series of recent interviews, he denigrated attorneys working in the office, telling the Lewiston Tribune that the “Attorney General’s Office needs to have better lawyers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The 2018 killing of “ZackTV,” a trailblazer in a perilous genre of gangland reporting he called “‘hood CNN,” seemed destined to go unsolved, even though gunmen attacked him on a downtown Chicago street lined with surveillance cameras. Police never announced arrests in the shooting of Zachary Stoner, who drew a national YouTube following filling a media niche with up-close stories about the lives and deaths of gang members and affiliated rappers from places other reporters were afraid to go. But police records obtained by the Associated Press reveal investigators believe they solved his homicide years ago when they arrested members of South Side Chicago’s “Perry Avenue” gang. Yet prosecutors in 2019 declined to prosecute, and police were forced to release the suspects. Police say the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office cited the possibility that the two sides in the shooting on May 30, 2018, were “mutual combatants” – a disputed legal concept that’s a throwback to duels between nobles or prearranged gunfights in the Wild West. That prosecutors passed on charges on those grounds raises questions about whether Chicago gangs can literally get away with murder when it’s unclear who initiated a shooting and who returned fire in self-defense.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is planning his fifth overseas trip of the year, this time to attend a U.N. climate conference in Egypt. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office announced Wednesday that he would take part in the COP27 climate change conference. Holcomb’s schedule includes giving a speech about Indiana’s efforts to increase use of clean energy in the state, the governor’s office said. “I look forward to highlighting the ongoing ways Hoosiers continue to pioneer the way forward, develop sustainable solutions, and lead productive global conversations,” Holcomb said in a statement. Holcomb and state Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers will be part of an Indiana delegation arriving Sunday in Egypt and returning to Indiana on Nov. 12. The trip is being paid for with private donations to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation, the governor’s office said. Holcomb also plans meetings with businesses and foreign governments and organizations during the conference drawing leaders from nearly 200 nations. The governor has made four previous economic development this year, including to Germany and Switzerland last month and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in May. He made two trips in the spring that took him to Sweden, Great Britain, Monaco, Slovakia and Israel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: This week the Des Moines Area Religious Council’s network of food pantries broke the record for the number of individuals helped during a single day in the network’s 46-year history. On Tuesday, the network of 15 pantries assisted 1,530 individuals across Polk County, beating the previous record of 1,476 individuals helped in one day Sept. 3, 2019, according to a DMARC news release. Matt Unger, the CEO of DMARC, said even though he expected the record to be broken this month, seeing it happen is still “jarring.” He said he expects this November to be the busiest month in the network’s history. “It’s going to be a big month and it is going to take a tremendous amount of public support for ALL organizations working in the food insecurity space to make sure our community members have AT LEAST the basic groceries they and their households need,” Unger wrote in an email. According to DMARC, rising costs for essential goods such as food and gasoline, coupled with the decrease in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in April, have contributed to the rise in people in need across Iowa. Michelle Book, the president of Food Bank of Iowa, said 1 in 7 working households across the state cannot cover the costs of their basic needs.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A former undersheriff was acquitted Wednesday in the death of an unarmed man he shot with a defective beanbag round five years ago. Virgil Brewer was charged with involuntary manslaughter after he shot Steven Myers using his personal shotgun the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A Wyandotte County jury deliberated for four hours after a weeklong trial before returning the not-guilty verdict. It was unclear if Brewer, who has been on unpaid leave from the Barber County Sheriff’s department since his 2018 arrest, would return to his former role. Brewer and two other officers responded to a call about an armed man on a street after an altercation at a Sun City bar. Myers, who was drunk and had been told to leave the bar, was gone by the time officers arrived. They found him in a shed at a Sun City home. He came out of the shed, and Brewer shot him at close range with a beanbag, which split open and emptied pellets into his chest, causing fatal injuries. Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill ruled Myers’ death a homicide. An expert testified at trial that the beanbag round was defective and should never have been sold or distributed, defense attorney David Harger said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In a move that experts describe as outrageous, the Kentucky Bar Association is seeking to punish a lawyer who brought a scandal to light this summer in which an elected prosecutor was trading favors with a defendant in exchange for nude images of her. An inquiry panel has accused attorney Thomas Clay of violating what is known informally as the “squeal rule” or “rat rule.” The rule says that when a lawyer knows another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Misconduct raising a “substantial question about their honesty, trustworthiness or fitness,” the first lawyer must report it to bar counsel. When Clay learned that Commonwealth’s Attorney Ronny Goldy Jr. had for several years done favors for a defendant in exchange for her giving him nude photos and videos of herself, he reported it to the FBI but not to the bar association’s disciplinary counsel. Clay provided the FBI and the Louisville Courier Journal with 230 pages of Facebook messages documenting the quid quo pro. Just two days after the newspaper published a story that included excerpts of the messages, the bar moved to temporarily suspend Goldy, the elected prosecutor for Bath, Menifee, Montgomery and Rowan counties. Clay’s lawyer, Jon Fleischaker, said his client deserves “praise, not sanction.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A little more than 12% of registered voters in the state have cast their ballots ahead of next week’s elections, keeping up with Louisiana’s steady increase in midterm election turnout. Of the 363,009 residents who participated in the state’s early voting period, which ended Tuesday night, about 42% were registered Democrats, and 43% were Republicans, according to data from the Louisiana Secretary of State’s office. Most Louisiana voters opt to vote in person on Election Day. But the percentage who vote early has been steadily increasing. During 2018 midterm elections, about 11% of voters cast their ballots early, up from 8% in 2014 and 4% in 2010. Early voting topped 32% in 2020, though presidential election years tend to draw far more voters than midterms. The state has placed a number of restrictions on mail-in voting. Absentee ballots need a notary or witness signature and can only go to older people, those with disabilities or voters who can show they cannot cast a ballot in person on Election Day. This election, absentee ballots went to about 3% of the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: More than $4.3 million in federal funds is on its way to the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District to help purchase 11 new, clean, zero-emission school buses. Such funds essentially will help the district swap out its current fleet of 12 diesel-engine buses. David Cash, the New England regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, made Wells his first stop Monday on his tour of Maine school districts that will be receiving their own slices of more than $13 million from the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program. Cash said the buses currently in use create pollution with “long-term impacts on our kids” and contribute to “problematic” issues related to climate change. He called the $5 billion being spent nationwide for new, “clean” school buses “tremendous.” “It’s incumbent upon us to make the right kind of choices and the right kind of investments,” he said. WOCSD is one of 13 school districts in the state that President Joe Biden announced would be part of his administration’s funding for the bus program for the current fiscal year. The funds are a part of the infrastructure bill Biden signed into law last year. WOCSD is receiving the largest share of the $13 million. Overall, the grant funds will help with the purchases of 34 “clean” buses for school districts throughout the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nMontgomery County: Vulgar signs atop a busy roadway are grabbing the attention of drivers and neighbors alike, WUSA-TV reports. Conservative activist Shaun Porter and several other people have recently been holding signs atop the Capital Beltway on the Bradley Boulevard overpass. While holding politically tinged signs near roadways is not a new phenomenon in the D.C. region, Porter’s signs include curse words and sexually graphic language directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Jobe Lett, an 11-year-old Montgomery County resident who lives nearby the overpass, said the signs have become a distraction in his neighborhood “because of the language that they’re using.” Data provided by the state shows more than 200,000 people drive the beltway around the Bradley Boulevard overpass every day. But some of those drivers honk at Porter’s signs. That has also become a problem for neighbors. Homes surround the overpass on both sides. “Hey, I support everyone’s right to (free speech),” Montgomery County Jesse Sanders said. “I just kind of wish it wasn’t in the most residential of areas.” Maryland State Police said obscenity laws are vague, and they have questions about infringing on Porter’s First Amendment rights by asking him to stop.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities who earlier this week said they had finally identified the “Lady of the Dunes,” the woman whose mutilated body was found on Cape Cod in 1974, are now looking for information about a man she may have married. The late Guy Rockwell Muldavin is believed to have married Ruth Marie Terry in February 1974, just a few months before the 37-year-old Terry’s body was found in Provincetown, according to a statement Wednesday from state police, Provincetown police and the Cape and Islands district attorney’s office. Investigators are asking anyone with information about the whereabouts of Terry or Muldavin in New England in 1973 or 1974 to contact them. Muldavin, described as an antiques dealer who also used the names Raoul Guy Rockwell and Guy Muldavin Rockwell, was a suspect in the deaths of a previous wife and a stepdaughter in Seattle in 1960, according to media reports at the time. He was caught in New York City and charged with “unlawful flight.” He died in California in 2002, according to his obituary. The death of the “Lady of the Dunes” was one of the most enduring and frustrating murder mysteries in Massachusetts. A young girl out for a walk found the body in the dunes in Provincetown in July 1974. The woman was naked on a beach blanket with her hands severed – so she could not be identified by her fingerprints, officials said. Her skull was crushed, and she was nearly decapitated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A shortage of poll workers has concerned local election officials in some parts of the country, but Michigan is facing a different side of the trend. Conservative groups and local Republican Party operatives who have pushed false claims about the 2020 presidential election have recruited poll workers in the state by the thousands. Similar recruitment efforts on the right have bolstered the ranks of poll workers in some other states with nationally watched races. Seeding the ranks of front-line election workers with people recruited by groups promoting election conspiracies has raised alarms among some that the people at the foundation of the election system could try to undermine it. “It concerns me when the motivation to serve as a poll worker is fueled through misinformation and people who have been fed lies, in some cases, for years now,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. “Since the spring, clerks have come at us with concerning questions they’re getting and, in some cases, hundreds of poll worker applications that seem to be motivated by nefarious intent.” In Oakland County, the state’s second-most populous, Republicans “discouraged about the outcome of the 2020 election” have been urged to sign up as poll workers through a new Republican National Committee recruitment program.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council on Thursday unanimously approved a former public safety director from New Jersey to take over the city’s police department, as it struggles with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, will start serving as Minneapolis’ police chief Monday. “Everyone is hungry for change in this city. I’m not here to maintain the status quo,” he told reporters after the council vote. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey nominated O’Hara to lead the police department in September and said Thursday that the city needs someone like O’Hara right now. “This moment matters,” Frey said. “The act of stepping up for this job – at this time – is an act of courage.” Minneapolis has been at the center of calls for changes in policing since the May 2020 killing of Floyd, whose death under an officer’s knee led to nationwide demands for racial justice and an end to police brutality. Calls to abolish the department or dismantle and replace it with a new department of public safety were rejected by voters in the city last year. The city is also under a federal investigation into its policing practices, and it is expected that court-enforced changes will be ordered through a consent decree.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State lawmakers met in special session Wednesday and quickly approved nearly $247 million in incentives for an aluminum plant that is supposed to bring 1,000 jobs to northern Mississippi by 2029. Many legislators voted on the incentives without knowing the name of the company. At a news conference as the session ended, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves acknowledged the aluminum project is being developed by Steel Dynamics Inc., an Indiana-based company that already operates a steel mill near Columbus, Mississippi. “They are a fantastic employer in the Golden Triangle today,” Reeves said. Reeves had previously said a nondisclosure agreement prohibited him from publicly naming the company until the deal was done. Only the governor can call a special session, and Democratic legislators questioned why Reeves has not called sessions to address other issues, including funding for Jackson’s troubled water system or for struggling rural hospitals. “Many Mississippians are suffering and dying. But none of these things, despite being matters of literal life and death, compelled the governor to call a special session,” Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez said Wednesday during a Democratic Caucus news conference. “So, what compelled him to bring us back again? A victory lap being portrayed publicly as an emergency? But this feels a lot more like a campaign event, a political pep rally, than public service.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city will pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of an unarmed Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2019. The Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners approved the settlement with the family of Terrence Bridges Jr. in a closed meeting earlier this week, The Kansas City Star reports. Bridges, 30, was shot and killed after officers responded to a reported carjacking. Police had contended he was resisting arrest and was shot during a struggle with the officer, identified in police records as Dylan Pifer. The officer told investigators he feared for his life because he thought Bridges was pulling a gun from a sweatshirt. Bridges’ family and civil rights activists said he was not armed, not resisting, did not pose a threat to the officer and was not involved in the carjacking. Tom Porto, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement the settlement represents the police department’s acknowledgement of the tragic and significant loss to Bridges’ family. Pifer, who is still on the police force, was not charged in the killing. A year after Bridges’ death, Pifer was with Sgt. Matthew T. Neal as Neal injured a 15-year-old boy by slamming his face into the pavement after stopping a car the teenager was in. Neal left the department after pleading guilty last week to third-degree assault. He was placed on four years’ probation. Pifer was not charged.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While Budweiser and Coors Light remain the state’s favorite beers, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Department of Agriculture Director Christy Clark have signed a letter of understanding saying Heineken’s parent company, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A., will do more business in Montana, including buying more Treasure State barley. The deal was announced Tuesday, The Daily Montanan reports. While the letter of intent didn’t commit the beverage industry giant to specific amounts or prices, it did say the company was committed to using more Montana products in its beer manufacturing. The “intent to procure increased volumes of high-quality Montana barley” will be met with “transparent market information, producer consultations, and continued investments in barley research” by the state, according to the letter. Gianforte, as well as leaders from Heineken and the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee along with members of the U.S. Grain Council, signed the letter at Bos Hay and Grain at Gallatin Gateway. “We’re thrilled Heineken recognized the superior quality of Montana barley and wants to do more business with our farmers,” Gianforte said. ‘This agreement ushers in tremendous opportunities for our ag industry.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: In the wake of a Halloween block party where a man drove around barricades and toward the crowd before a police officer shot and wounded him, counselors and government officials have been offering help for those who witnessed the chaos. Therapists were available Thursday evening at Minne Lusa Elementary School for those dealing with stress from Monday night’s incident in the same neighborhood, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Project Harmony Deputy Director told the newspaper that officials were hoping to help kids and adults alike process the experience and normalize their feelings, which she said might include fixating on the event, sleep interruptions, irritability and fearing for their own safety. The shooting happened about 7 p.m. Monday during the annual Halloween block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood, and no one besides the driver was injured. It capped a chaotic few seconds in which people ran screaming as the car accelerated toward the crowd before shots rang out. Authorities had blocked off the area to traffic to allow trick-or-treaters and their families to mill about the streets safely. Police said the driver, later identified as 31-year-old Dontavius Levering, drove around the barricades and traveled recklessly the wrong way without headlights on Minne Lusa Boulevard through crowds of people, including throngs of children. It’s not clear whether he intended to hurt anyone.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada asked the state’s secretary of state Wednesday to investigate what it called a “coordinated partisan election administration effort” during rural Nye County’s hand-count of mail-in ballots that was shut down last week until after polls close. The ACLU said a hand-count volunteer openly carrying a firearm removed an ACLU observer from a hand-count tally room, which the organization said it recently discovered was Nye County GOP Central Committee Vice Chair Laura Larsen. The ACLU said the situation “poses questions” surrounding Nye County interim clerk Mark Kampf’s delegation of authority to partisan officials to remove observers from hand-count rooms, particularly during a hand-count process that deals with tabulation of ballots.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A boil water order for customers of the Rye Water District has now stretched into its third week following the detection of harmful bacteria in district water samples in mid-October. A public informational meeting has been set for this weekend to discuss the order. Town leaders are continuing to distribute cases of bottled water to affected residents as Rye Water District leadership awaits the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services’ lifting of the order. Three weeks since the enactment of the order, Rye Water District superintendent Arik Jones said he still feels it could take several more days before it’s over. The cause of the water contamination has not been identified, though Jones stated that potential causes could be from “improper irrigation operation and/or maintenance.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDelran: A $2.5 million upgrade at a water-treatment plant here is intended to remove a potentially harmful contaminant from a major source of South Jersey’s drinking water. New Jersey American Water said the improvements will target a man-made chemical found more than two years ago in samples taken from the Delaware River. The utility’s Delran plant processes up to 40 million gallons of river water daily for use by hundreds of thousands of customers in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties. The chemical – 1,4-dioxane – is used as a solvent during manufacturing or industrial processes, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. It is also a byproduct of some consumer products, including detergents and cosmetics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Work to plug hundreds of abandoned oil and gas wells began in southeast New Mexico, amid the U.S.’ most active oilfields in the Permian Basin. The State’s Oil Conservation Division, an agency of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, got about $25 million in initial grant funding via the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, hoping to redouble efforts to plug some of the about 1,700 wells believed to be abandoned throughout New Mexico on state and private land. Operations began Oct. 31 at a well east of Hobbs in Lea County. It was prioritized, the OCD said, as it was reportedly emitting large amounts of methane and hydrogen sulfide within 1,000 feet of local homes. Before the federal funds were granted, New Mexico was able to plug about 50 wells a year, but the OCD estimated the funds would allow the agency to clean up about 200 wells in the next 12 months. The money will also help remediate and restore the surfaces of another 50 to 60 locations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York will receive up to $524 million from drugmaker Teva to settle claims that the company contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic, the largest amount secured from an opioid manufacturer or distributor sued by the state, Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday. The state has reached a series of settlements with drug companies following an attorney general’s lawsuit in 2019 accusing them of deceptive marketing and failing to prevent the unlawful diversion of controlled substances. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates were found liable last year for public nuisance charges by a jury on Long Island. To resolve the remedies phase, Teva agreed to pay out $313 million over 18 years, James said. New York will additionally receive $211 million from a $4.3 billion national settlement Teva agreed to in July if it is approved by state and local governments and tribes, according to the attorney general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health agency is weighing whether to challenge a judge’s order demanding that the state ramp up services for people with intellectual and development disabilities to allow more of them to live at home or in their communities. In 2020, Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour ruled that too many such people were forced to live in institutions in violation of state law. Baddour allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to address the violation, but recommendations made by a consulting firm haven’t been carried out, the judge wrote Wednesday while directing his own remedies. Baddour ordered that at least 3,000 people must be diverted or shifted to community-based programs by early 2031. Separately, he told DHHS to eliminate before 2032 a waiting list of roughly 16,000 people who are qualified to participate in a Medicaid-funded program that helps them live at home or outside of an institution. A shortage of well-paid direct-care workers also must be addressed by the state Department of Health and Human Services, the judge ruled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An invasive and destructive weed species threatening North Dakota agriculture has been found in three more counties. That raises the total to 19 counties in North Dakota where the so-called “super weed,” also known as Palmer amaranth, has been found since it was first identified in the state four years ago, The Bismarck Tribune reported. “We think it’s a very significant threat to our growers and ranchers,” said Tom Peters, an agronomist and weed control specialist at North Dakota State University and the University of Minnesota. Palmer amaranth can grow as tall as seven feet, even as much as 3 inches per day, and can resist many herbicides, produce hundreds of thousands of seeds and become strong enough to stop farm machinery, according to experts. A heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%, according to research by Purdue University. The plants were recently found in Kidder, Williams and Stark counties, according to the state’s agriculture department. The findings were confirmed by the National Agricultural Genotyping Center at NDSU in Fargo.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit in Ohio is evoking Christmas memories with a display of historic storybooks, vintage toys and costumes from the sets of the “Brady Bunch” of TV and movies. The show, “A Storybook Christmas Featuring a Very Brady Holiday,” opened Tuesday at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio and runs through Dec. 31. The exhibition marks the opening of the holiday season at the historic Reese-Peters House that houses the museum. Across five rooms trimmed for the holidays, visitors will be invited to step into the pages of classic Christmas storybooks including “The Night Before Christmas,” “Polar Express” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Some children’s board books and pop-up books will be arranged with pages open for visitors to read, while others will be positioned along with toys under Christmas trees as gifts, replicating what Christmas morning may have looked like for the Bradys and other families in the 1960s and ’70s. Several costumes and props from the “Brady Bunch” sets have been incorporated into the display by co-curator Randall Thropp, who manages the Paramount Pictures Costume Archive. They include a two-piece pantsuit Florence Henderson wore in the episode where the Bradys travel to the Grand Canyon and a horse sculpture that appeared at the base of the Bradys’ staircase.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt granted another temporary reprieve to death row inmate Richard Glossip, pushing his scheduled execution back until February 2023 so that an appeals court has more time to consider his claim of innocence. Stitt, who is locked in a tough reelection contest, issued an executive order on Wednesday that delays Glossip’s execution, which was scheduled for Nov. 21. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A clemency hearing for Glossip that was scheduled before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board next week also will be delayed. Glossip received the death penalty for the 1997 murder-for-hire killing of his boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese. Prosecutors acknowledge Glossip did not kill Van Treese, but maintain that he paid the hotel maintenance man, Justin Sneed, to do it. Sneed, who received a life sentence but was spared the death penalty, was a key witness in two separate trials in which Glossip was convicted.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland City Council members voted Thursday to create at least three large designated campsites and ban the rest of the roughly 700 encampments currently scattered across the city. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, according to the proposal. “People on the streets deserve our compassion. They need our understanding, and many of them need our help to get off and stay off the streets,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said after the vote. “It is my personal view that these resolutions take an important step forward for the city of Portland to be able to do just that.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A measure to help the Pennsylvania Turnpike recover more unpaid tolls was signed into law Thursday, legislation that could trigger the suspension of thousands of vehicle registrations early next year. Gov. Tom Wolf gave final approval to legislation aimed at getting owners or operators of some 25,000 vehicles to pay their overdue bills for turnpike travel. After the law takes effect in two months, the process will start with the Turnpike Commission notifying registrants they are seeking to have their registrations suspended. At least a month later, the toll agency can ask the Transportation Department to start the process, and PennDOT said it will give the owners six weeks’ notice. “The customer is given several notices and opportunities to pay the tolls they owe before their registration is suspended,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police are investigating an anti-Semitic note left at the reception area of the Brown-Rhode Island School of Design Hillel Center on Sunday. In a letter to the Hillel community, Rabbi Josh Bolton said staff alerted both the campus police and Providence police. “I personally came to campus and met with detectives who opened an investigation into the incident. The investigation remains ongoing,” Rabbi Bolton wrote. Public safety officers, he said, determined there was no threat to Jewish students on campus. Hillel opened its doors Monday at 9 am. “While BRH takes any expression of anti-Semitism very seriously, we will not allow an incident like this to divert our focus from our core mission of building a flourishing Jewish community, and supporting the growth of Jewish students on College Hill,” Bolton wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A man and his girlfriend suspected of killing five people in three states last year have pleaded guilty to two of the killings in South Carolina and have been sentenced to life in prison without parole, authorities said. Tyler Terry and Adrienne Simpson each pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and numerous other charges Wednesday in Chester County, according to media reports. Prosecutors agreed to not seek the death penalty in any of the five killings as long as the couple also pleaded guilty to two shootings near St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Memphis, Tennessee. All five deaths happened in May 2021, investigators said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The University of South Dakota received $552,381 to research the risk of emerging bed bug disease transmission in households across South Dakota earlier this month. On Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced seven universities were awarded $5.7 million to study populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, like pests, injury hazards and asthma triggers. Those focus populations will be young children and seniors. Although there isn’t evidence that indicates bed bugs are transmitting disease, the goal of the “pro-active” research project is to identify if there’s a risk bed bugs could eventually be contributing to disease in households, said Jose Pietri, the USD assistant professor of microbiology leading the project.\n\nTennessee\n\nMt. Juliet: A Tennessee man who fled a traffic stop with an officer in the vehicle and refused to stop has been fatally shot, authorities said. The shooting happened after Mt. Juliet officers stopped a vehicle late Wednesday and asked the passenger, Eric Jermaine Allen, 39, to exit the vehicle, according to preliminary information from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Instead of exiting, Allen moved from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat and began to drive away, the bureau said in a statement. One of the officers attempted to stop Allen by leaning into the vehicle and gave commands for him to stop, but Allen drove away with the officer fully inside the vehicle, the statement said. The officer attempted to use a stun gun, but Allen continued to ignore commands to stop, prompting the officer to fatally shoot Allen. The officer was not injured. Bureau agents are working to independently determine the events leading to the shooting.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner revealed Wednesday that he underwent surgery and six weeks of radiation therapy during the summer for bone cancer in his jaw. Turner made the disclosure during a question-and-answer session after he delivered his annual State of the City address, the Houston Chronicle reported. Turner said he underwent nine hours of surgery on July 30 to remove the osteosarcoma. “Let me tell you, I have been blessed,” Turner said to applause. Turner missed a few weeks of City Council meetings while receiving his radiation therapy in August and September. His staff said he was undergoing medical treatment but did not specify what for. Turner, who has served as Houston’s mayor since 2016 after 27 years in the Texas House of Representatives, suffered a bout of COVID-19 last December.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The family of a Black fifth grader in Utah who died by suicide last year plans to file a $14 million lawsuit against her school, arguing that an inadequate response to reports of her being bullied over her race and disabilities led to her death. Attorneys representing Brittany Tichenor-Cox on Wednesday said they would seek damages for the 2021 death of her daughter, Isabella “Izzy” Tichenor. In a notice of claim, they said the school had violated state and federal laws, including those that require schools ensure equal treatment, provide educational opportunity and protect students experiencing homelessness. Notices of claim are required before people can sue government entities and the family’s claim said that the lawsuit will seek $14 million in damages. The notice of claim from Tichenor-Cox names Foxboro Elementary School in North Salt Lake City as a defendant, as well as its director and principal. It also names as defendants the Davis School District, school board and superintendent. They have 60 days to respond before the family can file a lawsuit based on the claim.\n\nVermont\n\nStratton: Game wardens are investigating a bear attack in the southern Vermont town of Stratton, the Department of Fish and Wildlife said Thursday. Wardens said the victim was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after the Wednesday evening attack and discharged from Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. Officials did not describe the circumstances of the attack, but said more information would be made public as it becomes available. Vermont wildlife officials said earlier this year that the state was seeing a record number of risky encounters between human and bears.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Seeking to learn more about the election integrity unit of Virginia’s attorney general’s office, the state’s chapter of the NAACP has put down a $20,000 deposit to fulfill a request for unit records. Virginia’s NAACP President Robert Barnette said there’s not enough transparency about the unit and he feels the price aims to discourage the Freedom of Information Act request, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. “Given the importance of fair elections, the attorney general’s stated desire for transparency, we would have thought he would want to make these records public,” Barnette said in a news conference outside the state Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: The Bremerton City Council on Wednesday approved unanimously a plan to expand property tax exemptions for developers who build affordable housing in the city. The city remains “far behind the curve” in attracting affordable housing proposals and is thousands of units short of the number of people who desire to live in Bremerton, City Council President Michael Goodnow said. “I look at this as one tool in the toolbox toward solving our housing and homelessness issues,” Goodnow said. While beefing up what’s known as the city’s multifamily property tax exemption program, or MFTE for short, Mayor Greg Wheeler and other city council members had differing opinions about the best methods of bringing new affordable housing projects to the city. For now, the council created new property tax exemptions of both 12 and 20 years for developers who devote a fourth of their units to those defined as low income under a calculation using Kitsap County’s average income levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A West Virginia elementary school principal has been honored as one of the nation’s top educators. Principal Andrea Trio of Madison Elementary in Wheeling received a $25,000 Milken Educator Award from the Milken Family Foundation on Thursday. Up to 40 elementary educators nationwide will receive the awards this school year. Trio is known for walking through the school halls singing with children, using music and other social-emotional behavioral tools to calm her young students. Trio earned a bachelor’s in music education in 2005 from West Virginia University and a master’s in educational leadership in 2014 from Hood College.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Madison Children’s Museum has fired a Wisconsin man with cognitive disabilities after he wore an Adolf Hitler costume over the Halloween weekend. The museum said the man believed he was making a mockery of the Nazi Party’s leader when he wore the costume on a busy street near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus on Saturday. He was fired Tuesday night, after his costume was condemned on social media and by some news outlets, including the Jerusalem Post. The museum said in a statement that it fired the man after it “determined that his continued employment would create an environment at odds with our values and unwelcoming to visitors and staff.” The statement said the man’s costume was “completely unacceptable” and that the museum stands against antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination. The museum also said the man has cognitive disabilities due to a traumatic brain injury and that his work over the last decade has been supervised. “It is our understanding that he believed his costume to be mocking Hitler,” the statement said. The Madison Police Department called the costume “offensive and reprehensible,” but said wearing it was not a crime. Police said they told the man about the concerns his costume raised.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Sexual assault reports and complaints about equal-opportunity employment in the Wyoming National Guard have increased in the past year, a military official told state lawmakers Wednesday. While Greg Porter, adjutant general of the Wyoming National Guard, noted that sexual assault is a national problem, he told the state’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee that the state ranks “among the top 10 in forcible rapes in the U.S.,” the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Rep. Mark Baker, R-Green River, said while reports in the Guard have risen – suggesting service members feel more comfortable speaking up – he still fears the numbers don’t properly illustrate the scope of the problem, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/07/17/new-york-canadian-border-asylum-seekers-find-hope/70415618007/", "title": "At NY's Canadian border, asylum seekers find hope at a rural mini ...", "text": "Note: Translation for this story was done by Tone Translate in Utica, New York.\n\nAt 5 a.m., the girls tried to get to sleep on pebbled rocks under Mountain Mart’s awning.\n\nIt was in the low 40s and drizzling in Plattsburgh, a remote New York town a few miles from the Canadian border.

Mississippi is trying to recover more than $90 million, of which more than $5 million went to the University of Southern Mississippi Athletic Foundation to cover the construction costs of a volleyball arena.\n\nFavre's daughter had started playing on the school's volleyball team in 2017.\n\n“I wanted to help my alma mater and benefit the community,” Favre said to Congress. “Southern Miss introduced me to the nonprofit to see if they could help with funding. I had no way of knowing that there was anything wrong with how the state funded the project especially since it was publicly approved by many state agencies and multiple attorneys including the Attorney General.”\n\n“A court gag order bars the parties from discussing the specifics of the lawsuit,” Favre added. “Instead, I’m here to share what I’ve now seen up close, about how reforms are needed to stop the misspending of TANF funds.”\n\nFavre has repaid $1.1 million, which he received for speaking fees from a nonprofit organization, but Mississippi Auditor Shad White says he still owes nearly $730,000 in interest.\n\nFavre's testimony is the latest chapter in a quick and stunning fall from grace for a man who used to be one of the country's most beloved athletes.\n\nThe only player to win the NFL MVP award three years in a row (1995-97), Favre became a crossover celebrity while playing for the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 2007. His folksy demeanor, sense of humor and devil-may-care approach to the game – not to mention his ubiquitous presence as a commercial spokesman – were largely responsible for reviving the once-great franchise from a long dormant period.\n\nThe Pack won Super Bowl 31 to cap the 1996 season, Favre with the starring role (246 yards, 2 touchdowns passing and a rushing TD) in a 35-21 defeat of the New England Patriots in New Orleans – just a stone's throw from his hometown of Kiln, Mississippi. The Pack returned to the Super Bowl the following season but lost to the Denver Broncos.\n\nA second-round pick out of Southern Miss in 1991 − Favre survived a car crash in college that nearly took his life – he was traded by the Atlanta Falcons to Green Bay following a forgettable rookie campaign. An injury to Packers starting quarterback Don Majkowski in the third game of the 1992 season forced Favre into Green Bay's lineup, and he never left. His ability to play through injuries and adversity – and play well, notably a 2003 Monday night game in the aftermath of his father's death – was another of Favre's aspects that fans gravitated toward. His 321 consecutive starts, including playoffs, remain an NFL record, though speculation will likely only increase as to how his Ironman streak will affect his apparently compromised health moving forward.\n\nFavre's playing career certainly also had its darker side. He checked into rehabilitation for a Vicodin addiction in 1996, and he admitted to drinking heavily while in Green Bay. He was fined $50,000 by the NFL – for failure to cooperate with the league's investigation – after allegedly sexting a picture of his genitals to a New York Jets employee in 2008, an accusation Favre denied and was never suspended for.\n\nOn the field, his 336 career interceptions are 59 more than any other quarterback in NFL history. His final pass with the Packers was picked off in overtime of the 2007 NFC championship game, ultimately costing Green Bay a trip to Super Bowl 42. After one of his many dalliances with retirement, he was traded to the Jets in 2008, leading to the ascendance of Aaron Rodgers with the Packers. In 2009, Favre joined the NFC North-rival Minnesota Vikings, causing many fans in Wisconsin to deem him a vindictive traitor. Favre nearly led the Vikes to Super Bowl 44 in 2009 but more miscues and a battering from the Saints in the NFC title game at New Orleans ultimately undermined Minnesota's hopes.\n\nFavre retired for good after being injured during the 2010 season. He left the game as the NFL's all-time leader in yards (71,838) and touchdowns (508) passing among numerous other records. Many of his marks have since been broken several times over, Tom Brady now holding most of the league's major passing marks.\n\nFavre was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/09/24/brett-favre-parkinsons-disease-diagnosis/75364907007/", "title": "Brett Favre diagnosis: What to know about Parkinson's disease", "text": "Brett Favre announced during testimony in front of the Congressional House Ways and Means Committee that he's been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

The WHO does not know the cause of Parkinson's but family history does increase risk and the organization also notes exposure to pesticides, air pollution, and solvents may also increase risk.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nYounger people can be affected by Parkinson's but it's typically seen in older adults. It's also more common in men than women.\n\nParkinson's disease symptoms, treatment\n\nThe most visible symptoms of Parkinson's disease are motor symptoms including tremors, trouble walking, involuntary movement, rigidity, and imbalance, per the WHO. Other symptoms include dementia, sleep disorders, mental health disorders, and cognitive impairment.\n\nThere is no cure for Parkinson's disease. Instead, therapies can be used to reduce the symptoms and impact on daily life. The WHO lists levodopa/carbidopa – a medicine that increases the amount of dopamine in the brain – as the most popular medication for Parkinson's disease. Deep brain stimulation can also help reduce tremors and need for medicines, according to the WHO.\n\nRehabilitation can also improve quality of life. Strength training, hydrotherapy, and gait and balance training are the top options listed by the WHO.\n\nThe Parkinson's Foundation leads the \"PD GENEration: Mapping the Future of Parkinson's Disease\" global study to help people understand their risk for the disease. It's free to enroll and the Parkinson's Foundation aims to accelerate research and clinical trials with this study.\n\nShannon vs. Brett:Brett Favre asks appeals court to to re-ignite lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe\n\nNotable people diagnosed with Parkinson's\n\nFavre is the latest of many celebrities who have a confirmed Parkinson's diagnosis. Arguably the most visible celebrity is Michael J. Fox, who announced his Parkinson's diagnosis in 1998 and created the Michael J.

After a few difficult years trying to master the on-field action and migrate key features and game modes, Electronic Arts studio Tiburon seemed to finally get things right with Madden NFL 10 in 2009. Since then, Madden NFL has remained a solid sports game despite several nagging bugs.\n\nFor the 25th anniversary edition of the video game, running backs benefit greatly. There's a new Precision Modifier that unlocks variations on moves such as spins, jukes, stiff-arms or other tricks to evade defenders. Pressing and holding the left trigger while performing one of these moves will unleash a special — often faster — version, and can sometimes get strung together with other moves. So, for example, a speedy wide receiver could quickly go from a juke to the right followed by a spin to shake off mutliple defenders, or a truck move to lunge toward the first down marker.\n\nThe moves make it much easier for a player to stretch out an extra couple yards on a run or pass play, even on tougher difficulties. Averaging 4-6 yards per running seemed pretty easy to perform.\n\nTo make the running game even more attractive, Madden NFL 25 borrows from the NCAA Football 14 playbook with upgrades to option offenses, most notably the Read Option. Teams such as the San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins feature the Pistol formation with several Read Option plays, but any team with a versatile QB/RB combo (think Eagles, Seahawks, too) can benefit.\n\nSimilar to NCAA Football, Madden displays icons over the defensive player to show whether he'll shoot for the running back or quarterback. Defenders often don't follow the icon, so players will still need to watch whether that defender holds position to follow the quarterback or dive toward the line for the running back.\n\nMost of the time, running the ball has become fun again. However, between Precision Modifier and the Read Option, plowing through defenses is a breeze. In fact, it's almost too easy. Even on the challenging All-Madden mode, I was able to break off huge runs with Redskins QB Robert Griffin III, Seahawks back Marshawn Lynch and others. But even when players stick with a traditional offense, running the ball isn't tough.\n\nThe game also includes tweaks to the Infinity Engine, the tech used to render animations of tackles and other action. It's solid but players will definitely see some random buggy moments, such as tackles that look like a glob of twitching body parts, or the linebacker that unnaturally zips across the field like a vampire in True Blood.\n\nOff the field, Madden introduces a robust Owner Mode, where players can perform every task from drafting and signing future stars to hiking prices on nachos. When players start, they can choose between current NFL owners or create their own and choose an owner style.

Players sign free agents, draft rookies and restructure contracts, among other things.

Green Bay Coach Matt Lafleur has already said most of his starters won't play in Sunday's game since the Packers and Broncos held a joint practice session on Friday. The battle for the No. 2 quarterback spot between Sean Clifford and rookie Michael Pratt will be among the notable developments to watch.\n\nEntering coach Sean Payton's second season in Denver, the Broncos' quarterback competition is expected to be at the forefront of Sunday's preseason game. Veteran Jarrett Stidham started in the team's first preseason game and played two series.\n\nFirst-round draft pick Bo Nix out of Oregon then came in and looked sharp, leading the team on four scoring drives (two touchdowns, two field goals). Former New York Jets first-round draft pick Zach Wilson also acquitted himself well in mop-up duty. Nix is expected to get the start against the 49ers. Payton plans to play many of his starters in Sunday's game.\n\nThe Saints and 49ers had to call off their joint practices scheduled this week ahead of their preseason game Sunday due to injuries in San Francisco. San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said before the team's preseason opener against the Tennessee Titans that his team had 23 players who couldn't practice because of various injuries.\n\nThe franchise, coming off its second Super Bowl appearance in five years, is also without left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk. Williams is holding out for a new contract, and Aiyuk has requested a trade after being unable to reach a new deal with San Francisco.\n\nNew Orleans won its first preseason game, but will look to improve upon a rough showing by its first-team offense. During two series with quarterback Derek Carr, the Saints ran nine plays and gained just 18 yards.

And he later clarified — no, he has not considered leaving early. But the fact that the question was asked is an indication of the dilemma that might soon loom.\n\nImprobably, a guy who was the third-team quarterback back in August has become one of the faces of the Buckeyes. Those two starts were victories in the Big Ten championship and then the Sugar Bowl. After his solid performance in a 42-35 win against Alabama, there aren't many concerns about what he might be able to do in the College Football Playoff Championship.\n\nWhich only means that somehow, Ohio State had three championship-level quarterbacks on its roster, all ready to play well at virtually the same time. So the questions instead concern what happens after Monday's game. When Braxton Miller is fully recovered from the shoulder injury that required surgery in August, ending his season before it began, and when J.T. Barrett's broken right ankle has healed — what then?\n\nWho's the quarterback next season?\n\n\"It's crazy, right?\" Ohio State offensive coordinator Tom Herman said. \"But I honestly don't know.\"\n\nWhen the Buckeyes address the issue at all, that's essentially their answer, which is fine — because it's anybody's guess.\n\nTo recap: Ohio State lost Miller, the two-time Big Ten player of the year, during preseason; he's still recovering after surgery. Barrett, a redshirt freshman, excelled as Miller's replacement, propelling Ohio State throughout the regular season and finishing fifth in the Heisman voting. But Barrett broke his ankle against Michigan, in the last game of the regular season, and had surgery a day later.\n\nEnter Jones, who is bigger than the other quarterbacks, and who'd been an enigma for coaches, who had struggled during his career to motivate him. But as the sudden starter, Jones has been very good.\n\nHe was named the most valuable player in the Big Ten championship game, when he was 12-for-17 for 257 yards and three touchdowns. In the Sugar Bowl, he was 18-for-35 for 243 yards and a touchdown, rushed for 43 yards on 17 carries and was especially effective on third-down conversions. Afterward, Alabama coach Nick Saban suggested Jones' ability to throw the deep ball had added a weapon to the offense.\n\n\"Our situation we're in is second to none,\" Ohio State senior receiver Evan Spencer said. \"We have three quarterbacks who are really, really good. That's a testament to how we develop guys, but also a testament to the people we have on our team. We all love to compete. Their competition is gonna prove well for us.\"\n\nHere are the options:\n\nMiller graduated in December, but has another year of eligibility remaining. He could transfer elsewhere and play immediately — which means, in effect, he could essentially become the equivalent of a highly-sought-after free agent who would be coveted by top programs in need of a quarterback.\n\nMiller hasn't spoken recently with reporters, and neither has Barrett. But last month, Miller's father told the Columbus Dispatch his son would not transfer. Meyer said last week he expected Miller to remain at Ohio State.\n\nTeammates say they don't think Miller is going anywhere.\n\n\"Every time I've talked to him, he's always talked about things that are going to go on next year,\" Spencer said. \"From what I know, he loves this university and would love nothing else but to lead us to a national championship. … From what I know, I think that's his plan and I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen. If he comes back, we're going to be a dangerous football team next year.\"\n\nBut what if Jones does it instead? Meanwhile, Barrett, who was more of a runner than Jones — and perhaps the most precise passer of the three — would have to sit out a year if he transferred, making that prospect unlikely. That's true of Jones, too. There's a very real chance that all three return.\n\nComplicating things is the expectation that Miller and Barrett probably won't be ready to resume full football activities by spring practice. And here's one more wrinkle: Herman, who also serves as quarterbacks coach, is leaving after the championship game to assume his new job as head coach at Houston. The Buckeyes will have a new offensive coordinator.\n\n\"It might go all the way to fall camp until you get a full idea of what those guys can do,\" Herman said. \"I'll be watching with great interest because I love each and every one of those guys. I'm proud of what they've all done so far. They've all got things they need to improve on.\n\n\"The guy that improves the most and gives them the best chance to win, I'm sure is gonna play.\"\n\nFor now, only one guy can. Last Thursday night, Barrett and Miller watched from the sidelines as Jones led the Buckeyes to victory. Later, during the presentation of the Sugar Bowl trophy, Barrett stood quietly just outside the roped-off area set aside for the Buckeyes. With his right leg propped on a scooter, he declined interview requests.\n\nA few moments later, as Jones entertained questions in the Buckeyes' locker room, he sat in Barrett's empty locker rather than his own, which was adjacent. On the other side, was Miller's locker. Like Barrett's, it was empty.\n\nFor now, Jones is the Buckeyes' guy. But after Monday, nothing is certain. Except, well, that Jones is not going off to the NFL just yet. He said Tuesday he'll be back at Ohio State, which means there'll probably be some combination of quarterbacks competing. But he's not focused on that just yet.\n\n\"I know what I've got on my table when I wake up,\" Jones said. \"Tomorrow or the NFL or next season, I'm not even thinking about that.\"\n\nSoon enough, though, the Buckeyes might be consumed with an unprecedented quandary.\n\n\"I know the competition's gonna bring out the best in all three of them,\" Spencer said. \"… All three of them, the ceiling is incredible. I mean, the sky is the limit.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2021/04/26/steelers-comfortable-with-qb-situation-ahead-of-nfl-draft/43645701/", "title": "Steelers comfortable with QB situation ahead of NFL draft", "text": "AP\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — Mike Tomlin isn't talking like a coach in the market for a quarterback.\n\nEven with Ben Roethlisberger's status beyond his upcoming 18th season unknown. Even with backup Mason Rudolph in the final year of his contract. Even with Josh Dobbs and Dwayne Haskins on one-year deals.\n\nAfter general manager Kevin Colbert said Monday the Steelers could “absolutely” add another young face to the mix during this week's NFL draft, Tomlin sounded like a coach who believes the Steelers have already selected one.\n\n“It’s exciting from a coaching perspective with one of those guys (in the quarterback room) being a 22-year-old guy like Dwayne Haskins who was viewed globally as having first-round talent just a short time ago,” Tomlin said. “We’re excited about working with him and seeing what his skillset is and helping him, as well.”\n\nThe Steelers picked up Haskins in January after a spectacular flameout in Washington. Taken with the 15th overall pick in 2019, Haskins lasted less than two seasons in the nation's capital. Washington cut him last December after uneven play on the field and uncertain judgment off it.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nHe will get a chance to start over with Pittsburgh, though the Steelers insist they are not in a hurry to start over at quarterback. The 39-year-old Roethlisberger restructured his contract in March to offset a salary cap hit of nearly $42 million, a move Colbert praised for its selflessness because it set an example veterans such as linebacker Vince Williams, defensive tackle Tyson Alualu and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster to follow. Williams returned after getting cut as part of a salary purge while Alualu and Smith-Schuster both opted to come back rather than leave after hitting the open market.\n\nThe decisions reinforced the idea the Steelers remain in win-now mode, meaning the draft is likely to address their most pressing needs — particularly along the offensive line — near the top of the draft rather than begin the quest for Roethlisberger's eventual replacement.\n\nColbert called the class for centers “unusually deep,\" a good thing because Pittsburgh is in the market for one after perennial Pro Bowler Maurkice Pouncey retired in February. Improving a line that struggled to generate anything in the run game last year — when the Steelers finished last in the NFL in yards rushing and yards per carry — is a priority, though Tomlin cautioned adding talent isn't the only possible solution.\n\n“We’re capable of performing better than we have, players aside,” Tomlin said. “Schematics, formations, the things that we do to give ourselves a strategic advantage need to be improved, and that’s some of the things that we’re working on.”\n\nPittsburgh let offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner's contract expire and promoted quarterbacks coach Matt Canada to the position. Canada's had some success in generating an effective ground game in previous stops, most notably on the other side of the building the Steelers share with the University of Pittsburgh. The Panthers averaged 225 yards on the ground during Canada's one-year stop in Pittsburgh in 2016.\n\nGetting better production on the ground is vital if the Steelers want to take some of the pressure off Roethlisberger. Having a back that's a difference-maker would help. They haven't had one — at least, not consistently — since Le'Veon Bell opted to sit out 2018 in a contract dispute.\n\nBell was a second-round pick in 2013. The Steelers haven't taken a back higher than the third round since. There's a chance that changes this time around.\n\n“I think if you look at the Hall of Fame runners, most of those guys were taken in high rounds,” Colbert said.\n\nJust don't expect the Steelers to trade up from the 24th overall pick to grab a running back or anyone else. Pittsburgh has five picks in the top 140. Giving up a couple to move up a few spots in the first is sub-optimal for a club in need of immediate contributors.\n\nOne thing the Steelers won't do after having more than 100 video conferences with potential prospects is get caught up in what goes on ahead of them. Colbert called mock drafts “a complete waste of time.”\n\nInstead the Steelers will spend most of Wednesday coming up with a list of 24 players that could be available when they pick 24th. Odds are the one still available when they are on the clock is the one they'll take, regardless of position.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/buccaneers/2023/01/16/buccaneers-qb-coach-on-tom-bradys-confidence-in-winning-super-bowl/51194073/", "title": "Bucs QB coach on Tom Brady: 'You can't convince him we're not ...", "text": "Luke Easterling\n\nBucs Wire\n\nAs you might have noticed, the 2022 season hasn't exactly gone as well as the Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were hoping.\n\nAfter a Super Bowl win in 2020, and a franchise-record 13 regular-season wins in 2021, the Bucs limped to an 8-9 record, the first losing season of Brady's 23-year NFL career.\n\nAlong the way, Brady and the Bucs have dealt with tons of adversity, both on and off the field.\n\nEven so, they did just enough to win the NFC South for the second straight year, earning a third consecutive trip to the playoffs.\n\nRick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times recently sat down with Bucs quarterback coach Clyde Christensen to talk about everything Brady's had to overcome while leading his team to another division title this year:\n\nAll things Buccaneers: Latest Tampa Bay Buccaneers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n\"If you talk about running a marathon and everything is right, it's a hard race,\" Clyde Christensen, Brady's quarterbacks coach for the past three seasons with the Bucs, said. \"Now you start putting on a weight belt, then you add a couple weights to the belt and the next thing you know, those 26 miles are not just a tough race, they're brutal. Playing quarterback in the NFL, and especially if you're Tom Brady, it's … a tough, tough, long race and now you wear a weight vest and a weight belt and some weighted shoes. At the 15-mile mark somebody says, 'Hey, carry this.' That's how I would describe it.\n\n\"He's not your average guy. When he goes out there, everyone expects him to play well, week in and week out. It was an unbelievable strain and accomplishment to win the division this year with all that took place.\"\n\nThe strain, of course, was personal and professional. Brady missed a week of training camp, working through a divorce from his wife of 13 years, Gisele Bündchen. He dropped about 20 pounds. He lost starting center Ryan Jensen to a knee injury on the second day of camp.\n\n\"You literally start weighted down with some personal things that are hard and they're full-time,\" Christensen said. \"I think that would be different than all the other years. None of us knows what that entails but I do know it's a hard, hard job if everything is right. It's a hard job if all is well around you.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you have that, you lose your center on the (second) practice of the season. You proceed to have people in and out of the lineup. I do think it's a unique (season) and we just never overly played well, which always falls on the quarterback. … I don't think anyone will understand the strain it is for the quarterback or the face of the franchise to fight through all that stuff.\"\n\nDespite all of their struggles this season, Brady still has the Bucs in a position to make another Super Bowl run this year, starting with Monday night's wild-card game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nChristensen's last quote to Stroud says it all:\n\n\"You can't convince him we're not going to win the Super Bowl.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/11/08/espn-michael-wilbon-believes-colin-kaepernick-an-unfortunate-messenger-nfl/843259001/", "title": "Why ESPN's Michael Wilbon believes Colin Kaepernick is 'an ...", "text": "COLLEGE PARK, Md. — More than a year after he first took a knee during the national anthem, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick largely keeps out of the public eye.

But his struggles to stay on the field were only magnified by his absence in the AFC Championship Game after he suffered a thigh injury.\n\nNow he's looking for his next contract after the Patriots paid the remainder of his rookie deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and he's keeping his cards close to the vest.\n\n\"It's a business side of it, but I definitely enjoyed being a Patriot,\" he says. \"Free agency don't start 'til March, so until then I'm still a Patriot.\"\n\nIn his Monday press conference, Belichick declined to address the prospects of specific players' future with the team, explaining that the evaluation process will occur between now and September. He was asked about Talib but declined to offer insight. The Patriots must also decide what to do with wide receiver Wes Welker, who would garner more than $11 million if the team chooses to franchise him again. Said Belichick: \"You have to look at the entire team before you say, 'We want to keep this guy' or 'We don't want to keep this guy.' ... You have to see the big picture and how it all fits together.\"\n\nTalib, who said he had more fun playing football in New England than any other time in his career, says he plans to \"chill for a short minute, enjoy my time at home, and get right back to it.\"\n\nWhether Talib can return home to Texas without running afoul of the law will likely be closely monitored by Belichick and the New England front office.\n\nHis violent off-the-field history includes an indictment on charges that he fired a gun at his sister's boyfriend in early 2011. Those charges were dropped last June. Also, in October, Talib was suspended four games for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing substances. He says he was busted for use of the prescription drug Adderall.\n\nIt's enough to give the Patriots and any other organization pause when considering Talib for a long-term commitment, says former NFL head coach Herm Edwards.\n\n\"It's a concern,\" Edwards, an ESPN analyst, told USA TODAY Sports. \"But he's got talent. He's got to be in a place where there are going to be some defined rules where he's going to be held accountable. He's smart enough to know, too, 'I'm getting old in my career, I need to be on a team that's going to be in the playoffs, that has a chance to win a Super Bowl.' \"\n\nTalib, 26, was drafted by the Buccaneers with the 20th overall pick in 2008. He was swapped for a fourth rounder on the day of the 2012 trade deadline. When healthy, his presence solidified the Patriots pass defense. When not, the backfield needed shuffling, as fans saw Sunday when Talib left the title game in the first half with an injury that appeared to be a hamstring issue. Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco feasted in the second half.\n\nFor both Talib and Belichick, the stink of the AFC Championship loss had yet to wear off by Monday morning. The longest-tenured coach in the NFL was no more dour than usual in his season-ending remarks as players cleaned out their lockers.\n\n\"The last game, it's either euphoria or a crash landing. For us, it's a crash landing,\" Belichick said. \"A year ago this time, it was the other feeling. It's one or the other. There's no in between. And there's certainly no soft landing.\n\n\"A season that was very much alive with great hopes and expectations suddenly crashes, and it's over. That's how it's gonna be for every team but one. That's the NFL.\"\n\nTalib was especially disappointed with not having an opportunity to play with the injury to his right leg, though he adds it's simply a \"tweak\" and nothing to worry about.\n\n\"It's the (worst) way to go out in any game,\" he says, \"let alone the AFC Championship.\"\n\nFollow Robert Klemko on Twitter @RobertKlemko", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/21"}]}

I ask New Yorkers to wait to hear our defense before you make any judgments.”\n\n'Suspect sources'\n\nAdams has been dogged by questions about his fundraising and other practices since before he was elected mayor in 2021. Federal agents over the summer seized his phone and raided homes associated with his chief campaign fundraiser.\n\nEarlier this month, investigators from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, raided top members of his inner circle − including the police commissioner, who later resigned.\n\n\"The first thing that makes this moment in New York City history so sad is that so many people saw it coming right down Broadway,\" Josh Greenman wrote Thursday in the public affairs journal Vital City.\n\n\"When Eric Adams ran for mayor, even those who liked him couldn’t ignore his penchant for raising money from suspect sources and for keeping company with people who treated rules as loose suggestions,\" Greenman said.\n\nFederal agents raided Adams' official residence Thursday morning.\n\nNearly a dozen investigators rolled up before dawn at Gracie Mansion, the 220-year-old landmark on Manhattan's Upper East Side, in a black SUV and other vehicles.\n\nAlex Spiro, a lawyer for Adams, said investigators had seized a phone \"in an effort to create a spectacle,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nMore:New York City Mayor Eric Adams vows to fight charges in criminal indictment\n\n$10 million in public campaign funds\n\nAdams denied wrongdoing.\n\n“If it’s campaign violations, I know I don’t violate the campaign” laws, Adams said. “If it’s foreign donors, I know I don’t take money from foreign donors.”\n\nThe indictment alleged Adams received illegal foreign donations and donations exceeding the legal limit through \"straw\" donors and then increased his campaign war chest by accepting public funds to match the illegal donations. New York City offers public campaign financing for candidates who agree to certain limits, providing $8 for every $1 raised from smaller donors.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Adams' campaign received $10 million in public money based on illegal donations.\n\nThe case of the Turkish skyscraper\n\nThe indictment charges that Adams paid back his Turkish government benefactors by forcing city approval of a new Turkish consulate even though it couldn't pass a fire inspection.\n\nIn Sept. 2021 − after Adams had won the city's Democratic primary, assuring his election in November −Turkish officials were under pressure to open a new, 36-story, consular skyscraper in Manhattan in time for a visit by their president.\n\nAdams leaned on the city's fire department to push it through, the indictment said, and a top inspection official \"was told that he would lose his job if he failed to acquiesce.\"\n\n\"After Adams intervened, the skyscraper opened as requested,\" the indictment said.\n\nAdams appointee helped indict him\n\nStanding beside U.S. Attorney Damian Williams at a press conference Thursday was Jocelyn Stauber, the city's investigations commissioner, an Adams appointee.“We handled this investigation as we would any other,” Stauber told reporters.\n\nAdams face a storm of calls to resign including city Controller Brad Lander, who is challenging Adams in next year's election. Public Advoate Jumaane Williams, who would take over as acting mayor if Adams resigned, said City Hall was in \"in an untenable situation,\" but stopped short of asking Adams to quit.\n\n“I do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., wrote on X before the charges were unsealed.\n\nA spate of investigations\n\nAdams is reeling from numerous federal investigations of his administration.\n\nHis police commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned on Sept. 13 after federal raids targeted top city officials including Caban, First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, Deputy Mayor for Criminal Justice Philip Banks III, and Schools Chancellor David Banks.\n\nFederal prosecutors have been investigating possible illegal foreign donations to Adams' campaign from Turkey since last year.

He was arrested two days prior to the insurrection on unrelated charges by Metropolitan D.C. police and was barred by a judge from protesting in the city on Jan. 6.\n\nTarrio was added as a defendant in an existing conspiracy case against five other members of the Proud Boys who allegedly attacked the Capitol that day.\n\nThe indictment alleges that \"Tarrio nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and that he claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack,\" according to a Department of Justice news release.\n\nWHAT IS EXTREMISM?Does it include far-left?

Last year, Reuters reported that he was a \"prolific\" informant for the FBI. Since that revelation, his relationship with the Proud Boys has been fractious at best, with several chapters rejecting his leadership of the group. As a result, the Proud Boys has largely splintered since Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTarrio served four months and a week in prison in the Washington, D.C., for setting fire to a Black Lives Matter banner during a December 2020 protest and for being in possession of high-capacity magazines, which are illegal in the district. He was released Jan. 14.\n\nTarrio joins 42 other Proud Boys who have been charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nIn the brief Tuesday court hearing, Tarrio appeared by video in a T-shirt and wearing a face covering. A public defender was appointed to represent him for a Friday detention hearing after the Proud Boys leader told a judge that he was largely indigent with \"absolutely\" no savings.\n\nHe said he only recently landed a job printing T-shirts, earning $400 to $500 per week.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/08/25/check-social-security-number-data-breach/74944395007/", "title": "Data breach: How to check if your Social Security number was affected", "text": "An estimated 2.9 billion records, including names, addresses and Social Security numbers may be affected after National Public Data confirmed it suffered after a massive data breach involving the personal information of millions of Americans.\n\nStill, despite privacy concerns, Americans shouldn't offer to submit their Social Security numbers to websites just because they claim they can help identify if they're a victim of a recent breach.\n\nSocial Security scams are nothing new.

Greg Abbott.\n\nFifty-four asylum seekers arrived in New York Friday on board a bus from Texas, according to the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs.\n\nAbbott’s office indicated that New York is now a designated “drop-off location for the busing strategy as part of the governor’s response to the Biden administration’s open border policies overwhelming Texas communities,” according to a statement released Friday announcing the arrival of the first bus.\n\n“It’s unimaginable, what the governor in Texas has done,” Adams told reporters Sunday. “When you think about this country, a country that has always been open to those who were fleeing persecution and other intolerable conditions, we’ve always welcomed that. And this governor is not doing that in Texas, but we are going to set the right message, the right tone, of being here for these families.”\n\nOn Monday, Adams called it a “mean and cruel thing.”\n\nAbbott claimed in a statement Monday, though, that the asylum seekers freely chose to go to New York, “having signed a voluntary consent waiver, available in multiple languages, upon boarding that they agreed on the destination.”\n\n“What’s horrific is the thousands of illegal immigrants overrunning and overwhelming our border communities with populations smaller than a New York City borough, and Mayor Adams is hypocritically upset about welcoming a few dozen into his sanctuary city,” Abbott said. “If the mayor wants a solution to this crisis, he should call on President Biden to take immediate action to secure the border—something the President continues failing to do.”\n\nA fierce critic of the Biden administration’s immigration policies, Abbott began sending hundreds of willing migrants on buses to Washington, DC, earlier this year as an affront to the administration. Abbott’s office has said that “to board a bus or flight, a migrant must volunteer to be transported and show documentation from DHS.”\n\nMore than 5,100 migrants have arrived in Washington from Texas on more than 135 buses, according to the governor’s office.\n\n“In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,” Abbott said Friday.\n\nHis state has been busing people to Washington, DC and New York City “to provide relief to our local partners,” Abbott said in the statement.\n\nManuel Castro, commissioner of the mayor’s immigrant affairs office, told CNN New York is a right-to-shelter city, so anyone who needs shelter may receive it. However, the city has “exhausted” its regular shelter space, so it has leased additional space at hotels, he said.\n\n“These are families, these are people,” Castro said. “They have a right to be here as asylum-seekers and New York is here to welcome them. They frankly need a lot of support. They’ve traveled a long way to get here.”\n\nAdams repeated Monday he hoped to be in touch directly with the White House about federal assistance on the matter.\n\n“Right now, we are at a state where we must get to the assistance from the federal government,” Adams said.\n\nThe Biden administration has “been in regular contact with Mayor Adams,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said, and the administration is “committed to working with them as we do effectively with other local leaders through FEMA funding and other support.”\n\n“As we have always said, there is a process in place for managing migration flows, and Republicans governors should stop meddling in that process and using desperate migrants as political tools,” Hasan said.\n\nSome migrants did not want to come to New York, mayor says\n\nAround 40 people were expected to arrive Sunday, Adams said, adding that it is not known if others got off the bus before it arrived in New York.\n\nSome of the migrants who did arrive Sunday told the mayor they had relatives in other cities and did not plan to come to New York.\n\nSome families “wanted to go to other locations and they were not allowed to do so,” Adams said Sunday. “They were forced on the bus with the understanding that they were going to other locations that they wanted to go to, and when they tried to explain, they were not allowed to do so.”\n\nFamilies whose desired destination was not New York said it took three days to get to the city from Texas, according to Castro, who also met with them, noting many “were hungry and thirsty, with small children.”\n\nAdams issued an emergency declaration last week to “rapidly procure shelter and other services” for people seeking asylum in the city. Those who want to stay in New York will go to shelters, and volunteer groups will be helping “those who want to go somewhere else” to travel to another location, the mayor said.\n\nNew York Taxi Workers Alliance executive director Bhairavi Desai told CNN they had 19 yellow cabs and Uber cars ready to voluntarily transport refugees arriving from Texas from the bus stop to shelters or to homes of friends or family in the area Sunday morning.\n\n“Everyone we saw looked exhausted by the journey. Many people looked relieved to finally reach safety but there were also people crying from the trauma,” Desai said.\n\n“It’s wrong, and in our melting pot city, it won’t work,” Desai added. “We wanted to do our part to let new neighbors know that they’re welcome here, and in NYC there are people who will help.”\n\nAround 4,000 asylum seekers have entered the New York City shelter system since late May, according to Adams, who said the influx is the primary driver of around a 10% increase in the city’s Department of Homeless Services’ census. New York’s shelter system is currently receiving more than 100 asylum seekers looking for some form of housing per day, on average, according to the homeless service’s department.\n\nCNN has asked the mayor’s office for the total number of migrants the city is processing from Texas.\n\nGenerally, once migrants are processed by federal authorities and released from custody, they are allowed to move throughout the country while they go through immigration court proceedings. They are often released in Texas and other border states, and then continue on journeys to other parts of the country.\n\nAn immigration judge will ultimately decide if they are allowed to remain in the US or be deported.", "authors": ["Nicki Brown Samantha Beech Emily Chang Alaa Elassar", "Nicki Brown", "Samantha Beech", "Emily Chang", "Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/25/eagle-cam-lynching-memorial-midwest-wildfires-news-around-states/50871577/", "title": "Eagle cam, lynching memorial: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After the company that opened a high-tech recycling center in the city went belly-up, and a second company needed steep government subsidies to keep it running, Mayor Steven Reed said the city has decided to cut its losses, end its public recycling service and sell the building. People in Montgomery throw all their trash into one container, and it’s separated and sorted into re-sellable goods at the $37 million facility. RePower South has handled operations there since 2019, when the company poured $10 million into upgrades to produce alternative fuel. But the price of commodities crashed the following year when China changed its import policies, and the facility couldn’t claw back into the black. Since then, Montgomery has paid RePower South about $2 million in subsidies to keep plant operations afloat. Reed said the company may continue to provide service temporarily, but the subsidies are over. RePower South issued a statement Friday afternoon saying it “will soon be announcing a new partnership to bring an advanced plastics recycling capability to Montgomery to build a sustainable, circular economy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Republican gubernatorial candidate faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor. The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay.

Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.

Selchick found officers Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe not guilty of three charges of violating police and city rules, saying their use of force in pushing the protester was “absolutely legitimate.” The arbitrator also wrote that the protester, Martin Gugino, was not complying with their orders to leave the area and “was definitely not an innocent bystander.”\n\nIn the arbitration proceeding, both officers downplayed the force they used. Officer McCabe testified that he gave Gugino a “nudge” in an attempt to “get him away from our personal space. We had no intention on injuring him,” according to the arbitrator’s report; Torgalski testified that he “didn’t make solid contact with (Gugino).”\n\nGugino was subpoenaed to testify in the proceeding but declined to appear, the report notes.\n\nAn attorney for Gugino, Melissa D. Wischerath, said in a statement she was not surprised by the arbitration ruling and noted that the ruling is separate from a civil lawsuit Gugino has filed against the city and police. “This private mediation should not be confused with an independent, transparent and public court proceeding,” she said.\n\nThe incident occurred on June 4, 2020, during a Black Lives Matter demonstration after the police killing of George Floyd. As police moved to clear Buffalo’s Niagara Square after an 8 p.m. ET curfew, Gugino walked up close to several of the officers. Two officers then pushed him, and Gugino stumbled backwards and fell to the ground, cracking the back of his head on the concrete.\n\nGugino was taken to the hospital with a fractured skull, his attorney said. Police initially said Gugino tripped and fell, but video of the incident showed he was shoved by the officers.\n\nThe video led to widespread condemnation, and the officers were suspended and charged with assault. Yet, a grand jury declined to indict the officers in February 2021 and the charges were then dismissed, according to Erie County District Attorney John Flynn, who expressed disappointment in the decision.\n\n“I’m not going to tell you that in my opinion the right thing happened here, because I still believe that a crime was committed,” Flynn said then.\n\nOn its website, the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association, the union representing Buffalo’s officers, praised the arbitrator and said he “saw through the political witch hunt” against the officers.\n\n“True law enforcement and politics don’t mix.

Bauernschmidt is the only woman in that group. In fact, she’s the only woman ever to command a US aircraft carrier, the largest and among the most powerful warships afloat.\n\n“(It’s) easily one of the most incredible jobs in the world,” she told CNN.\n\nMost people would consider that an understatement.\n\nBauernschmidt commands the USS Abraham Lincoln, a 97,000-ton, 1,092-foot Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. With around 5,000 people aboard, it’s the equivalent of a small city at sea.\n\nIt’s also one of the centerpieces of US military might. More than 60 aircraft are aboard the Lincoln, including F-35C stealth fighters, the most advanced warplanes in naval aviation.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln, front, and other warships sail in formation during a US-Japan bilateral exercise. AP\n\nUS aircraft carriers “are ready to control the sea, conduct strikes, and maneuver across the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace. No other naval force fields a commensurate range and depth of combat capabilities,” a US Navy fact sheet says.\n\n“In times of crisis, the first question leaders ask is: ‘Where are the carriers?’” the fact sheet says.\n\nBauernschmidt says answering that call is a privilege.\n\n“There’s absolutely no more humbling sense of responsibility than to know that I was selected to lead the men and women that have chosen (to) defend our nation,” she told reporters on a recent visit to the warship during maneuvers off Japan.\n\nGrowing up in Milwaukee, Bauernschmidt knew she had an affinity for the sea. “I have always loved the water, and swam and rowed competitively,” she says. But joining the Navy was more practicality than ambition.\n\nCapt. Amy Bauernschmidt, commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, speaks with media before the ship gets underway for a deployment in San Diego, California, on January 3, 2022. US Navy\n\n“I came upon my service in a roundabout way.” she says. “I knew I would be paying for my college education and I wanted to find a major I was not only interested in pursuing but would allow me to find a job to repay student loans.”\n\nWith a strong interest in math and science, and that love of the water, she settled on a major in ocean engineering.\n\nOnly a handful of colleges offered it, the US Naval Academy in Maryland being one. With tuition paid, it was the choice for Bauernschmidt.\n\nBut when she arrived at the campus in Annapolis, the thought of being the first woman to command an aircraft carrier wasn’t even something she thought possible.\n\n“Absolutely not. I didn’t even understand this was an option when I first started on this adventure,” Bauernschmidt says.\n\nWhen she entered the Naval Academy, it wasn’t an option.\n\nIt was only in November of 1993 – six months before Bauernschmidt’s graduation from that Naval Academy – that Congress passed legislation allowing women to serve on US Navy combatant ships.\n\nThat “changed almost everything about women’s service in the Navy,” Bauernschmidt says.\n\nA few months before graduation, Naval Academy midshipmen are allowed to request their first assignments. Bauernschmidt chose aviation and began the path to her current command.\n\nShe learned to fly helicopters, became a flight instructor, deployed on destroyers and aircraft carriers and eventually commanded a helicopter strike squadron.\n\nShe then attended the Naval War College, earning a Masters degree in strategic studies before serving in the US Secretary of State’s Office of Global Women’s Issues.\n\nCapt. Amy Bauernschmidt, commanding officer of the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. US Navy\n\nAfter that Bauernschmidt attended the Navy’s Nuclear Power School, learning the science and engineering behind naval nuclear power plants in what Naval Sea Systems Command calls “the most demanding academic program in the US military.”\n\nShe’d need that knowledge aboard the Lincoln, which is powered by two nuclear reactors, as she became the executive officer, the second in command, in 2016.\n\nAlmost five years later, after a stint commanding the amphibious transport dock USS San Diego, Bauernschmidt took command of the Abraham Lincoln.\n\n“Each new job and opportunity strengthened my leadership, and challenged me to be the best version of myself,” Bauernschmidt says.\n\n“I’ve had a phenomenal career where I’ve been given incredible opportunities.”\n\nEven jobs she didn’t really want were opportunities, she says.\n\n“Sometimes you will learn the most and grow the most in a situation or job you did not want to be in or to do.\n\n“Not every job I’ve done in the Navy is a job I wanted, but I learned and took everything out of every job I could,” Bauernschmidt says.\n\nEven though she’s risen to a powerful position, Bauernschmidt acknowledges the many challenges still faced by women in the Navy.\n\nAs of December 31, only 20% of the Navy’s active duty force of 342,000 personnel are women, according to the service’s demographic data.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln makes history as thousands of service members deploy from San Diego Naval Air Station North Island under Capt. Amy Bauernschmidt, the first woman to lead a carrier in US Navy history, in San Diego, California on January 3, 2022. Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nAs a Department of the Navy gender relations survey from February relates, “social media is filled with anecdotes and shared experiences about instances of sexism, discrimination, accessing help, and reporting and seeking justice for sexual harassment and sexual assault. It’s clear there are challenges that must be overcome for meaningful change.”\n\n“These are challenges bigger than the military,” Bauernschmidt says. “We constantly work to improve the environment and sailor programs to support our most important resource – our people during their careers.”\n\nAt Bauernschmidt’s rank of captain and above, the Navy’s gender gap is even more stark. Only 13% of those 3,075 officers are women, Navy data shows.\n\nSo Bauernschmidt does feel an extra sense of responsibility as the first woman to command an aircraft carrier, but she seems to see it as evolutionary, not revolutionary.\n\n“While women have accomplished a lot, I look forward to the day we don’t have to celebrate firsts,” she says.\n\nBauernschmidt says support she’s had from the entire Navy community was crucial in getting her to that bridge on one of the biggest warships in the world. And she says she’s still learning now.\n\n“Overcoming any challenge for me starts with ownership – know your job and do your job to the utmost of your ability every day. It is hard to argue with someone doing exceptional work supporting the mission and the team,” she says.\n\nFamilies wave to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln as it deploys from San Diego in January.

You have to meet them where they need a leader and you have to know yourself well enough to know how to meet them where they are,” she says.\n\nHer advice to those under her command, and to anyone with aspirations: follow through on a daily basis.\n\n“I try not to just complete a task, but own the outcome of my work,” she says.\n\nFor inspiration herself, she quotes an NFL superstar, Arizona Cardinals defensive end JJ Watt: “Success isn’t owned, it’s leased and rent is due every day!”\n\nPay that rent, and you might find yourself with one of the rarest jobs in the world: commander of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Blake Essig Emiko Jozuka", "Brad Lendon", "Blake Essig", "Emiko Jozuka"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}]}

Pesto, who is still growing, is much larger than the average adult for now - but it probably won't stay that way forever.\n\nIn a few months, Pesto will enter his fledgling period, the state during which he begins to mature and will start losing the cute fuzzy brown set of feathers.

Money was still rolling in Tuesday morning.\n\n\"We were overwhelmed with how successful yesterday was. We were so happy and pleased with the support we received,\" Sines said. \"Anyone who is an animal lover is a big fan of Betty White.\"\n\nSines said organizations from guinea pig rescues to wildlife rehabilitations benefited from the day of giving focused on animals of all sizes.\n\n\"It's really beautiful to see people wanting to show support and pay tribute to Betty,\" he said.\n\nKristen Clancy, president of South Shore Pet Food Pantry, said the organization received $1,400 on Monday alone, and $2,500 since the news broke of White’s death. In the first three weeks of January, the organization has raised nearly 30 percent of what it brought in during all of 2021.\n\n“People have been really generous. It’s been phenomenal,” Clancy said. “Obviously (White’s) love of animals inspired people, and her birthday fell on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which I think always inspires people to do an act of kindness.

Tatiana Skalozub, a Ukrainian artist who sells sewing patterns for miniature stuffed bears, confirmed to USA TODAY that she had taken and posted the photo of the hand-sized cub to her account.\n\nExperts say a real newborn polar bear cub would be larger and heavier than the toy, which is only four inches long, according to the Etsy listing.\n\nVickie Larkin, carnivore team leader at Highland Wildlife Park in Scotland — which houses three polar bears — told USA TODAY in an email that a newborn cub is typically born about a foot in length and weighs \"little more than a guinea pig.\"\n\nIts appearance would also differ from that of the stuffed bear, she said, since polar bears are born blind and only open their eyes at around one month old. Their skin also shows pink through their thin fur.\n\n“It is normal for mum and cub to stay in the den for the first four months of their life, with the cub being significantly bigger by the time they emerge,” Larkin said.\n\nFact check:Photo of stuffed mascot at Arizona ski resort goes viral with false story\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate the claim that a viral photo shows a newborn polar bear cub FALSE, based on our research.

Delawareans should expect more wind and rain on Friday, with National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Staarmann saying conditions are \"favorable\" for the development of tornadoes.\n\nFriday's weather will inevitably make cleanup from Thursday's twister more challenging. Here's a look at how residents in affected areas are managing.\n\nDELAWARE STORM PHOTOS AND VIDEOS: Share your great shots with us\n\n'Get home fast:' Mother warns daughters after receiving worried call\n\nMegan O’Donnell Clements was far from the tornado on Thursday evening, busy safeguarding their family's boat in Perryville during the storm.\n\nThen her phone rang.\n\nIt was 7:10 p.m., and Clements’ twin teen daughters called from the car. Both work at the same restaurant, Cafe Napoli in Kirkwood Plaza.\n\nIt was getting a bit windy, they told their mother, as they began to head home from work. One sister thought she saw the clouds beginning to swirl and gather, the pair later told their mother. The other thought it must just be heavy wind, a trick of the light.\n\nGet home fast, Clements told her daughters. Get home safe.\n\nThe next time the girls called their mother, they were in tears. Less than a minute later, as they drove down Farrand Drive toward home, a tree branch snapped in the wind and hit the hood of their car, snapping a power line along the way.\n\nShaken, they’d turned the car around to go back to their work. That’s when they saw a chunk of the roof come off the Acme. She told them to get inside the restaurant for safety.\n\nBut they stayed frozen to their seats in the car as the tornado touched down − right where they would have been driving if they’d kept heading home, Clements said. The tornado then came raging across the Kirkwood Plaza parking lot where the teens sat in the car.\n\nBut the tornado passed just to the east.\n\nFinally, Clements said, the danger passed. Her daughters were safe. Their grandfather, who ate at Cafe Napoli that night, was also safe.\n\nIt was another near miss in their lives. Seven years before, Clements had also been present at the deadly Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 60 dead, more than 1,000 injured and Clements’ life forever changed.\n\nShe wrote a book last year, “Grief, Grace and Gratitude,” about how she learned to heal after that near-death experience. She was so close to many who weren’t as fortunate.\n\nShe said she'd be glad if the near-misses stopped here. As a reminder of its force, the wind on Thursday had severed her house's power, ripping a tree from her lawn and laying it down flat, as if a hand had come down from the sky to pluck it.\n\nTRACKING THE STORM:Debby continues to threaten Delaware.\n\nClements is grateful her family again escaped unscathed.\n\n“We’re batting a thousand,” she said, laughing with relief.\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nWoman describes being inside Acme as tornado hit\n\nJulie Hendrix was looking for some specific grocery items after taking her dog to the vet Thursday evening. Her intent was to go to Wegmans, but she decided to pop into the Acme on Kirkwood Highway near her Limestone Acres neighborhood to see if they had what she needed.\n\nShe was almost finished with her shopping but headed to the back of the store to grab one more thing when mother nature temporarily upended her tasks.\n\n\"It sounded like a truck hit the front of the building,\" she said, recounting that ceiling tiles falling inside the store.\n\nHer phone had sent her a flash flood warning, but no tornado alert. Her housemate texted her right after asking if she was okay.\n\n\"I said, 'I'm okay but I think the walls are collapsing,'\" she said. \"I couldn't tell what was going on because the lights had gone out right after that.\"\n\nEmployees hurried people to the back of the store where she saw two women crying.\n\nThey told her a tornado had just touched down in the parking lot. She quickly thought about her dog hanging out in the car outside.\n\n\"I ran out to the parking lot to see if he was OK,\" she said. \"He was sitting in the car like nothing happened.\"\n\nThen her mind went back to the food she had picked out. Back inside, everyone was looking at the ceiling tiles on the floor and employees were saying they had to close the store.\n\n\"I'm just looking at my cart and I looked at the self checkout and the lights on and it says 'open.' I'm like, well (expletive), I'm just going to check out real quick,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nSo, she rang up her items and bolted.\n\n\"It was, you know, sort of exciting, not super exciting,\" she said.\n\nHendrix said she had experienced a tornado somewhat close-up in the past and her work in healthcare has taught her to calmly look at what's going on and not panic.\n\n\"It was an interesting trip to Acme,\" she said.\n\nShe said the experience shows people need to take tornado warnings seriously when they receive them. It also made her think about growing up in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and how tornadoes were never a part of her life growing up, but now are \"a regular part of our lives\" both there and here in Delaware.\n\n\"Anybody that believes that the climate has not changed is nuts,\" she said.\n\n— Xerxes Wilson\n\nWeather in Bethany Beach, Delaware coastal areas\n\nThough the storm is moving out of the area, clouds hang over the Delaware beaches.\n\nStill, vacationers are still out and about in Bethany, Rehoboth and Dewey beaches.\n\nLike the rest of Delaware, the beaches are under a tornado watch until 2 p.m.\n\nWATCH LIVE:Here's what's going on at beaches from Maryland to NY, including Delaware\n\nMultiple telephone poles down in one New Castle County neighborhood\n\nThe tornado ripped through the backyards of homes on W. Robino and Sherwood drives on Thursday evening. Downed trees and wires sprawled across the properties, but fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nCleanup crews chopped up the debris as residents began the cleanup process.\n\nDawn Warrick said she and her fiancé received the NWS warning and were warned by her son, who is a firefighter, about the incoming storm.\n\n“I guess it touched down that way and just went right through all of our backyards, and it pulled down eight of our telephone poles,” Warrick said.\n\nWarrick said her friend was in a car in the neighborhood, but she wasn't hurt.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nWhat to do during a tornado warning\n\nIf a tornado warning is issued, move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building and avoid windows, doors and outside walls.\n\nIf you are in a mobile home, outdoors or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from flying debris. Do not go to an overpass or bridge. A low, flat location is safer, reports Ready.gov.\n\nMore tornado safety tips include:\n\nUse your arms to protect your head and neck.\n\nMake plans to go to a public shelter if you cannot stay at home.\n\nPay attention to weather reports during a tornado watch and sign up for your community or state’s warning system.\n\nInclude your pets in your emergency plans. Plan in advance for pet resources and accommodation in the event of an emergency.\n\nDo not try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle.\n\nAfter a tornado, you should take these precautions:\n\nStay clear of broken utility lines or fallen power lines.\n\nPay attention to emergency communication channels and local authorities for updates and safety information.\n\nContact your healthcare provider if you need medical attention.\n\nWear appropriate clothing during cleanup. Long pants and tops, work gloves, face masks or other coverings and thick-soled shoes are all items that can help keep you safe.\n\nAcme pharmacy open despite store damage\n\nAcme's pharmacy remained open Friday, despite the remainder of the store being closed.\n\nThe tornado damaged the store's roof and some of the ceiling inside the building.\n\nWorkers could be seen on the roof of the store Friday morning and a blue tarp was draped near a bucket truck.\n\nGlass door slams, shatters in tornado\n\nErnest Goldner lives on Owen Drive, up the street from the Acme that was hit by the tornado. The 40-year-old said he was woken up by the sound of his glass door slamming and shattering.\n\nHis property sustained damage with a few downed wires, shingles blown off of the roof and tree limbs taken down, along with the shattered door.\n\n“I just didn’t know what was going on, I just thought I heard some noises, and then back to bed and sleep,” Goldner said.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nWhat's the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning?\n\nA tornado watch means tornadoes are possible in the area. If you are in a region under a tornado watch, you should keep an eye on your surroundings, discuss emergency plans and check your supplies and safe room, according to the weather service.\n\nBe ready to act quickly if the tornado watch progresses to a tornado warning or you suspect one is approaching. Tornado watch areas are typically large and cover numerous counties or states.\n\nA tornado warning means take action immediately. When a warning is issued, a tornado has been sighted or indicated by a weather radar or trained spotter and there is imminent danger to property and life in the area.\n\nTornado warnings typically encompass a smaller area than a tornado watch, usually a city or a small county that may be impacted by the identified tornado.\n\nREAD:What's the difference between a tornado watch vs. warning? Find out and ways to keep safe\n\nAcme closed due to tornado damage: 'Sounded like a truck'\n\nAt Kirkwood Plaza in Milltown, the Acme Markets grocery store was closed Friday morning after apparent damage to its roof as the tornado rolled in across the parking lot.\n\nAcme spokespeople declined or didn't respond to requests for comment about the extent of building damage. Parking lot shopping cart corrals and parts of the supermarket's roof appeared to be mangled Thursday night, and social media reports from shoppers showed ceiling tiles falling in after a loud boom.\n\n\"Sounded like a truck hit the building. Power out briefly. Damage in the parking lot and to the roof of the store,\" wrote one X user who was apparently inside the business.\n\nSTORM BRINGS RAIN, TOO:Wondering how much rain Tropical Storm Debby brought to Delaware on Thursday, Aug. 8?\n\nSome neighboring businesses remained unscathed, however.\n\nAt Italian restaurant Cafe Napoli two doors down from the Acme, manager Tim Widdoes said his restaurant will be open for business Friday after no more than a light flicker as the tornado passed. But there were some frightening moments as staff saw the tornado in the parking lot barreling toward them.\n\n\"There was a gentleman at the front of the restaurant coming out, and he said, 'There's a tornado,'\" Widdoes remembered. The restaurant staff thought the man was kidding, but he doubled down.\n\n\"No, I'm serious,' the customer said. \"Take cover, take cover!\"\n\nStaff and customers took refuge in the back of the restaurant as the tornado chose its path across the top of the Acme store, Widdoes said, leaving Cafe Napoli all but untouched.\n\n\"It was scary, and there were some hearts pumping,\" Widdoes said. \"But we were fortunate enough to not have any real damage, and we stayed open. A lot of people ended up coming in.\"\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nResident: Tornado sounded like 'a train was coming down the street'\n\nCharles McKiernan, 72, said he was watching television when the tornado came through. A tree was uprooted on his property, but he said he is lucky there was no other damage. There was damage to overhead wires over his house, which crews were in the process of cleaning up on Friday morning.\n\n“I saw it come through a couple of times on the television, and then honestly it sounded like when the tornado blew through like a train was coming down the street,” McKiernan said.\n\nMcKiernan said his power was out overnight and came back at 5 a.m. Friday morning.\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nNational Weather Service: Conditions 'favorable' for Friday tornado\n\nStaarmann said there's certainly no guarantee that a tornado will form Friday, nor is the National Weather Service \"expecting or warning\" that there will be a twister. However, \"the environment is favorable\" for the development of one.\n\n\"Keep an eye on the weather, be alert for changing conditions and be prepared to take shelter if a tornado warning is issued,\" he said.\n\nREAD:Tornado confirmed near Kirkwood Highway. Delaware under tornado watch Friday\n\nStaarmann added that the severe weather is a result of Debby. He said the storm is transitioning to what's considered an extra tropical cyclone, which \"is pretty typical for these systems when they come up this far north.\"\n\n\"Basically what that means is, the more typical dynamics in the atmosphere are causing it to maintain its strength somewhat, bringing the heavy rain and tornadoes and all that to the area,\" Staarmann said.\n\nThat said, Staarmann noted that the main impacts of the storm should move out of Delaware and surrounding states by Friday night − possibly as early as 6 p.m. or as late as 10 p.m.\n\n\"Heading into the overnight, aside from any lingering like river flooding ... it should be a pretty nice weekend, actually,\" the meteorologist said.\n\n'I'm not afraid of a little bit of wind'\n\nEdward Gardner, 65, lives in a Milltown neighborhood behind the Kirkwood Acme with his fiancée. The grocery store was hit by the twister.\n\nGardner said a large tree fell in his front yard. He said he got the tornado warning right as the wind began to blow hard.\n\nThe tornado took down two trees but did not damage the house. He said he was lucky.“I was outside looking,” Gardner said. “I’m not afraid of a little bit of wind, but I didn’t realize it was actually a tornado.”\n\n— Shane Brennan\n\nPower outages continue across New Castle County\n\nIn the wake of Thursday's tornado, parts of New Castle County − especially around Marshallton and Pike Creek − remain without power.\n\nAs of 9:15 a.m., Delmarva Power's outage map showed 49 active outages with 600 or so people affected in both Delaware and Maryland.\n\nGot a story tip or idea?

A sign in the window at the Pathmark states the pharmacy there will transfer prescription files to a Rite Aid on East Basin Road on Nov. 8.\n\nAll three stores have posted signs about prices being slashed from 40 to 50 percent, along with printed notices about the hours of operation now running from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\n“I don’t like it at all,” said Larry Quinn, who lives about 2 miles from the Pathmark.\n\n“I like the convenience of the store being so close and come here often for odds and ends,” he said. “I guess those quick little runs are going to be over.”\n\nManagers at all three stores referred questions to A&P’s corporate office, which directed inquires to the New York public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co.\n\nA spokesman for Sard Verbinnen declined to comment.\n\nThe impending closure of three grocery stores follows the recent shut down of two other A&P-owned supermarkets in New Castle County.\n\nA Pathmark at 3901 Lancaster Pike near Wilmington and a Superfresh at 2105 Philadelphia Pike in Claymont were among 25 stores that A&P shuttered within weeks of its bankruptcy filing, due to a “lack of interest and significant ongoing store operating losses.”\n\nFord recalls 129,000 SUVs to fix fuel leaks\n\nA&P has since sold off 120 of its 300 supermarkets and other stores to three grocery chains for nearly $600 million.\n\nAcme Markets Inc. acquired 71 of those locations, including four in Delaware. Those stores include a Milltown Pathmark at Kirkwood Plaza off Kirkwood Highway (Del. 2) near Milltown, a Brandywine Hundred Superfresh at Branmar Plaza off Marsh Road (Del. 3), a Newark Pathmark at College Square shopping center off Library Avenue (Del. 72) and a Rehoboth Beach Superfresh at Pelican Square off Coastal Highway (Del. 1).\n\n“The company is on an aggressive timeline to convert all locations to the Acme banner within the next month or so,” Acme spokeswoman Danielle D’Elia wrote in an email. “Typically, the stores will be closed for just a few days while we convert them into an Acme.”\n\n7 things to know about insurance open enrollment\n\nConversion of the grocery stores is expected to occur around Thanksgiving. D’Elia said Acme plans to make job offers to nearly all the store-level workers at the supermarkets acquired from A&P.\n\nAs of its bankruptcy filing, A&P had about 28,500 employees nationwide, most of whom are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.\n\nAltogether, the two New Castle County grocery stores already shuttered and the three stores now slated to close will leave more 300 people unemployed, said union spokesman Casey Hoag.\n\n“It’s a truly awful situation,” he said. “For 300 of our members in Delaware, through no fault of their own, the world has come crashing down.”\n\nA U.S. Bankruptcy judge ruled in September that workers at the first 25 stores to be shut down will be eligible for only 52 percent of the severance pay that had been negotiated as part of their current labor deal – more than twice the 25 percent A&P had sought to pay them.\n\nUnder their contracts, those workers had been entitled to $300 for each year of work. The judge’s order cut that to $156.\n\nHoag said the union is planning resource fairs aimed at helping its members hone their résumés and obtain new job skills. Other local union grocery stores also are being asked to participate in those events in the hopes of finding jobs for displaced workers at other chains, he said.\n\nA&P, meanwhile, is seeking permission to reject terms of existing union contracts – including an obligation to pay benefits to retired employees – as it seeks to find suitors for its remaining store holdings.\n\nThe three Delaware grocery stores slated for closure are among more than 100 A&P-owned stores operating under Superfresh, Pathmark and other brand names that are still on the auction block.\n\nSam & Sam Meats, a 30-year-old independently owned, full-service grocery store in Upland, Pennsylvania, is reportedly nearing a deal with A&P to take over the lease for the Superfresh at Crossroads Plaza, which has housed a grocery store since the late 1950s.\n\nSam & Sam Meats owner Sam Kushto could not be reached for comment, but the shopping center’s owner said he is hopeful another supermarket will replace Superfresh in the nearly 29,000-square-foot anchor store.\n\n“The community certainly needs it, and we think a well-managed supermarket could do very well there,” said Terence Ryan, president of R&R Property Managers in Gilberton, Pennsylvania.\n\nClaymont boy prints hand, wins arm wrestling match\n\nLarry Poteat, a frequent shopper at Superfresh near New Castle, said he assumed a grocery store always would be located at the shopping center.\n\n“You just get used to something being there; you think it’s always going to be a part of the neighborhood,” he said. “I’m going to miss some of the staff. It’s been here so long that I’ve gotten to know some of them.”\n\nR&R Property Managers also owns the 51,000-square-foot, standalone property in Claymont that contained a Superfresh until mid-September.\n\nRyan said that property is more likely to be subdivided and leased to multiple tenants.\n\nOwners of other properties that already have – or will soon – lose their grocery stores did not return messages.\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nWoman sexually assaulted in city", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/10/31/a-guide-to-grocery-shopping-in-delawares-new-castle-county/69555598007/", "title": "A guide to grocery shopping in Delaware's New Castle County", "text": "What's Going There in Delaware\n\nThe opening of Delaware's first Wegmans offers another option for shoppers in northern Delaware.\n\nThe new specialty store joins Delaware's standard, discount and wholesale grocery stores we rely on for our everyday shopping needs.\n\nSo, we've broken down Delaware's offerings to help you chart your grocery store plan of attack, whether you're looking for something nearby, or specialty foods.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/04/06/delaware-shopping-centers-ranked-how-business-changing/6926033001/", "title": "Delaware shopping centers ranked: How the business is changing", "text": "Today, you're as likely to find a gym or a grocery store in Delaware's top retail centers as a big-box department store.\n\nIn a trend that began before the pandemic, Delaware's shopping centers are turning to non-traditional users to fill vacancies left by the brands of yesterday.

There are close to 10 Walmart locations in Delaware.\n\nZingos: The Pike Creek supermarket, located at Polly Drummond and New Linden Hill Roads, is open from 6 a.m.-7 a.m. for seniors.\n\nIs it safe to get groceries during senior shopping hour?\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Grace Hauck provided an answer to this question from Tania Elliott, a clinical instructor of infectious disease at NYU Langone, in a recent article.\n\nElliott doesn't advise it, saying she'd rather see stores limiting the number of people who can enter during a given time period so there are fewer people in the store. Presumably it is better to shop during senior hours than during regular hours as there are likely less people present. Elliott encourages seniors to have healthy people do the shopping.\n\nWhat should we do with our groceries?\n\nDr. Jeffrey VanWingen, a physician with Family Medicine Specialists in Grand Rapids, Michigan, posted a YouTube video showing how to practice safe grocery shopping and how to go about unpacking and storing groceries with caution.\n\nUnless you absolutely need them, VanWingen advises leaving groceries in the garage or on a porch for three days before bringing them inside your home. In the video, he goes on to explain techniques you can use to remove possible infection from the groceries and their containers once inside.\n\nIs anyone hiring?\n\nQuite a few grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience stores are adding staff to help with growing demand. The list includes Acme, CVS, Dollar General, ShopRite and Walmart. More information can be found here.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

John Carney's order closing \"nonessential\" businesses went into effect, many stores across the state have shuttered, their usually lit facades now dark.\n\nThe businesses that have remained open have had to come up with creative ways to ensure customers practice social distancing, in an attempt to stem the rapidly growing number of coronavirus cases.\n\nAs of Friday night, Delaware had more than 160 confirmed cases.\n\nIn many grocery stores in the U.S. and across Delaware, including the ShopRite of Christina Crossing, Giant, Food Lion stores and various ACMEs, stores have installed plexiglass shields separating cashiers from customers.\n\nIn a letter from Giant Food, the chain wrote it is \"adapting operations to comply with new (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines to protect (customers') health and safety.\"\n\n\"During the COVID-19 pandemic, shopping in our stores will be a different experience, but we hope that you will understand the steps we are taking to provide a safer environment and do your part to support our efforts,\" the store wrote.\n\nIn addition to the plexiglass, many grocery employees are now donning gloves and masks despite CDC recommendations that people who are healthy not wear them.\n\nRELATED:Supermarkets and stores set limits on purchases, refuse returns or exchanges for now\n\n\"We want to assure you, if you see an associate wearing a mask, it does not mean that the associate is ill,\" Giant wrote to its customers. \"If an associate is not feeling well or is demonstrating any signs of being sick, they have been instructed not to report to work under any circumstances.\"\n\nShopRite of Christina Crossing installed plexiglass, while also saying it's being \"vigilant about regular cleaning and sanitizing of food contact surfaces.\"\n\nThe store follows a routine of \"frequent, thorough cleaning of restrooms and public areas with a special focus on check out stations and conveyor belts, credit card keypads and other surfaces regularly handled by customers,\" a Facebook post said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS DEATHS:Sussex, Ogletown men first two Delawareans to die because of coronavirus\n\nIt's not just grocery stores that are implementing safety measures, however.\n\nAt the CVS on Delaware Avenue near Trolley Square in Wilmington, employees placed tape on the floor by cash registers and the pharmacy, creating 6-foot squares for each customer to stand in.\n\nIn front of the pharmacy counter, the store also placed fold-up tables to create further distance between customers and pharmacy staff. A stand of cleaning wipes was also set up at the counter, and signs read, \"We clean our store to help keep you safe.\"\n\nAt select Walgreens stores in the U.S. that have drive-thru pharmacies, the chain is now giving customers the option of buying certain other items at the drive-thru to reduce the number of people inside the stores.\n\nOn its website, Walgreens said the items that can be bought at the drive-thru windows are limited to household essentials, which are \"chosen specifically to support the communities we serve as our customers practice social distancing to fight the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe items available for drive-thru pickup include:\n\nCleaning supplies and sanitizers.\n\nCough/cold and pain/fever medicine, and immunity support.\n\nGrocery items.\n\nInfant formula/adult nutrition.\n\nMedical supplies/first aid.\n\nPaper goods.\n\nPetSmart, too, which is considered an \"essential\" business, has begun implementing curbside pickup.\n\nThe way that works is customers order online and choose in-store pickup. Once they arrive at the store, they call the store's phone number and select option \"0\" from the menu.\n\nREAD:Why are liquor stores essential? Gov. Carney provides an answer\n\nCustomers will have to give their name, make, model and color of their vehicle, and an associate will \"promptly\" bring out the purchase, PetSmart said.\n\nMany stores are also no longer accepting returns, for fear that the items may be harboring the coronavirus — a step some shoppers said they understand.\n\n\"It's smart to do, especially with what's happening now,\" shopper William Berrios told Delaware Online/The News Journal outside Acme on Kirkwood Highway Thursday afternoon.\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com or 302-324-2785.

He and his partners, Chef Antimo DiMeo and Pino DiMeo, juggle numerous meals at their city restaurants all the time.\n\nBut it was an entirely different story when Stein realized the dinner was being hosted by the president of the United States and his guests would be the leaders of Australia, Japan and India, as well as some of their Cabinet members and support staff.\n\n\"It didn't hit me at first,\" says Stein, about his initial call from the White House. \"And then, as things went by, I got more excited. And once we really got into full swing, I was like 'Oh, my God.' It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Antimo and I feel so lucky our staff got the opportunity to take part and be a part of history.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden wanted to show off his Delaware hometown this past weekend when he hosted the Quad Summit, a gathering of an Indo-Pacific partnership that included Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nAfter the dinner, the world leaders left for New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, which opens on Tuesday.\n\nThe Quad Summit in Delaware was the sixth gathering of the leaders since 2021 and likely its last with Biden, who has bowed out of the presidential race.\n\nBiden chose Archmere Academy, his Claymont high school alma mater, for the Quad Summit and went with a familiar Delaware restaurant, Bardea Food & Drink, to cater the meals there. He and first lady Jill Biden dined at the Market Street restaurant when Biden was vice president and Stein says they have since ordered food from the modern Italian restaurant.\n\nAntimo DiMeo, Bardea's executive chef who has been a semifinalist for a James Beard Award for his cooking, said Biden wanted classic Italian to be the theme. (The president has long been known for his love of Italian food.) The White House then began coordinating with the Bardea partners over the menu and asked that courses accommodate some dietary restrictions. Some attendees were vegetarians and some were pescatarians.\n\nThe Saturday night dinner menu included a play on a Caprese “salad” made with mozzarella di bufala, scarlet red baby tomatoes, basil and Sicilian oregano; Wagyu strip steak with pistachios, black lime and lemon risotto; red snapper; root vegetable pave; and a trio of gelati for dessert with chocolate crumbles and homemade pizzelle cookies.\n\nThe Bardea team also provided drinks and snacks throughout the day on Saturday.\n\nDiMeo prepared the food in a small kitchen near Archmere's \"Patio\" and the school's cafeteria, but he said he couldn't walk freely around the private school's campus. Secret Service escorts walked with him and his staff between the kitchens and Secret Service members also were stationed in the kitchens as they made the dinner.\n\n\"Security was top level. It was pretty cool,\" he said. \"I kept saying, 'I feel like we are in a movie right now.'\"\n\nStein said because the Wilmington Bardea restaurants were busy over the weekend, present and former Bardea staff members helped with the dinner service. The White House also brought its own longtime butlers to Archmere.\n\n\"It was high intensity and hustling and bustling. The service was one of the most fun parts of the experience,\" Stein said. \"One of the butlers was there [at the White House] for 30 years. They said, 'You guys, be you.' They calmed our nerves a little bit. Watching these [butlers] in action is like art.\"\n\nBack home in Delaware:President Biden visits Wilmington restaurant that catered his daughter's 2012 wedding\n\nItalian food fan:President Biden dines at Mrs. Robino's in Wilmington, once also visited by Guy Fieri\n\nStein and DiMeo both said Biden \"was amazing.\"\n\n\"At the very end of the meal, we got to see President Biden,\" Stein said. \"He really went out of his way to thank us and take the time with the staff.

It's a good time to try someplace new, or to revisit an old favorite. News Journal food writer/columnist Patricia Talorico visits the Columbus Inn. Here's what she says:\n\nCOLUMBUS INN\n\n2216 Pennsylvania Ave., Wilmington, 302-575-9651; www.columbusinn.net\n\nRELATED: Delaware Dines Out reviews of Piccolina Toscana, Skipjack\n\nFIRST IMPRESSION: I have fond memories and a soft spot for the Columbus Inn, a Delaware institution which traces its roots back to the 18th century. It's been known as the Columbus Inn since 1953. Over the years, I've dined here with family and friends on special and not-so-special occasions. (I had one of my prom dinners at the Columbus Inn.) The renovations in June 2010, after the restaurant was closed for three years, have made it very inviting and much more modern.\n\nPRICE RANGE: It serves lunch Monday-Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; dinner Monday-Tuesday from 5 to 9 p.m., and Wednesday-Saturday from 5 to 9:30 p.m. with a snack menu available from 9:30 p.m. until closing. Sunday brunch is served from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Prices at dinner can range from $13 for a tavern burger to $33 for a 12-ounce, center-cut New York strip steak.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Clubby, warm, old-school Wilmington with very attentive service.The patio is a great place to dine, especially now that there's a just a hint of autumn crispness. The tavern area is one of the best in the city and you'll get a well-made cocktail or a good glass of wine or cold beer. In the tavern, the leather-bound high chairs are comfortable (though might be a bit of a challenge for some older diners) and TVs are tuned to sporting events. We spied a couple of suit-wearing businessmen at the bar, but you can go in jeans or neat, casual clothes. However, it's not really a baseball cap wearing kind of place. The main dining room is very attractive with a fireplace, votives on tables and twinkle lights on potted plants near the front door.\n\nDDO review: Skipjack wows with creative yet accessible fare\n\nHIT OF THE MEAL: The kitchen staff seems to have really put thought into the Delaware Dines Out menu and there are many options and introductions to the main menu. The crab cake starter was terrific with a crispy outside and a combination of lump crabmeat and slightly creamy interior. It sits on a puddle of tomato-horseradish puree with a bed of fresh corn, asparagus, tomato and arugula tossed in a lemon vinaigrette. You really can't go wrong with the \"Steak House\" option, twin petite filets cooked to order, along with a not-so-small wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon, and thick, crunchy steak frites. A particular delight is dessert, the mini ode to \"The Charcoal Pit sundae.\" (Columbus Inn owners also run The Charcoal Pit, another Delaware institution.) The sundae has vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, caramel sauce, wet walnuts and whipped cream. Our server ran out to deliver the forgotten cherry on top.\n\nROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: It's such a quibble, but I wish there was a little more cauliflower puree with the beautifully cooked bronzino that had crispy skin. The DDO mini raw bar starter gives you a small taste of what the Columbus Inn offers: You'll get one large shrimp, some lump crabmeat, an oyster, a crab claw and a smoked mussel. I liked the size, especially since it's one of three courses, but diners with big appetites might prefer something a little more substantial such as the pumpkin ricotta-stuffed gnocchi or the red bliss potato and caramelized onion stuffed pierogi with short-rib and horseradish cream.\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU TELL A FRIEND? The Columbus Inn has roots in Delaware tracing back to 1798 when it was called Schamlz's Bakery and it's sometimes easy to forget about this treasure. But I don't plan to make this mistake again. Delaware newcomers, discover this restaurant. Longtime residents, revisit it soon.\n\nWOULD YOU RETURN? We were already planning our next visit in the middle of dinner. I would definitely get a seafood platter, a tavern burger and a draft beer and watch a ballgame in the tavern area.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/27/new-castle-county-police-protest-matt-meyer-over-contract-negotiations/3785252002/", "title": "New Castle County police protest Matt Meyer over contract ...", "text": "Protest was on the menu at the New Castle County Chamber of Commerce Policy Makers Breakfast in Stanton Friday.\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer was the featured speaker at the event, at which dozens of county police officers showed up to protest the executive over ongoing contract negotiations between government and the local police union.\n\nCounty police's contract expired in March and contract negotiations have been underway for nearly a year.

A celebration of life will be held from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 4, at Maris Grove Cardinal Clubhouse, 200 Maris Grove Way in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the height of their success, the Sloan brothers owned about 15 food establishments, including two Charcoal Pit locations; two Dog House sandwich shops; three Pappy’s pizza restaurants; a chain of roast beef sandwich restaurants known as Beefy’s; a higher-end hot dog restaurant called Swanky Frank; and a Dunkin’ Donuts.\n\nSTORY: Obama's surprise Charcoal Pit stop: 'Ahhh'\n\nSTORY: Readers sound off on best brioche buns\n\nLou Sloan, a Wilmington native, learned his strong work ethic at an early age. His father Harry Sloan, a former Wilmington city councilman, died when he was just 4. His eldest brother Sam, a World War II photographer 15 years his senior, became his mentor and hero. Sam, injured during his war service, was told he would never walk again; he proved skeptics wrong.\n\nThe Sloan brothers, who made a pact to always stick together, later opened and operated the former Sloan’s Camera Center on Wilmington’s Ninth Street.\n\nThe brothers knew little about the restaurant industry when in about 1950 they decided to open their first food operation, an ice cream shop known as the Dairy Whip.\n\nIt lasted several years, but hot dogs turned out to be more profitable. In 1952, the Sloans opened The Dog House at 200 N. Dupont Highway. At that time, the four-lane highway where the Wilmington Manor eatery sits at Stahl Avenue was only two lanes with trees growing in the median.\n\nAfter first visiting food businesses in a number of cities, the Sloan brothers decided to open a stand featuring foot-long hot dogs with all the trimmings. The concept was already a success in nearby Baltimore. The split, foot-long hot dogs, cooked on a flat-top grill, remain The Dog House’s signature dish. They eventually tore down the Dairy Whip to expand The Dog House.\n\nFor more than 60 years, customers have found refuge at the cash-only roadside eatery featuring a long, throwback counter that has remained in place since 1962. Employees have told The News Journal The Dog House has been known to sell up to 3,000 dogs a week to locals and travelers during its busy summer months.\n\n“What kept us here was we were different,” Sloan told The News Journal in 2010. “We don’t compete with major chains. It’s very difficult to do that. We have our own little niche. We started something different. Everybody had hamburgers and that kind of stuff.”\n\nLooking to capitalize on their Dog House success, in 1956, the Sloan brothers opened The Charcoal Pit, an archetypical American hamburger joint. It was modeled after The Dog House, and, initially, it had a long counter with a view of Concord Pike and about four tables.\n\nBut “The Pit,” as it’s known to longtime Delawareans, proved to be such a success, the brothers had to remodel three months after opening and add more tables.\n\nThe Sloan brothers and an ice cream manufacturer created “The Pit’s” tradition of serving ice cream sundaes that are named after local high schools and match the school colors. The eatery was so popular with high school students in the 1960s to late 1970s the brothers wouldn’t let students hang out in the parking lot unless they had a Charcoal Pit hamburger and a Coke in their hands.\n\nLou Sloan told The News Journal in 1986 that while The Dog House was the family’s original restaurant, his favorite was The Charcoal Pit.\n\n“I’ve spend much of my adult life here. So it’s had a big effect on me,” he said. Lou Sloan was a stickler for fresh food, cleanliness, moderate prices and counseling young employees.\n\nSloan began selling the businesses off after his brothers died. He and brother Marty sold the flagship Charcoal Pit in 1986 to developer Louis J. Capano Jr. for an undisclosed price.\n\n“It’s our time to let it go,” Lou Sloan told The News Journal.\n\nStill, Sloan held onto The Dog House, which he called his “baby.”\n\nSTORY: Is Johnnie's fried chicken like Walt's? You decide\n\nSTORY: Dishes that segue from summer into autumn\n\nWhile he lived in Rehoboth with his wife, Peggy, he continued to commute to the Wilmington Manor hot dog eatery over the years as needed. “It keeps me young,” he told The News Journal. His daughter Robin Sloan Densten said he sold the business about three years ago to longtime employee Mitch Reinhart\n\nDensten said her father was delighted when President Barack Obama visited The Charcoal Pit in 2014 for a cheeseburger, fries and milkshake. Obama told diners Vice President Biden had recommended the Delaware eatery. But Densten said what the public didn’t know was during Obama’s visit to The Charcoal Pit, Biden and his son Beau, longtime friends of the Sloan family, were lunching at The Dog House with little fanfare.\n\n“It was exciting for him,” Densten said, though her father was very humble. “Dad never really retired. He was still emotionally attached to the businesses. He would still talk about the prices of the milkshakes.”\n\nLou Sloan is survived by his wife. Peggy; daughters, Donna Sloan Burick of Greensboro, North Carolina, and Robin Sloan Densten of Newark; stepson J. Mark Eldredge (Melisa) of Middletown; and five grandchildren, David and Jordan Sloan Burick, Mallory and Matthew Eldredge and Hannah Sloan Densten.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 orptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter@pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2020/01/13/salem-oregon-food-restaurants-dining-bar-grill-drinks-bbq-wine/2622564001/", "title": "Salem Restaurants: Check out the best food in the area from 2019", "text": "The first weeks of the new year, for many of us, involve deploying austerity measures in our home kitchens, or at least moderating the excesses of the holidays.\n\nWhile I'm focusing on reintroducing green vegetables and whole grains into my cooking, I'm also reflecting on some of my favorite flavors from 2019, many of which were undeniably indulgent.\n\nOnce I'm back in the saddle of near-daily restaurant dining, I'm looking forward to revisiting these and seeing what new delights 2020 brings to the table.\n\nBertha roasted vegetables at The Valkyrie\n\nLindsay Darling and Savannah Pearce are working wood-fired witchery at Independence's Valkyrie Wine Tavern. A central element of their kitchen and one that lends smoky swagger to many of the restaurant's dishes is Bertha, their indoor charcoal oven. The oven especially showcases seasonal vegetables, concentrating the flavors of beets, carrots, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower while kissing them with smoke. If you need a little convincing to eat your vegetables, a board of Bertha veggies might just do the trick.\n\nRead More:The Valkyrie Wine Tavern in Independence is worth the trip\n\nChoco Taco at On Any Sundae\n\nAt his South Commercial ice cream shop On Any Sundae, Caleb Hayward leans hard on the nostalgia factor. Bright colors, games, and a TV constantly streaming vintage cartoons could make any grown-up feel like a kid again. For me, the menu item that most gets at ice cream truck excitement is Hayward's take on the Choco Taco. He fills a waffle cone \"tortilla\" with vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate sauce and caramel, and seals it with chocolate shell. There's also a double chocolate version (made with chocolate ice cream) a Filbert version (stuffed with Nutella and hazelnut salted caramel ice cream) and two seasonal tacos, too. Go on Tuesdays and you can get one for $4.\n\nRead More:A place to build memories and ice cream sandwiches; Salem truck expands to storefront\n\nOno Bombs at Get Seom Aloha\n\nI first tried Jaysen Ridout and Sylvia Ocampo's ono bombs at Hawaiian restaurant Pandan Leaf Cafe on South Commercial. Just a few months later, when the business closed without warning, I was heartbroken at the idea I would never have them again. Fortunately, the family cropped back up at The Yard as Get Seom Aloha and the ono bombs are back. What are they? Imagine a Spam musubi deconstructed and re-imagined as a deep fried rice ball. Sushi rice, pieces of crispy Spam and a crispy exterior served on sesame slaw and topped with sriracha mayo and furikake, a rice seasoning with seaweed and sesame.\n\nPizza at Turn Here Bar & Grill\n\nThanks to a brushing of garlic butter when they emerge from the oven, the pizzas at Turn Here Bar & Grill Turner pub are something of a pizza-garlic bread hybrid. Owners Dan and Gerry Koonce make the pizza dough in-house based on a recipe by a sister of Gerry's who once owned Pepperoni's Pizza in Dallas. Like everything else at Turn Here, there's a car theme to the menu. Pepperoni pizza is a Hot Rod, the Prius is an all veggie pie sauced with basil pesto; and the Malibu is their take on barbecue chicken pizza with red onion, jalapeños and pineapple. The toppings are more interesting than a typical delivery place, and the crust puffy and pleasantly chewy.\n\nRead More:Pull over to Turn Here Bar & Grill, a new, car-themed pizza spot in Turner\n\nBlack Garlic Ramen at Ibendoo\n\nBefore Ibendoo Ramen opened last April, Salem had been hurting for a ramen spot. Now, It's all I can do to not spend all of my lunch money at the South Commercial restaurant, slurping up noodles. One of my favorite touches that chef-owner Zhixian \"Rocky\" Yang adds to many of his bowls is a finishing drizzle of black garlic oil. Black garlic is made by slowly fermenting whole heads of garlic until the cloves inside turn fudgey and dark, with an unmistakable sweet flavor. I particularly enjoy the flavor of the black garlic in Yang's kimchi ramen, a tangle of fresh noodles in spicy broth with beef, bamboo shoots and onion.\n\nRead More:New restaurant, Ibendoo Ramen, serves up generous bowls of noodle goodness\n\nEmpanadas at Xicha Brewing\n\nLook, there are a ton of delicious things on the menu at Xicha, but one of areas where the West Salem brewery is really in a league of its own is in offering vegetarian and gluten-free options alongside dishes like guava glazed spare ribs and albondigas. I'm particularly fond of the fluffy, crisp-chewy empanadas. The jackfruit tinga filled ones are just as juicy and savory as the hatch chile chicken version and, accompanied by chipotle aioli, crema, cotija, and cilantro, the dish represents a great collection of flavors and textures.\n\nRead More:New menu, bottled beers, events, and a mural; not yet 2 years old, Xicha Brewing continues creatively\n\nSpicy Grilled Pork Salad at Big Blue Thai BBQ\n\nAs the Statesman Journal's frequent Facebook commenters often remind me, Salem's salad game could be stronger. Sure, we've got a handful of salad bars, but in absence of Sweet Tomatoes, Sweetgreen, Chop't and other salad-focused spots, the veg tends to remain on the side or as a precursor to the main dish. This isn't the case at Big Blue Thai BBQ, home to my favorite salad in Salem. Served atop mixed greens, the he spicy grilled pork salad combines shreds of pork, grilled so it has a just smoky edge, with spears of shallot and green onion. The fresh flavor of fresh mint and cilantro brace the richness of the meat and a sharp lime juice and toasted rice dressing tie it all together. The wedge of green salad and cucumbers alongside act as counterpoints, offering sweet, juicy, refreshing crunch.\n\nApple Fritters at Dough Hook Bake Shop\n\nSalem had a serious doughnut boom in 2019 with Bearscat Bakehouse, Dough Hook Bake Shop and Bigwig Donuts all opening their doors. Even so, for me, one doughnut stands above all the others: Dough Hook's apple fritter. Introduced after owner Guadalupe Alvarez Aguilar went apple picking, Dough Hook's fritter is studded with tart chunks of Gravenstein apples and enrobed in a just-sweet-enough La Familia Cider glaze.\n\nHot Bird at Noble Wave\n\nIn a year where Popeye's chicken sandwich ran the fried chicken table, in Salem we had a sandwich that would make anyone say \"Popeye who?\" Their take on a Nashville-style hot chicken sandwich, the Hot Bird is a fried breast dipped in tangy (not wildly spicy) Crystal hot sauce from Louisiana. Served on a sweet bun, it's topped with cabbage slaw and pickles. The sandwich has become so popular that chef Raymond Pelas and owners Karl Schultz and Riley Vannoy are leaning in. They're now offering the Classic Bird (on a different bun, minus the hot sauce, plus fry sauce) on the regular menu. There's a fried chicken biscuit sandwich with maple butter and cheddar on the brunch menu, and they're offering special sandwiches as well. Hits thus far have included the CBR Bird (chicken bacon ranch sandwich with double bacon and double Tillamook cheddar) and the Thai Bird (Thai-style sweet chili glazed fried chicken topped with lemongrass aioli slaw and rice vinegar-pickled red onion).\n\nRead More:Surf's up, Noble Wave brewpub opens today\n\nChurro Ice Cream Sandwich at Don Bigote\n\nForget freak shakes and waffle cones and have your ice cream sandwiched between two warm disks of just-fried cinnamon-sugar dipped churros. Don Bigote is Oscar Rodriguez and Veronica Islas' shiny black food truck that sets up under the awning at Fruteria La Cabana.They specialize in crepes, milkshakes, and churros. The ice cream sandwich It is as messy and epic as it sounds and they also offer a churro banana split.\n\nRead More:15 must-try frozen treats to sweeten up Salem this summer\n\nDuck over Spinach at Bai Bua Thai Kitchen\n\nI might have overlooked this dish, buried in the house specialties page of the menu at Bai Bua Thai Kitchen in Keizer. But when restaurant owner Vichuda Stine made a recommendation I went with it. I'm so glad I did. Duck breast, beautifully rendered until crisp and juicy is thinly sliced and served over a pile of sautéed spinach. Both sit in a pool of thin, deeply savory and slightly sweet soy-based sauce. The juiciness of the meat and greens and comparatively simple flavor profiles made it a lovely component to the rest of a meal loaded with bigger, spicier and more dynamic flavors of curry, stir fry and noodles.\n\nRead More:Avocado curry and crispy catfish with apple, Bai Bua brings inventive Thai to Keizer\n\nCumberland Sausage Roll at Santiam Brewing\n\nWhat's a sausage roll? It's a pasty stuffed with aromatic sausage. Think of a Hot Pocket, if a Hot Pocket lived up to one's hopes for it. The version of this classic British dish at Santiam Brewing is excellent. Ian Croxall makes Cumberland sausage from scratch, seasoning ground pork with nutmeg, mace, coriander, sage and chives. This he rolls in pastry, showers in fennel seeds and bakes. It's perhaps the perfect beer-drinking companion and a steal at $5.95, which also gets you a side of house made salt and vinegar crisps and a pickle. Served hot or cold…you choose. When your server asks if you want a side of gravy for dunking? You do.\n\nRead More:Santiam Brewing embraces commonwealth expats, and everyone else, with new British pub menu\n\nAlambre at Santana Mexican Food in Woodburn\n\nAlambre is so simple, yet so good. At Santana Mexican Food on Front Street in Woodburn, it's a gooey tumble of red and green bell peppers and onions with carne asada, puddles of melty, stretchy queso Oaxaca melting over top. Accompanied by rice, beans, and a stack of made in-house tortillas, Santana's version is what I want for breakfast on most days. When I drive there to get it I'm in luck, because a single order is enough for at least two meals.\n\nRead More:How to tackle Taste of Woodburn, a festival celebrating Mexico in a dozen delicious ways\n\nSheng Jian Bao at Shanghai's Best Street Food\n\nPan-fried dumplings or silky steamed dumplings; why choose when you could have the best of both? Lin Chen relaunched her business, Shanghai's Best Street Food, at The Yard Food Park after being displaced by the construction at Portland's longstanding Alder Street food cart pod, I don;n't know that anyone was happier than I. I love the chewy skins of her handmade dumplings, slightly sticky on top with crunchy, browned bottoms. Chen forms each dumpling by hand, rolling the dough and crimping it into delicate pleats, each pattern signaling a different filling. There's chicken; pork; a crescent-shaped vegetarian dumpling filed with egg, chives and mung bean noodles; and a vegan version filled with tofu, mushrooms, carrot and celery. Your best bet is to bring a friend and get some of each.\n\nRead More:Portland food cart, displaced by Alder Street hotel development, sets up in Salem instead\n\nTacos Dorados de Birria at Sancho's Tacos & Grill\n\nI, along with the rest of Salem, love tacos. This makes it tough to choose a single favorite taco for the year, especially since I'm still in mourning for Salvador's Bakery 2, which closed at the end of 2019. Even so, one truly stand-out stellar taco of 2019 was the birria dorado tacos at new food truck Sancho's Tacos & Grill. Filled with cheese and birria, spicy, slow-cooked beef, these tacos are crisped on the grill before being topped with a scattering of chopped onion and cilantro. They're greasy in the best way possible, tinged orange from chili-scented beef fat. Sancho's serves an order of two with a cup of beef consomme.\n\nTaro Milkshake at T4 Tea House\n\nSipped on the last days of 2019, I loved the taro milkshake at the new Taiwanese tea house in Keizer Station. Most bubble tea places (including T4) use powdered taro flavoring to make their milk teas, but owners Michelle Wong and Dicky Chan use real taro, a root vegetable with a purple tinge, to make their milkshake. The taro gives the milkshake starchy richness. It's especially good with the addition of small boba pearls.\n\nRead More:Salem-area's biggest bubble tea menu is at T4 Tea House, Taiwanese cafe now open in Keizer\n\nTonkatsu with Japanese Curry at at Manna Japanese Comfort Food\n\nJuicy, with a robustly crunchy exterior, Manna's tonkatsu is a pork cutlet, breaded with rice panko and fried. Served over rice with a sunny side up egg and bright yellow slices of pickled daikon radish, I think it's a perfect antidote to a rainy day. Pair it with a bowl of rich, warmly spiced Japanese curry sauce for maximum blues-fighting effect.\n\nChocolate Old Fashioned at Bentley's\n\nEthan Plum has been showcasing his talents as one of Salem's best bartenders at Bentley's Grill, the restaurant at The Grand Hotel. The menu rotates regularly, but the drink I still think about is Plumb's Chocolate Old Fashioned, a richly flavored cocktail that unites Bushmills Irish whiskey, Aztec chocolate bitters, and a spritz of orange zest. It has a deep cocoa flavor without cloying sweetness.\n\nRead More:At Bentley's Grill, Hans Afshar and Ethan Plumb debut new food and drink menus\n\nPho at Super Pho\n\nNoodles for breakfast, noodles for lunch, I would eat noodles at any time of day, any day of the week. One of the most comforting bowls of noodles in Salem is Steven Trinh's Super Pho. To make the broth for the rice noodle soup, Trinh simmers hundreds of pounds of beef bones in water for a full 8 hours, before adding ginger, shallot, onion, sugar and salt. Dry spices – cloves, coriander seeds, star anise and cinnamon sticks – balance the savory broth with their sweet aromas.\n\nRead More:Lancaster Vietnamese destination Super Pho celebrates a decade with a fresh start\n\nEmily Teel is the Food & Drink Editor at the Statesman Journal.

Main St. in a little more than two months, one of the messages should have been, \"The days of dingy college bars on Main Street are over.\"\n\nA pair of first-time restaurateurs will soon open Grain Craft Bar+Kitchen, a craft beer-themed restaurant seeking to become a community gathering spot with live acoustic music and sharable plates of comfort foods.\n\nAfter more than 25 years as the East End Cafe and Mojo Main servicing a mix of locals and college students with a wild mix of original music and touring national acts, the rough-around-the-edges spot is turning a page.\n\nIn doing so, Main Street is losing its final grungy hangout after years of welcoming a long line of more spiffy (and parent-friendly) restaurants and bars like Stone Balloon Ale House, Del Pez, Taverna and Santa Fe. Even the legendary beer-stained Deer Park Tavern was spruced up in 2001 thanks to six months of renovations when Bob Ashby bought the watering hole.\n\nIf you want more signs that Main Street is growing up, keep your attention on the ongoing renovations and construction at the Newark Shopping Center, Grain's neighbor on Main Street's east end.\n\nThe shopping center is getting a much-needed $10 million renovation that will leave it with a new modern look and refurbished store fronts.\n\nAt the same time, Brunswick Blue Hen Lanes was demolished in the fall and a new 220-unit apartment building named Bainbridge Delaware is currently going up in its place. Also, Newark Cinema Center 3 is undergoing its own renovations, switching from 35mm projection to digital, and a new Brazilian steakhouse, Churrascaria Saudades, will be open by the end of the summer.\n\nThrow in Grain, which is capitalizing on the craft beer boom that has spawned successful bars like Newark's Two Stones Pub and Wilmington's Trolley Tap House, and a somewhat forgotten part of Main Street is prime for a rebirth.\n\n\"Main Street is a one-way street obviously, so all of this is going to really cement that first impression,\" says Ricky Nietubicz, the city's community affairs officer and administrator of Downtown Newark Partnership, a public/private partnership that promotes and enhances the downtown area.\n\nGrain, co-owned by North Star neighbors and University of Delaware graduates Lee Mikles and Jim O'Donoghue, plans to open in time for July 25's Downtown Newark Food & Brew Festival. Expect a menu that turns away from some of the fancier fare that other gastropubs have leaned toward.\n\nExtensive renovations are beginning in days with Yorklyn-based interior designer and fellow UD graduate Katie O'Hara guiding the restaurant's trendy look. A website for the restaurant recently appeared online at grainonmain.com.\n\nAlong the front sidewalk, Grain will have a lounging area with seating made out of cords of wood that will lead to the front patio. The porch will feature an exposed and curved wood grain wall covering over the brick that divides the restaurant from a neighboring property. Some of the tables will be German beer garden-inspired with a built-in center area that can house ice and beers.\n\nOnce inside, the front bar will have a large, see-through walk-in cooler they joking refer to as the \"medicine cabinet.\" Further back, the rear bar will be a more relaxed space. The old Mojo Main stage will remain in the same spot, but will be reduced in size. The doorway linking the two bar areas will be widened and four large windows will be installed transforming the longtime dank, dark bar into a sunny saloon.\n\nAnd on the walls, the restaurant's real theme will come together in a nod to American inventor Oliver Evans. A collection of antique tools will cover the walls throughout and a suspended steam-themed structure will even hang above diners in the front bar.\n\nEvans was a Newport-born engineer and a pioneer at the turn of the 19th century, building the first automated flour mill and America's first high-pressure steam engine.\n\n\"We wanted to link up with the innovation and excitement that is happening at the university. That's the sort of stuff we want to celebrate,\" says Mikles, who previously worked at Wilmington digital design agency The Archer Group, which he co-founded.\n\nMikles sold his final interest in Archer last summer and is now marketing a new software company for a Pennsylvania-based investor group. O'Donoghue works in marketing for a Wilmington bank, but put in his time serving at and managing restaurants during his younger days, including now-closed Newark bar Down Under and The Rusty Rudder in Dewey Beach.\n\nGrain's biggest draw just might be its large parking lot in the rear, which will get improved lighting and a good cleaning to remove the graffiti on the walls and the broken glass on the ground.\n\nBoth Mikles and O'Donoghue spent part of their college years seeing bands at the old East End Cafe and view music as a big part of their new restaurant, eyeing solo and duo acoustic acts for their stage. The restaurant plans to stream the performances online or record and post them on its website.\n\n\"We want to create reasons for people to get together and music is one of those reasons,\" Mikles says. \"Main Street has such a heritage of music. Everyone we talk to has a story of an artist they saw here before they got real big, so music is a big part of this.\"\n\nAs for the beer, Grain will have at least 100 different varieties to choose from with plans to establish a \"beer council\" of customers and beer fans to help curate the rotating selection. And unlike some of the other craft brew pubs that have popped up in recent years, Grain will also carry non-craft beers, so Budweiser, Miller Lite and Pabst Blue Ribbon drinkers will still be able to call the location home.we talk to has a story of an artist they saw here before they got real big, so music is a big part of this.\"\n\nMikles and O'Donoghue, both in their 40s, plan on expanding and opening other Grain Craft Bar+Kitchen restaurants across Delaware in the coming years.\n\nThe property that Grain is located on is being managed by Ernie Laletas and Christine Frangakis, the son and daughter of Elaine Papantinas, who owned it with her husband, Stephen. Elaine Papantinas died in December at the age of 86. Stephen Papantinas is 91 and unable to manage the property so his step-children worked on the deal to bring in Grain.\n\nLaletas says the family was dedicated to keeping the property home to a restaurant. When the Papantinas family first bought the property in 1976, they owned and operated the Hidden Hearth restaurant before the pair retired and East End Cafe took over the location in 1987.\n\n\"We really wanted it to be another restaurant because it was [Stephen Papantinas'] wish to always have a restaurant,\" says Laletas, 58. \"I think these guys really want to do it right. We're behind them all the way.\"\n\n-- Ryan Cormier, The News Journal. Facebook: @ryancormier. Twitter: @ryancormier.

The celebrity chef picks a \"secret ingredient\" the competitors must use, and the dishes are then judged by two friends of Flay.\n\nWhoever wins then will try to outcook Flay by making their \"signature dish.\"\n\nFlay supposedly doesn't know what the dish will be before the clock begins in the 45-minute round.\n\nThere is no prize for beating Flay other than lifelong bragging rights.\n\nThe friends of Flay's appearing in Cameron's episode are Flay's daughter Sophie and Eddie Jackson, a chef and former NFL cornerback.\n\nCameron will put his cooking chops up against Leilani Baugh, a chef/restaurateur from Oakland, California, who is known for making \"Southern comfort food with an Asian twist.\"\n\nIs the name of the episode a signal that Cameron makes it past the first round?

Though falling one position in both sections — from No. 2 and No. 8 last year — it remains the third consecutive year Delaware State has landed in the top 10 overall, and the ninth within the public rankings' top 5.\n\n\"This year’s ranking demonstrates our continued commitment to excellence in academic programming and student support services. I am proud of the work of our faculty and staff who continue to place the success of our students as their No. 1 priority,” said Provost Saundra DeLauder in a statement. “We will continue to strive to become the most diverse, contemporary HBCU in the country.”\n\nSpelman College, Howard University and Florida A&M University secured the three top spots among private and public.\n\nSports:How Deion Sanders praised former Delaware State star he recruited for key role in Colorado\n\nHow these fellow HBCUs — or institutions established before the Civil Rights Act aiming to foster African American students — value each other in peer evaluation, alongside a six-year graduation rate, are two significant categories in the ranking system, Delaware State said Monday. The university now shares its No. 9 spot at a tie with Claflin University in South Carolina.\n\nDelaware State hopes to pair these rankings with continued expansion of its research portfolio and increased recruitment of male students in education. This follows growth in the Aviation Program, adding helicopter training to its roster, the launching of an Early Childhood Innovation Center, and the successful integration of Wesley College, now the home of College of Health and Behavioral Sciences at DSU Downtown.\n\nWhat the university deemed \"most notable\" in its rankings this year were momentum in retention and graduation, social mobility — or success in graduating students from low-resource communities — innovation and leadership in undergraduate teaching.\n\nThe HBCU also unveiled some new logos last month, updating both its academic emblem and the hornet logo for university athletics. Refreshed branding was meant to capture DelState's growth over the last decade.\n\nThe university has also battled some student unrest on campus since winter 2023, when students protested for improved campus safety and handling of sexual assault cases.

North Carolina A&T, based in Greensboro, placed eighth this year.\n\n“Moving up 13 places is a testament to our focus on student success and the dedication of our faculty, staff and students to the tenets of our strategic plan, FAMU Rising,” FAMU President Larry Robinson, said in a release. “Our intentionality and teamwork allow us to focus acutely on opportunities and more effectively address challenges.”\n\nThe university is hosting a celebration of its rankings during a public event at 5 p.m. Wednesday at the Lawson Center.\n\nThe university’s current five-year plan (2017-2022), places a key emphasis on improving retention, six-year graduation rates, expanding faculty research options, improving infrastructure and customer service.\n\nThe plan, which is currently being updated, has resulted in several gains for the university.\n\nThis year, the university increased its overall points gained in achieving metrics set by the Board of Governors from 73 in 2020 to 79 in 2021, marking its highest increase in history. As a result, FAMU will see $12.65 million from the state investment along with $14 million from its own investment, for a total of $26.7 million in performance-based funding.\n\nFor the fall semester 2021, FAMU had 7,871 first-time-in-college students apply, up from 7,588 last fall.

It is a statement about a joint effort between our Board and the President to establish and stick with key priorities,” FAMU Board of Trustees Chairman Kelvin Lawson said. “We want to continue to push the envelope and focus on ongoing improvement in our operating model as we continue our march to the top 100 colleges and universities in the nation.”\n\nFor more on the rankings, visit: https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges?src=usn_pr.\n\nContact senior writer Byron Dobson at bdobson@tallahassee.com or on Twitter @byrondobson.\n\nNever miss a story: Subscribe to the Tallahassee Democrat using the link at the top of the page.\n\nTop 10 HBCUs by U.S. News & World Report\n\nSpelman College, Atlanta, Georgia (1, Private)\n\nHoward University, Washington.

Ron DeSantis — to make good on state debts to land-grant HBCUs, alleging that Florida A&M University has been denied nearly $2 billion since 1987 by the state of Florida.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona along with U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack sent letters to 16 state governors Monday, calling on them to equitably fund 16 land-grant HBCUs across the country due to the over $12 billion disparity in funding between the schools and their non-HBCU land-grant peers.\n\n“Unacceptable funding inequities have forced many of our nation’s distinguished Historically Black Colleges and Universities to operate with inadequate resources and delay critical investments in everything from campus infrastructure to research and development to student support services,” Cardona said in a prepared statement.\n\nAttempts to get comment from the governor's office were unsuccessful.\n\nUnder what is called the Second Morrill Act of 1890, states that chose to open a second land-grant university to serve Black students are required to provide a fair distribution of state funds between their 1862 and 1890 land-grant universities.\n\nBut data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Survey (IPEDS) shows that unequitable appropriated funding of the land-grant HBCUs ranges from $172 million to $2.1 billion from 1987 to 2020.\n\nFAMU’s counterpart when it comes to land-grant institutions in the state is the University of Florida.\n\nBut $1.973 billion of state appropriated funding has been held back from FAMU in the last 33 years compared to the amount of money that UF has been receiving from the state.\n\nFAMU declined to comment on the issue while active unrelated litigation is pending on the same subject in the U.S. District Court.\n\nFAMU in the headlines:FAMU President Larry Robinson looks ahead after epic rise in latest U.S. News rankings\n\nOther land-grant HBCUs include North Carolina A&T State University with a $2.08 billion gap in state appropriations compared to North Carolina State University, Fort Valley State University with a $603.156 million gap compared to the University of Georgia and Alabama A&M University with a $527.28 million gap compared to Auburn University, according to NCES.\n\n“The documented discrepancies are a clarion call for governors to act without delay to provide significant support for the 1890 land-grant institutions in their respective states,” Vilsack said in a prepared statement. “Failing to do so will have severe and lasting consequences to the agriculture and food industry at a time when it must remain resilient and competitive.”\n\nWhile there are HBCU land-grant institutions in 18 states, the 16 letters were sent since Delaware and Ohio have equitably funded their respective universities, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture release.\n\nThe letters from the U.S. secretaries come during a time where advocates — including a group of FAMU students who took their concerns to court — have been pushing for states to increase HBCU funds.\n\nLast year, six FAMU students filed a lawsuit alleging discrimination by the state, which includes allegations about how the university faces underfunding when compared to other state institutions in Florida.\n\nIn a June court hearing, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle rejected a motion to dismiss by Attorney General Ashley Moody and gave the students 30 days to amend their complaint to provide more data in support of their allegations.\n\nBut the state made a motion to dismiss the revised version, which has led the plaintiffs to respond with a new complaint that they hope will be back in front of a judge sometime toward the end of the year or in the beginning of next year to present their arguments, according to civil rights attorney Joshua Dubin — the lawyer representing the FAMU students.\n\nMore on FAMU related lawsuit:Judge issues ruling that indicates skepticism about key parts of FAMU student's lawsuit\n\n“I think it's a step in the right direction that light is being shined on this issue, but a request is just a request,” Dubin told the Tallahassee Democrat Thursday, referring to the letters sent to the governors. “We’re looking for something more than a request. We’re looking for a court order that mandates the state of Florida to equitably fund FAMU.”\n\n“The main reason behind filing the lawsuit in the first place is to get some equality here,” he added. “We’re going to keep pushing toward what our objective is, which is to right past wrongs and to ensure that it doesn’t continue so that a brighter future can be created for FAMU and its students.”\n\nAs the letters to the governors were released Monday, so were the U.S. News & World Report’s latest rankings, revealing that FAMU exceeded its goal of breaking into the Top 100 among the nation’s public universities at 91st place.\n\nFAMU also maintains its standing of being the top public HBCU in the nation for the fifth year in a row, according to the 2023-2024 U.S. News rankings.\n\nIn addition, the university is seeking $50.4 million in state funding in its legislative budget request, which is nearly twice the amount it requested last year.\n\nFAMU's rise in the rankings:'Outstanding': FAMU breaks into Top 100 in U.S. News & World Report rankings\n\n“I am continually inspired by all that HBCUs have achieved despite having to punch above their weight,” Cardona said in the release. “Our HBCUs graduate a huge share of our nation’s Black educators, doctors, engineers, judges and lawyers. These institutions and the talented, diverse students they serve must have equitable funding in order to reach their full potential and continue driving innovation.”\n\nThe Departments of Education and Agriculture have offered to work with each state’s budget office to examine the funding data and bring balance to investments in the underfunded HBCUs.\n\nContact Tarah Jean at tjean@tallahassee.com or follow her on twitter @tarahjean_.\n\nNever miss a story: Subscribe to the Tallahassee Democrat using the link at the top of the page.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/campus/2017/07/08/documents-show-b-cus-new-dorm-will-cost-school-306-million/16236665007/", "title": "Documents show B-CU's new dorm will cost school $306 million", "text": "Seth Robbins,T.S. Jarmusz\n\nseth.robbins@news-jrnl.com\n\nBethune-Cookman University's first contract with the company that would finance its newest dormitory wound up in unlikely hands: a forensic document examiner tasked with determining whether the school's president had actually signed it.\n\nThe agreement, which dated back to February 2014, called for the school to pay monthly installments of $250,000 to a company called TG Quantum. But President Edison Jackson claimed that the signature on the agreement wasn't his.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the some 30 members of the board of trustees that oversees the school's operations received an email with the examiner's report. The investigation had concluded that Jackson had not signed the contract.\n\nThe apparent forgery, however, didn't stop B-CU's board or president from moving forward with the company and its financing of the dorm. There seemingly was no discussion of canceling the contract, signed just two months earlier, or even reviewing the lease agreement -- a type of deal that experts say is complex and should always be reviewed by outside accountants.\n\nThe dorm, whose original price was stated at $72.1 million, will cost the school more than $300 million when it's paid off in 40 years, the News-Journal has learned.\n\nThis was just one of several bizarre and troubling episodes related to B-CU's finances under its current president. Fitch Ratings agency has on three separate occasions downgraded the school's credit rating, most recently in June, when it noted B-CU's \"aggressive level of debt.\"\n\n[READ: Tax documents show B-CU losses mounting to $17.8 million]\n\nBut on at least two occasions when trustees raised questions about the school's solvency, they were removed from the board, documents and court records show. And a B-CU alumni representative chosen to serve on the board was denied access to meetings after questioning the management of the school's finances.\n\nOn Tuesday, there is a mandatory meeting for all trustees where the school's operations will be discussed. Neither Jackson nor any active board member would speak on the record for this story. Instead, The News-Journal reviewed hundreds of documents, including emails, court records and financial statements related to the dorm deal and B-CU's finances.\n\nHere is what else the newspaper found:\n\nThe 1,200-bed dorm now costs about $85 million, not the $72.1 million projected. School officials weren't able to explain the cost overrun. Moreover, thanks to an aggressive financing agreement, the final cost to B-CU, which has never been disclosed publicly, will amount to more than $300 million over a period of 40 years.\n\nThe deal is structured so that B-CU's monthly payments on the dorm will increase by 1.5 percent annually over the life of the lease from a low of $470,000 a month to a high of about $840,000 -- or about $10 million a year. Financial documents also suggest that the school is already struggling to make these payments and has been deferring some.\n\nDarnell Dailey, the businessman behind TG Quantum and other companies involved in the financing and building of the dorm, has been sued twice by former partners for alleged fraud. One of them was a partner in the B-CU dorm deal. TG Quantum was formed to bid on the B-CU dorm project and had no other business dealings prior to its selection. Its partners expected to earn $45 million from the agreement.\n\nB-CU, meanwhile, is scrambling to find money to keep its operations going. Last year, the school's operating cash flow was a negative $7.8 million. And just last month, Jackson thanked the board for approving a drawdown of $10 million from earnings on its endowment, a restricted investment account.\n\nWhen asked about the recent financial difficulties, Albert Mosley, the school's new chief operating officer, said that the school is not running out of money.\n\n\"Under President Edison O. Jackson's leadership, the university has materially improved operating results in 2017,\" he said, pointing to the most recent Fitch ratings report that downgraded its credit rating but also said the school had a stable outlook going forward. \"We expect to maintain and slowly grow our financial resources over time.\"\n\nYet in recent years, any number of colleges and universities -- many of which are much larger and wealthier than B-CU -- have received harsh lessons after building binges left them saddled with debt. And it's the students who often have been the ones left to pick up the bill, experts say.\n\nLast October, B-CU's finance committee approved 3 percent hikes in housing costs for all new dorms, and this year a 3 percent increase in tuition for academic year 2018-2019 was approved, according to board meeting reports. At the start of last school year, officials also enforced a new policy that all sophomores -- not just freshmen -- live in the dorms.\n\nThis all comes at a time when several historically black colleges and universities have been grappling with skyrocketing debts and declining enrollments as they compete for a pool of students who have more options and become more selective. Some of the hardest-hit HBCU's have had their accreditation put on probation or even revoked because of financial mismanagement and high debt levels.\n\nRobert Delancy, a 1979 B-CU alumnus and former IRS investigator, was among those who raised questions about the dorm's high expense, but he never received answers.\n\n\"All I wanted to know is that they had a safety net,' he said. \"Everything this administration has done has been shrouded in secrecy. It didn't have to be.'\n\nJackson takes over\n\nPrior to becoming B-CU's president in 2012, Edison Jackson was president of Medgar Evers College, a historically black institution in New York City that is named after the slain civil rights leader.\n\nDuring Jackson's tenure, enrollment doubled, new degree programs were added and the school grew from a two-year to a four-year college, according to a profile of him in a journal for black professionals. He was described as charismatic and affable and earned praise for building bridges in the community.\n\nWhen Jackson arrived at Medgar Evers, the school was housed in a dilapidated building in Brooklyn. By the time he left, it had a $138 million science building, a student center with high-tech classrooms and a modern campus.\n\nWhen it came to overseeing the school's finances, however, Jackson faced scrutiny from the City University of New York, a group of 24 community, undergraduate and graduate colleges that includes Medgar Evers. Just after he stepped down from his 20-year career as president, CUNY ordered a sweeping internal audit of the school's finances that led to three employees being fired. Federal and state prosecutors were also investigating allegations that officials had pilfered thousands of dollars from the school, according to a 2010 article in the New York Daily News. (The News-Journal reached out to the prosecutors' offices, but neither responded about the resolution of those cases.)\n\nAfter a three-year retirement, Jackson took over B-CU in 2012 -- first as interim president to succeed Trudie Kibbe Reed, who had run the school for eight years. A year later, Jackson officially became the sixth president of the school named for Mary McLeod Bethune, who used $1.50 in savings to open the \"Daytona Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls\" in 1904.\n\nJackson was lauded for bumping up enrollment and bringing in students who were better prepared academically. Trustees spoke of his ubiquitous presence at local events and his vision for the school, which included renovating old dining halls and building two new residence halls.\n\nThere was no question that the school sorely needed new housing. One of its old dorms was plagued by mold problems, and B-CU eventually had to lease hotel beds and off-campus apartments for some 900 students.\n\nJackson told the News-Journal in 2015 that \"one can argue about anything, but the truth of the matter is we need new residence halls.'\n\n'Best proposal'\n\nThe president first spoke to B-CU's board about the critical need for new residence halls in late 2013. At a Dec. 4 meeting that year, board members learned that a request for proposals had been sent out, and that four bids were received.\n\nA month and a half later, at the board's annual retreat, Emmanuel Gonsalves, the school's chief financial officer at the time, told the board that the \"best proposal came from TG Quantum LLC,' according to meeting minutes the News-Journal has obtained.\n\nThe board gave approval to the finance committee to begin negotiations with TG Quantum, which would provide a master plan of a residential building with some 1,000 beds and a student center with retail space.\n\nTG Quantum, however, had never conducted any other business prior to being selected for the B-CU job.\n\nThe company was formed in July 2013, just six months earlier, with the express purpose \"of participating in a potentially lucrative real estate development project' with B-CU, according to a suit alleging fraud and deceit brought by Eugene Amegashitsi, a former partner in Delaware-based TG Quantum. Court records show TG Quantum countersued Amegashitsi for interference of business relations, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Both sides agreed to a joint dismissal of the cases this year. Amegashitsi and Dailey did not respond to calls or emails from the News-Journal.\n\nThe defendant in that suit was Darnell Dailey, whom business records identify as the company's managing partner. Dailey is a University of Maryland graduate whose biography once highlighted his time as a \"member of the National Football League,' though the NFL's official website shows that he never played a season.\n\nDailey's biography also says he managed accounts at several major insurance firms and served as a vice president with TransCapital Group, which he claims carried out more than $10 billion in real estate deals.\n\nRecords show that a Maryland-based company called TransGlobal Capital, which listed Dailey as a vice president, ran into some trouble. A 2006 lawsuit against Dailey and his companies alleges that he and fellow executives secured $600,000 in startup cash and office space to carry out financing deals related to student housing at historically black universities in Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Mississippi. While it is unclear whether these deals ever went through, the plaintiff claimed that the loan was never repaid and that Dailey and his colleagues committed securities violations and fraud, and harassed the lender. Court records show that the suit was settled in 2008 in the lender's favor, but there were no details.\n\nBy March 2014, the negotiations between TG Quantum and B-CU were \"proceeding on an extremely fast track,' according to a finance committee report sent to the board of trustees. The report noted that a builder and architect had already been chosen. Representatives from the school and TG Quantum had already met with city officials to discuss approval processes, and a draft contract was being reviewed by the school's attorneys.\n\nIn early July, the board's then-chairman, the Rev. John Harrington, sent an email to trustees about a mandatory meeting to discuss the dorm deal.\n\n\"Literally millions of dollars are involved,' he said in the email, \"as we shape the future of B-CU.'\n\nIn October, 10 months after selecting TG Quantum, the board gave its approval for it -- along with its banker, builder and architect -- to construct the dorm for $72.1 million.\n\nTrustee Audley Coakley told the board about a different proposal from an Orlando firm. This was tabled because the company had been asked to bid on the project and had not provided a response, according to the meeting minutes.\n\nTim Hudson -- a B-CU alumnus and the owner of DeBary-based TDH Construction, which built several multimillion dollar buildings at the school -- said two of his proposals were also dismissed.\n\nThe first, which Hudson spoke to Jackson about directly, offered to renovate two existing dorms and construct new floors atop them to add 600 beds. Hudson said he never heard back. The second, a four-phase project, was pitched through a board member and was much more ambitious: a $16.7 million, 405-bed dorm, a $6.1 million four-floor administrative building and student center, two new dormitory buildings totaling 550 beds for $35 million dollars, and a $15 million, 3,500-seat stadium. The total cost for all of these structures was about $73 million and could be built in phases over several years, Hudson said. But that plan was rejected, he said, because he didn't have financing already in place.\n\nThe winning proposal's $72.1 million price tag has long bothered Hudson. In 2010, his firm built the school's last new dormitory, the 270-bed Lee E. Rhyant Residential Hall, for $6.5 million. For this reason, he estimated that a 1,200-bed project should cost between $27 to $32 million, or $40 million at most.\n\n\"They were not frugal in administering the funding,' he said. \"It's very heart-wrenching to me, being an alumnus, to see how we could even squander one red penny at a black institution because we don't have the same funding as Rollins (College) or Stetson (University).\"\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2014, the agreement between B-CU and TG Quantum was signed. In an email, Harrington, the board chair, praised Jackson \"for putting all the lawyers in the same room at the same time so they could hash things out.'\n\nThe project was moving ahead at full steam.\n\n\"We should be in our new buildings by about this time next year,' Harrington told board members.\n\nRisk: Downward spiral\n\nThe dorm deal was presented as having no downside for B-CU for one reason: the school wasn't going into debt to fund it.\n\nThe deal was structured so that the developer, in this case TG Quantum, would buy the land from B-CU for $1, making TG Quantum its owner. Private investors would then loan money to TG Quantum, and the dorm would be constructed using the investor's cash. The school would become, in effect, a tenant, paying its rent with money made from students' housing costs -- costs which for B-CU's newer dorms are scheduled to increase by 3 percent every year to meet the growing rental payments.\n\nAfter 40 years of payments to the investors, the school owns the dorm. It's called a \"lease and sublease back arrangement,' and it's the total cost of the escalating rental payments that matters most when it comes to understanding the dorm's price tag, experts say. But B-CU never revealed publicly the total amount it would have to pay over the 40 years.\n\nCourt records from Amegashitsi's suit makes it clear what the school likely owes its investors. Rental payments start at $470,000 per month and then escalate by 1.5 percent a year to a high of $840,000 per month over the lifetime of the deal. When the 40-year lease expires, the school will have shelled out more than $306 million. School officials confirmed the numbers.\n\nMosley said the deal's gradual escalation of payments makes it more affordable for the school and is expected to \"correspond roughly with the inflation rate.\"\n\nCharlie Eaton, an expert in higher education finance and an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Merced, said this complicated type of arrangement is usually only undertaken by large schools that have negotiating leverage and no other way of raising money.\n\nWith a smaller school such as B-CU, Eaton said, such a deal is riskier. If the school cannot make its rental payments, it would have to pull the money from other areas, such as cutting staff or reducing operating expenses drastically. If tuition and enrollment levels can't be maintained, \"it just becomes harder and harder to service your debt,' he said. \"The risk is you get into a downward spiral.'\n\nEaton said B-CU's deal \"resembles a lot of exotic financing in which smaller organizations are taking on too much risk.' And small nonprofit colleges, unlike larger ones, tend not to have \"in-house finance personnel to evaluate these deals and whether it is worth it to have escalating payments.'\n\nAnother concern is that the cost of the project can be passed on to students -- something already seen in the increase in B-CU's tuition and room charges, and in now requiring sophomores, not just freshmen, to live in the dorms.\n\nB-CU can ill afford sloughing the payments on its students, most of whom use federal loans to help pay for school, Eaton said.\n\n\"Historically black colleges offer an important type of education that has a lot of value in society,' Eaton said. \"There is a risk of pushing students away or bringing in students and saddling them with debt because of financing mistakes by the college.'\n\n'More questions than answers'\n\nShortly after signing the deal with TG Quantum to build the dorm, some cracks in its foundation began to show. The company wasn't able to come to terms with its lender. The school's chief financial officer was fired. And the deal was renegotiated.\n\nAccording to the court case filed by Dailey's former business partner, construction had already begun when TG Quantum's funder pulled out. Eventually, a substitute lender, CTL Capital, was found that provided some $100 million, according to Amegashitsi's lawsuit. For this reason, the school's contract with the company had to be rewritten, emails and meeting minutes show.\n\nMeanwhile, the school's chief financial officer, Gonsalves, was fired in January of 2015. His removal, Harrington later revealed, was tied to his setting up a B-CU nonprofit committee with the Florida Department of State Division of Corporations. The board knew nothing about the committee and its makeup, which included several top school officials.\n\n[READ: Resignation sparks questions at Bethune-Cookman]\n\nIt also came to light that Gonsalves, who worked with Jackson at Medgar Evers, had resigned from his previous job as president of a university in Trinidad and Tobago after an audit was ordered there, according to news reports.\n\nDespite all this, the B-CU board again approved contracts with TG Quantum to continue with the $72 million dormitory. There were also two items added to the contract: TG Quantum would reimburse the school more than $5.3 million in development costs, and it would provide four yearly $1 million gifts to the university beginning in 2017. According to the school's website, Dailey contributed $4 million to the school at its 2016 awards gala.\n\nAt that same April 2015 meeting, trustee Johnny McCray Jr. raised the first questions about the dorm deal, saying in a letter to the board, which was read at the meeting, that there was a lack of transparency and independent financial advice surrounding it and that the board was expected to rubber stamp it.\n\n\"All of which,' he wrote, \"forms a conspicuous pall over this transaction that invites more questions than it provides answers.'\n\nTwo weeks prior to the meeting, the school's auditors had discovered $5.6 million in \"undisclosed expenditures' related to the dorm project, McCray's letter said. McCray also brought up the mysterious service agreement with TG Quantum signed in 2014 -- the same agreement that later needed to be scrutinized by a forensic document examiner\n\nMcCray, an attorney in Pompano Beach, asked for a forensic audit, a request that was shot down at the same meeting in a vote of 36-3, according to a later email to board members.\n\nMeanwhile, all was not well at that time at TG Quantum, according to Amegashitsi's suit filed in Maryland's Montgomery County Court.\n\nIn the suit, Amegashitsi claimed that the company's profits from the deal were about $45 million. He claimed his share amounted to $14 million as one of four partners in the company. The partners, however, had agreed to move the lucrative B-CU project to another company, Maryland-based Quantum Equity I, of which Dailey was the sole executive, according to the suit. School officials said Quantum Equity I is the lender on the project and that monthly payments are being made to it; TG Quantum is the developer.\n\nThe transfer left TG Quantum \"as nothing more than a shell entity,' making Amegashitsi's interest in it \"worthless,' the complaint said.\n\nIn late June of 2015, Harrington provided board members a report prepared by handwriting expert Richard Orsini. In it were 10 samples of Jackson's signatures. Orsini concluded that there were \"fundamental differences in movement, letter and form' on the service agreement supposedly signed by the university president.\n\nIn September, McCray sent the board a second letter that highlighted questions stemming from the handwriting report. He asked for a \"comprehensive investigation of the financial affairs at the university,\" adding that he was prepared to file a lawsuit. Though McCray never carried through with his threat, he was suspended from B-CU board meetings.\n\nIn an October 2015 email, the newly installed board chairman Joe Petrock mentioned McCray's letters and told board members that an audit of the residence hall project had found no irregular spending.\n\nMcCray said he continued to urge for outside accountants to investigate the school's finances.\n\n\"I think there was too much trust by the board in Jackson,\" McCray said. \"The board refused to ask the hard questions. We didn't perform our fiduciary responsibility.\"\n\nOpening Day\n\nThe Thomas and Joyce Hanks Moorehead Residential Life Center received its first students in the spring of 2016. Upon unveiling the four-story brick dorm to the school's top officials, Jackson told them that \"this building is made of quality materials' and would \"last for generations to come.'\n\nBy the beginning of October, the board had approved a 3 percent increase in housing rate costs at the new residence halls. Whether those hikes were already planned is not clear from the meetings.\n\nStudents currently pay $7,726 a year to share a bedroom in B-CU's new dorm. Raising housing costs by 3 percent a year for 40 years would increase the price to $25,202, even before tuition and board.\n\nLast month, the school also raised tuition costs by 3 percent for the 2018-2019 academic year. Mosley said B-CU has not raised its tuition in recent years when other schools have done so.\n\nWith larger schools' lavish facilities to compete with, smaller schools often try to provide the same amenities for their students, despite the debt risk. But research conducted by Eaton and his colleagues at the University of California has shown that the strategy hasn't worked. Smaller schools wind up with more debt and fewer students to pay for it.\n\n\"The problem is the cost of these financing deals gets placed on the backs of the students,\" he said, \"and contributes to things like rising student debt.\"\n\nAt B-CU, nearly 90 percent of students receive federal student loans and owe an average of $36,000 in debt at graduation, according to the Department of Education.\n\nMarybeth Gasman, a University of Pennsylvania professor who has written extensively on historically black colleges and universities, said that while new facilities can be beneficial to these institutions, they are not the primary reason most students opt for one. Instead, they go \"for the tradition, the culture, the academics,\" she said.\n\n\"HBCUs historically have been underfunded,\" Gasman said. \"As a president of an HBCU, you have to keep your focus on what is best for students. You have to focus on the curriculum and giving people the best educational experience. Then if you have the funding you can add the bells and whistles, but you have to go with the core first.\"\n\nBy several measures, B-CU is doing well: enrollment only dipped slightly in 2015 and recovered last year. The number of applications has steadily increased, and its yield -- the percentage of accepted students who commit to attend -- has stayed above 20 percent, according to documents.\n\nThe school, however, had a negative cash flow of $7.8 million at the same time it put off some $1.6 million in payments to its vendors, according to financial documents from 2015 to 2016. The documents also show that the school deferred its initial $3.2 million minimum lease payment in the dorm deal. Next year, the lease payment will double to $6.2 million and then steadily grow.\n\nThe school also registered a $7 million dip in its endowment, from $54.8 million to $47.8 million, according to tax documents. The dip was partly attributed to more than $5 million going to administrative expenses, including hefty raises for the school's top administrators. Jackson received a $40,000 salary bump to $410,000 in the 2016 fiscal year, the tax documents show.\n\nFinally, B-CU showed a loss of $2.2 million in 2016 in auxiliary activities -- things like bookstore sales, laundry services, parking fees, meal plans sold to students -- after earning a $2.5 million profit on those items the previous year.\n\nThe school's mounting financial concerns came to light at an April board meeting, in which members talked about reining in spending and proposed a review to \"identify expenses that can be deferred or canceled.\"\n\nThe school adjusted its revenue to include money received from a summer tuition and fee rate hike. It also examined expanding the allowable list of activities that could be reimbursed from restricted funds or grants.\n\nOn June 9, Jackson wrote an email to trustees in which he described the unstable environment at higher education institutions generally.\n\n\"In some extraordinary cases,\" he said, \"several institutions have even gone out of business altogether.\"\n\nYet he described B-CU as an \"anomaly,\" with a steady and, at times, rising enrollment, adding that the institution remained \"strong and viable.\"\n\nHe then thanked the board for its approval of a $10 million draw down from the earnings on its endowment fund and explained how another $6 million in restricted funds was also withdrawn.\n\nThis, he said, \"will assist us in meeting some of the continued challenges that arise from the uncertain and shaky world we are facing in higher education.\"\n\n$72.1 million: Publicly disclosed cost of the 1,200-bed dormitory. $85 million: Actual construction cost. $306 million: Cost to the school through a complex financing deal.\n\nBy the numbers", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/29/record-grapefruit-light-rail-win-snake-road-news-around-states/40042541/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The mayor has promised that any graduate from the city’s public school system will “have the opportunity” to attend any in-state public college for free starting next year. Randall Woodfin tweeted the pledge late Tuesday with the hashtag #BirminghamPromise. Al.com reports Birmingham Promise is a public-private partnership that promised in June to provide funding for 20 rising Birmingham seniors or graduates to work in the city for seven weeks. At least one student from each city high school was included. Woodfin has said that program would offer scholarships for city graduates to attend college. The mayor didn’t provide specifics about the college promise, including sources of funding or possible limitations. He later tweeted that he wanted to clarify that in-state college for city graduates “will be funded.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Add salmon to the list of species affected by the state’s blistering summer temperatures, including the hottest July on record. Dead salmon have shown up in river systems throughout Alaska, and the mortalities are probably connected to warm water or low river water levels, says Sam Rabung, director of commercial fisheries for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The department has not quantified past heat-related fish deaths because they tended to be sporadic and inconsistent, Rabung says. But department scientists this year will analyze fish deaths, summarize observation and record effects. The deaths should not be a surprise because climate models have for years forecast unhealthy Alaska river temperatures for salmon, says Peter Westley, assistant professor of fisheries conservation and fisheries ecology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A fall groundbreaking for an extension of a light rail system in the nation’s fifth-largest city is back on track after voters soundly rejected a referendum that would have killed any future expansion, transit officials say. Mayor Kate Gallego said the vote underscored that residents want a modern, sustainable city that respects mass transit and urban development. She said the city is already scheduling community meetings to discuss the upcoming extension’s design with residents and business owners. The total number of ballots cast was 180,636, the highest ever in a city special election involving only ballot measures. Proposition 105 would have immediately stopped the rail’s extension into the working-class Hispanic and African American communities of south Phoenix, as well as other future extensions linking far-flung areas around the region.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is forming a committee to promote statewide participation in the 2020 census. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday issued an executive order establishing the Arkansas Complete Count Committee, a panel of 30 volunteer members appointed by the governor from state and local government. The panel will also include representatives from the private sector. Fort Smith Mayor George McGill is serving as the committee’s chairman. Hutchinson directed the committee to establish a public awareness campaign to promote census participation and to provide recommendations on how best to reach hard-to-count communities within the state. The panel is required to submit a progress report to Hutchinson by Nov. 1.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Schools in the state may soon allow parents to administer medical marijuana to their children on K-12 campuses. The California Assembly approved a bill this week that lets school boards decide whether parents can give their kids the medicine on school campuses. It would allow the use of marijuana in non-smoking form. Current law prevents marijuana on school campuses, meaning children who use medical cannabis to treat seizures have to go off campus to get their medication. Supporters of the bill say that’s a dangerous and onerous requirement. Opponents worry about allowing the drug on campus and question whether medical marijuana regulations for children are strong enough. If it passes the Senate in a final vote, it will go to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. His predecessor, Jerry Brown, vetoed a similar proposal last year.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A private security guard who officials say accidentally wounded a student during a school shooting that left one teen dead wasn’t supposed to be armed, an online news outlet reports. Emails obtained by The Colorado Sun show the suburban Denver charter school had requested an unarmed guard from BOSS High Level Protection about a year ago. In a statement, STEM School Highlands Ranch said it didn’t know the guard was armed until the shooting occurred May 7 on the campus that includes students from kindergarten through high school. “While it is more common to have armed security personnel at high schools, it is uncommon at elementary schools,” the statement said. “Given the diverse population at our school, we made the decision to request an unarmed guard in an effort to balance these different interests.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nEnfield: The state is changing the way it handles visits between prisoners and their children. The reintegration center at the Willard-Cybulski prison in Enfield is one of five sites in a pilot program called Family Connections, designed to help inmates become better parents both behind bars and once they are released. The inmates are taking parenting classes, and guards are receiving training on how to interact with children to create a more welcoming environment. The prison’s visiting room is undergoing a makeover to allow contact visits and will now include toys and games. On Monday night, the prison hosted a family dance. Prison officials say about 5 million children in the United States have a parent in prison, and research shows fostering better relationships can lower recidivism.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Local law enforcement officers will be conducting checkpoints throughout the state over Labor Day weekend. The DUI checkpoints will be on U.S. 40 in Newark, U.S. 13 in Camden and Del. 24 in Millsboro. Police will be conducting the checkpoints from 10 p.m. Saturday to 2 a.m. Sunday. The effort is part of a national “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” campaign. In addition to the campaign, the Office of Highway Safety is continuing with its highway safety signs program, which aims to display cleverly crafted safety reminders for drivers. According to the Office of Highway Safety, there have been four DUI fatalities in 2019. There have been more than 600 DUI-related crashes and 300 DUI-related injuries this year.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Black golfers are hoping a gift from NBA star Stephen Curry to fund Howard University golf teams will spark a resurgence in the sport at historically black colleges and universities. Curry’s donation to help the prominent Washington school relaunch its men’s and women’s teams is bringing new attention to collegiate black golf. It is also spotlighting the harsh budget constraints that HBCUs face in keeping their programs alive. Black colleges and universities are a crucial pipeline to increasing diversity in golf at a time when few African Americans are playing the sport at the college and professional levels. Craig Bowen, president and founder of the Black College Golf Coaches’ Association, says only about a quarter of the more than 100 HBCUs have golf teams. Howard abandoned its golf program in the 1970s.\n\nFlorida\n\nBartow: A prosecutor says he is dropping criminal charges against an estranged couple known after the wife’s arrest for taking two guns from the husband’s apartment and turning them over to the police. State Attorney Brian Hass said in a case disposition that Courtney and Joseph Irby agreed to participate in a 12-month program that includes anger management classes. Courtney Irby was originally arrested in Bartow for theft and burglary but later charged with trespassing. Joseph Irby faced an aggravated battery charge for hitting his wife’s vehicle with his. The couple is divorcing. Hass says the offer came after prosecutors found Courtney Irby illegally installed a tracking device in her husband’s car. He says contradictions in her testimony have affected her credibility.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Residents near two plants that have emitted toxic gas say they’re furious that the government did not alert the public about a federal report on potential health dangers. Hundreds of people packed two recent town hall meetings in Marietta and Covington, where the two companies use ethylene oxide to sterilize medical devices. The meetings followed news stories about a 2018 report that identified Census tracts near the two businesses where residents could face health risks. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chose not to issue press releases about the study or take other steps to inform the public about it. The EPA did provide Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division with talking points about the report in case someone stumbled upon it on the EPA’s website and asked questions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory officials have started a search for a new site. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports a federal disaster relief bill signed in June has enabled the observatory to begin exploring new properties. The previous observatory in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park overlooking the Kilauea volcano was abandoned due to earthquake damage. The quakes were part of the prolonged eruption of Kilauea, which began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower Puna. The $19.1 billion Big Island relief package includes $49 million for a new observatory, which is part of the U.S. Geological Survey. There is also a $20.1 million appropriation for ongoing operations in a rented, transitional facility in the Hilo Iron Works building and for instrument and equipment replacement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials are increasing logging on state lands by more than 30% and plan to build a seed orchard in northern Idaho to plant trees to replace those cut down. The Idaho Land Board has voted to ramp up harvest on the state’s forests over a four-year span to bring in about $20 million more annually for beneficiaries, mainly public schools. Officials with the Idaho Department of Lands told Gov. Brad Little and other Land Board members that a better method of inventorying the state’s timber holdings found significantly more timber available for cutting. The Lands Department says cutting mature stands will reduce the risk of loss due to disease, insects and wildfires. The board also approved a $165,000 plan by the Lands Department to start a seed orchard near Lewiston to provide western larch and Douglas fir seed.\n\nIllinois\n\nJonesboro: Snake Road is closing to cars so snakes can cross without getting run over. The Southern Illinoisan reports that the road winding through the Shawnee National Forest in southern Illinois will close to vehicles beginning Sunday. The road, more than 2 miles long, will stay closed until late October. And it’s not just snakes: Frogs, turtles, newts and salamanders are also starting to migrate across the road from swamps to limestone bluffs where they’ll spend the winter. Some are endangered, so the Forest Service goes the extra mile to ensure their safety. People can still walk the road while it’s closed to cars but are prohibited from collecting or handling the species. The road will be closed again in March as the animals head back to the swamp.\n\nIndiana\n\nVincennes: A replica of an early Confederate flag has been removed from a flagpole near a Civil War monument after a county official says “misunderstandings” kept it flying. Knox County Commissioners President Kellie Streeter says the commissioners “weren’t fully aware” of the flag’s nature, but it’s been replaced with an Indiana state flag outside the county courthouse in Vincennes. She says “misunderstandings” about its origins kept it flying among seven different flags near the war monument. The Confederate flag isn’t the one most would think of but is instead the Confederacy’s first official flag, which flew for a year starting in early 1861. The Vincennes Sun-Commercial reports that flag features a circle of white stars against a blue background and a white stripe flanked by two red stripes.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: A public radio station that was founded to serve black listeners is seeking help to stay on the air. Officials at Afro-American Community Broadcasting Inc. told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier they need $100,000 quickly to handle overdue payments for the station, KBBG-FM 88.1, and have set a fundraising target of $400,000 over the next year. Community outreach director Edyce Porter says the station is “in dire straits right now.” Her father, Jimmie Porter, founded KBBG in 1977. KBBG officials say the financial crisis stems from equipment failures, lost federal support and declining donations as its older patrons pass away and aren’t replaced by younger listeners. KBBG accountant Candice Lanning says KBBG originally was a station for black people but no longer is just for the black community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A proposed settlement has been reached with inmates whose conversations with attorneys were taped at Leavenworth Detention Center. KCUR reports the agreement calls for the private operator of the prison and the phone provider to pay $1.45 million into a settlement fund for inmates. After payments to attorneys, the money will be distributed to about 539 current and former Leavenworth inmates. The settlement with CoreCivic, which runs the prison, and Securus Technologies, which provided the phone and video services, needs court approval to become final. On Aug. 15, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Kansas City, Kansas, improperly listened to the recorded conversations and willfully violated court orders during an independent investigation. The ruling could affect hundreds of federal convictions and sentences.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A Christian theme park with a 500-foot-long Noah’s Ark is not paying enough in property taxes, according to a county school board. Grant County’s school board filed a lawsuit against the Ark Encounter after losing an administrative appeal. The school board alleges the theme park has been undervalued by county officials. The park in northern Kentucky preaches a literal interpretation of the Bible’s Old Testament. The centerpiece is a massive wooden ark that houses exhibits telling the biblical story of Noah, who built the giant boat to survive the flood. The lawsuit by the school board says the county’s property valuation administrator assessed the park’s worth at $48 million in 2017. The school board argued the Ark Encounter is worth much more, perhaps up to $130 million, meaning it is paying thousands less in property taxes than it should. County schools are funded by property taxes.\n\nLouisiana\n\nSlidell: A basketball-sized grapefruit has brought two world records to a local couple. The giant citrus grew in the yard of Mary Beth and Doug Meyer. The Guinness Book of World Records says it’s the world’s heaviest and largest in circumference. It weighed 7 pounds, 14.6 ounces and measured 28 3/ 4 inches around. That’s almost as big as an NBA basketball. The grapefruit was 13.6 ounces heavier and 1 1/ 4 inches bigger around than the 2006 record, set in Brazil. State Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain presented a Guinness certificate to the couple Tuesday in Baton Rouge. His department provided the equipment for the official weighing and measuring in January.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: U.S. lobster exports to China have fallen off a cliff this year as new retaliatory tariffs shift the seafood business farther north. China, a huge and growing customer for lobster, placed heavy tariffs on U.S. lobsters – and many other food products – in July 2018 amid rising trade hostilities between the Chinese and the Trump administration. Meanwhile, business is booming in Canada, whose fishermen catch the same species of lobster as American lobstermen, who are based mostly in Maine. The loss of business has brought layoffs to some Maine businesses, such as The Lobster Co., of Arundel, where owner Stephanie Nadeau has laid off half the 14 people she once had working in wholesale. “They picked winners, and they picked losers, and they picked me a loser,” Nadeau said. Lobster exports to China have seen a more than 80% drop since last year.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has narrowed the possibilities for a potential new crossing over the Chesapeake Bay to ease traffic congestion to three areas near the current twin spans of the Bay Bridge, state officials announced Tuesday. The Maryland Transportation Authority also announced a fourth option of not building a new bay crossing. Data indicates the three construction proposals are the only ones that sufficiently meet the purpose and need in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The proposals narrow the possibilities from 14 that were first considered. Jim Ports, the executive director of the transportation authority, said while all four proposals are being included for further study, traffic models indicate that building a third crossing near the current bridge “would have the most positive impact on reducing traffic.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gun safety advocates contend further steps are needed in a state acknowledged to already have some of the toughest firearms laws in the country. A legislative committee heard testimony Wednesday on dozens of gun-related bills filed for the current two-year session. The proposals include barring 3D-printed firearms and so-called copycat assault weapons, as well as requiring all gun owners to carry liability insurance. Boston Police Commissioner William Gross told lawmakers that “one homicide is too many,” while arguing for a crackdown on illegal trafficking in firearms. Jim Wallace, executive director of the Gun Owners Action League of Massachusetts, disputed that current state laws – which include an assault weapons ban – have saved lives or made residents safer. Instead, he argued they burden law-abiding gun owners with high costs and onerous regulations.\n\nMichigan\n\nPaw Paw: Officials have reversed course and won’t cover up courthouse paintings that have nude figures and bare-breasted women. WOOD-TV says Van Buren County commissioners heard from people on both sides Tuesday and decided to leave the paintings alone. One painting in a stairwell shows a bare-breasted woman holding a decapitated head and a spear. Another painting above a judge’s bench shows a nude man and nude woman begging a woman for mercy. Breasts are exposed on one woman. One painting could be more than 100 years old. Judge Kathleen Brickley says the paintings are contrary to efforts to “de-escalate trauma rather than revisit trauma.” But Rose Rook spoke to commissioners and asked, “Do we have to shelter everything?” She says there are attempts to get rid of everything that “makes us uncomfortable.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nHanhassen: Prince’s estate will take over management of the late rock star’s studio complex near Minneapolis. Graceland Holdings, which runs Elvis Presley’s tourist attraction in Memphis, Tennessee, had been operating Prince’s Paisley Park in Chanhassen as a museum since October 2016. Prince’s oldest sibling, Sharon Nelson, says the family will manage Paisley Park because the contract expires at the end of September. She says the family is not unhappy with Graceland Holdings or making the decision because of economic reasons. The Star Tribune reports Nelson says there are differences of opinions among the heirs, so the estate’s administrator, Comerica, will be making the final decisions on how to operate the landmark. Prince died at age 57 of an accidental overdose of fentanyl at Paisley Park on April 21, 2016.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Second-term Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves won the Republican nomination for governor, setting up a November general election showdown with Democrat Jim Hood, the state’s four-term attorney general. Reeves defeated retired Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr. in a Republican primary runoff Tuesday. Reeves, 45, spent more than $6 million this year – the most of any candidate in the race, regardless of party. Waller, 67, spent about $1.4 million. Waller is a retired brigadier general in the Mississippi National Guard and son of the late Gov. Bill Waller Sr., a moderate Democrat who served from 1972 to 1976. Hood, 57, had spent about $1.1 million through the end of July. He said Tuesday that Waller ran a “gentlemanly race” and discussed quality-of-life issues. Hood said he hoped some Waller supporters would cross party lines to vote for him in November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJoplin: The Friends of Camp Mintahama group is getting ready to start raising money to purchase a former Girl Scout camp near the city. The Joplin Globe reports the property’s new owner approached the group this year with the chance to purchase about 140 of the camp’s 180 acres for about $1.25 million. The group has started the process of becoming a nonprofit corporation. Members have been attending public events, raising awareness of their upcoming campaign to raise $300,000 for a down payment on the property, which includes a spring-fed lake. A short documentary about the camp is under development and expected to be released next month. The friends group has targeted summer 2020 for its first camp programs for boys, girls and families.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Environmental officials are proposing approval of a major expansion of the state’s largest coal mine after it was recently sold through a bankruptcy auction. Jen Lane with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality said the 72 million ton expansion of the Spring Creek Mine near Decker will occur within the mine’s existing permit boundary. The expansion would extend the life of the mine by four years, to approximately 2031. Spring Creek in 2017 ranked as the 10th-largest coal mine in the United States, producing almost 13 million tons of coal. A bankruptcy judge last week approved the sale of Spring Creek and two Wyoming mines owned by bankrupt Cloud Peak Energy to the Navajo Transitional Energy Company. Company representatives said the sale will help keep the mines open.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Students returning to Mid-Plains Community College campuses will find a new tool to help with their emotional health – and she’s furry. The college has added Shenzi, a black Labrador puppy, as the college’s therapy dog to help those going through a personal tragedy or loss. The college says Shenzi’s work began this month with the return of students for a new fall semester. Shenzi’s handler, Holly Andrews, says the pup is taking over the role that had belonged to Nestle, the college’s therapy dog for the previous five years. Nestle died in January after a battle with cancer. The college has its main campuses in North Platte and McCook and satellite campuses in Broken Bow, Imperial, Ogallala and Valentine. Shenzi will be available to students at all locations at various times.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Clark County School District has gone to court to stop a teacher’s union from carrying out a threatened Sept. 10 strike if negotiators fail to agree on a new contract. The school district filed a court order Monday asking a judge to certify that it’s against state law for members of the Clark County Education Association to walk off the job next month. Teacher strikes are illegal under Nevada law, and if a judge issues an order against any strike, the union can be fined up to $50,000 a day, and striking employees can be punished or fired. The Clark County School District said in a statement Tuesday that the union has agreed to mediation talks, but the strike threat remains. The union says it believes the law making strikes illegal is unconstitutional.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Fish and Game Department is offering advice to hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts as fall hunting season approaches. Sept. 1 is the beginning of fall hunting season, but it’s not just hunters who will be out in the woods enjoying cooler weather, fewer bugs and changing leaves. Fish and Game officials say people should remain aware of their surroundings and know the dates of hunting seasons in their area. They also advise hikers to stick to established trails, wear blaze orange clothing and make some noise – talking, singing or whistling – to make their presence known.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The governor has signed a bill ensuring voters who got mail-in ballots in 2017 and 2018 will get them for future elections unless they opt out. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the measure Wednesday after the Democrat-led Legislature quickly passed the legislation earlier this week. The measure updates a 2018 law that mandated voters who signed up for and got mail-in ballots for the 2016 general election would continue to get those ballots for future elections, unless they opt out. But lawmakers said the law failed to specifically address voters who requested 2017 and 2018 mail-in ballots. The new measure requires that those voters also get mail-in ballots unless they opt out. The bill also sets aside $2 million for counties to implement the law.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State economists on Wednesday revised forecasts upward for government income amid surging oil and natural gas production, giving lawmakers greater leeway as they begin crafting a general fund spending plan for the coming fiscal year. The fiscal forecasts, announced at a legislative committee hearing in the mountain resort community of Red River, hold major financial implications for public school budgets, tax incentives for filmmakers, infrastructure spending, support for Medicaid and an array of state government services. Most of the windfall is linked to steadily growing fossil fuel production focused in the Permian Basin. Economists from three state agencies and the Legislature said state general fund income for the coming fiscal year that begins July 1, 2020, is expected to surpass current annual spending obligations by $907 million, a nearly 13% surplus. Legislators and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are grappling with efforts to expand economic opportunity in a state with the highest rate of poverty in the western U.S. and to improve the quality of public schools.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York softened penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana and created a process for erasing certain past offenses in a state law that went into place Wednesday. The maximum penalty for possessing less than an ounce of pot has been lowered to $50. The legislation also turns an unlawful marijuana possession statute into a violation similar to a traffic ticket, instead of a criminal charge. The criminal statute was responsible for hundreds of thousands of arrests over the past four decades, according to state data. Advocates for marijuana legalization have argued the law is a positive step but falls short of addressing negative consequences that come with keeping the drug illegal. Under the law, they say people can still face immigration consequences and probation violations for basic marijuana possession.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s Transportation Department is looking for volunteers to remove trash along roads during the Adopt-A-Highway Fall Litter Sweep next month. Each April and September, NCDOT asks volunteers to help remove litter from the sides of roads. Volunteers from local businesses, schools, nonprofits, churches and community groups often participate. In addition, NCDOT maintenance crews devote one week of their time during Litter Sweep to pick up trash and collect the bags that the volunteers have filled with trash. This year’s fall Litter Sweep will be held Sept. 14-28. The department provides cleanup supplies, including trash bags, gloves and safety vests.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agricultural officials say there’s help available for the millions of dollars in crop damage caused by blackbirds each year. Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring says the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services program loans nonlethal management equipment to farmers to help disperse blackbirds that attack sunflower and grain crops. The USDA says of eight states with significant sunflower acreage that were surveyed, North Dakota ranked first in bird damage to confectionery and oilseed sunflowers. The study found the eight states lose a total of $29.5 million annually from bird damage to sunflowers.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A state tourism bureau says a record-breaking 19.2 million people visited Greater Cleveland in 2018. Regional tourism bureau Destination Cleveland says the visitor numbers were up 3.9% from the previous year. The bureau says that rate of increase outpaced the rest of Ohio and the nation. The bureau defines a visitor as someone who travels at least 50 miles from home outside of a normal routine. The Plain Dealer reports Cleveland visitors in 2018 accounted for nearly $6.2 billion in spending, up 6.2% from 2017. The bureau says spending is likely up because of an uptick in people staying the night. Destination Cleveland president David Gilbert says he’s impressed with the numbers and hopeful the bureau will reach its goal of 20 million visitors in 2020.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Second Amendment Association is challenging efforts that would put on hold a new permitless carry law until voters weigh in on the issue. The law passed earlier this year will allow residents to openly carry guns without a background check or training. It takes effect Nov. 1, but efforts are underway for a statewide referendum on the measure. The Oklahoman reports the association filed a legal challenge Monday to the wording of the referendum petition, calling it inaccurate and misleading. Second Amendment Association President Don Spencer called the statewide vote a waste of time. “Citizens of the state of Oklahoma have been waiting on this for over 112 years and it’s time for them to get their rights back,” he said. The measure’s backers have until 5 p.m. Thursday to collect nearly 60,000 signatures to get the measure on the 2020 ballot.\n\nOregon\n\nCascade Locks: One of the most popular hikes in the Columbia River Gorge has reopened almost two years after it was damaged by the Eagle Creek Fire. The Wahclella Falls Trail, near Cascade Locks and east of Multnomah Falls, features a 2.4-mile out-and-back hike through a slot canyon to a powerful waterfall. The main part of the trail has been cleared and stabilized, but the upper section remains closed because of a damaged bridge and washouts. The U.S. Forest Service says people should respect closure signs and stay out of areas that remain closed for their safety. The trail was one of those hit hardest by the Eagle Creek Fire, which ignited Sept. 2, 2017, after a teenager tossed a firework off nearby Eagle Creek Trail.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State prison officials are planning to close another prison, as the inmate population continues to decline and prison costs rise. State Sen. John Yudichak said Wednesday that prison officials had just briefed him and Retreat state prison staff in northeastern Pennsylvania about its plans to close it. Gov. Tom Wolf’s office isn’t commenting. Retreat has about 400 employees and is at full capacity with almost 1,100 inmates. Pennsylvania’s state prison population is about 48,000, after reaching nearly 52,000 in 2012. Retreat is about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre. Wolf’s administration closed a state prison in Pittsburgh in 2017. Retreat’s original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state approved tax credits Monday to lure a third major offshore wind company to the state as part of an effort to become a hub for the industry. The first U.S. offshore wind farm began operating off Block Island, Rhode Island, in late 2016, and Gov. Gina Raimondo wants the industry to grow in the state. The Rhode Island Commerce Corp. approved nearly $900,000 in tax credits over 10 years for Boston Energy, which plans to open its U.S. headquarters in Providence. The British company must maintain at least 52 full-time jobs in the state for at least 12 years. Raimondo said Tuesday that the development is “further proof that we’re well-positioned to be the hub for this growing industry.” She announced in June that another British wind turbine maintenance company, GEV Wind Power, will locate its U.S. headquarters in Rhode Island and create about 125 jobs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: The island’s leaders are one step closer to banning long shovels and large holes in the sand to protect sea turtles and beachgoers. The Island Packet reports Hilton Head Island public planning committee members voted unanimously last week for the ordinance. The full council will vote on it Sept. 17. The proposal would ban shovels longer than 14 inches. It would also ban holes larger than 12 inches deep and 12 inches wide. A volunteer group called The Hilton Head Island Turtle Trackers says young turtles can get trapped in large holes after they hatch in dunes and head toward the sea. Beaufort County sheriff’s deputies would be able to ticket anyone who broke the rules. The volunteer group says enforcement could be difficult.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Federal regulators are holding a hearing on a uranium mine proposal that could help resolve a long-running dispute over the potential impact on places of Native American cultural, historical and religious significance. The Oglala Sioux Tribe argues federal regulators haven’t done enough to study the potential effects of the mine near Edgemont on Native American burials, artifacts and other cultural sites within the project’s boundaries. The Rapid City Journal says the hearing before the federal Atomic Safety and Licensing Board in Rapid City that began Wednesday could last through Friday. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission contends regulators have done everything within their power to study the potential impacts on tribal cultural resources. The company proposing the mine, Powertech, agrees.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A prominent member of the sanitation workers union whose historic strike drew the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the city where he was assassinated has died, close friends said Tuesday. Baxter Leach was 79. Gail Tyree, executive director of the Memphis Local 1733 chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said Leach’s daughter gave her the news of her father’s passing. Leach had been battling cancer, said his friend Calvin Taylor. Leach helped organize the 1968 strike that saw 1,300 sanitation workers walk out of their jobs and march on Memphis streets with demands of higher wages and better working conditions. They mobilized after two colleagues were killed by a malfunctioning garbage truck. Leach and other surviving sanitation workers received the National Civil Rights Museum’s Freedom Award last year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey will join the University of Texas as a professor this fall, teaching in the university’s Department of Radio-Television-Film. McConaughey has been a visiting instructor at the flagship campus in Austin since 2015, and the university said in a statement Wednesday that the appointment recognizes his “outstanding work as a teacher and mentor.” He will continue teaching a Script to Screen film production class for which he developed the course curriculum. The university says McConaughey is respected for his “willingness to work with students beyond the classroom.” McConaughey earned a film degree from the school in 1993. He’s appeared in more than 50 films, including “Dazed and Confused,” “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Dallas Buyers Club,” for which he won an Oscar and Golden Globe for his leading role.\n\nUtah\n\nEden: A proposed heliport at a ski resort is raising concerns about environmental impact and other issues. The Standard-Examiner reports SMHG Village Development has applied for a conditional use permit to operate a heliport at Powder Mountain. The facility would house a helicopter to haul skiers, mountain bikers and anglers to remote areas of the resort 59 miles north of Salt Lake City. The heliport would be operated by partner firm Whisper Ridge. One resident says the proximity of helicopters to the Middle Fork Wildlife Management Area south of Powder Mountain could disturb wildlife. Another cited risks posed by hauling helicopter fuel on the area’s narrow roads. The Ogden Valley Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the permit request next week.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Officers from the University of Vermont police department are investigating what they describe as “bias-motivated vandalism” on campus. Police say they received a report Tuesday of vandalism to a sign at the Davis Center off Main Street. Responding officers found locations where a person or people affixed stickers and posters with statements such as “Keep America American” and “Better Dead Than Red.” The name “Patriot Front” was on the bottom of the stickers. UVM police cited Burlington police who said earlier this year that the Patriot Front is a group “that espouses white supremacist views.” The group’s members have recently been associated with placing banners on bridges, buildings and overpasses in several states.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Three months after a city employee killed 12 people in a mass shooting, the city’s executive resigned Wednesday following criticism from victims’ family members and others about his response to the rampage. In his resignation letter, City Manager Dave Hansen urged employees to work together without “pointing fingers.” “Our most recent tragedy will take all our energy, strength and patience so we can walk the long path of recovery ahead,” he said. Hansen worked for the city for 13 years, including more than three years as city manager, overseeing day-to-day operations of the city. Criticism of his leadership style has been long running, but the May 31 shooting and the city’s response brought heightened scrutiny. Family members of some of the victims have said he has not been responsive to their requests for information or treated them well.\n\nWashington\n\nRidgefield: Work is underway to improve pedestrian access to a unit of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge. The Columbian reports work began this summer on the project, estimated to cost $3 million to $5 million, which will create dedicated pedestrian and bicycle access to the refuge from existing sidewalks near Ridgefield city limits. The Federal Highway Administration will contribute about $3.1 million. The city, county and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Pacific Region also are contributing. Previously, pedestrians walked along a road in a ditch to reach the Carty Unit. Port of Ridgefield CEO Brent Grening says that was dangerous. The new walkway is expected to be finished by Oct. 3. Culvert improvements are also planned to help prevent water from backing up on sections of the road.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Secretary of State Mac Warner says his office hopes there are at least 100 voter registration drives next month during National Voter Registration Month. Warner said in a news release that everyone should check their voter registration and make sure their voter information is correct. Any group interested in hosting a voter registration drive can submit a form to the secretary of state’s office. The National Voter Registration Day project provides access to promotional support and materials including an organizer’s toolkit, posters and social media graphics.\n\nWisconsin\n\nPark Falls: More accurate weather forecasts could depend on each blade of grass, leaf and pine needle in a small, dense area in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers and students are trying to figure out how trees and other vegetation affect the atmosphere and influence weather. That means examining how plants suck up and release moisture and carbon dioxide and how that changes as the seasons evolve. The data collection involves numerous instruments on towers of varying heights, lasers, drones, weather balloons and low-flying aircraft. Ankur Desai, UW professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, dreamed up the project five years ago and has dubbed it Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 – CHEESEHEAD19.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has set new minimum score requirements on college entrance exams for students to be admitted. The Laramie Boomerang reports university trustees voted this month to make changes to admissions requirements. For high school graduates with GPAs of 2.5 to 2.99, the university will require a minimum score of 17 out of 36 on the ACT or a score of at least 900 out of 1600 on the SAT. The university previously did not require the tests for students in this group. The university says it has admitted about 20 freshmen in the group annually, but only about half continue past their first year. For students with lower GPAs, the university still requires a 20 on the ACT or a 1020 on the SAT.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/29"}]}

Tom Carper, a patriarch of modern Delaware politics, will retire next year, ending a career as one of the most successful politicians in state history.\n\nHis announcement Monday at the Wilmington Riverfront will undoubtedly shake up the state, with now an open U.S. Senate seat in 2024.\n\n\"While nothing is forever, the Delaware Democratic Party is blessed today with a bench as strong as any I’ve ever seen in the 50 years that I’ve called Delaware home,\" Carper said in a prepared speech. \"If there was ever an opportune time to step aside and pass the torch to the next generation, it’s coming, and it will be here on January 3, 2025.\n\n\"But, until then, God willing, I’ll continue working 60-hour weeks and coming home on the train most nights as long as Martha keeps leaving the light on for me.\"\n\nCarper has been in statewide public office since 1977, serving as Delaware treasurer, congressman, governor and senator. He helped establish Delaware Democrats’ now longstanding ideology of socially liberal but center on economic and fiscal issues.\n\nAnd he has been one of the most prominent representations of “The Delaware Way\" − a less adversarial approach to politics that prioritizes building consensus. Yet critics have also derided this mentality for its behind-the-scenes politicking.\n\nThroughout the decades, he remained popular with Delaware voters. In 2018, he faced his most challenging primary in years when he faced then-newcomer Kerri Evelyn Harris, who is now a state representative in the Delaware General Assembly.\n\nCarper defeated her by a 30-point margin, ultimately capturing 60% of the vote in the general election.\n\nBefore running for reelection in 2018, Carper said at the time that he considered retiring. But that changed with former President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.\n\nIt’s hard to find an elected Delaware official, and their respective deputy, who has not campaigned, interned or worked for the politician. Known as “Carper Town,” there’s an intricate web of connections, careers and marriages that can be traced back to the senior senator.\n\nFor years, many have viewed Delaware’s lone congresswoman Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester as the heir apparent to Carper’s seat. Delaware has never elected a woman or person of color to the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut Gov. John Carney, whose career trajectory has been very similar to Carper’s, is in his final term as governor. He has not indicated what his future plans will be.\n\nTom Carper’s political history\n\nCarper, born in West Virginia and raised in Virginia, first came to Delaware in 1973 as an M.B.A. student at the University of Delaware. He had served as a naval flight officer in the Vietnam War, making Carper the only remaining Vietnam veteran in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThree years later, at age 29, he was elected as Delaware’s state treasurer. The Delaware Democratic Party was in the midst of transformation, in part from Joe Biden’s shocking upset against Caleb Boggs in the 1972 U.S. Senate race.\n\nThe two have been friends for decades. Carper noted in his speech that it was Biden, who calls him Tommy, who encouraged him to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nCarper served as Delaware’s sole congressman for a decade, then as Delaware governor for two terms before running for U.S. Senate in 2000. One of Carper’s signature achievements as governor was his role in the development of the Wilmington Riverfront, where he made his announcement Monday.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, Carper has been vocal on climate change, serving as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. He has also led the quest to make Washington, D.C. the country’s 51st state.\n\nCarper, in his speech, spoke of his efforts to \"help center and clean up the Democratic Party,\" which \"have borne great fruit.\" Democrats control every statewide seat in Delaware.\n\nIs age a factor in Carper's retirement?\n\nCarper, at age 76, is not considered to be one of the older U.S. senators. The reelection bid of 80-year-old Biden and the health decline of 89-year-old U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, has put renewed scrutiny on the age and well-being of U.S. politicians.\n\nMaryland U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, 79, recently announced his retirement earlier this month, citing his age as one of the factors in his decision.\n\nFor about a decade now, Carper has fiercely pushed back on questions of his health, primarily lobbed by opponents. When asked about his health during a campaign event in 2012, Carper responded by doing more than 30 push-ups on a folding table as supporters cheered.\n\nCarper, in his speech, did not cite a specific reason for retirement.\n\n\"As last year came to a close and the new one began,\" he said in his speech, \"Martha and I began to focus on what I should do next - run for a fifth term in the Senate which - if I won - would be a record 15 statewide elections or ride off into the sunset and call it a day.\"\n\n\"After a good deal of prayer and introspection, and more than a few heart-to-heart conversations, we've decided I should do neither but, rather, run through the tape over the next 20 months...\"\n\nWhat Carper is known for\n\nThe senator is also known for his quirks. He famously drove a 2001 Chrysler Town & Country minivan , called the “Silver Bullet,” for two decades, racking up close to 600,000 miles.\n\nIn his final 20 months in office, Carper said he plans to help implement the significant climate provisions he helped write that passed in the infrastructure and inflation laws recently passed by Congress.\n\nHe called representing Delaware in public office as the “great privilege” of his life.\n\n“I’ve never felt the gratitude and affection of so many Delawareans as I feel today when traveling through our Small Wonder,\" he said in his speech. \"It is palpable, it is a source of joy, and it is deeply, deeply appreciated.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/17/us-sen-tom-carper-aims-to-leave-a-delaware-legacy-still-at-work/74964288007/", "title": "Sen.

But this late-July morning, he was distracted.\n\nThe 77-year-old kept looking up from work to discuss his life, to share stories of his service in the U.S. Navy. He’d ask questions of his own, too – including if this was a good place to stop, after a long tale about returning to Asia, as now the last Vietnam veteran in the Senate.

Tom Carper for his past votes on U.S. Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe ads are being paid for by the Working Families Party, a New York-based coalition of unions and activists that Thursday will announce its endorsement of Carper's primary opponent Kerri Harris – an insurgent progressive and political newcomer from Dover.\n\n\"In the Donald Trump era, we need someone voters can trust to be a reliable and progressive fighter for working- and middle-class families,\" said Joe Dinkin, the party's national campaigns director. \"We think Kerri is someone who has been an inspiration and aggressive activist on all the things we believe in.\"\n\nThe minor party's support is just the latest example of how progressives both in and outside of the Democratic Party are taking Harris' longshot bid seriously and helping to drum up national attention for her campaign.\n\nBut it is one of the first instances in which Harris' rising star power will be visible to large swaths of Democratic voters here in Delaware.\n\nThe Facebook ads the group plans to run starting Thursday seek to convince likely Democratic voters that Carper has been weak on blocking Republican nominees to the high court.\n\nIt's a strategy meant to play on the immediate concerns those voters might have over President Donald Trump's nomination of conservative Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the seat of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nTo block Kavanaugh's confirmation, Democrats will need every one of their senators to vote no and get some help from at least two Republicans.\n\nCarper has called Kavanaugh's record \"extreme\" and \"deeply concerning.\" On Wednesday he made it clear he would not back his confirmation.\n\n\"If I had known 12 years ago how Judge Kavanaugh would have ruled on any number of issues, including health care and the environment, I never would have voted for him in 2006,\" he said in an email sent by his campaign. \"I have no intention of voting for him now.\"\n\nYet Carper is the only Democrat still in the Senate who voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia – a fact Harris' supporters are quick to point out.\n\nHe also has come under criticism for voting to confirm Bush nominee Chief Justice John Roberts in 2015 and voting against a filibuster on the 2006 confirmation of Bush nominee Justice Samuel Alito.\n\nHe later voted against Alito taking the bench and last year voted against confirming Trump nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nLittle of that nuance is contained in the Working Family Party's Facebook ads.\n\n\"A conservative Supreme Court majority threatens reproductive choice and LGBTQ rights, and could give corporations even more power in our Democracy,\" one version reads. \"Tom Carper voted for John Roberts, failed to block Sam Alito and empowered the Trump Majority. This September, we deserve progressive Democrat Kerri Harris.\"\n\nThe ads also carry taglines such as \"Tom Carper caved on the court\" and \"Tom Carper created the Roberts Court.\"\n\nHarris on Wednesday said she had not seen the ads but welcomed scrutiny of Carper's voting record.\n\n\"I think it's something that needs to be called out,\" she said. \"But if, in my opinion, if they are disrespectful or not hinging on the facts, I would make sure to call that to someone's attention.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether attacking Carper's votes on Supreme Court nominees will have an impact among Democratic primary voters.\n\nPrevious attempts to go negative against the three-term senator have ended in failure, including far more personal stabs at his military record and a well-documented domestic violence incident involving his first wife in the early 1980s.\n\nCarper has never lost an election in his 40-year political career, including stints as state treasurer, Delaware's lone U.S. congressman, governor and now its senior U.S. senator.\n\nThat does not mean he is unstoppable, however.\n\nCarper in January turned 71 – the same age as former governor and congressman Michael Castle when he lost the 2010 Republican primary for U.S. Senate to tea party favorite Christine O'Donnell.\n\nHis primary opponent also is rapidly gaining notoriety among a national progressive movement that has proven formidable in the early 2018 election cycle.\n\nLast month, for instance, Harris got a shoutout tweet from fellow progressive political newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, just days after the Democratic socialist upset 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in New York.\n\nShe further earned credibility among progressives when she and nearly 600 other women were arrested in Washington, D.C., two weeks ago while protesting the federal government's family separation policy and calling for the abolishment of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nIn recent weeks, Harris has recorded a sizable bump in campaign contributions, volunteers from out-of-state and media reports lumping her in with other progressive outsiders looking to oust incumbents.\n\nMany of those candidates have already proven successful thanks to support from the Working Families Party. The group, for instance, was active in recent primaries and general elections won by Maryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner.\n\nDinkin declined to say how much money the party is investing in its ad buy for Harris but insisted the group will remain active in Delaware's U.S. Senate race at through the primary.\n\n\"We're at a moment in which surprising results are possible,\" he said. \"We think Kerri is kind of candidate our members can get excited about, and we're going to work really hard to get her elected.\"\n\nCarper's campaign noted he also has received endorsements this year, including support from unions such as the Delaware AFL-CIO and the state educators union, along with political action committees for National Resources Defense Council, Planned Parenthood and LGBTQ rights in Delaware.\n\nThe Delaware Democratic Party also endorsed Carper late Wednesday, making him the only candidate in a contested primary to receive the blessing of the state executive committee.\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nMORE POLITICAL NEWS:\n\nEarly voting, election day registration approved by Delaware House\n\nDelaware Senate candidate owes $50K to feds, $10K to state\n\nMass incarceration, judicial racial disparities dominate Democrat's campaign for attorney general", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/21/lisa-blunt-rochester-delaware-senate-race-2024-elections-tom-carper/70329181007/", "title": "Lisa Blunt Rochester bidding for Tom Carper's Senate seat for ...", "text": "U.S. Rep.

He has made few appearances and said little publicly about his health since receiving treatment in August at a Texas cancer center. He responded to intense criticism about his office's prosecution of a child rapist from a prominent Delaware family who received probation over prison time by issuing a written statement and declining media interviews.\n\nLast Thursday, on one of the most significant days of his political career, he described the end of a chapter in his public service in an email.\n\n\"The Office of Attorney General is a four-year commitment,\" Biden said. \"Its responsibilities are too significant, and the voters' trust too important not to give it my complete and undivided attention. It should not be, nor can it become, a two-year staging ground for another elected office.\"\n\nBiden's approach to public office in 2014 is surprising to many.\n\n\"In this day and age, for a modern political figure to not open themselves up for scrutiny, accountability, is unprecedented,\" said John Flaherty, president of the Delaware Coalition for Open Government, and a former Delaware-based aide to then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, the attorney general's father. \"It's perplexing.\"\n\nIt's also a reminder that for Beau Biden, who is arguably the state's most popular politician, the normal rules don't apply.\n\nMolly Magarik, Biden's political director, said his health did not impact his decision not to seek re-election as attorney general. Biden, 45, underwent surgery in August to remove what his doctor called a \"small lesion\" from his brain. He also suffered what was described as a \"mild stroke\" in 2010, causing him to miss several weeks of work. His Texas doctors said in a February statement that Biden received \"a clean bill of health\" about three months earlier.\n\nBut his surprise announcement, and his unwillingness to answer questions publicly, has only fueled speculation that Biden's health remains an issue and a threat to his political career. It was an unusual declaration, that he would not continue in public service so he could seek public service two years later.\n\n\"If you're not standing up to the total media review of your situation, you always run the risk that people are going to say there's a health problem,\" said former Delaware Gov. and U.S. Rep. Mike Castle, a Republican, who held a walking news conference in Rockford Park after suffering a stroke ahead of his 2006 election.\n\n\"Most people have a normal curiosity as to exactly what the problem was and what the treatments were. And then the doctors saying he is OK would be the icing on the cake. As it is, it just has people raising the question.\"\n\nHealth questions\n\nRepublicans, and a few Democrats, have raised the issue of Biden's health repeatedly since his announcement that he was not running for office this year, despite having hired a campaign staff and raising $1.2 million.\n\nCharlie Copeland, chairman of the Delaware GOP, said his party \"has disagreed with the attorney general on many occasions, but he deserves our gratitude for his service to the state. We hope that his health improves.\"\n\nSen. Greg Lavelle, a Sharpley Republican who is among those mentioned as potential candidates for governor in 2016, said \"it's clear to me [Biden's health] is playing a role in any decision he makes.\n\n\"That's an analysis of a political run that I've never heard before,\" Lavelle said. \"He raised a million and a half dollars to run for attorney general not to run for attorney general?\"\n\nFlaherty said Biden should be more open to questioning to avoid speculation about this health.\n\n\"He's allowing a lot of questions to surface, a lot of rumors to go rampant,\" Flaherty said. \"I think he needs to start saying, 'I was sick last year. I've been sick before. Other people have been sick in the past.'\"\n\nBiden's silence \"is not stopping any of us from talking,\" Flaherty said.\n\nState House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf criticized those still questioning Biden's health. He said the statement in February from his doctor should have quelled speculation.\n\n\"He's working. He's out there. He's just not out there doing press conferences,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"It's almost like Obama, where he gives them a birth certificate and they still want to see his birth certificate.\"\n\nKathleen Jennings, who works for Biden as the state prosecutor, said she learned about his intention to skip this year's attorney general's race before the announcement, but was surprised by his decision. She would not comment on whether she advised Biden one way or another, adding that the way he announced his decision, in an email without public comment, was in character.\n\n\"I don't think you can glean anything from the announcement ... other than Beau is a careful guy,\" Jennings said. \"I work with him on a daily basis, I see him all the time. I know that he carefully weighs decisions before they're made. This was an example of that. I'm sure he gave it a lot of thought.\"\n\nStill popular\n\nThe truth is, Biden isn't a typical politician seeking office in Delaware.\n\nIn September, a University of Delaware poll identified him as the state's most popular, and recognizable, politician. Of the 902 adults who participated, 64.2 percent viewed Biden favorably, versus just 16.9 percent who had unfavorable views and 7.1 percent who had never heard of the attorney general.\n\nBiden topped long-serving politicians like U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, who hasn't lost a race in a career that dates back to 1976, in popularity and name recognition.\n\n\"Those numbers are very good,\" University of Delaware political science professor Paul Brewer said at the time. \"He's up there with [Gov. Jack] Markell and Carper who have been around a long time and have won a lot of elections. I think that reflects the strength and popularity of Beau Biden in the state.\"\n\nDelaware election law now allows Biden to move money raised for the attorney general campaign into a new campaign account for the 2016 governor's race. He had about $902,000 on hand last year, plus about $44,000 in his political action committee, Beau PAC.\n\n\"To not, at a minimum, contact donors that have given to the attorney general's race and offer to refund their money simply doesn't smell right,\" said John Fluharty, executive director of the Delaware GOP. \"These people gave under the pretense that they were giving to the attorney general's race.\"\n\nTradition broken\n\nBut by not seeking election to a third term – his victory all but assured, with no opponents filed – Biden also is abandoning a tradition of politicians using their platform in public office to pursue a higher post.\n\nHolding office while running for another \"gives you a profile, an ability to shape an agenda that you wouldn't normally have. He does give that up,\" said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.\n\n\"On the positive side, he doesn't have to be accused of running for an office that he doesn't intend to keep.\"\n\nMarkell won election to the governor's office in 2008 midway through his third term as state treasurer, also using funds raised during his 2006 treasurer campaign to bolster his war chest for the governor's race. Joe Biden campaigned for the U.S. Senate and vice president simultaneously in 2008.\n\nCriticism that officials misuse their current office to seek a higher post \"typically doesn't go anywhere,\" Madonna said.\n\nBiden's supporters say his decision to not use his post as attorney general as a launch pad into the governor's office is one that everyone should support.\n\n\"I know everybody does it and there's a wink and a nod, but he just couldn't run for re-election as AG if, in his heart, he knew there was a very good chance he would not finish the four years,\" said former U.S. Sen. Ted Kaufman, who earlier served as a top aide to Joe Biden in the U.S. Senate and was appointed to assume Biden's seat when he was elected vice president.\n\nOthers expressed a similar sentiment.\n\n\"How many people in public office do this? Everybody asks people in public office to be transparent. Beau is transparent,\" said Bart Dalton, a Wilmington lawyer and former chief deputy attorney general. \"If you've worked in the Attorney General's office, you can't be in two minds in that office. You have to be of one mind.\"\n\nMagarik, Biden's political director, offered a glimpse Friday about what Biden considers as his legacy from his eight years as attorney general. Magarik highlighted Biden's creation of a Child Predator Task Force to prosecute crimes against children, a task force that has led to 180 convictions for dealing in child pornography and other sex crimes. Biden also successfully pushed for anti-bullying measures, and stricter sentences for possessing and dealing in child pornography.\n\nAs attorney general, Biden has secured millions in bank settlements, and sued the ratings agency S&P and the mortgage registry MERS for their roles in the mortgage crisis, using money to help assist homeowners, she said.\n\nThrough Magarik, Biden declined to be interviewed. \"He'll talk about running for governor, about the challenges and opportunities ahead for our state at the appropriate time,\" Magarik said.\n\nNew candidates emerge\n\nBiden's decision has had one immediate impact: a reshuffling of the state's political landscape.\n\nSome well-known public officials are openly discussing their interest in seeking the attorney general's office.\n\nLt. Gov. Matt Denn says Biden's announcement last week has led him to consider an attorney general campaign, which, if he won, would require him to leave the lieutenant governor's office two years early.\n\nAlso in the mix for attorney general is Jennings, the state prosecutor.\n\n\"I've been approached by several people, both inside and outside law enforcement, in the wake of this decision urging me to run. There is really no doubt that my lifelong vocation has been criminal justice,\" Jennings said.\n\n\"I care deeply for the mission of the Attorney General's office and the people who work there every day. For all of those reasons, I am carefully considering my options,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans are pursuing former U.S. Attorney Colm Connolly, who declined to comment when reached Friday. Ferris Wharton, the former federal prosecutor now working as a public defender who lost to Biden in 2006, also has been considered a potential Republican candidate.\n\nBut Wharton, who also is said to be seeking a Superior Court judgeship, said he had no interest in the race.\n\n\"That is a huge commitment in both time and money,\" Wharton said. \"Frankly, I've been busy with other things.\"\n\nWharton, who worked as chief deputy under Attorney General M. Jane Brady, lost by five percentage points to Biden in the 2006 election.He, like many others, was \"surprised\" by Biden's announcement.\n\n\"It's not your typical way of doing it,\" Wharton said. \"Historically, most people like to have some places to fall back on if they're not successful. His approach here is different and that's part of what the surprise is.\"\n\nBiden's interest in the governor's race could have a \"chilling effect\" on Republicans and Democrats who might have had gubernatorial ambitions, Castle said. That's because of the popularity of the Biden name, and his high-profile ability to raise campaign money.\n\n\"People have been watching for him to make a move and this is it,\" said Rhett Ruggerio, a Dover lobbyist who hosted a fundraiser for Biden in Lewes in August. \"I really think it just comes down to, who in the Democratic Party is going to primary him? There's nobody who is going to step up to that challenge. They would have serious difficulty in every facet of the game.\"\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/07/31/2024-senate-elections-seats-up-for-reelection/70321610007/", "title": "What senators are up for reelection in 2024?

Ten are Republicans, three are Independents, and 20 are Democrats.\n\nThe upper chamber, which is now controlled narrowly by Democrats, could flip red if the GOP performs well in November. The map is considered to favor Republicans slightly this election cycle, though electoral predictions will continue to evolve, and surprises on the campaign trail are always possible.\n\nCome decision day 2024, these are the states that will see contests for senator, and who currently represents them.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhich senators are up for reelection in 2024?\n\nArizona\n\nKyrsten Sinema\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSinema, once a Democrat, is known for her eccentric fashion choices and her centrist views, which have regularly held up the Democratic policy agenda. Sinema left the Democratic Party in December 2022 over concerns of \"rigid partisanship.\"\n\nSinema will not run for reelection, citing increased polarization in the Senate. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D.-Ariz., is the leading Democratic candidate to fill Sinema's seat. Kari Lake, a former news anchor and 2022 gubernatorial candidate, is the leading Republican choice.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDianne Feinstein\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAfter winning California's \"jungle primary,\" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey will be on the ballot in November to fill the seat of the late Feinstein, who died in September 2023. The Super Tuesday ballot featured Schiff, Garvey and two other Democratic House lawmakers: Reps. Barbara Lee and Katie Porter.\n\nSome feel Schiff is to thank in part for Garvey's second-place finish – he spent millions of dollars on ads boosting Garvey in the lead-up to the primary. The race for the liberal state's Senate seat is all but secured for Schiff as Californians haven't voted in a Republican Senator since 1988.\n\nConnecticut\n\nChris Murphy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMurphy has served as the senator from Connecticut since 2013 and is expected to cruise to reelection in 2024 in predominantly blue Connecticut.

Scott is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was tasked as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee with securing a victory for the party in the midterms. Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging Scott.\n\nHawaii\n\nMazie Hirono\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHirono, running for reelection in 2024, was the first Asian American woman to be elected a U.S. senator. She first won her seat in 2012 and has spent much of her tenure in the chamber working on legislation addressing immigration, the environment and veterans affairs.\n\nIndiana\n\nMike Braun\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBraun, who won his Senate seat in 2018, is opting to run for governor in his state rather than seek a second term. The race to replace Braun includes Republican Rep. Jim Banks and former Democratic State Rep. Marc Carmichael.\n\nMaine\n\nAngus King\n\nParty: Independent\n\nKing is running for reelection in 2024. One of just three independents in the Senate, he has held the seat since 2013.\n\nMaryland\n\nBen Cardin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCardin, who has been in office since 2007, announced in May he would not seek reelection. Since the announcement, a slew of candidates have indicated they plan to run in the Democratic primary in Maryland, including Rep. David Trone and Angela Alsobrooks, the county executive of Prince George's County. Former Gov. Larry Hogan will run on the Republican side.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nOne-time presidential hopeful and Senate veteran Elizabeth Warren is running to keep her seat in 2024. She has served as senator for ten years.\n\nMichigan\n\nDebbie Stabenow\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nStabenow, who has been in the Senate since 2001, announced plans to retire in early January, opening up a seat in a critical battleground state. In the Democratic primary to replace her, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is widely considered the frontrunner, though businessman Nasser Beydoun and actor Hill Harper have also declared candidacies. On the Republican side, many are tossing their hats into the ring. Republican candidates include former Reps. Justin Amash, Peter Meijer and Mike Rogers, businessmen Michael Hoover, Glenn Wilson, J.D. Wilson and Sandy Pensler, State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder, physician and pastor Sherry O'Donnell, physician Bensson Samuel, educator Sharon Savage and attorney Alexandria Taylor.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKlobuchar, who rose to national fame during her 2020 bid for the presidency, has been a Minnesota senator since 2007 and is the first woman to be elected by the state to the Senate. She is running for reelection.\n\nMississippi\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nParty: Republican\n\nWicker has been the state's senator since 2007 and will run again in 2024. He serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nMissouri\n\nJosh Hawley\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFamous in part for holding up a fist in support of rioters outside the capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Hawley forms part of a growing conservative flank of the GOP. He will run for reelection in 2024.\n\nMontana\n\nJon Tester\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nA Democrat in a deeply red state, Tester has held his Senate seat since 2007. He is expected to face a tough challenge from the right in 2024 as Republicans battle to regain a majority in the U.S. Senate. After U.S. Rep. Matthew M. Rosendale dropped out, Tester's likely opponent is GOP nominee Tim Sheehy, a businessman and veteran with a Trump endorsement.\n\nNebraska\n\nDeb Fischer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFischer has represented Nebraska in the Senate since the 2012 midterms and is seeking reelection.\n\nNevada\n\nJacky Rosen\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nRosen, who has already announced her reelection bid for 2024, has held her seat since 2019. Nevada is a fiercely divided state and forms part of a challenging electoral map for Democrats. Army veteran Sam Brown is challenging Rosen in what may be a tight race, based on recent polls.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRobert Menendez\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMenendez has held his Senate seat since 2006. He has not ruled out running for reelection but faces harsh criticism from his own party after he was charged with accepting bribes and obstructing justice. Other Democratic candidates include New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMartin Heinrich\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHeinrich, who has held his seat since 2013, will run again in 2024. He launched his campaign for a third term with a video touching on gun safety and the importance of a transition to clean energy.\n\nNew York\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nGillibrand has become a mainstay of New York politics, holding her Senate seat since 2009. She is running for reelection. New York Republicans have tapped Mike Sapraicone, a private security executive, to run against Gillibrand.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nKevin Cramer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCramer, who won his seat in 2018, will seek reelection this year. Cramer was a close ally of Trump during the former president's term in office, but has since voiced support for a possible replacement on the 2024 GOP ticket. Katrina Christiansen, an assistant engineering professor at the University of Jamestown, is vying for the seat from the Democratic side.\n\nOhio\n\nSherrod Brown\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBrown, who first won in 2006, is a prominent target for Republicans in 2024. He occupies a swing state seat they see as a possible pick-up in their quest to regain control of the chamber. Republican state Sen. Matt Dolan is running along with businessman Bernie Moreno and GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBob Casey\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCasey was first elected in 2006. Though he represents a swing state identified by Republicans as an ideal win in 2024, he is considered a tough candidate to beat. The son of former Gov. Robert Casey, Sr. he is widely popular in the state, especially with swaths of voters other Democrats have begun to struggle with attracting. Former business executive David McCormick is challenging Casey.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSheldon Whitehouse\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nWhitehouse, who has been in the Senate for a little under a decade, is running for a fourth term. He will face a challenge on the right from Raymond McKay, a veteran and the former president of the Rhode Island Republican Assembly, and Republican State Rep. Patricia Morgan.\n\nTennessee\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\nParty: Republican\n\nElected in 2018, Blackburn has become a prominent voice among conservatives, particularly on culture war issues. She has announced plans to seek reelection, but will face a prominent challenge on the left.\n\nState Rep. Gloria Johnson, who entered the national spotlight when she was nearly expelled from the state legislature for holding a protest on the House floor against gun violence, will run. Two of her colleagues, Democratic Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis were briefly expelled for the same action. Joining her in the primary is Marquita Bradshaw, an activist for environmental justice who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2020.\n\nTexas\n\nTed Cruz\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCruz, a political firebrand for his party and a two-time presidential candidate, successfully battled off a challenge from Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke in 2018. For 2024, he may have to do the same. Democratic Rep. Collin Allred, a former NFL player, won the recent Senate primary and will face Cruz in November.\n\nUtah\n\nMitt Romney\n\nParty: Republican\n\nOne-time presidential nominee for the GOP, Romney has come to occupy a minority in recent years, treading a more centrist, anti-Trump line. He has held his Senate seat since 2019, but is not running for reelection in 2024. Many hopefuls are vying for his seat, notably Rep. John Curtis and Brent Orrin Hatch, the son of the late Orrin G. Hatch, a former Utah senator.\n\nVermont\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSanders, a famously outspoken member of the Senate's left flank, has been in office since 2007 and is running for reelection this year. He is one of the chamber's few independents but often votes on a party line with Democrats.\n\nVirginia\n\nTim Kaine\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKaine, the vice presidential candidate on Hillary Clinton's ticket in 2016, has represented Virginia in the Senate since 2013. For Democrats who face a tough electoral map in 2024, his race is a must-win. Though Kaine is a veteran of Virginia politics, and the state tends to lean blue, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win in 2021 proved a red tilt is not far off.\n\nRepublican hopefuls include veterans Eddie Garcia and Hung Cao and former Ron DeSantis advisor Scott Parkinson.\n\nWashington\n\nMaria Cantwell\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCantwell has been in the Senate for over two decades, first winning election in 2000. Cantwell is running for reelection. Several hopefuls have thrown their hat in the ring, including Republican candidate Raul Garcia, an emergency room physician.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nJoe Manchin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nManchin, a notoriously centrist vote on the Democratic side, will not run for reelection.\n\nFormer West Virginia coal executive, Don Blankenship, who previously ran for the U.S. Senate seat as a Republican in 2018, is running for Manchin's vacant seat as a Democrat. Other hopefuls include Glenn Elliott, the mayor of Wheeling, West Virginia and former Marine Zachary Shrewsbury.\n\nWisconsin\n\nTammy Baldwin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBaldwin, who announced plans for reelection in April, is a prime target for the GOP this election cycle. Her likely GOP opponent is businessman Eric Hovde.\n\nWyoming\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBarrasso has represented Wyoming in the Senate since 2007.

Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nTrump, 78, reckoned with a new November opponent, one almost 20 years his junior, as some Democratic donors celebrated what one called the \"shot of adrenaline\" Harris could bring to the pivotal race.\n\n\"Now we have to start all over again,\" Trump complained in a Truth Social post Sunday evening.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's updates.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nSenate fundraising arm triples individual donations\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tripled its fundraising record for the cycle in “individual grassroots” donations in a single day on Sunday, a DSCC aide told USA TODAY, though they did not provide exact fundraising numbers.\n\nOther major fundraising arms, including the House’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, are reporting big fundraising hauls the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nDifferent biographies\n\nTo make her case against former President Donald Trump, Harris, in a visit to her new campaign headquarters, sought to highlight their sharp biographical differences.\n\n\"As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse,” said Harris, a former prosecutor. \"Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.”\n\nHarris continued: “As attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.\"\n\nSimilar to Biden’s agenda, Harris vowed to fight for “reproductive freedom” if elected, take action to ban assault weapons and work to pass the John Lewis voting rights bill, among other policies.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong. And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for,” Harris said.\n\nShe ended her remarks saying, \"God bless you all and God bless the United States of America -- and Joe Biden.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\n‘I’m watching you, kid,’ Biden tells Harris as she takes over campaign\n\nPresident Joe Biden dropped in by conference call as Vice President Kamala Harris met with her full campaign staff Monday evening for the first time since taking the torch from Biden as the likely Democratic presidential nominee\n\n“I watching you, kid.

I love Joe Biden.”\n\nHarris announced that she retained Jen O’Malley Dillon, who served as chair of the Biden campaign, to lead her presidential campaign. She said Biden’s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, will remain in her role as well.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris trails Biden in battleground states\n\nLess than a day after President Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement, the national political landscape has dramatically shifted. While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Biden-Trump race, an InsiderAdvantage poll showed 9% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nGeorgia: An exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMichigan: Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President.\n\nNevada: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Trump-Biden poll that offered a hypothetical matchup against Harris, Trump received 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%\n\nNorth Carolina: There are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump.\n\nPennsylvania: No current polls show Harris-Trump results but before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump.\n\nWisconsin: A Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error.\n\n-Maya Homan\n\nHarris fundraising boom continues, campaign says\n\nThe Harris campaign announced $81 million in donations in the 24 hours since the vice president announced her bid Sunday.\n\nThis number includes money raised through the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\n“The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Kevin Munoz, campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with Democratic lawmakers, major donors had raised concerns about Biden following his debate performance and threatened to withhold their financial support if the president continued toward the nomination.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Republican campaign arm hits Harris\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, released a messaging memo to candidates Monday titled: \"Harris creates strong down-ballot opportunity.\"\n\nThe group argues that the case against Biden − that he was \"mentally unfit to hold office\" − didn't work well against down-ballot Democrats. But Harris \"owns the Biden Administration's baggage,\" they write, making her \"arguably a bigger threat to Democrats' Senate majority than Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe memo details Harris' policy positions and concludes with a section titled \"weird,\" including noting that she laughs at \"inappropriate moments\" and loves Venn diagrams.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris quickly securing votes to become Democratic nominee\n\nA USA TODAY count of delegates shows the 59-year old Harris is more than 40% of the way to the 1,968 delegates needed to become the party's nominee in the first round of voting. There are 3,936 Democratic delegates in total, including former presidents, state and local party leaders, members of Congress and governors.\n\nAfter announcing Sunday afternoon that he no longer sought the nomination, the 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, a move that likely inspired delegates pledged to him to endorse her.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the delegates to pick the nominee, but it remains unclear whether that decision will come by a remote roll call vote early next month as was originally planned by the party or at the Democratic National Convention that's scheduled to run August 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer, Jeffries praise Harris in statement, stop short of endorsing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a joint statement Monday saying that Harris is \"off to a great start\" with her pledge to pursue the nomination \"in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process\" set forth by the DNC.\n\nHarris is \"rapidly\" gaining support from delegates, they said, but stopped short of endorsing her for president themselves.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nVance mocks Harris over debate\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is already taking more than a few shots at Harris, including her debate skills.\n\n\"I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's gonna get to debate her?!\" Vance said during a homecoming speech in Ohio.\n\nHe added: \"I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJeffries, Schumer to meet with Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris \"shortly,\" Jeffries told reporters Monday.\n\nThere's no exact time for that meeting yet, he said, but they're waiting for Schumer to get back into town. The Senate doesn't return until Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm excited for that meeting,\" Jeffries said when asked why he has not yet endorsed Harris for president, as many of his high-profile Democratic colleagues have. Harris \"has excited the community, she's excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she's exciting the country.\"\n\nHe said he and Schumer will have more to say about \"the path forward\" once that meeting is over.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nPelosi backs Harris as the vice president locks up congressional support\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday as she continues to pick up key support from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris,” Pelosi said in a statement. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for president is official, personal and political.”\n\nPelosi played a key role in Biden’s eventual exit from the race. The former speaker served as a sounding board for Democratic lawmakers who were concerned with Biden’s campaign. Her comments on Biden that were hardly enthusiastic endorsements of Biden over the past weeks gave the green light to Democrats to publicly come out against the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?' Kamala Harris meme resurfaces after Biden drops out\n\n\"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nNo, that isn't a quote from an ancient philosopher or a classic author. It's from Kamala Harris.\n\nAs rumors swirled in recent weeks over Joe Biden's ability to win and complete a second term in office, and following the recent news of him stepping down as the Democratic nominee, Harris (as well as the internet-famous coconut tree) has drawn increased interest in the political sphere as voters look to her as Biden's potential replacement on the Democratic side of the ticket.\n\n− Emily DeLetter\n\nHarris celebrates student athletes at the White House\n\nHarris on Monday spoke at an event celebrating college athletes, her first public appearance since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNCAA Sports Day brings championship teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the White House.

You remind all of us what can be achieved with hard work and ambition,\" she added.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIn first remarks since launching campaign, Kamala Harris pays tribute to Joe Biden, Beau Biden\n\nIn her first public remarks since she became the de facto presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris payed tribute to Joe Biden and his son, Beau Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" Harris said during an NCAA event at the White House.\n\nSaid she first met Joe Biden through his son Beau Biden. Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware while Harris served in the same role in California. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"Back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is,\" Harris said. \"The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president.

He quit his law practice in 2020 to take on the responsibilities of his new role as second gentleman.\n\nEmhoff and Harris met on a blind date in 2013 after being set up by a friend and married the following year. Harris became “Momala” to his two children, Cole, 26, and Ella, 21, from his first marriage.\n\nEmhoff traveled to key battleground states to campaign for Biden and Harris before the president dropped out of the race. He's also the first Jewish spouse of a vice president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat’s next for the upcoming presidential debate?\n\nJoe Biden’s announcement that he will not seek another term has cast uncertainty on yet another facet of the election year: The upcoming presidential debate.\n\nBack in May, ABC News announced that a debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden was scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. ET. But with Biden exiting the race Sunday and endorsing Kamala Harris, the debate schedule may not go on as planned.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday evening, Trump called for Fox News to host the debate, rather than “Fake News ABC.”\n\n“Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,” he wrote.\n\nABC News has not issued an update on the debate schedule.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nAs Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\nPresident Joe Biden's announcement Sunday that he's dropping out and backing Vice President Kamala Harris shakes up the 2024 presidential election in many ways. Perhaps most significantly: Biden's decision could bring millions more voters to the polls, according to a new analysis of the U.S. electorate.\n\nResonate, a consumer data and intelligence company, released exclusively to USA TODAY a new set of 10 distinct voter groups. From its database of 250 million Americans, the 10 groups emerged as company's AI data engine culled and matched thousands of U.S. voter attributes.\n\nEricka McCoy, chief marketing officer for Resonate, predicted Friday that a new Democratic nominee would likely reenergize Gen-Z Zealots, based on insights from these groups. They're the largest of the 10 groups, which include younger, independent voters who advocate for environmental regulations and LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nMore:As Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\n– Jim Sergent and Veronica Bravo\n\nUS allies react to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 election race\n\nPraise, acknowledgment it was a difficult decision, maybe a little relief.\n\nThese were some of the reactions from world leaders and officials to Joe Biden's Sunday announcement that he was dropping out of the presidential race. Biden had been under intense pressure to step aside after a poor performance in a June debate against former President Donald Trump that highlighted concerns about his age.\n\nWhile diplomatic protocol tends to limit what American allies will say in public about an active U.S. election, many international officials applauded what Biden had, in their view, done to give new energy to the NATO military alliance, his administration's support for Ukraine and for democratic principles around the world.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nBiden news leaves some voters feeling panicked. If you're stressed, read this.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, President Joe Biden ended his bid for reelection. It's a move many voters have called for on social media and around their dinner tables. Yet, the news that Biden was dropping out had many expressing anxiety and nerves, rather than relief.\n\n\"I'm so nervous now,\" one commenter wrote Sunday beneath an @UnderTheDeskNews summary of day's events. \"Very scary times. I have no words. I'm shaking,\" another added.\n\nExperts say the ups and downs of the political world can cause serious stress for people who feel like all they can do is watch helplessly. \"We're in a state of flux, and brains really don't like ambiguity,\" psychotherapist Stephanie Sarkis says. \"They like knowing what to expect, and so this one more thing that's changed.

He's only the third Black person to be elected governor in the country.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is Mark Kelly?\n\nArizona’s junior senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly quickly cast his support for Harris as nominee Sunday, fueling speculation that he could be tapped to become her running mate.\n\nKelly, 60, has been in Congress since 2020.

He did win Democratic primaries across the country earlier this year.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTop Democratic leaders come out for Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark D-Mass., and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 2 and No. 3 ranking House Democrats, respectively, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.\n\n“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all,” Clark said in a statement.\n\nAguilar said in a statement he will “do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States.”\n\nHarris is quickly locking up support from congressional Democrats for her campaign. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has yet to weigh in though.– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear endorses Harris\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear suggested Monday he would be open to joining the Democratic presidential ticket as Harris’ running mate.\n\n“If somebody calls you on that, what you do is at least listen,” Beshear said during an interview on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nBeshear, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president or vice president, endorsed Harris for president and pledged to do everything he can to support her. Harris “is smart and strong, which will make her a good president,” he said, “but she's also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president. The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn't be clearer.”\n\nBeshear, who is in second term as Kentucky governor, said while it’s flattering to be mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, “the only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nHunter Biden shares emotional post on his father\n\nHunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, gave an emotional tribute to his father after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday.\n\n“For my entire life, I've looked at my dad in awe. How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?” Hunter Biden wrote. “Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.”\n\nHe said that over a lifetime, he’s seen his father “absorb the pain of countless everyday Americans who he's given his personal phone number to, because he wanted them to call him when they were hurting.”\n\n“That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?\n\nGavin Newsom has served as California governor since 2019.\n\nNewsom had been seen as a potential presidential candidate to replace Biden, until the 56-year-old came out in support of Harris Sunday evening.

Harris is 59 years old and she was born in California.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does Harris fare against Trump in the polls?\n\nSome polls show Harris beating Trump by one or two points and others showing her almost neck in neck with the former president.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between July 5 and July 9, found that 49% of registered voters would choose Harris while 47% would choose Trump.\n\nBut an NBC News poll conducted after the debate found Trump leading Harris 47% to 45% among registered voters. Likewise, a Fox News poll conducted between July 7 and July 10 found that 48% of registered voters would choose Harris if the election were held today compared to 49% for Trump.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden Cabinet members praise his leadership\n\nTwo of President Biden’s Cabinet secretaries – Attorney General Merrick Garland and Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of Homeland Secretary – praised his leadership for following the rule of law and protecting the country.\n\nThe praise contrasted with years of Republican attacks against Biden and his administration. Republicans have investigated the president’s son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted of gun charges and who still faces tax charges. Biden didn’t block the prosecutions.\n\nBiden sat for an interview with a special counsel for investigated how classified documents were found at his home and former office. Republicans are fighting for the recording of the interview, despite the Justice Department releasing the transcript.\n\n“From the beginning of his tenure, President Biden has made clear in both word and deed that he stands for the rule of law and for the Justice Department’s critical mission to protect the safety and the civil rights of everyone in our country,” said Garland, who was held in contempt by the House after refusing to release the recording.\n\nRepublicans have also accused the administration of weakening border security, allowing unprecedented waves of undocumented immigrants to enter. But Mayorkas said the country and world are better for Biden’s leadership in protecting the American people.\n\n“When it comes to homeland security, he has taken and directed bold, innovative, and decisive actions to help safeguard our communities, secure our borders, harness the power of artificial intelligence, advance our cybersecurity, eradicate the scourge of fentanyl, and more – all while standing up for our nation’s values,” said Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over border security. “It is a privilege to advance his vision of and for a strong, secure, and prosperous America.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris is frontrunner to become Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democratic Party won’t officially name its presidential nominee until its convention in August, but Harris is the immediate frontrunner.\n\nBiden, who chosen Harris as his vice presidential running mate four years ago, emphatically endorsed her to be the party’s nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nSome other prominent Democrats also endorsed her, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Others, including Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued statements lauding Biden but without explicitly endorsing Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris, however, has several advantages. She has already been vetted for national office during her tenure as Biden’s second-in-command. She has also been a part of Biden’s reelection apparatus for months.\n\n–Karissa Waddick and Michael Collins\n\nDelegates will pick Democratic nominee\n\nBiden endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president, but it’s the party’s 3,896 delegates who will pick their candidate.\n\nDelegates can vote for someone other than Biden even if he won their states’ primaries earlier this year.\n\nThat's possible because of a section in the DNC rules referred to as the \"good conscience\" clause, which states delegates shall \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" The word “sentiment” is where much of the delegates' support will hinge and opens the door to interpretation.\n\nSo delegates could vote for Biden, Harris or someone else. There is no system to automatically transfer the delegates from Biden to Harris.\n\n–Kathryn Palmer and Michael Collins\n\nSecond gentleman Douglas Emhoff: Biden 'a true patriot'\n\nHarris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, has offered his thoughts on Biden’s withdrawal from the race.\n\n“I am deeply grateful to @POTUS and @FLOTUS for their years of friendship and support,” the second gentleman wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “President Biden is a true patriot who leads our nation with honesty, decency, and integrity.

Here's what to know about 2024 convention after Biden drops out of race\n\nOn the heels of Biden's decision to end his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from scores of his own party leaders, all eyes are now on Chicago, where the Democratic National Convention is set to kick off next month.\n\nThe DNC is slated to take place Aug. 19 through Aug. 22.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/02/dover-community-activist-challenge-carper/1085121001/", "title": "Kerri Harris to challenge Tom Carper in Delaware Democratic primary", "text": "Kerri Harris, a Dover community activist and political newcomer, plans to challenge three-term U.S. Sen. Tom Carper in the Democratic primary this fall.\n\nIf she succeeds, she would make history as the state's first biracial lesbian woman to serve in Congress.\n\nBut Harris, an Air Force veteran who has struggled to make ends meet and finish her college degree, prefers not to be pigeonholed.\n\n\"The bigger history I'm going for is to represent everybody,\" the 38-year-old mother of two said this week.\n\nHarris plans to officially kick off her campaign at 11 a.m. Feb. 10 at an event at the Chris White Gallery at the Shipley Artists Lofts in downtown Wilmington.\n\nLast week, the state's political insiders were abuzz after news of a mystery Carper challenger surfaced on Facebook — one who supports a $15 minimum wage, single-payer health care and universal pre-kindergarten.\n\nMystery solved.\n\nHarris co-founded the Delaware Civil Rights Coalition on the eve of President Donald Trump's inauguration. Consisting of about a dozen civil rights and religious organizations, the group works to combat broad attacks on women, Muslims, African-Americans and the LGBTQ community.\n\nWhile Harris' agenda firmly aligns with that of progressive Democrats, she refuses to characterize her upcoming battle as one of progressive versus moderate ideology.\n\nRather, the state Human Relations commissioner who has lobbied Carper's office on a range of issues, criticized him as a disconnected career politician who continues to vote against Delaware residents' best interests to the benefit of corporate donors.\n\n\"I know we're all looking for all the same things,\" she said of First State voters. \"Almost all of our hardships are simply because of the way our structure is set against us.\"\n\nHarris is aware of the grueling path ahead. She is only the second Democrat to challenge Carper in a primary since he was first elected to the Senate in 2000, upending longtime Republican Sen. William V. Roth Jr.\n\nKnown for playing the godfather role in state politics, Carper has served as Delaware's treasurer, congressman, governor and senior senator during his more than four decades in public service.\n\nState leaders here wear with pride the \"Carper Democrat\" badge; they tend to be socially liberal, but centrists on taxes, the economy and fiscal policy.\n\nIn 2012, the last time Carper's seat was in play, Keith Spanarelli, an independent-minded former business owner, earned only 12 percent of the vote. Carper later sailed to his 13th consecutive statewide victory — a Delaware record — defeating Republican Kevin Ward, Independent Alex Pires and the Green Party's Andrew Groff.\n\nCarper's campaign committee raised nearly $4.9 million in contributions in that election, dwarfing his opponents' war chests, according to campaign finance records.\n\nAlso entering the race this year is first-time Republican candidate Chuck Boyce, who announced last spring. A Middletown businessman, Boyce has pledged to help veterans through an improved Veterans Affairs system and by creating more jobs for Delawareans in expanding industries.\n\n\"It's time Delaware sends someone with private sector experience to D.C., who understands the struggles of being an employer and will fight on the side of America's workforce,\" Boyce said.\n\nJesse Chadderdon, executive director of the state Democratic Party, said he and others had heard rumblings about Harris entering the race. But she never talked to the party directly.\n\nAs the party brings in new voices reflective of Delaware's diverse population, Chadderdon expects several crowded primaries this year, including races for state attorney general and auditor. So far, no Democrat has emerged to challenge U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is also up for re-election.\n\nIt's still too early to know whether the Delaware Democratic Executive Committee will formally endorse a candidate in the Carper race. Breaking with tradition, the party declined to endorse candidates in 2016 in statewide primaries for Congress, lieutenant governor and insurance commissioner, citing a packed field of qualified candidates.\n\nSTORY: More Democrats enter race for Delaware attorney general\n\nSTORY: Former Catholic priest charged in child rape case\n\nEven with President Donald Trump's win in 2016, Delawareans mostly stuck with incumbents and career public service workers. In the last state election, only one of the four GOP candidates challenging a Democratic incumbent won: Anthony Delcollo, who defeated Senate President Pro Tempore Patricia Blevins.\n\nAt the same time, the state has grappled with a budget deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars, an opioid crisis, calls for comprehensive school reform and the loss of major employers.\n\nChadderdon promised a fair process for all candidates involved this year. He praised Carper's long and distinguished service to Delaware, adding \"there is a reason that he's one of the most successful politicians in our state's history.\"\n\nCarper, who at 71 says he still runs 8 miles before church on Sunday, doesn't view his establishment brand of politics as a liability. He typically votes along party lines but stressed that voters appreciate his reputation as a consensus-builder and advocate for clean air, affordable health care, infrastructure development and sound fiscal governance.\n\nYet he also doesn't see himself as an invincible candidate.\n\n\"Every campaign I’ve ever had, I always run like I’m 20 points behind,\" he said recently. \"I also kill them with kindness.”\n\nAs the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Carper has a long record of support for anti-pollution legislation and action on climate change. He has also demonstrated steadfast and impassioned opposition to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nHarris, who opposes fracking and offshore drilling, criticized Carper for supporting the construction of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which prompted environmentalists in 2014 to stage a sit-in at his Washington office.\n\nCarper has consistently argued that the pipeline impasse had delayed movement on other clean-air issues.\n\n\"One vote out of 1,000 or more,\" he said. \"Give me a break.\"\n\nA staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act, Carper has worked relentlessly to block GOP health care bills. Yet he and U.S. Sen. Chris Coons were among 13 Democrats last year who opposed a measure that would have allowed pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacists to import low-cost medicine from Canada and other countries.\n\nBoth Carper and Coons, who count the pharmaceutical industry among their major donors, cited drug safety concerns.\n\nWhile serving as Delaware's governor, Carper was instrumental in bringing AstraZeneca to Fairfax, offering a $40.7 million package of grants and tax credits along with $70 million in road improvements in exchange for the company's pledge to create more jobs.\n\nLast month, Carper and Coons were among six Democrats who voted to confirm Trump nominee Alex Azar, a former drug company executive, as secretary of Health and Human Services. Azar, who has described the Affordable Care Act as a \"fundamentally broken system,\" has promised to work on lowering drug prices.\n\nPreviously, Carper voted against multiple Trump Cabinet nominees, but he considers Azar qualified for the job. He cited Azar's work as HHS general counsel during the George W. Bush administration. Coons, who attended Yale Law School with Azar, also vouched for him, Carper said.\n\nHarris said she would have voted against Azar. She also criticized Carper for opposing legislation that would have prevented the government shutdown last month.\n\nThree days later, Carper and other Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government and fund it through Feb. 8 while both parties continued to negotiate a deal on immigration and spending issues.\n\n\"One way we can bring pressure to bear is to do the morally right thing,\" Carper said, adding that young undocumented immigrants deserve protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nHarris said she also supports DACA and easing other immigrants' path to citizenship, but she depends on her veterans benefits and nearly lost her home during the last government shutdown.\n\nAfter serving for eight years in the military, Harris said she retired as an Air Force staff sergeant in 2008 because of medical complications from an anthrax vaccine.\n\nSoon after, she assembled a varied résumé that included lawn mower, fried chicken cook, acupuncturist, auto body mechanic and manager of a leadership program for former gang members. She recalls attending corporate luncheons where executives reported record profits while workers' wages stagnated.\n\n\"You can't treat people poorly and expect them to perform at peak levels when their worlds are falling apart,\" she said. \"There's a miseducation throughout the state of Delaware.

Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination this week and announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential pick.\n\nSunday's decision came as Biden spent weeks repeatedly rejecting calls for him to end his campaign. He had said he would only consider dropping out if doctors diagnosed him with a medical condition.\n\nThe president is expected to address the nation about his decision later this week. He is isolating in his Rehoboth Beach home after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nREAD:Delaware's own Joe Biden drops out of Presidential race, citing 'best interest' of country\n\nAll quiet outside Biden HQ in Wilmington\n\nAll was quiet outside Biden’s campaign headquarters in Wilmington Sunday night.\n\nThe doors to the Brandywine Building were locked and a security guard was not letting anyone in.\n\nTwo women who walked out of the building about 8:45 p.m. declined to comment when asked if they worked for the Biden campaign.\n\nLights could be seen lit on several floors in the building.\n\n— Esteban Parra\n\nDelaware NAACP president Richard \"Mouse\" Smith: Biden's a 'hero'\n\nRichard \"Mouse\" Smith, president of Delaware's NAACP, recently sensed something different about his friend Joe Biden, a man he's known for decades.\n\nThe president was speaking at the 115th NAACP National Convention in Las Vegas last week when Smith said he noticed unfamiliar in his friend. It was like an aura of sadness, he said.\n\n\"I knew that a decision was going to be made that he was not going to continue,\" Smith said.\n\nNo one told Smith anything. He just sensed it.\n\n\"I sensed the spirit that came to me from everything,\" Smith said, adding he was begging Biden family members to urge him to stay in the race.\n\nSmith added that Biden's departure brings him sadness, as the president has done so much for Black and brown people.\n\n\"He's a hero to me,\" he said.\n\n— Esteban Parra\n\nBiden helped re-shape Delaware, national politics\n\nBiden has spent more than a half-century in the public eye, beginning his political career in 1970 at age 28 when he ran for New Castle County Council. He served two years before turning to the national stage in 1972.\n\nIn a shocking upset that year, he beat Republican incumbent Caleb Boggs. He served in the Senate for three-and-a-half decades before being tapped as former President Barack Obama's right-hand man.\n\nA HISTORY OF BIDEN:'Meat on the bone': How Joe Biden changed Delaware politics\n\nThat Senate race more than 50 years ago helped usher in a new era of Democrats in Delaware – both in the party's ideology and how it campaigned. Today, the First State is predominantly blue.\n\nYet even before becoming president, Biden also left his mark on the national stage – including for his work on a 1994 crime bill that disproportionately affected Black communities. When running for president in 2019, he called the legislation \"a big mistake.\"\n\nREADBiden says he regrets 1990s crime bill, calls it a 'big mistake'\n\nStill, his longtime public service earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction in 2017.\n\nThe nation's highest civilian honor, Obama said when presenting Biden with the medal that \"to know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully.\"\n\nAt the time, then-Delaware Gov. Jack Markell called the honor \"a fitting tribute to a lifetime of work that has improved quality of life, economic opportunity and security for millions of people across the country.\"\n\n\"We also know that while President Obama can elevate him with one of the nation’s highest honors ... for Delawareans, he’ll always be our Joe.”\n\nSTORY:Obama awards Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nIf Kamala Harris becomes presidential pick, who would be her VP choice?\n\nMany questions remain unanswered in the wake of Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential race, namely: Who will become the Democratic nominee for president and vice president?\n\nThe most likely pick for president is Vice President Kamala Harris, as Biden has endorsed her. But should she be chosen, who might be her running mate?\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper could be among those being considered to join the presidential ticket, as could California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Neither man addressed those rumors on Sunday.\n\nYet a poll conducted in two swing states, Pennsylvania and Michigan, also floated Pa. Gov. Josh Shapiro. and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as possible candidates.\n\nThose polled favored a Harris-Shapiro ticket over a Harris-Whitmer ticket.\n\nWhen comparing a Harris-Shapiro ticket to a Trump-JD Vance ticket, respondents were equally split.\n\nREAD:Who will replace Joe Biden? Kamala Harris top Democratic candidate as endorsements roll in\n\nWhat happens to Biden's delegates?\n\nPrior to dropping out, Biden received 3,896 pledged delegates ahead of the Democratic National Convention, where he would have officially become the party's presidential nominee.\n\nThere is no system for Biden to appoint someone to take his place as the presumptive Democratic nominee. If no candidate wins the majority of the roughly 4,000 delegates, then the party's more than 700 superdelegates, or automatic delegates, will be able to vote at the convention.\n\nDelaware has 19 Democratic delegates. While the state did not have a primary election, according to state law, if only one candidate files for a party's nomination by the deadline, the candidate is declared the winner.\n\nBiden was running unopposed in Delaware so all 19 delegates were awarded to him.\n\nDELEGATES, EXPLAINED:Who gets President Biden's delegates? How many does Delaware have\n\nSen. Carper on Biden: 'I love him like a brother'\n\nSen. Tom Carper, who has served with Biden for 50 years, said he was \"immensely proud\" of the president for his Sunday announcement.\n\n\"From the day he took office, he has consistently said that in the end, his final decision on running for reelection would be based on what’s best for America,\" Carper said. \"His decision today meets that standard, and I am immensely proud of him for that.\"\n\nThe longtime politician, who spent years riding Amtrak with Biden to and from Delaware and Washington, D.C., also said he loves the president \"like a brother.\"\n\nLike U.S Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester wrote in a statement issued earlier Sunday afternoon, Carper noted Biden's achievements, saying the president's record \"is one that all Americans can be proud of.\"\n\nDELAWARE POLITICIANS SPEAK:Delaware politicians react, honor Joe Biden's legacy after news he's dropping out\n\nSen. Chris Coons tears up as he speaks of Biden, calls him 'greatest Delawarean'\n\nSen. Chris Coons became emotional on Sunday as he spoke with CBS News about the president's decision to withdraw his reelection bid.\n\nAs a reporter asked the senator about Biden's grounding in Delaware and why he waited to come home to reach the decision to drop out, Coons teared up.\n\n\"He did make the hardest decision – I suspect of his whole life – in a way that was informed by, and grounded by, everything that has sustained him in his decades of public service,\" Coons said.\n\n\"He is the greatest Delawarean in our history,\" the senator added.\n\nWhen pressed by a reporter why it took Biden so long to drop out, Coons said he wouldn't put words in the president's mouth. But, he said, Biden \"is someone who has always fought hard. He is tough. He is a fighter.\"\n\n\"He has survived blows that would have leveled any lesser man. And so in the last few weeks he has struggled with that instinct, that toughness, that determination to keep fighting and to keep showing what America is all about,\" Coons said.\n\nThe senator cited the death of Biden's son, Beau, several years ago, as well as the 1972 deaths of his wife and daughter in a car crash.\n\n— Ben Mace\n\nFormer Sen. Bill Roth's widow weighs in on a politician not dropping out\n\nIn a letter to the editor published on Delaware Online/The News Journal website on Saturday, the widow of longtime Sen. Bill Roth wrote that the newspaper's comparisons of her husband's failed reelection bid in 2000 to Biden's weeks-long refusal to heed calls to drop out \"stirred up some painful memories.\"\n\nSEN. BILL ROTH:The veteran Delaware politician who wouldn't retire. It's not who you think\n\nJane Roth said she was \"very concerned\" when her husband sought reelection, writing she worried he \"was not up to the heavy demands of being a senator and a committee chair.\" She, their son and Bill Roth's chief of staff staged an intervention of sorts, urging him not to run.\n\nDespite the concern of the man's loved ones, he ran and lost. Jane Roth said her husband's \"heart was broken.\"\n\nWhile Jane Roth did not mention Biden in her letter, she wrote that her husband's loss to now-Sen. Tom Carper \"was a very sad ending to his 30 years in the Senate.\"\n\n\"I think he never got over it. As his spouse, I believe he would have been happier if he had bowed out. His remaining years would not have been touched with a sense of loss but instead with one of accomplishment.\"\n\nREAD JANE ROTH'S FULL LETTER:'I have witnessed the grief of a politician' who did not bow out, ran against age and lost\n\nRep. Lisa Blunt Rochester calls Biden 'the most accomplished president in modern history'\n\nIn a statement issued just before 3:30 p.m. Sunday, Blunt Rochester touted Biden's achievements.\n\nHer notes of his highlights included capping the cost of insulin to $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, \"forgiving $160 billion in student loan debt, helping entrepreneurs open small businesses, investing over $16 billion in HBCUs and creating good-paying jobs.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden’s accomplishments have secured his legacy as a great president,\" the statement continued.\n\nOn a more personal note, she cited her decades-long friendship with the Biden family, calling him \"the Comforter-in-Chief because of his empathy and compassion for every person.\"\n\nA TIMELINE:President Joe Biden through the years\n\nTrump rants on Truth Social, calling Biden 'not fit' to run\n\nOn Truth Social Sunday afternoon – Trump's social media answer to X – the former president and Republican presidential nominee issued a series of messages, repeatedly calling Biden \"crooked.\"\n\nThe first message said Biden \"was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve – And never was!\" He further claimed the president \"has done everything possible to destroy our Country.\"\n\nSen. Chris Coons notes Biden's 'legacy of putting his country before himself'\n\nU.S. Sen. Chris Coons posted on X Sunday that Biden \"has been the most consequential president of my lifetime.\"\n\n\"His legacy of putting his country before himself is only strengthened by his hard decision today to step aside as a candidate for president,\" the post said. \"I look forward to working with President Biden this fall as Democrats unite to defeat Donald Trump, and I will work hand-in-hand with him as he continues his important efforts to strengthen the middle class at home and our nation’s standing abroad.”\n\nWhen is the DNC 2024?:Who will replace Joe Biden as Democratic National Convention nears\n\nBiden not running:Thank you, President Biden, for your service to our nation\n\nThis is a developing story.

A decrease in solar radiation and lower temperatures can result in a decrease in convection and cloud cover.\n\nHumidity will increase during the eclipse because temperatures will drop closer to the dew point.\n\nWinds will decrease because of the decrease in solar radiation and convection.\n\nHow will my pets react to the eclipse?\n\nJeff Reibert, pet supplies buyer for CountryMax, a New York-based farm supply and feed store, said in a release that on a normal day, dogs don’t try to look at the sun, making it unlikely they will during the eclipse.

Simply put, they will react more to their owner's excitement and anxiety, not the actual eclipse.\n\nSome dogs bark, some don't.

Smartmatic will not stop until the perpetrators are held accountable.\"\n\nSmartmatic sued Newsmax in 2021, alleging it broadcast damaging misinformation falsely claiming the company switched votes in the 2020 election, that its machines were hacked and that it was funded by corrupt dictators.\n\nSmartmatic alleged that Newsmax profited from its false reporting. Trump amplified Newsmax's reporting on social media and the broadcaster's audience jumped 10-fold after the election, vaulting it over cable news rivals such as CNBC and Fox Business, according to Nielsen Ratings.\n\nSmartmatic's machines were used only in Los Angeles County in the 2020 election and it has said there has never been a security breach with its equipment, which has recorded billions of votes, largely in non-U.S. elections.\n\nBoth Newsmax and Smartmatic's U.S. affiliate are based in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nNewsmax said it had a First Amendment right to report claims by Trump and his supporters, which were often made in court filings challenging the election.\n\nThe company also clarified its reporting about Smartmatic in December 2020 and invited Smartmatic representatives to come on air to explain their side of the story to Newsmax viewers.\n\nSmartmatic did not accept that invitation.\n\nNewsmax has described its coverage of Smartmatic as \"minor.\"\n\nSmartmatic has not publicly estimated the damages at stake, but Newsmax told the court on Sept. 16 that the voting machine company was seeking $400 million to $600 million and described the case as \"bet your company\" litigation.\n\nNewsmax had $67 million in assets at the end of 2022, according to a securities filing, and said in a June investor presentation it hoped to file for a public offering of its stock this year or early 2025.\n\n\"We are now looking forward to our day in court against Fox Corp. and Fox News for their disinformation campaign,\" Smartmatic said.\n\nThe company is suing Fox in New York for $2.7 billion.\n\nFalse claims about the 2020 election have led to several defamation settlements or verdicts.\n\nFox agreed to settle defamation claims by Dominion Voting Systems last year for $787.5 million, which was the biggest defamation settlement by a U.S. media company, according to legal experts. Dominion is also seeking up to $1.6 billion in damages against Newsmax, which is in litigation in the Delaware court.\n\nA jury decided last year that former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had to pay more than $148 million in damages to two former Georgia election workers he defamed through false accusations that they helped rig the 2020 election against Trump.

Then again, Lurie's opening statement Friday lasted 16 minutes, so perhaps Lurie did most of the talking then, too.\n\nWHO'S THE QB? Nick Sirianni got a lot of questions on Eagles' quarterback situation and didn't have many answers\n\nLOOKING FOR CLUES:Wentz or Hurts? From Eagles' owner to new coach to his staff, some clues as to the 2021 QB\n\nBut Sirianni won't ultimately be judged on his non-polished responses, such as when he was asked about a time-frame for naming a starting quarterback between Carson Wentz and Jalen Hurts.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n\"As far as the starter, haven't really thought about that yet and naming a starter,\" Sirianni said. \"That hasn't even crossed my mind.\"\n\nReally?\n\nIt's safe to say that the subject of quarterbacks came up often during the interview with Lurie. Heck, that probably took up 9½ of the 10 to 12 hours. And it's safe to say that Sirianni answered those questions the way Lurie wanted or else he wouldn't have been hired.\n\nOf course, we don't know what was said in that interview, or what Sirianni and Wentz talked about, because Sirianni wouldn't say.\n\nBut we do know that Wentz had by far his worst season, reportedly felt his relationship with previous coach Doug Pederson was \"fractured beyond repair,\" and that Wentz, even with the new hire, might still not be thrilled with the organization.\n\nIt's also possible that Sirianni isn't sold on Wentz, just like Wentz might not be sold on Sirianni.\n\nWhether or not that's the case, it's much more important for Sirianni to win the locker room than it is to win the press conference.\n\nAnd this could be Sirianni's toughest task.\n\nWe have seen coaches come in and win over press conferences before. Few have given a better opening press conference than Chip Kelly, who famously said about the possibility of coaching again in college: \"I've burned the boats. I'm not going back.\"\n\nKelly lost the locker room after two seasons. He lost his job before the third season was finished. And yes, he's coaching in college.\n\nFew have given worse opening pressers than Andy Reid, who stayed for 14 seasons, went to a Super Bowl and five NFC Championship games. Unless you count Doug Pederson's opening presser, and he won the franchise's only Super Bowl.\n\nSo Sirianni has to convince veterans like defensive linemen Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham, offensive linemen like Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce, and cornerback Darius Slay that he knows what he's doing, more so than Anthony from Langhorne.\n\nAll of those players are in their 30s, and all of them have been around long enough to know when a coach has command of a team or not.\n\nSlay, for example, will be playing for his fifth NFL coach as he enters his ninth season. For Graham and Kelce, it will be their fourth head coach.\n\nBut there's more to that locker room dynamic.\n\nLurie said after firing Pederson that the Eagles are entering a \"transitional period,\" and that he fired Pederson because Pederson was more consumed with winning in 2021 than he was about formulating a long-range plan for success.\n\nAnd perhaps this is what he saw in Sirianni, to make the transition from veterans, possibly including Wentz and almost certainly tight end Zach Ertz, to a young team led by players like running back Miles Sanders, tight end Dallas Goedert, wide receiver Jalen Reagor and Hurts.\n\nThat's true for Sirianni's coaching staff as well.\n\nLike Sirianni, offensive coordinator Shane Steichen, defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon and quarterbacks coach Brian Johnson are all in their 30s, with a combined 1.5 years of experience in their current NFL roles.\n\nThat certainly doesn't sound like a staff that's looking to win now.\n\nNeither does this statement from Sirianni: \"I'm 39 years old, I'm part of a team. That's unbelievable. We all should feel so lucky to be a part of that team.\"\n\nYes, that was awkward.\n\nBut this wasn't, at least in Lurie's eyes:\n\n\"The core values that I believe in that are important to any good team that I really want to make sure that we have here with the Philadelphia Eagles ... is to connect with each other,\" Sirianni said. \"That's so important to me, is that we have a building here where everyone is connecting. Coaches are connecting to coaches, players are connecting to players, and coaches are connecting to players.\"\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, that hardly conjured up images of Knute Rockne's speech of going out there and winning one for the Gipper.\n\nBut as Lurie put it, what works best in \"modern football today, modern sports today, is to care very much about the players and coaches you work with.\"\n\nTo Lurie, Sirianni cares a lot, and this is how he will be judged.\n\n\"It became apparent that this is a very special communicator, not just a brilliant football IQ,\" Lurie said. \"(That) was very evident early on as we went through how he game plans, how he attacks defenses, how he maximizes personnel. It's not just relying on a scheme, but how to each week attack exactly who you're playing, what their strengths and weaknesses are in great detail.\n\n\"Much more than that, he's somebody who connects with everybody.\"\n\nIf \"everybody\" means the Eagles players and coaches – and not necessarily the media and fans – then Sirianni will succeed.\n\nIf not, there could very well be a new coaching search in three seasons.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Inside, Branch brandished a gun, took money and jumped back into the waiting car.\n\nThey were at a nearby gas station when a team of nearly two dozen police swarmed their car where they found that Kolmonen's 3-year-old daughter was in the car and had been with the duo during the robbery.\n\nPRIOR COVERAGE:\n\nTwo suspects in string of cross-state robberies charged\n\n\"The defendant's audacity to put his own daughter in such a predictable danger added a dangerous and thoughtless element to an already brazen conspiracy,\" reads the sentencing memorandum signed Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander Mackler and Edmond Falgowski.\n\nSentencing documents filed on behalf of the defendants' attorneys noted substance abuse problems led to the crimes.\n\n\"The simple answer that his addiction became so overpowering that he robbed the stores for money to buy heroin,\" wrote Dina Chavar, an attorney representing Branch. \"The more complicated answer is how he became such a desperate addict at age 27 which powered the offense conduct.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Please support the work we're doing by subscribing to Delaware Online.\n\nSitting in her car in the parking lot of Miller's Gun Center near New Castle on Wednesday afternoon, Valisa Noel waited in the warmth as her husband stood in line inside.\n\nHe was one of about a dozen people at the New Castle County store to buy firearms and ammunition. The line moved slowly, but the customers, many of whom donned medical gloves and masks, waited patiently, knowing Miller's could close at any minute.\n\nHis shop and at least one other were breaking the rules under Gov. John Carney's emergency order, which had ordered them closed.\n\nTiring of the wait, Noel went in to check on her husband's progress in line.\n\n\"I feel that (firearms stores) should be open,\" Noel said. \"People are terrified. They're beyond scared. They're terrified, and they should be able to keep protecting themselves.\"\n\nThat sentiment is being echoed among gun rights advocates as they push back against part of Carney's Sunday afternoon order closing all \"nonessential\" businesses. The order went into effect Tuesday at 8 a.m. and is intended to reduce the spread of coronavirus.\n\nUpdate:Gun stores issued cease-and-desist orders after defying governor's order to close\n\nUnder Delaware business code, most firearms stores are given the same North American Industry Classification code as sporting goods stores, which are deemed \"nonessential.\"\n\nThus, they've been told to close, though some have not abided by that order.\n\nA NATIONAL DEBATE:Are gun stores and golf courses ‘essential businesses’ during coronavirus shutdowns? It depends where you live.\n\nThe issue, gun rights advocates say, is the forced closures are a \"direct infringement\" on the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 1, Section 20 of the Delaware Constitution. Both grant citizens the right to bear arms.\n\nBy closing firearms stores, someone who does not have a firearm now cannot get one and is thus \"unable to practice (their) rights,\" said Mitch Denham, founder of Delaware Gun Rights, a 21,000-member Facebook group.\n\nThat's been a big topic of discussion in the group the last several days, especially because Pennsylvania backtracked on their order Tuesday.\n\n\"We want people to be able to have access that don't have access,\" Denham said. \"Maybe you're anti-gun and never saw a reason to have one until now, so you've never had one. Now you don't have access to protect yourself and your family, and that's what we're fighting against.\"\n\nREAD:Shelves clear as coronavirus fears fuel sales of firearms, ammunition\n\nIn the two weeks since Delaware announced its first case of coronavirus and watched cases climb to 119 Wednesday, sales of firearms and ammunition have gone through the roof, according to several store owners.\n\nA large amount of those sales are fueled by coronavirus fears — and the uncertainty of what lies ahead.\n\n\"There's an inherent fear with something that you can't see,\" Denham said. \"If you can't see a virus, you don't know if you're going to get it. You don't know if you're susceptible to it; you, you don't know if you're a carrier — there are a lot of unknowns.\"\n\nRELATED:We can't see the coronavirus, but can see its effects. Does that make it scarier?\n\nIt's not the virus itself that's driving the firearms and ammunition sales, Denham said: A firearm can't prevent a person from falling ill.\n\nIt's the concern that society's collective fear is \"going to make people crazy.\"\n\n\"I’ve seen people that fight over TVs or something on Black Friday,\" Middletown resident Joe Cael said last week. “Right now, there’s a crisis. People have to think. You have to make decisions. I worry about people. They get a bit cagey, so I want some protection.”\n\nThat protection, with some exceptions, is guaranteed under the U.S. and Delaware constitutions.\n\nTaking that away, by virtue of closing firearms stores, means \"you are depriving every citizen in the state of Delaware the ability to exercise their right to keep and bear arms,\" said Jeff Hague, president of the Delaware State Sportsmen's Association.\n\n\"We feel that's wrong,\" Hague said. \"We feel that that's unconstitutional. But there's a solution.\"\n\nThat would be amending the list of nonessential businesses to make an exception for firearms stores.\n\nIndividual businesses can submit requests to have their business status changed from \"nonessential\" to \"essential,\" though there is \"not a guarantee that a petition will be successful,\" Carney's office said.\n\nHague said the governor should look to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's directive on Tuesday, which allows Pennsylvania firearms dealers to sell their wares by individual appointment during limited hours, as long as they comply with social distancing guidelines and take other measures to protect employees and customers from the coronavirus.\n\nFirearms dealers were initially on Pennsylvania's nonessential business list, but Wolf quietly changed that after three Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justices urged the governor to rethink the firearms store closures.\n\nSTORY:Gov. Wolf beats gun dealers in court, then reopens gun shops at urging of dissenting judge\n\n“Quite simply, if firearm dealers are not able to conduct any business in person at their licensed premises, then no transfers of firearms can be completed,” Pennsylvania Justice David Wecht wrote.\n\n\"This amounts to an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth — a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution [and] the Pennsylvania Constitution.”\n\nHague, Denham and others argue the same.\n\nIn an interview with radio station WGMD earlier this week, Carney said he was not part of the process for determining what businesses were deemed essential and what were not.\n\nHe said he guessed the firearms store closures \"was a combination of maybe the fact that they’re not immediately essential, obviously notwithstanding Second Amendment rights there.”\n\nThe governor's office has not issued any update to Carney's current list but said it's heard gun advocates' concerns.\n\nDenham said that's not enough, and the governor must take action.\n\n\"Gov. Carney needs to know that he did not make the right decision,\" Denham said. \"We understand (the order), but now it's time to back up and rethink it and let (firearms stores open).\"\n\nSend story tips or ideas to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2785.

These are explosions of plasma and magnetic fields, which cause geomagnetic storms.\n\nOn Earth, the storms can cause disruptions in communications, the electric power grid, navigation and radio. In space, they can affect satellites.\n\nBut the storms can also trigger \"spectacular displays\" of the northern lights, or aurora borealis, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. A \"severe\" storm means the aurora could be seen as far south as Alabama and northern California.\n\nThis would also include Delaware.\n\nThe last time space weather forecasters issued a severe (G4) geomagnetic storm watch − the second most powerful solar storm classification − was January 2005, though a G4 storm did occur in March of this year.\n\nA G5 storm is the most severe and classified as \"extreme.\" The last one occurred in October 2003 and caused power outages in Sweden. It also damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nWhen could I see the northern lights?\n\nTiming is not exact, but the time to view the aurora is usually within several hours of midnight, or between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time. There can be aurora in the evening and morning, but it is not usually as active, according to NOAA.\n\nDuring a Friday morning news conference, officials with the space weather prediction center said they will not know the intensity of the storm until the coronal mass ejections reach about a million miles from Earth. They travel at 800 kilometers (497 miles) per second, meaning scientists will have 20 to 45 minutes to determine the intensity before any potential effects are felt or seen.\n\n\"Because we're talking about something (that originates) 93 million miles away, it is extremely difficult to forecast with a very good degree of accuracy,\" said Shawn Dahl, a service coordinator with the space weather prediction center.\n\nBut, he and others added, if the solar storm does reach the G4 level, sky gazers should look up in the \"late evening to post-midnight hours.\"\n\nFor best viewing, the National Weather Service recommends looking to the north and trying to get away from city lights. The darker the sky, the better for viewing, weather officials say.\n\nWhile Friday night appears to be the best chance for viewing, the aurora may also be visible Saturday night into Sunday.\n\nWill Friday's rain affect my potential viewing?\n\nOne key requirement to seeing the aurora is clear skies − meaning Friday's wet weather may hinder potential viewing.\n\nRain is expected to continue on and off throughout much of the day in Delaware, though radar shows it tapering off around 9 p.m.\n\nWEEKEND WEATHER:Grab your raincoats, Delaware. It's going to be a dreary weekend with rain, cloudy skies\n\nStill, cloud cover is predicted at 100% at 10 p.m., 98% at 11 p.m., 98% at midnight, 97% at 1 a.m. and 93% at 2 a.m., according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWhile Delaware will likely have an overnight reprieve from rain, a frontal system developing over the Midwest will cause precipitation to return to the Mid-Atlantic on Saturday with another round of rain and thunderstorms.\n\nThe storm will be weaker than Friday's, however, and severe thunderstorms are not expected, the weather service said.\n\nWhat are the northern lights?\n\nThe aurora borealis is a glow produced by electrons that float down to the Earth’s magnetic field from space. The electrons crash with atoms and molecules of the atmosphere in a ring on the Earth’s magnetic pole, according to NOAA.\n\nAll that commotion produces multicolor bulbs of light, which can be seen in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively.\n\nGot a story tip or idea?

I thought this position was about helping the people, not about policing City Council.”\n\nNepotism in Delaware\n\nNepotistic hiring practices were on full display last year when Delaware Auditor Kathy McGuiness was found guilty of criminal corruption charges stemming from her hiring her daughter and affording her special privileges in the office.\n\nA jury in July found McGuiness guilty of conflict of interest, structuring and official misconduct. She was found not guilty of two felonies: theft and witness intimidation.\n\nBACKGROUND:Jury returns verdict in Delaware Auditor Kathy McGuiness criminal corruption case\n\nA key argument McGuiness made in her defense was that the hiring of political leaders’ family members is “common” among state agencies, an aspect that was brought up in the City Council’s discussions over the ordinance.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:Pointing fingers, convicted Delaware Auditor Kathy McGuiness refusing calls to resign\n\nSpadola acknowledged there are no known examples of the City Council hiring relatives for positions on council staff, but he added that doesn’t mean the legislative body shouldn’t ensure good governance.\n\n“Before we look at other departments, it’s important that we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards,” he said. “It hasn’t happened before, and that’s great, and we should continue to prevent having close family members of council members hired. I understand nepotism is a problem in government in general and because of that, that’s why we need it here.”\n\nIs the ordinance necessary for the City Council?\n\nOliver further contended the legislation would be unfair to kids looking for internships or part-time jobs with the city.\n\n“I think it’s unfair for us to put in an ordinance that will hinder our kids, our family members, and I’m totally against it,” she said. “It’s not fair because (other city departments have) family members working in this building.”\n\nCouncilperson Michelle Harlee questioned why an ordinance prohibiting hiring family members is necessary given that the City Council votes to approve any hires to council staff.\n\nCOUNCIL HIRING PRACTICES:Why Wilmington council still hasn't hired a chief of staff\n\n“I’m not sure what or why we are doing an ordinance when we already have a legislative process to hire council staff, which is distinctively different from what has happened in other municipalities where there were individuals that had the ability to singlehandedly pick family members, which is totally different from City Council.”\n\nThe ordinance will be up for a vote of the full council in April, Spadola said. Next week's City Council meeting will feature Mayor Mike Purzycki's budget presentation.\n\nGot a tip? Contact Amanda Fries at afries@delawareonline.com.

Legislative session is out, and lawmakers have wrapped up their work in Dover.\n\nFrom repealing the death penalty and two bills targeting “deepfakes,\" to a $1.1 billion bond bill and the assembly overriding a veto to support retirees' benefits coverage — it had been a busy time in Legislative Hall leading into the weekend. Not too busy, though, to miss the General Assembly also sending education-related bills to the governor's desk.\n\nIn this weekly roundup, we'll catch you up on some updates you may have missed.\n\n[Did we miss another good education story? Tell me about it: kepowers@gannett.com.]\n\nEducation highlights from Legislature's final week\n\nPromises of education reform hit the floor in Dover before the session's end.\n\nAs the bills make their way to Gov. John Carney for his signature, some highlights come in student wellness. One bill looks to establish a mental health services unit across Delaware high schools.\n\nOver three years, House Bill 200 aims to reach a final ratio of 250 students per full-time school counselor, school social worker or licensed clinical social worker in schools. The ratio for a full-time school psychologist would be 700 to 1. Total cost by fiscal year 2026 is estimated to reach $33.8 million, in combined local and state funds.\n\nAnother measure focused on free school meals.\n\nHouse Bill 125, as substituted, would require \"all public schools to offer only students who qualify for a reduced-price meal, under the federal School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program, a free breakfast and lunch every school day.\"\n\nAnd it could take effect the next school year if signed into law. Funding for the measure has already made the state’s budget, under the $242,000 designated for “child nutrition.”\n\nThis assembly also \"strengthened the workforce pipeline for public education,\" according to a Senate press release Sunday, creating the Delaware Educator Apprenticeship Program, codifying the teacher academy pathways program and helping schools recruit.\n\nAlso in education, Senate Bill 297 heads to Carney's desk.\n\nIt would require the Department of Education to \"update content standards and regulations using a non-exhaustive list of racial, ethnic and cultural groups” for K-12 education. This would include AAPI studies, as pushed by Make Us Visible Delaware since the fall, but theoretically not stop there.\n\nThe bill does not get into specifics or accountability guardrails. It does, however, start by adding to state standards in code, if signed into law.\n\n“I’m hopeful for a Delaware where students of any racial, cultural or ethnic group can see themselves reflected in their textbooks,\" said Devin Jiang, co-director of Make Us Visible Delaware. \"Delaware has an opportunity to stand against anti-Asian American bullying and embrace visibility for all.\"\n\nLawmakers also signaled support for the removal of Christina School District from Wilmington, nodding to the Redding Consortium's recommendation earlier this spring. That connects to broader goals for redistricting schools across Delaware's largest city.\n\nLook out for more coverage to come on this now-wrapped legislative session.\n\nWilmington with fewer school districts?Delaware lawmakers signal support for removing Christina School District from Wilmington\n\nBiden administration invests $16.7 million for marine technology — UD sees $1.75 million\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Commerce and NOAA announced $16.7 million in funding in a dozen awards to \"support the development of innovative, new technologies and public-private partnerships\" focused on sustainability, biodiversity and supporting climate adaptation.\n\nThese awards, fueled by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, look to boost marine technology innovation.\n\nAnd the University of Delaware will get a cut.\n\nUD, alongside its partners in Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, are recommended to receive $1.75 million, according to a press release, to \"establish and develop\" a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network for this region's coast.\n\n“To tackle climate change nationwide, we have to better understand and manage our coasts,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in the announcement. “These awards will advance new technologies needed to gain critical insights into the status and health of our coastal ecosystems.”\n\nUD:Delaware native George Thorogood receives the University of Delaware’s Medal of Distinction\n\n5 Delaware teens selected as Bank of America 2024 Student Leaders\n\nBank of America announced five \"2024 Student Leaders\" to highlight this year.\n\nFrom varsity sports to environmentalists, the class \"showcases a bright future for the First State,\" according to the financial outfit.

By eschewing what they see as outdated clichés about tie-dyes and Cheech and Chong movies and arming themselves with arguments rooted in social justice, fiscal policy and economic development.\n\nEmboldened by polls that show broad support for legalization both in Delaware and nationwide, they are showing up in force at town hall meetings, holding rallies and lobbying events in Dover, and privately pushing lawmakers to change their minds.\n\nBACKGROUND: Read details on how the legalization law would work\n\nREAD MORE: Do they have the votes?\n\nMost of them are doing all this in their spare time.\n\nFerguson, 56, is a code enforcement administrator for the City of Wilmington.\n\nA couple times a month, she also sets off pyrotechnic displays at Frawley Stadium, where she works as a private contractor for a Pennsylvania-based fireworks company.\n\n“It’s a lot to juggle but it’s a cause I believe in,” she said of her pro-marijuana lobbying efforts. “Thankfully, we’re all in this together, which helps more than I can tell you.”\n\nFerguson is among a handful of core activists — most of them women — working to change state laws and public attitudes about cannabis in Delaware.\n\nCollectively known as the Delaware Cannabis Policy Coalition, the group is made up of four main organizations: NORML, the Delaware Cannabis Advocacy Network, the state chapter of the NAACP and the Marijuana Policy Project, a national nonprofit dedicated to reforming state drug laws.\n\n“It’s what I would call a grass tips organization rather than a grassroots one,” said Maggie Ellinger-Locke, a 34-year lawyer with the Washington D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project. “The roots are the people helping out, while the tips are leading the effort in a more professional manner.”\n\nTheir strategy appears to be working.\n\nMembers of the coalition helped to advance Delaware’s medical marijuana program in 2011. They also successfully lobbied for passage of a 2015 bill that eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug.\n\nThe Delaware Marijuana Control Act was introduced in the state House of Representatives last month by Rep. Helene Keeley, D-Wilmington, and Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington — who also introduced bills that legalized medical marijuana and decriminalization.\n\nTurning heads in Legislative Hall\n\nKeeley believes marijuana advocates have momentum because citizens are growing more comfortable about voicing their support in public.\n\n\"I think there has been this fear. They think, 'I don't want to put myself out there,'\" Keeley said. \"But more and more, it is becoming less of a taboo thing to talk about.\"\n\nA big reason, Keeley argues, is that supporters have built stronger arguments beyond that of personal use.\n\n\"It's about much more than just people who want to enjoy cannabis like a glass of wine,\" Keeley said. \"There are people who are interested in creating a new era of business and economic development. They're talking about how we could create revenue for the state.\"\n\nBoth Keeley and Henry, D-Wilmington East, have said the core argument for legalization is social justice. They point out that black and poor people are far more likely to end up in jail for marijuana possession.\n\nREAD MORE: Governor holds marijuana round table at DelTech\n\n\"This bill would raise revenue, and that's good, but that's not the reason we're bringing this bill,\" Henry said.\n\nKeeley and Henry say they are confident the measure will get the backing it needs from 14 senators and 28 representatives — a two-thirds vote in both houses needed to change criminal penalties. That means it will need both Democratic and Republican votes.\n\n\"This is just my general feeling, but I don't think it has the votes yet,\" said Senate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford. \"I don't see it as a party issue, I think there are supporters and opponents on both sides.\"\n\nSimpson said most legislators have seen an increase in calls to support the legislation. He chalks that up to greater energy among activists, not a major increase in the number of supporters.\n\n\"They see other states relaxing the laws about recreational marijuana, they look at the state's fiscal situation and think they can persuade legislators on a monetary basis; I think they see an opening,\" Simpson said.\n\nSimpson said many members of the General Assembly want a more conclusive picture of how full legalization has affected other states. He says concerns linger about marijuana-impaired driving, an increase in the use of other, more harmful drugs and brain development in minors.\n\nOPINION: Editorial: It’s time for Delaware to make a decision on marijuana\n\n\"Why jump into something that really hasn't been studied enough?\" he said, sounding much like Gov. John Carney, a Democrat.\n\nRep. Larry Mitchell, D-Elsmere, thinks there's a chance legalization passes either this year or next year, during the same General Assembly session. If it doesn't, he thinks it will pass in the future, and \"not in the far-off future.\"\n\nMitchell, like Simpson and Carney, thinks the state needs more comprehensive information on how other states have fared. But he said advocates' efforts are bearing fruit.\n\n\"The right people for legalizing marijuana are at the forefront now and they're making all the correct arguments,\" Mitchell said. \"With that being said, they've caught the attention of quite a few legislators.\"\n\nSupporters have been particularly zealous in pressuring Carney, who thinks decriminalization and medical marijuana were good ideas but is resistant to the idea of full legalization.\n\nThe two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill would theoretically also mean it could survive a Carney veto. But lawmakers who are tentative supporters of legalization — particularly Democrats — may find it much harder to overrule the governor.\n\nRealizing this, the cannabis coalition and other proponents have heat on Carney. He has been holding town-hall discussions up and down the state that were supposed to be about Delaware's budget woes, but at virtually every event he was barraged with questions about marijuana.\n\nThe pleas became so persistent that Carney held a special roundtable discussion last week just to talk about marijuana. More than 100 people attended the event at Delaware Technical and Community College’s George Campus in Wilmington, and the vast majority of them clearly supported legalization.\n\nSeated at the table with Carney were Keeley, Henry and the leaders of the Cannabis Coalition.\n\nZoe Patchell, who leads the Delaware Cannabis Advocacy Network, was one of the panelists.\n\nA 36-year-old paralegal who works in Dover, Patchell is a registered lobbyist who co-founded her group, which boasts more than 80 dues-paying members.\n\nPatchell said she became active in marijuana reform after reading research that dispelled myths about the drug, many dating back to the infamous 1936 anti-cannabis propaganda film \"Reefer Madness.\"\n\n\"After getting access to the truth, I felt obligated to tell others,\" she said.\n\nPatchell first joined the Philadelphia chapter of NORML before becoming a board member of DeNORMAL, which won its charter in 2014.\n\n\"The biggest difference I've noticed in the public perception of marijuana has been at Legislative Hall,\" she said. \"I think legislators are more receptive now than ever before because they see the research themselves and are aware of how their constituents feel thanks to all of the polling.\"\n\nA public debate\n\nLegalization backers say the public is on their side.\n\nA University of Delaware poll last year suggests 61 percent of residents support legalization.\n\nNationally, support has steadily increased over the years. Gallup polling organization pegs support nationwide around 60 percent, up from 12 percent in 1969.\n\nThat's partially because more people understand the arguments for legalization, proponents like Keeley say.\n\nOne of those arguments: marijuana is safer than alcohol, which is legal. It isn't chemically addictive, it can't lead to an overdose death, and it does not provoke risky behavior in those who consume it.\n\nAnother argument is that the war on drugs has needlessly filled prisons at a time when sky-high incarceration rates of black and low-income Americans are in the spotlight. There's always the persuasive power of money — states like Colorado and Washington have reaped millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nLegislatures in at least 18 states have introduced bills to legalize recreational marijuana use and sales among adults this year. Many, like Delaware, are facing a budget deficit. Current estimates place the First State's shortfall at roughly $400 million. Legislators estimate the Delaware Marijuana Control Act could generate $22 million a year for state coffers.\n\n\"Lawmakers are looking for low-hanging fruit to fill these fiscal holes,\" said Ellinger-Locke, a 34-year-old attorney from Missiouri. \"With marijuana, they see an illicit market that can be regulated and taxed in a way that builds revenue and reduces the cost of arrests and incarceration.\"\n\nJust because pro-legalization advocacy is gaining steam doesn't mean the opposition is crumbling.\n\nAAA Mid-Atlantic, the influential automobile owners' association, has been asking lawmakers to tap the brakes, given concerns about marijuana-impaired driving.\n\n\"For the risks on the road posed by impaired/drugged driving and the unintended consequences for the public that states who have legalized recreational marijuana are now painfully learning, we, as a good corporate citizen of Delaware and a protector of AAA members for safe road travel, oppose any measure to commercialize the use of marijuana in the state of Delaware,\" said Cathy Rossi, AAA Mid-Atlantic's vice president of Public & Government Affairs.\n\nIn Colorado, AAA is neutral on all matters pertaining to marijuana. However, the organization's spokesman is intimately familiar with that state's marijuana law.\n\nSkyler McKinley spent a year as the deputy director of the Colorado Office of Marijuana Coordination and served as a press secretary for Gov. John Hickenlooper. He had a first-hand view of how Colorado implemented legalization in 2014 following passage of a voter referendum two years earlier.\n\n\"I think what we did was prove that the sky wasn't going to fall because of legal pot,\" he said. \"But there have been several hiccups along the way. My advice to Delaware would be to slow down, allow some time to see how these efforts play out in other states and above all bring opponents to the table early to carve out a bill everyone can live with.\"\n\nWarnings like those are one reason some Delaware state leaders are hesitating.\n\n\"This is a huge issue that we've got to make sure we get right before we go either way on it,\" said Rep. Mitchell.\n\nComplicating the picture is the fact that the federal government still considers marijuana an illegal narcotic, which has raised concerns about the interaction between federal and state law enforcement. Those concerns have been exacerbated by the election of President Donald Trump, whose Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has promised a more hard-line stance on marijuana than his predecessors under President Barack Obama.\n\nGiven all these concerns, cannabis advocates still face an uphill fight. But they remain optimistic that, sooner or later, they will triumph.\n\n\"I think we're really lucky to be riding this wave of public support,\" Ferguson said. \"And it's only going to build from here.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/27/elk-wildfire-rescue-escaped-bison-captured-diseased-raccoons-news-around-states/50289405/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa:The city’s annual Memorial Day program, which is free and open to the public, will be held at 9 a.m. Monday at Veterans Memorial Park in front of University Mall. Forrest Fitts, chairman of the Alabama Marines Foundation, will be the guest speaker. John Merkle, director of the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center, and David Blair, director of the University of Alabama Office of Veteran and Military Affairs, are also scheduled to speak. Audrey Watts and Clara Parker of the Alabama Choir School will sing the national anthem and student cadets from Paul W. Bryant High School Junior ROTC will present the colors. At the end of the ceremony, participants will place a wreath at the Military Order of the Purple Heart Monument.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: An aircraft crashed while attempting to land on a rural Alaska airstrip lined by trees, injuring all four people on board. Three people seriously injured in Tuesday’s crash at Dry Bay airstrip were sent to hospitals in Anchorage. A fourth person with minor injuries was treated in the nearby southeast Alaska community of Yakutat, the Coast Guard said in a statement. The names of those injured weren’t immediately released.\n\nArizona\n\nCasa Grande: Two women were arrested after about 500,000 fentanyl pills were found in an SUV pulled over for speeding on Interstate 10 in Arizona, police said. The pills were found concealed in collagen supplement bottles on Monday during a search that also turned up a handgun and a large amount of cash, police said. Martha Lopez, 31, and Tania Luna Solis, 30, were arrested on suspicion of crimes including possession of a narcotic drug for sale, according to police. Court records didn’t list attorneys who could comment on behalf of the women, who are from Phoenix. Two children in the vehicle were turned over to state child protection officials, police said.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: University of Arkansas-Fort Smith Chancellor Terisa Riley named Shadow JQ Robinson as the next provost and vice chancellor of academic affairs, effective July 1. Robinson, raised in rural Kentucky in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, said the Ozarks feel like home. And because of the work of those who came before him, he said, the campus and its position in the higher-education landscape feel inviting and inspiring. Robinson currently serves as the Dean of the College of Engineering and Natural at the University of Tennessee-Martin, where he provides academic, administrative and financial leadership to more than 100 faculty and staff, with an annual budget of more than $6 million.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A gun and a loaded magazine were found in a second-grade student’s desk after other students alerted the staff that a classmate had brought the weapon, officials said. The incident happened Tuesday at Edward Kemble Elementary, the Sacramento City Unified School District said in a statement to families. School staff called police “who secured the weapon and opened an investigation,” the statement said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:City Council members are coalescing around a potential ballot measure to increase their pay and benefits. Many details remain to be determined, including the magnitude of the proposed pay increase, when it would take effect and how compensation would be adjusted over time. But at a council work session on Tuesday, most council members expressed initial support for a November ballot measure, saying higher pay for council members could make council candidacy more feasible for a more diverse slate of community members. Council members currently make about $893 a month, or $10,712 annually. The mayor earns $1,340 a month, or $16,074 annually. Their pay is adjusted each year based on the consumer price index and has increased by about 80% since 1998. Council members don’t qualify for the health insurance provided to city employees.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city is interested in maintaining the docks at Howard T. Brown Memorial Park, but it will cost a little more to do so. The city is expected to make another 20% contribution to repairing the docks at the park as a part of the city’s American Rescue Plan Act funds, scheduled to be approved June 6. Although the original repairs focused on compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and replacing an unsafe platform, additional money will focus on repairing the pilings that have been deteriorating, after being underwater for almost 30 years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long said she supports the legalization of marijuana, showing a major chasm with Gov. John Carney, who on Tuesday vetoed a bill to legalize possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults for recreational use. Hall-Long did not comment on the governor’s veto or if a recreational marijuana industry should be created in Delaware. Many in Delaware have speculated that Hall-Long could run for governor in 2024. Carney is in his second term as governor and cannot run for re-election.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:After a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, organizers of the March for Our Lives are planning to march in D.C. on June 11 to demand gun control legislation and universal background checks from lawmakers, WUSA-TV reported. The original march took place on March 26, 2018, in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Florida House of Representatives gave final passage to sweeping property insurance legislation that creates a $2 billion reinsurance fund and rewrites rules on coverage denials and attorney fees, as lawmakers attempt to stabilize rising rates and insurer losses. The legislative package now awaits the signature of Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is suspending Georgia’s motor fuel tax for six more weeks. Kemp signed an executive order Thursday extending the tax break through July 14. Kemp used the announcement to again blame Democratic President Joe Biden for high gas prices. Kemp signed a law in March that passed with broad bipartisan support suspending the state’s gas tax through May 31. But with pump prices climbing again, Kemp signaled in recent days that he would extend the relief. Under state law, Kemp can suspend taxes by executive order as long as state lawmakers ratify the action the next time they meet. Kemp abated gas taxes in 2021 during a pipeline shutdown, and former Gov. Nathan Deal suspended gas taxes multiple times. Georgia’s gasoline price normally includes a federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon and a state tax of 29.1 cents per gallon. A number of cities and counties also charge taxes. Federal taxes on diesel fuel are 24.4 cents per gallon, and Georgia’s tax on diesel is 32.6 cents per gallon.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Catherine Payne, the head of the Hawaii Board of Education, said it’s time to consider developing a public school policy on preparing for active shooter scenarios. Payne spoke after a gunman killed 19 fourth-graders and their two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas on Tuesday. Payne’s time as board chairperson ends next month. She said she expects the new chairperson, to be named by Gov. David Ige, to direct the state Department of Education to assess and report on school preparations and safeguards regarding shootings.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A Washington man is dead after a boating accident on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Custer County. Robert Gray, 63, of Mill Creek, Washington, was floating on the river Tuesday afternoon “when his raft struck a log jam, throwing him into the water,” according to a news release from the sheriff’s office. The accident took place about 2:30 p.m. MDT near the Boundary Creek boat launch, northwest of Stanley. About noon Wednesday, Custer County Search and Rescue located a body matching Gray’s description by helicopter, submerged in a log jam downstream from Boundary Creek, the release said. Gray’s body was still in the river, as rescuers have determined the river is too dangerous for retrieval, the release said.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A bison that escaped a suburban Chicago farm in September and had been living in the wild since was recaptured Wednesday, officials said. The 1,300-pound bison some had come to know as Tyson ran off while being delivered to the Milk and Honey Farmstead in Wauconda, and officials said they believe she settled in Lakewood Forest Preserve in early April. Forest preserve officials brought in Loose Cattle Caught to help with her capture, and she was found early Wednesday and tranquilized enough to slow her, officials said. The bison is healthy and under observation. Loose Cattle Caught is working to contact her owner.\n\nIndiana\n\nPorter: A federal appeals court has declined to disturb an Indiana Supreme Court ruling, later codified into Indiana law, which declared that Lake Michigan’s shoreline is – and always has been – owned by the state for the public’s use. In Wednesday’s 3-0 decision, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said the three lakefront property owners in the town of Porter who claim their holdings include a private beach lack standing to challenge Indiana’s high court ruling and statute in federal court.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: A central Iowa business is being sued in federal court for allegedly claiming that its Chinese-made products, which collect data on crucial infrastructure that’s buried underground, are produced in the United States. Digital Control Inc., or DCI, which is based in the state of Washington, is suing Underground Magnetics of Johnston in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. The Johnston company is accused of trademark and patent infringement, unfair competition and false advertising. DCI claims the central Iowa company holds itself out as a manufacturer when it is “a sales arm of a Chinese company manufacturing its products in China.”\n\nKansas\n\nLarned:A lawsuit filed Thursday alleges long wait times at Larned State Hospital are unconstitutional and are inflicting mental and physical harm on those who are incarcerated. The complaint, brought in federal district court by the ACLU of Kansas, National Police Accountability Project and a Kansas City, Mo., law firm, said individuals are frequently waiting nearly a year in jail for an evaluation to determine if they are competent to stand trial. And patients determined unfit to stand trial also will have prolonged waits if they must be sent back to Larned for care so they might become competent to be tried. While individuals are sitting in jail, their criminal proceedings are paused. They are unable to access psychiatric treatment and are often placed in solitary confinement, something ACLU legal director Sharon Brett said is “cruel and unusual punishment.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An apartment complex in eastern Jefferson County has discriminated against potential tenants based on their race and source of income, according to a report from the Louisville Metro Human Relations Commission. Terraces at Forest Springs, managed by St. Louis-based Michelson Realty Company, twice discouraged Black renters with federal housing vouchers from applying to the complex, located near Anchorage, while encouraging white tenants with vouchers to apply, according to a complaint that was validated by human relations employees. Michelson Realty has denied it discriminated against tenants. It will soon face a hearing before a representative from the Kentucky Office of the Attorney General.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Spanking a student in Louisiana schools would be forbidden unless school officials have written permission from the child’s parent, under legislation approved Wednesday by the state House. The bill by Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Metairie Republican, had started out as a ban on corporal punishment in schools. As amended on the House floor, the bill would prohibit the spanking of a child in an elementary or secondary school unless the child’s parent or guardian has signed a consent form permitting corporal punishment. The bill passed 70-28 and goes next to the Senate, where it will need to get through a committee hearing and a floor vote before the current session’s adjournment deadline on June 6.\n\nMaine\n\nHollis: Some nature advocates are worried that Maine residents are killing the wrong caterpillar as they seek to wipe out an invasive species that causes a rash with its toxic hairs. The browntail moth caterpillar is an invasive pest that can cause a rash and respiratory distress in humans. They’re expected to be especially bad this year because of weather conditions. Destroying the caterpillars’ nests is one way to mitigate their spread. However, some residents are destroying the nests of Eastern tent caterpillars, which are a different species, the Bangor Daily News reported. Tent caterpillars serve as important forage food for Maine birds, Maine Audubon said. Unlike browntail moths, they’re native to North America. As for browntail moths, it’s too late to destroy their nests because they’re no longer occupied at this time of the year, said Jim Dill, pest management specialist with University of Maine Cooperative Extension.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:A raccoon has tested positive for canine distemper, and several others are showing symptoms near the bayside campgrounds at Assateague Island National Seashore. The highly contagious virus doesn’t affect humans, but dogs and other small mammals, such as foxes, skunks and river otters, can become infected. It’s transmitted through saliva, urine, feces and respiratory secretions, according to Cornell University Wildlife Health Labs. Symptoms begin 10 to 14 days after infection and include discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, fever, coughing and pneumonia. Park officials recommend campers ensure their dogs have a current distemper vaccine and be kept on a 6-foot leash at all times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: The flood of disinformation that is spread and amplified on social media represents a threat to fragile democracies, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said during the keynote speech at Harvard University’s commencement, exhorting graduates to do their part of fight it.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A federal appeals court dismissed a Catholic school’s challenge to Michigan’s 2020-21 mask order. The Whitmer administration policy during the COVID-19 pandemic was dropped about a year ago, making the lawsuit moot, the court said. The appeal was heard by 17 judges at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It was a rare step; most appeals are heard by three-judge panels. Resurrection School in Lansing and some parents sued in 2020, saying a state mask order violated the free exercise of religion, among other objections. A federal judge, however, ruled in favor of the state and declined to suspend the policy with an injunction. The statewide mask order ended in June 2021. Any subsequent school mask mandates came from local health departments.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAitkin: A space heater might have been involved in a fire that killed a couple and their young grandson in Aitkin County, sheriff’s officials said. The fire broke out in a trailer home early Sunday in Wealthwood Township north of Lake Mille Lacs. Authorities said sheriff’s deputies and firefighters arrived, and once the flames were extinguished, they located the three bodies in the charred debris. Officials identified the victims as 69-year-old Jeff Cleys, 55-year-old Michelle Cleys and 6-year-old Grant Diehl, of Deerwood.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A preliminary snapshot of third graders’ literacy proficiency in Mississippi showed a passing rate nearly the same as before the COVID-19 pandemic, the state education superintendent said Thursday. The statement said 73.9% of 31,068 students passed the test for the 2021-22 school year. That’s compared to 74.5% in 2019, the last normal school year, when 34,998 students took the initial test. State law requires Mississippi third graders to pass a reading assessment to qualify for promotion to the fourth grade.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Police are searching for a driver of a stolen pickup truck they said fatally hit a pedestrian as it fled from officers. The chase began Wednesday afternoon on Kansas City’s east side when officers spotted the stolen pickup and tried to pull it over, police said in a news release. The truck fled, ramming a patrol car in the process. Police said the officers called off the chase as the truck entered the northbound lanes of Interstate 435 traveling southbound. Less than a minute later, police found the body of a man in the road who appeared to have been hit by the fleeing truck. The truck was found a short distance away, and a woman who was a passenger in the truck was arrested. The driver of the truck fled on foot and, despite a search involving helicopters and police dogs, was not found, police said. The name of the pedestrian killed was not immediately released.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings:Conservative minister Jordan “JD” Hall admitted he fabricated a story about a transgender Native American lobbyist allegedly berating a state senator so badly that he sought the protection of the Montana Senate’s sergeant-at-arms. In a libel case that has been ongoing for more than a year the minister admitted that he fabricated the story and apologized to Adrian Jawort, a lobbyist who testified on many issues related to Native Americans. The settlement and a potential $250,000 claim was reached as Hall is going through the bankruptcy process, seeking protection from a libel case, as well as discharging attorney’s fees he racked up during the libel fight. Two weeks ago, Hall was arrested on charges of driving under the influence and illegally carrying a concealed weapon, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A man was sentenced to 70 years to life in prison Wednesday for the shooting death of a police officer in 2020. Felipe Vazquez, now 19, shot Officer Mario Herrera when he tried to escape from police who were serving an arrest warrant for him at his Lincoln home. Vazquez was wanted in the stabbing death of 36-year-old Edward Varejcka months earlier. Vazquez was sentenced to another 59 to 86 years for attempted assault on a second officer, escape and four gun charges, the Lincoln Star reported. He will not be eligible for parole for about 70 years. Vazquez was convicted in March.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gambling in Nevada continued a 14-month hot streak in April and a return of international flights boosted travel nearly to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic began more than two years ago, according to Las Vegas airport and state casino revenue reports. The state Gaming Control Board said the $1.13 billion that casinos statewide reported winning last month represented the best April ever for the state, Clark County and the Las Vegas Strip. Nevada casinos have now reported winning at least $1 billion every month since March 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A man pleaded guilty in federal court to defrauding government programs that were intended to provide assistance related to the COVID-19 pandemic. George Adyns, 51, of Sandown, who was chief financial officer of several companies in Plaistow, directed employees in March 2020 to file for state unemployment benefits while continuing to work, prosecutors said. The state paid more than $49,000 in fraudulently obtained benefits. Adyns also fraudulently obtained loans totaling more than $135,000, prosecutors said. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 31 on a wire fraud charge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: One month into existence, New Jersey’s recreational marijuana market has done $24 million in sales and regulators on Tuesday voted to grant permits to nearly a dozen new recreational cannabis retailers in their first public meeting since the market opened to the public last month. How long before the new dispensaries open, though, isn’t known, and there will be additional regulatory hurdles before the new shops start selling to adults 21 and over.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Firefighters rescued an abandoned newborn elk calf found amid the ashes of the nation’s largest wildfire as calving season approaches its peak in New Mexico and fires rage across the American West. Missoula, Montana-based firefighter Nate Sink said he happened upon the motionless elk calf on the ground of a fire-blackened New Mexico forest as he patrolled and extinguished lingering hot spots. “The whole area is just surrounded in a thick layer of ash and burned trees. I didn’t think it was alive,” said Sink, who was deployed to the state to help contain a wildfire that by Wednesday had spread across 486 square miles and destroyed hundreds of structures. The 32-pound singed bull calf, dubbed “Cinder,” was taken for care to a nearby ranch and is now regaining strength at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Espanola, north of Santa Fe. Veterinarian Kathleen Ramsay at Cottonwood Rehab said she paired Cinder with a full-grown surrogate elk to be raised with as little human contact as possible. Ramsay said the calf hopefully can be released into the wild in December after elk-hunting season. The strategy has worked repeatedly with elk tracked by tags as they rejoined wild herds.\n\nNew York\n\nEast Greenbush: Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed raising the age to 21 for purchasing the type of firearms used in recent mass shootings in Buffalo and Texas, and possibly for other weapons, as well. The Democrat said she wants to work with the state Legislature to raise the legal purchasing age for AR-15-style rifles. Only six states - California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Vermont and Washington - require buyers to be at least 21 instead of 18 to purchase rifles or shotguns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Those states have the same higher age limit for handguns, while a few other states have no age limits at all for any firearm, the gun-control advocacy group says. New York City already, by local law, prohibits anyone under age 21 from possessing any firearm, with some exceptions for people engaged in military drills or competitions, or while under the supervision of a permitted gun owner.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilmington: A former dean at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington is returning to the school as its chancellor, officials said. Aswani Volety, serving as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Elon University, was elected unanimously by the UNC Board of Governors during its meeting in Chapel Hill. Volety replaces Jose Sartarelli, who is retiring in June after seven years as UNCW’s chancellor. Volety is the former dean of UNCW’s College of Arts and Sciences and former executive director of UNCW’s Center for Marine Science. He spent five years at UNCW from 2014 to 2019 before serving as the chief academic officer and chief operating officer at Elon University, according to a news release. UNCW, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, has an enrollment of more than 18,000 students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Developers want to build a $390 million wind farm in south-central North Dakota. The state Public Service Commission has scheduled a hearing in late June for Badger Wind, a project under development by Orsted Onshore North America. The company is proposing a 74-turbine farm west of Wishek. It would have a generating capacity of 250 megawatts, which is comparable to powering 70,000 homes, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Orsted Onshore plans to start construction in September if it receives the necessary permits. The project would be completed late in 2023. Badger was still looking for an entity to purchase the wind farm’s output when it filed its application with the PSC in February.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican state lawmakers have fast-tracked a fall ballot measure that would expressly prohibit noncitizens from voting in local elections. The proposed noncitizen voting ban – which emerged just last week and cleared the Ohio House 68-28 on Wednesday – stands to ignite GOP voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections, when Republicans hope dissatisfaction with Democrats in Washington will help them regain control of Congress and win overwhelming Statehouse majorities. The push comes as some places in the country have begun to allow legally documented, voting-age noncitizens to cast ballots. It’s legal in New York City in races for mayor, City Council and other municipal offices; and in San Francisco for school board races – but not for positions such as president, governor or U.S. House members. The Ohio constitutional amendment moves next to the state Senate, where it needs a similar three-fifths majority to advance to the November statewide ballot.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed a bill requiring public school students to use only the bathroom of the sex listed on their birth certificate. About a dozen conservative states have passed laws regarding transgender use of bathrooms, transgender participation in school sports, and gender-affirming treatments or surgery for young people. The bill passed overwhelmingly in the Republican-controlled House and Senate last week, and Stitt signed it on Wednesday.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Some customers of Pacific Power would see their power bills increase 14% if a plan proposed by the company is approved. In the plan filed with the state, the utility is asking for an $84 million yearly increase in rates for customers in Oregon, a 6.8% increase. But that increase would impact different types of customers in different ways. The average residential bill is $91.89 for customers in single-family homes using 900 kilowatt hours per month. The company’s request would increase that to $104.90 per month. That would be a 14.2% increase. Also, multifamily homes that use an average of 600 kilowatts per month would see their bills increase $6.97 per month, an 11% increase, under the proposal.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWolf Creek: State police said they have solved the slaying of a Chicago man whose burning body was found 42 years ago near Interstate 80 in a northwestern town. Edwin Rodriguez was identified through the use of DNA testing and genealogy tools, authorities announced Wednesday. Rodriguez was 18 when he and a family friend, Nestor Quintanal, left Chicago for Florida in the fall of 1980, and Rodriguez’s family never heard from him again. His burning body was found Nov. 6, 1980, near Interstate 80 in Wolf Creek. Authorities said Quintanal – who died in Florida in 2002 at the age of 71 – is believed to have killed Rodriguez, who had third-degree burns on 70% of his body. A possible motive for the killing was not disclosed. The Mercer County District Attorney’s office paid for state police to have an advanced DNA analysis performed, and in 2007 the office secured a DNA profile of the victim through evidence collected at the autopsy. In January 2019, the profile was sent to a lab for DNA phenotype testing and a genetic genealogy screening. The testing linked the body to a first cousin of Rodriguez, authorities said. Police reached out to the individual, who was able to confirm the victim was Rodriguez. His remains have since been returned to his family in Chicago.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin of the Providence diocese sparked internet fury by suggesting Catholics boycott a classic North Kingstown donut shop over its collection of donations to Planned Parenthood. In response, Allie’s said each month, it allows an employee to select an organization for which to collect donations at checkout. Planned Parenthood was chosen for May. Allie’s said it has raised money for many other organizations, including Ronald McDonald House of New England, the North Kingstown Food Pantry, T.A.P.S., Friends of Exeter Animals, Project Sweet Peas and the J. Arthur Trudeau Center. Reached by The Providence Journal, the diocese said Tobin wouldn’t be saying anything other than his tweet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolina jurist Michelle Childs – recently under consideration for a slot on the U.S. Supreme Court – was confirmed on a 17-5 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee for a spot on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It now goes to the full Senate for a vote. Childs, 56, has been a federal judge on South Carolina’s District Court for more than a decade. Earlier this year, she was on a shortlist of candidates being considered by President Joe Biden for an upcoming vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, given the pending retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Ellsworth Air Force Base has broken ground for the first of three dozen major projects that will support the incoming long-range B-21 bomber. The 95,000-square-foot Low Observable Restoration Facility, or LO, will have “specialized equipment to ensure that the free world’s next generation stealth bomber is sustained and maintained,” said Gen. Anthony Cotton, Air Force Global Strike Commander. 28th Bomb Wing Commander Col. Joseph Sheffield called the event not only a great day for South Dakota, but also for the United States. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson called the B-21 an important part of this nation’s military history.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state report said nearly half of Tennessee public high school seniors in the class of 2021 did not attend college or technical school right after graduating. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission report said the college-going rate has dropped from 63.8% for the 2017 class to 52.8% for the 2021 class. Officials pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic while noting a drop of 9 percentage points from the 2019 class to the 2021 class. Nationally, freshman enrollment dropped 9.2% between 2019 and 2021, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Current Term Enrollment Estimates.\n\nTexas\n\nManor: Four people were detained in connection with a threat made against Manor High School, police said Thursday. Officers at about 9:25 a.m. conducted what they called a high-risk stop of a vehicle entering the Manor High School campus, police said. Four people were detained, and police said two of them are suspects in two recent threats against Manor students. Just before midnight Thursday, Manor police had said they were investigating a social media post that showed a hunting rifle with a male voice saying “(expletive) Manor.” The post had Thursday’s date in the caption. Authorities were told the video was sent to several Manor middle school students earlier that day, but officers have not yet confirmed if that is true.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Another poor spring runoff has exacerbated Utah’s ongoing drought problem, with nearly every part of the state now rating as under “severe” or “extreme” drought, water officials said Thursday. The statewide “snow water equivalent,” or how much water melted off Utah’s mountains and poured into its streams and reservoirs, ended up at about 75% of normal this year, according to a new report from the state Division of Water Resources, leaving 99.86% of the state under those two categories of drought. The dry conditions were likely to lead to another year of limited restrictions and other efforts to curb water use while also drying out vegetation and making the state more susceptible to wildfires. Eighteen of Utah’s largest 45 reservoirs were below 55% of available capacity as of Thursday, with overall statewide storage at 63% of capacity. This time last year, reservoirs were about 67% of capacity. Great Salt Lake was expected to drop to a new historic low.\n\nVermont\n\nEast Burke: Canadian mountain bikers are back again in the Northeast Kingdom after a two-year absence when the border was closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Abby Long, executive director of the Kingdom Trails Association. “In the past about 38% of our trail users were our neighbors to the north,” Long said in an email. “We missed welcoming our Canadian trail users for the past two years.” Kingdom Trails, comprising more than 100 miles of mountain bike trails across the properties of 104 private landowners, has become a national draw for mountain bikers traveling to the Northeast Kingdom and the towns of Burke, Lyndonville, Kirby and East Haven. Long said the trail system creates an estimated $10 million economic impact every year – when there’s not a pandemic.\n\nVirginia\n\nVerona: The Blue Ridge Area Food Bank is participating in the USDA's Summer Food Service Program, sponsoring six locations starting Tuesday, helping to ensure that children across the region have access to nutritious food. One-in-12 children in the Food Bank service area are food insecure, according to the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank. The Summer Food Service Program is designed to reach children who might not get nutritious meals at home over the school’s summer break. Students receiving free or reduced-price meals at school are at particular risk.\n\nWashington\n\nMoxee: Yakima County Hearing Examiner Gary Cuillier approved a conditional-use permit for the Black Rock Solar Energy Project, a photovoltaic solar power facility to be located 20 miles east of Moxee on both sides of State Route 24, the Yakima Herald-Republic reported. The project will feature 264,000 solar panels spread over a 1,060-acre site north of the Rattlesnake Hills and roughly 8 miles south of the Columbia River as it flows into Benton County and past the former Hanford nuclear reactor site.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSouth Charleston: A Pennsylvania resident caught a record carp while fishing from the bank of Summersville Lake in West Virginia, regulators said. Ayden Minick of Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, caught and released the carp on May 7, the Division of Natural Resources said in a news release. It measured by a DNR fisheries biologist at 41.2 inches long, breaking the record of 41 inches caught in 1988 by Charles Cook at Stonecoal Lake. The carp weighed 45 pounds, which was just short of the record of 47 pounds set in 1998 in a Preston County farm pond.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Rising material prices and legal expenses are expected to add nearly $50 million more to the cost of a power transmission line being built across southern Wisconsin. American Transmission Co., ITC Midwest and Dairyland Power Cooperative are building the 345-kilovolt Cardinal-Hickory Creek transmission line that would run more than 100 miles from Dane County to Dubuque County in Iowa. The utilities have notified the Wisconsin Public Service Commission that the overall cost of the project is now expected to top more than $500 million, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. In the filing, the utilities cited considerable increases in the cost of steel, conductors, insulators and other materials.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney said Wednesday she tested positive for the coronavirus and planned to work through minor symptoms she said she was experiencing. The Republican’s diagnosis came amid a nationwide surge in new coronavirus cases and reports of positive tests from Cheney’s congressional colleagues, including North Carolina Democrat David Price, who tested positive last weekend.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/25/wildfire-break-social-media-suits-hate-crime-reporting-news-around-states/50279845/", "title": "Wildfire break, social media suits: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: A 54-year-old residence hall for more than 40,000 young women at the University of Alabama will come tumbling down this summer. Its replacement has been rising next door, not as tall or distinctive but with greater depth, breadth, and contemporary tech and comforts. The second Julia Tutwiler Hall – a distinctive, splayed-Y-shaped modernist tower – is planned for demolition on Independence Day. The last of the 13-story dorm’s residents moved out at the end of exams this month. The new Tutwiler, a $145 million project underway since summer 2019, is on pace to open in the fall. The new residence hall, the culmination of a 10-year plan, follows the Georgian neo-classical style more common to Capstone edifices. Unlike the second Tutwiler, the third Tutwiler is wider than it is tall, about half the height of the old tower, with a green-space quadrangle at the heart of the building. In addition to updated basics, electricity and plumbing and the like, the new 1,284-bed Tutwiler will include enhanced connectivity, safety and security measures. In addition to the double-occupancy rooms, it will also offer study, lounge and fitness rooms, with a 16,600 square-foot multipurpose space that doubles as a Federal Emergency Management Agency-rated storm shelter capable of housing all its residents. Former residents – or anyone nostalgic – can still take on a piece of the old Tutwiler through Aug. 31. Room numbers are being sold for $50 and commemorative bricks for $100.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Razor clam fisheries in parts of the Cook Inlet area will remain closed for sport and personal use this year, continuing a years­long trend of closures as the clam population has struggled to regain numbers. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says eastern Cook Inlet beaches from the mouth of the Kenai River to the southernmost tip of the Homer Spit are closed to clamming through the end of 2022, Anchorage TV station KTUU reports. The department said in a statement that surveys completed at Ninilchik and Clam Gulch beaches this month and last showed numbers below the threshold required to allow for limited clamming. The department said the abundance of adult razor clams at Ninilchik was 64% below where it needed to be to allow for public clamming, while the Clam Gulch population was 17% below. Razor clam fisheries closures on the eastern side of Cook Inlet date to 2015. State biologists and Fish and Game officials have struggled to explain what is causing the low numbers, but officials have pointed to a November 2010 winter storm as playing a role. The storm turned up hundreds of thousands of clams along the shores, worsening a trend of declining populations in the area.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An impassioned effort by some Republicans in the state Senate to ban the use of ballot drop boxes failed Monday. Scottsdale Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita’s efforts to change a proposal requiring drop boxes to have video monitoring was blocked by fellow GOP senators who knew House Republicans weren’t on board with the harsher proposal. And the whole exercise ended up being in vain after Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, joined all Senate Democrats in rejecting the measure outright. Ugenti-Rita said drop boxes are rife with possibilities for “ballot harvesting,” a pejorative term for dropping off completed ballots for other people. The Legislature in 2016 made it a felony to return another person’s mail ballots unless it is for a family member or if the person returning the ballot is a caregiver. She pointed to a recent documentary that alleged thousands of ballots were illegally cast in 2020 battleground states. Fact-checkers have shown the arguments made in “2000 Mules” are full of unsupported allegations that thousands of ballots were illegally deposited into drop boxes. “If you think ballot boxes contribute to ballot harvesting and can be manipulated, you would ban them, not require that we tape them,” Ugenti-Rita said. “It’s too late at that point.”\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: University of Arkansas-Fort Smith Chancellor Terisa Riley has announced the appointment of Shadow JQ Robinson as the school’s next provost and vice chancellor of academic affairs, effective July 1. Ken Warden, associate vice chancellor for compliance and legislative affairs, who chaired the search, said the team was able to bring five highly skilled finalists to campus from a variety of backgrounds. “We worked diligently to ensure all UAFS constituents had the opportunity to engage with each of them,” he said. “The committee worked tirelessly to complete a thorough search, and the process resulted in a great hire with Dr. Robinson. His energy and excitement for our work is infectious. I think he is a perfect fit, poised to lead us into our next phase of greatness.” Robinson, raised in rural Kentucky in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, said the Ozarks feel like home. And thanks to the work of those who came before him, he said, the UAFS campus and its position in the higher education landscape feel both inviting and inspiring.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon hold social media companies responsible for harming children who have become addicted to their products, permitting parents to sue platforms like Instagram and TikTok for up to $25,000 per violation under a bill that passed the state Assembly on Monday. The bill defines “addiction” as kids under 18 who are harmed – either physically, mentally, emotionally, developmentally or materially – and who want to stop or reduce how much time they spend on social media but can’t because they are preoccupied or obsessed with it. Business groups have warned that if the bill passes, social media companies would most likely cease operations for children in California rather than face the legal risk. The proposal would only apply to social media companies that had at least $100 million in gross revenue in the past year, appearing to take aim at social media giants like Facebook and others that dominate the marketplace. It would not apply to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu or to companies that only offer email and text messaging services. “The era of unfettered social experimentation on children is over, and we will protect kids,” said Assemblymember Jordan Cunningham, a Republican from San Luis Obispo County and author of the bill.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill into law Monday at Pueblo City Hall to ensure that parents who use assisted reproductive technology have equal protections under the law, regardless of their gender. “This bill is very simple,” Polis said at the signing. “It just makes it easier and reduces paperwork for counties and for both parents of a child through assisted reproduction to be the parents of a child, instead of one parent having to do an adoption process, which takes time and costs the county money. “This makes it automatic, just like it is for non-assisted reproduction.” Formerly called the “family affirmation act,” the bill was renamed in honor of the baby daughter of Colorado House Majority Leader Daneya Esgar, D-Pueblo, and her wife, Heather Palm. “When I was carrying Marlo as the birth mother, my wife realized that even though she was the biological parent, she had no actual legal rights to Marlo unless she went through a stepparent adoption, which we thought was incredibly unfair,” Esgar said. Adoption is a costly, lengthy process, involving steps such as in-home evaluation and background checks, Esgar said. Most parents do not have to go through that process, she noted.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials hope timely, stepped-up reporting of hate crime investigations by local police to a new State Police investigative unit will help lead to the prevention and detection of such crimes before something violent happens. A new law requires all local and tribal police departments, resident state troopers, and constables with law enforcement duties to notify the new Hate Crimes Investigative Unit of a broader list of crimes involving bigotry and bias within 14 days, using a new standardized system, beginning Jan. 1. They must continue to share information about their local investigations with the State Police unit. “Pretty much every week, every month we get a new national report about the extent of the increase in hate crimes,” said Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chair of the General Assembly’s Public Safety Committee. “These crimes are among the most corrosive ones we have because they go after the bonds that ties together as communities and as a state.” The law, signed March 10 by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont and highlighted during a ceremonial signing Tuesday, comes days before the State Bond Commission is scheduled to release a second $5 million allocation for security grants for houses of worship and eligible nonprofits at risk of being the target of a hate crime or violent act.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Gov. John Carney on Tuesday vetoed a bill to legalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana by adults for recreational use. In vetoing the measure, Carney reiterated his previously expressed concerns about legalizing recreational pot – concerns that did not dissuade fellow Democrats from pushing the legislation through the General Assembly. “I recognize the positive effect marijuana can have for people with certain health conditions, and for that reason, I continue to support the medical marijuana industry in Delaware,” Carney said in returning the bill to the state House. “I supported decriminalization of marijuana because I agree that individuals should not be imprisoned solely for the possession and private use of a small amount of marijuana – and today, thanks to Delaware’s decriminalization law, they are not. That said, I do not believe that promoting or expanding the use of recreational marijuana is in the best interests of the state of Delaware, especially our young people.” Carney’s veto comes just days after legislation to establish a state-run marijuana industry in Delaware failed to clear the state House for a second time. It’s unclear whether Democratic lawmakers will try to override Carney’s veto, which would be a rare occurrence, with a veto-override effort last popping up in 1990 and last succeeding in 1977.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Nurses Association and Howard University Hospital have reached an agreement following nine months of a labor dispute, WUSA-TV reports. The agreement was ratified May 19, after months of negotiations between the two departments. DCNA and the hospital said the agreement will help to advance patient care and provides nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and dietitians with new resources, which will include high-quality care and services for district residents, increased compensation and benefits, and further their ability to administer safely. “It was only through the efforts and collective action of our members, with support from the community, that we were able to achieve agreement on a fair and equitable contract that recognizes our hard working healthcare professionals and their commitment to caring for patients who come to HUH for care,” Edward Smith, DCNA executive director, said in a media release. The news comes after nine months of actions from nurses at HUH that included petitions to negotiate a fair contract, an informational picket in January and a 24-hour strike in April. The agreement ensures that there will be no pay cuts for senior health care professionals in the overall compensation. The agreement will continue to maintain patient care.\n\nFlorida\n\nSanford: Two political operatives and an independent candidate who opponents say hardly campaigned and only entered a state Senate race in central Florida in 2020 to siphon off votes from a Democrat were criminally charged Tuesday. Prosecutors filed election finance charges against the candidate, Jestine Iannotti, as well as Seminole County GOP chairman Ben Paris and political consultant James “Eric” Foglesong in Seminole County, a suburb of Orlando. Some candidates with no party affiliation, “commonly referred to as ‘ghost’ candidates, have been used by political parties as a way to close elections or siphon off votes,” State Attorney Phil Archer, whose jurisdiction covers Seminole County, said in a statement. “While not illegal per se, many have questioned the ethics of the practice. However, when that candidate and the partisan political operatives involved violate election finance laws by illegally funding those races and filing false reports, it is the responsibility of government to act.” The case was investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. According to the FDLE, Iannotti illegally accepted a $1,200 cash donation from Foglesong for her campaign. The two falsely used the names of others as contributors in state campaign finance reports in order to skirt Florida laws on campaign contributions, the FDLE said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A prosecutor on Monday said he would not prosecute police officers involved in a May 2020 confrontation with two college students who were stunned with Tasers and pulled from a car while they were stuck in traffic caused by protests over George Floyd’s death. Messiah Young and Taniyah Pilgrim, two students at historically Black colleges in Atlanta, were confronted by police in downtown Atlanta on May 30, 2020. Within days, then-Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard announced arrest warrants had been obtained for six officers. “Not only was law enforcement acting within the scope of their legal authority in their actions to obtain compliance, their actions were also largely consistent with the Atlanta Police Department’s own use of force policy,” Cherokee Judicial Circuit District Attorney Samir Patel said in a statement Monday. Patel dismissed the warrants filed against the officers involved: Ivory Streeter, Mark Gardner, Lonnie Hood, Roland Claud, Willie Sauls and Armon Jones. He said he is “unable to find probable cause to prosecute the officers involved for a crime under Georgia law.” Lance LoRusso, a lawyer representing Streeter and Gardner, said his clients “have been vindicated” and look forward to returning to full duty.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday signed legislation providing freedom of speech and press protections to students publishing school-sponsored media at the state’s K-12 public schools and the University of Hawaii. The “Hawaii Student Journalism Protection Act” also protects advisers from retaliation for refusing to infringe upon student press freedom. Ige told lawmakers and students gathered for a bill-signing ceremony at McKinley High School that he was the page one editor of The Messenger at Pearl City High School. “Providing student journalists with the same protections that exist for them in the industry gives them real-world opportunities and provides them a more enhanced laboratory for democracy and learning,” Ige said. Althea Cunningham, a recent McKinley graduate and student reporter at The Pinion, submitted written testimony saying students should be able to chase and report the truth with confidence. “Schools are supposed to help prepare students for the future. How is letting administrators get away with killing articles they don’t agree with helping our future journalists?” she said. Supporters say similar laws already exist in 15 other states.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A local woman was sentenced Tuesday to two months in jail for her participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol building. Pam Hemphill, of Boise, will also be on probation for three years and must pay a $500 fine, U.S. District Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said. Hemphill pleaded guilty earlier this year to one misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol building. In exchange, prosecutors dropped three additional misdemeanor charges. During Hemphill’s sentencing hearing, Lamberth said it’s “tempting to be lenient,” but he can’t justify letting her just walk away after her offenses at the Capitol. Like many other defendants who have been charged in connection with the siege, Hemphill posted videos to social media sites that showed her in Washington, D.C., in the days surrounding the insurrection and at the Capitol when it was happening. In one video, she compared breaking windows at the federal building to actions protesters at the Idaho Statehouse had taken the previous year. In another, she said she avoided getting into trouble after being found inside the Capitol by telling police she became lost after being pushed into the building by the crowd. The videos were later removed. “Sometimes when I see those videos I want to give you the maximum,” Lamberth said.\n\nIllinois\n\nOakbrook Terrace: A former suburban Chicago mayor pleaded guilty Monday to taking kickbacks to support the use of red-light cameras in his community. Tony Ragucci, who resigned in 2020, admitted to getting $88,000 when he was leading Oakbrook Terrace. He pleaded guilty to fraud and tax crimes. It’s the latest conviction related to how SafeSpeed LLC dealt with some Chicago-area communities that installed cameras to record traffic violations. SafeSpeed said that it didn’t authorize payoffs and that any kickbacks were part of a scheme by people who are no longer associated with the company. In April, Louis Presta, who was mayor of Crestwood, was sentenced to a year in prison for accepting $5,000. Assistant U.S. Attorney James Durkin said Ragucci is cooperating with investigators, assistance that could help him when he gets a sentence. He was a police officer before being elected mayor in 2009. Oakbrook Terrace’s red-light cameras produced nearly $17 million in revenue from 2017 to April 2021, the Chicago Tribune reports. Ragucci had defended the cameras as a way to encourage safe driving.\n\nIndiana\n\nWarsaw: A pastor who confessed to “adultery” years ago with a teenager publicly informed his congregation last weekend after church leaders confronted him, the church said Tuesday. John Lowe II has resigned, New Life Christian Church and World Outreach in Warsaw said in a statement on its website. Lowe, 65, told church members Sunday that he had “committed adultery” and wanted their forgiveness. Moments later, a woman stepped to the microphone and said the pastor had a sexual relationship with her when she was 16, according to video. “It was 27 years ago, not 20. … I was just 16 when you took my virginity on your office floor. Do you remember that? I know you do,” she said as Lowe stood nearby. She said the “lies and the manipulation have to stop.” The church said leaders confronted Lowe recently after the woman told others about a “long-held secret.” The church said the sexual conduct continued into her 20s. “We are hurting and broken for a woman who has lovingly attended and served in the church for many years, as well as for her husband and family,” the church’s statement said. “It is our deepest prayer and commitment to love, support, encourage and help her through a process of healing in any way in which we are able.” The church said “none of this” was previously known by staff.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: After decades of efforts, Iowans are about to see a major change in how and where they can turn in their empty pop cans and beer bottles to get back the nickel deposit paid at the point of purchase. Iowa lawmakers’ agreement to reframe the recycling program comes as supporters and opponents alike have warned the system is on the brink of failure and could have collapsed without legislative action. Frustrated by years of work without tangible progress, key lawmakers also had threatened to repeal the entire law – known as the bottle bill – if they failed to reach a deal this year. The Iowa Senate voted 30-15 Monday to pass Senate File 2378. The House previously passed the bill in April on a 73-17 vote, so it now goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for her signature. Under current law, Iowans can return empty cans and bottles to grocery stores and other retailers to get back a 5-cent deposit that they paid when buying the drink. The new legislation would triple the handling fee collected by the roughly 60 redemption centers around the state and authorize mobile redemption options in an effort to make their businesses financially viable. Meanwhile, grocery stores, gas stations and other retailers could refuse to accept empty bottles and cans under most conditions.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Legislature adjourned for the year Monday without handling efforts to legalize medical marijuana and enact a major overhaul of the state’s election laws. But after two years in which Gov. Laura Kelly rejected more bills than any governor in recent memory, Republicans once again overrode her veto and enacted two pieces of legislation into law. One would delay the renegotiation of $4 billion worth of contracts with private firms that serve as managed care organizations for the state’s Medicaid program. They also pushed through a bill that would prevent the governor from entering into legal agreements that change state election law without legislative approval. Meanwhile, lawmakers passed several remaining pieces of legislation, including a framework for the state’s new 988 suicide prevention hotline and a property tax break for small businesses affected by COVID-19 orders. Lawmakers did not need to pass a new set of congressional district maps, as many feared, after the Kansas Supreme Court last week upheld the original lines enacted earlier this year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A man who was fatally shot by a deputy U.S. marshal during an arrest attempt was shot during a foot pursuit, the city’s police chief said Monday. Omari Cryer, 25, was wanted on an arrest warrant for assault, strangulation and terroristic threatening when he was tracked to a residence in Louisville on Friday, police Chief Erika Shields said at a press conference. “There was a brief foot pursuit. They ran upon a fence. Subsequently, the marshals opened fire striking Mr. Cryer,” Shields said. Shields said Cryer was in the possession of a handgun at the time he was shot. She said she anticipates any “body-worn camera footage to be released in the near future” after “essential” interviews are conducted. The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office has described the cause and manner of death as “gunshot wounds/homicide.” A group of roughly 30 protesters gathered in downtown Louisville’s Jefferson Square Park on Monday evening. Many called for more transparency from Louisville police and the U.S. Marshals Service. Antiya Parker, the mother of Cryer’s 2-year-old son, also attended the rally, holding a poster showing photos of Cryer and another with the words “Black Lives Matter.” “We’re all confused,” she said. “You got these people who are saying one thing; you got some people saying another.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Driving while using a handheld cellphone could become a traffic violation punishable by a ticket and fine under legislation approved Monday by the state House. State Rep. Mike Huval, R-Breaux Bridge, got the bill passed with a 55-38 vote after failing to win passage earlier in the legislative session. The bill goes next to the Senate. Huval has two weeks to get it through a Senate committee hearing and floor vote before the session’s June 6 deadline for final adjournment. Amendments adopted in the House ensure that a violation will result only in a citation and fines, not arrests. Huval said the measure is needed to increase highway safety. He won House passage after recounting stories from friends and colleagues of accidents involving drivers holding cellphones. Drivers using hands-free devices would not be in violation of the proposed law.\n\nMaine\n\nMonson: Infestations of ticks contributed to a record-high death rate for young moose tracked by wildlife managers in the state’s rural areas. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife collared 70 moose calves in remote sites last winter, and 60 of them had died by the beginning of May, Maine Public reports. The 86% mortality rate was the highest since the agency started the tracking survey. Lee Kantar, the moose biologist with the wildlife department, said the winter ticks are to blame. The ticks, also called moose ticks, are a worsening problem in the areas of the northern U.S. and southern Canada that moose call home. Short winters and long falls have given the ticks more time to seek out moose, and the moose have accumulated larger numbers of them, biologists said. The ticks can gather on moose in the tens of thousands and can bleed the animals to the point of death. Maine moose are also coping with other parasites, such as brainworms. The giant animal, the largest member of the deer family, is Maine’s official state animal.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The brand-new Oceans Calling Festival is promising a star-studded lineup. The Lumineers, Alanis Morissette and Dave Matthews with Tim Reynolds are headlining the event, organizers announced Monday. And the slate of entertainers is deep for the three-day festival, set to come to the resort town from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2. Matthews and Reynolds headline the first night, with Toad the Wet Sprocket, Dirty Heads, O.A.R. and more on the bill. Playing ahead of the Lumineers are bands including Cage the Elephant, Jimmy Eat World and Pup Punk. And joining headliner Morissette on the final night are Cyndi Lauper, Sublime, St. Paul and the Broken Bones and more. One-day and three-day pass tickets for the festival go on sale Wednesday at www.oceanscallingfestival.com. One-day passes start at $99 for general admission and range up to $795 for “platinum” tickets. Three-day passes start at $185 and soar to $1,250 for “platinum” tickets. The festival is being put on in partnership with the band O.A.R., which has roots in Maryland, and will also include a culinary component featuring world-renowned chefs and cooking demos that celebrate regional cuisine. Amusement park Jolly Roger at the Pier will be inside the festival grounds.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is taking additional steps to help people experiencing homelessness, substance abuse disorder and mental health issues to deter a recurrence of the humanitarian crisis at the city intesection that was once home to a sprawling homeless encampment, Mayor Michelle Wu said Tuesday. She unveiled the city’s 11-point plan amid concerns warmer weather will bring more people to the area known as Mass and Cass. The plan, developed after 20 meetings with about 250 stakeholders, addresses immediate public safety and public health needs. “As the weather warms, we are taking concrete steps to ensure safety and health,” Wu said. “Boston is creating a continuum of care for individuals experiencing homelessness and substance use disorder with pathways from living on the streets to permanent housing.” In January the city cleared out tents where up to 140 people had been living near Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, where drug dealing and use often occured in the open. Some business owners and residents said the problems persisted. The new plan includes an increased presence of public health and public safety outreach teams; more street cleaning and beautification efforts; transportation and referrals to day centers outside the neighborhood; and increased access to permanent housing.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state’s elections bureau said late Monday that five Republican candidates for governor, including two leading contenders, failed to file enough valid nominating signatures and should not qualify for the August primary. The stunning recommendations immediately transformed the race in the battleground state and dealt a major blow to former Detroit Police Department Chief James Craig, who has led in primary polling despite campaign problems, and businessman Perry Johnson, who has spent millions of his own money to run. Democrats had challenged their petitions, alleging mass forgery and other issues. Another GOP candidate, Tudor Dixon, had also contested Craig’s voter signatures as fake. The bipartisan, four-member Board of State Canvassers will meet Thursday to consider the elections bureau’s findings of fraud across five gubernatorial campaigns. The Republican candidates, who are vying to face Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in November, could end up going to court if they do not make the ballot. Bureau staff also determined that three other lesser-known GOP candidates – Donna Brandenburg, Michael Brown and Michael Markey – did not turn in enough valid signatures. If the canvassers agree with the recommendations, the 10-person field of political newcomers would be cut in half to five.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul has been activated for service in the U.S. Navy. A weekend commissioning ceremony was held in Duluth for the Freedom class littoral combat ship. It measures nearly 400 feet long and can travel at speeds greater than 40 knots, the equivalent of about 46 mph. According to officials, the ship is designed to have significant maneuverability and will utilize a state-of-the-art system that combines diesel and gas turbines with steerable water jet propulsion, KBJR-TV reports. Gov. Tim Walz had a special message for the crew during the commissioning ceremony Saturday. “To the crew, when you sail the world’s oceans to whatever nation calls you, in order to defend the freedoms that we enjoy, know that the pride and patriotism of all Minnesotans sails with you. May the USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul protect you,” Walz said. The ship has a flight deck that’s about 1.5 times larger the most naval warships and can accommodate a crew of 140 service members. The ship was built in Marinette, Wisconsin, using Iron Range iron ore. Its commissioning, originally planned for 2021, was delayed by a problem with its propulsion system.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Citing safety concerns, the Real Cowboy Association said it’s canceling the 19th Annual Black Cowboy Association Rodeo that had been scheduled for July 16 at the Mississippi Coliseum. “Unfortunately I have to announce that the 19th Annual Jackson Black Rodeo is canceled,” said a post on the group’s Facebook. “Reasons are due to previous incidents on the Fairgrounds that will restrict the event from being what it has been. I stand for the safety of All RCA Fans, Cowboys, and Cowgirls.” The Real Cowboy Association has held the annual event in Jackson for the past 19 years. The association’s goal is to influence and help promote leadership, scholarships and provide a increase in business involvement in the community, according to the group’s website. Michael Lasseter, director of the Mississippi State Fairgrounds, said providing safety for such events is mandatory. “We do not want this event to be canceled,” Lasseter said. Last week organizers of JXN Fest announced cancellation of their event, citing “unforeseen circumstances beyond our control” and “the climate of today’s times.” The moves come after a May 1 shootout between rival groups of teenagers, with a law enforcement officer fatally shooting a teen suspected of firing shots, at the Mississippi Mudbug Festival – also at the Fairgrounds.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: A state lawmaker charged with fraud involving medical treatments has been sued by a patient over the care she prescribed for him to relieve back pain. Rep. Tricia Derges, a Nixa Republican, is scheduled to go on trial in federal court next month on charges that she sold fake stem cell treatments, fraudulently used pandemic aid and wrote illegal prescriptions. In a lawsuit filed in state court this month, a patient alleges Derges, an assistant physician, used amniotic fluid injections to treat his back pain at her clinic in Springfield in 2020. He alleges he was charged over $6,000 for treatments that did not help. Derges’ attorney, Al Watkins, said the plaintiff had no problems with his treatment until the federal indictment was publicized and called the allegations “absolutely erroneous.” In that indictment filed last year, Derges is accused of claiming nearly $900,000 in federal payments for COVID-19 treatments that were not performed or had already been performed. It also alleges that she promoted amniotic fluid as a treatment for COVID-19 and other diseases by falsely claiming it contained stem cells. In February, Derges’ narcotics license was placed on probation for three years.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State health officials say transgender people can’t change their birth certificates even if they undergo gender-confirmation surgery, in defiance of a court order that had blocked the Republican-controlled state’s bid to restrict transgender rights. The state health department said late Monday in an emergency order that it would no longer record the category of “gender” on people’s birth certificates, replacing that category with a listing for “sex” that can be changed only in rare circumstances. Sex is “immutable,” the order said, while gender is a “social … construct” that can change over time. The order came a month after a state judge temporarily blocked enforcement of a law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change their gender on their birth certificates. Judge Michael Moses ruled the law was unconstitutionally vague because it did not specify what procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they had had a surgical procedure. Moses’ order forced the state to revert back to a process adopted in 2017 that said transgender residents could apply to change the gender on their Montana birth certificate by filing sworn affidavits with the health department. But state health officials said the April 21 ruling put them in “an ambiguous and uncertain situation.” The new order exceeds the restrictions on transgender rights imposed by the Republican-dominated Legislature.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska’s game-day tradition of football fans releasing helium-filled red balloons to celebrate the Cornhuskers’ first touchdown is ending. Balloons have been handed out to fans near the stadium entrance before games since the early 1960s. Athletic director Trev Alberts said on his radio show Monday night that a global shortage of helium led to the decision to end the practice. Russia is one of the top helium suppliers, and Alberts said U.S. sanctions in response to the war in Ukraine have caused a shortage. Alberts said university leaders want the helium that would have been used in the balloons to go to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for medical use. The release of balloons at football games has drawn criticism for at least a decade because of environmental concerns. A lawsuit filed in 2016 claimed the balloons were a health hazard to birds and other wildlife when they return to the ground. The university’s student government, in a symbolic move, voted in November to end the tradition. The Huskers’ home opener is Sept. 3 against North Dakota.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State and national advocacy groups say 83 children remain missing in the state – 25 more than last year at this time. Officials with the Las Vegas-based nonprofit Nevada Child Seekers said a majority of the children reported missing to law enforcement in the state each year are from Las Vegas, and many are considered endangered or abducted. “We’re a 24-hour entertainment city,” Heather Doto, program manager of Nevada Child Seekers, told the Las Vegas-Review Journal. “There’s a lot to do out here. We’re a hub, and these streets are dangerous. Unfortunately, where there’s more people, you’re more likely to have more predators.” Nevada Child Seekers works on about 500 cases per year and reports a 90% success rate in finding children, according to Doto. She said the pandemic led to a rise in predators using the internet to lure children away from their homes because “predators go where children go.” Doto said Nevada Child Seekers avoids the term “runaway” on its missing children posters because it leads to the public paying less attention to those children. She said children who leave home are, in most cases, “running to something, or they’re running away from something.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: The city’s petition to challenge the constitutionality of the state’s legislative redistricting plan was denied by the New Hampshire Supreme Court last week, but the city isn’t giving up on it just yet. Dover’s Ward 4 voters will be affected by the state’s House Bill 50, which was signed into law earlier this year and divides Ward 4 residents into two districts combined with other towns. Despite meeting the requirements in the New Hampshire Constitution that require a dedicated district for wards with sufficient population, Ward 4 was left without its own representative. City Attorney Joshua Wyatt said it’s currently unclear why the state Supreme Court denied the motion, as no rationale was presented in the rejection document. Dover had petitioned for the complaint to go straight to the high court to expedite the process, with the June 1 filing period for the state House looming. That’s been done before in redistricting cases, Wyatt said. In its legal filing, the city asked the court to address the matter directly so that, ideally, a ruling could be made in advance of the elections. Wyatt said he does not think the city will see relief or a ruling before the 2022 state House election, but the goal at that point would be to petition for new maps to be drawn before the next census.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s casinos collectively saw their profitability increase in the first quarter of this year compared not only with a year earlier but also with the pre-pandemic period, according to figures released Monday. But only four of the nine casinos indivdually reported higher gross operating profits than they did in the first quarter of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Figures released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos and their online arms collectively posted a gross operating profit of $155.6 million in the first three months of this year. That’s up 63% from the first three months of 2021 and nearly 79% from the first quarter of 2019. The pandemic forced Atlantic City’s casinos to close for 31/ 2 months starting in mid-March of 2020, so 2019 is a more useful point of comparison. Yet the news was not all good. Only four casinos – Borgata, Hard Rock, Ocean and Tropicana – were more profitable in the first quarter this year than at the start of 2019. Gross operating profit represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City gambling industry. Eight of the nine casinos – all but Bally’s – were profitable in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The largest wildfire in North America came to a near-standstill overnight amid light rain and frosty temperatures as firefighters scrambled Tuesday to clear flammable vegetation and deployed aircraft to douse smoldering forests. The blaze that started about seven weeks ago in the Rocky Mountains foothills east of Santa Fe was 41% encircled by clearings and barriers that can stop a wildfire from spreading farther. Gusty winds continued to carry hot embers across barrier such as roadways, as fire crews race to extinguish small spot fires. The fire has consumed more than 486 square miles of timber, grassland and brush, with evacuations in place for weeks. It’s among six active large fires in the state that have burned across 536 square miles. So far this year, wildland fires have burned across roughly 2,650 square miles (of the U.S. That’s roughly twice the average burn for this time of year, according to a national center for coordinating wildfire suppression. Climate change and an enduring drought are significant factors. Still, wildland firefighters braced for the anticipated return of hot, dry and windy weather later this week. A wildfire on the outskirts of Los Alamos National Laboratory was 85% contained Tuesday. In the vicinity, Bandelier National Monument is preparing to reopen some areas to visitors Friday. In southwestern New Mexico, a fire is burning through portions of the Gila National Forest and outlying areas.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A U.S. history and government exam for the state’s high school students has been canceled in the wake of the racist shooting at a Buffalo supermarket over concerns that material on the test could “compound student trauma,” education officials said Tuesday. The state’s Regents exam had been scheduled for June 1, but a review of the content following the May 14 shooting found that “the tragedy in Buffalo has created an unexpected and unintended context for the planned assessment,” said Emily DeSantis, a spokesperson for the state Education Department, in a statement. As a result, she said, “it is not appropriate to administer the exam with a question that could compound the grief and hardship faced by our school communities.” Ten people, all of them Black, were killed in the Tops Friendly Market when a white 18-year-old opened fire. Three others were injured. Funerals for the victims have been taking place this week. The department refused to say what the content was or give any additional information on the question of concern. In a memo sent to school administrators, Commissioner of Education Betty Rosa said it wouldn’t be possible to make a different test or modify the one that had been scheduled.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A federal appeals court has ruled against arguments by U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn that he is protected from a post-Civil War era constitutional disqualification from future office for those who engaged in an insurrection. The three-judge Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that a lower federal court erred in its ruling and must revisit the arguments of whether Cawthorn engaged in the Jan. 6 insurrection. The district court had ruled the 14th Amendment disqualification from federal or state office did not apply because of the 1872 Amnesty Act that restored the right to hold office for all but those at the highest level of the Confederate rebellion. The ramifications for Cawthorn, an ambitious right-wing congressman who is only 26, could be long-running. Cawthorn recently argued the case was moot because of his May 17 Republican primary loss to state Sen. Chuck Edwards, despite support for his reelection bid from ex-President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the U.S. House Ethics Committee is investigating allegations that Cawthorn had a conflict of interest in a cryptocurrency he promoted and engaged in an improper relationship with a member of his staff, the panel said Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Planned Parenthood said Monday that it will offer abortion services at its clinic in Moorhead, Minnesota, if North Dakota’s only abortion clinic does not quickly relocate from Fargo should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade. Planned Parenthood said it expected Red River Women’s Clinic, a private clinic not affiliated with it, to make the short move across the river by July 1, if necessary. “However, if that is not the case, Planned Parenthood will begin offering abortions at our Moorhead facility so that women in the region have no interruption in services,” said Sarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States. The Red River Women’s Clinic has long operated as the only abortion provider in North Dakota. Owner Tammi Kromenaker has said she would cross over to Moorhead if forced to do so but told the Associated Press in recent interviews that she has been too busy to explore details of such a move. Kromenaker said Monday that “there are too many unknowns to confirm a specific date” for relocation. The nearest clinics to the Fargo-Moorhead that currently offer abortion services are both about 240 miles away, in Minneapolis and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, though the Sioux Falls clinic would also shut down if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A new initiative by the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts aims to remove an obstacle standing in the way of some residents obtaining housing. The clerk’s office’s online search will no longer show inactive evictions older than three years. In a release, Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Pavan Parikh said evictions remain a stain on a tenant’s record that is nearly impossible to erase, even if a tenant made good on the obligations. This new policy aims to prevent old eviction cases from hindering those who are attempting to find new housing. The older eviction cases will not be viewable online, but they remain on file in the clerk’s office and are open to the public. The hope is that with older eviction case records removed from the online search, thousands of records that may no longer reflect a tenant’s financial situation will not easily pop up and influence landlords or other screeners. This new policy still allows landlords to properly screen tenants but aims to protect tenants from those landlords or screeners who are trying to take the easy way out, Parikh said. Nick DiNardo, managing attorney of the housing practice group at Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati, said the organization is pleased with the change.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPawhuska: Rising grocery, gas and housing bills prompted leaders of one Native American tribe to make a change. The Osage Nation will temporarily pay workers 10% more to help offset inflation costs that have reached 40-year highs. Principal Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear proposed the cost of living increase, and Osage Nation Congress approved the change in April. It took effect this month. “We have not seen a time like this inflation-wise since the 1980s,” Standing Bear said after he announced the proposal in March. The main metric used to track inflation, the U.S. consumer price index, climbed 8.5% between March 2021 and March 2022 – the largest spike in 41 years. Fuel costs, in particular, surged. Food prices increased 10%. The impact of rising costs is amplified in tribal communities and rural areas because of access and supply chain issues. “It’s as if someone is taking a pair of scissors and just cutting 10% to 15% of your paycheck every period. That’s exactly what it is,” Standing Bear said. He said tribal employees started to talk more about rising gas prices at the start of the year. Then Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in March that she believed inflation would remain high for some time. “When she made that speech, I really said, ‘That’s it. We’re going to do this cost of living,’ ” Standing Bear said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state is reporting some of the highest numbers of new COVID-19 cases since the pandemic started more than two years ago. The Oregon Health Authority reported nearly 12,000 new cases last week, and the state is averaging 1,685 new cases a day, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. That’s higher than all but 12 weeks since the start of the pandemic in 2020. Hospitalizations continue to lag the rising case numbers and remain far below previous pandemic highs. As of Monday, 278 people were hospitalized – up 11% from a week before – and 24 were in intensive care unit beds. The tally of hospitalized patients is expected to peak at 330 occupied hospital beds June 9, according to forecasts by Oregon Health & Science University. Many of those patients are considered to be people hospitalized for other conditions who also tested positive for COVID-19. People in the 15 Oregon counties deemed to be “medium” risk of COVID-19 by federal metrics should consider donning masks indoors while out in public. Those counties are Multnomah, Clackamas, Washington, Columbia, Benton, Deschutes, Hood River, Tillamook, Yamhill, Polk, Lincoln, Lane, Wallowa, Union and Baker.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Two former police officers whose gender discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit led Philadelphia’s police commissioner to resign have won a $1 million verdict against the city. A federal jury on Tuesday found that Cpl. Audra McCowan and Patrol Officer Jennifer Allen endured a hostile work environment that included being put in undesirable jobs, with changing shifts, after they raised sexual harassment complaints. They each won $500,000. McCowan, Allen’s supervisor, alleged that former Commissioner Richard Ross failed to help because she had ended a romantic relationship with him in 2011. When the allegations surfaced in 2019, Ross denied engaging in any retaliation but resigned for what he called the good of the city. Philadelphia then hired Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, the first Black woman to lead the department, to succeed him. McCowan now works at a school for less than half her former pay, while Allen remains unable to work, according to their lawyer, Ian Bryson. A psychiatrist testified at the weeklong trial that both suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome from the 15 years each spent in the Philadelphia Police Department, he said. “I think this verdict sent a message that this isn’t how you treat people,” Bryson said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Three firefighters were injured battling a major fire at a recently renovated hotel, fire officials said. The blaze at the Wayfinder Hotel was reported about 8 p.m. Monday, and crews remained on the scene Tuesday morning. Nearly 100 firefighters from multiple municipalities responded to the blaze, and all guests made it out safely, fire Chief Harp Donnelly IV said. The Red Cross responded to assist displaced guests in finding new accommodations. The cause remains under investigation. The four-story hotel has nearly 200 guest rooms, according to its website. The injured firefighters are expected to recover, Deputy Chief Mark Riding said at the scene Tuesday. “We had one firefighter go through the floor. He was rescued by the crew that was with him. We don’t know if it was from the heat or the water weight that was causing collapses,” he said. “As soon as the firefighter went through the floor, all companies were pulled out.” Hotel ownership said in a statement that they were “deeply grateful” for the efforts of firefighters. The hotel reopened in the summer of 2020 after a $16 million renovation project.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: In one of the year’s most closely watched congressional Republican primaries, U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace met two GOP challengers on the debate stage who are seeking to oust her from South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District, one of whom immediately endorsed the other before walking off stage. In the Monday night matchup in Charleston – slated to be the only debate for Mace, Katie Arrington and Lynz Piper-Loomis ahead of the June 14 primary election – Piper-Loomis answered her opening question by saying she would be supporting Arrington before removing her microphone and leaving the debate. With Piper-Loomis having been unable to attract significant fundraising, her departure now makes official the two-way contest that had already been largely shaping up between the freshman Mace and Arrington, a former Defense Department cybersecurity expert who is making her second run for the seat. In 2018, Arrington notably knocked U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford out of the GOP primary, going on to lose the general election to Democrat Joe Cunningham, who became the first of his party in decades to flip a South Carolina House seat. Mace then ousted Cunningham in 2020 to become the first Republican woman elected to Congress from the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is suing Lyman County in federal court for delaying a redistricting plan that would ensure the timely election of tribal candidates to the County Commission. The tribe said the delay prevents its residents from electing two commissioners in the upcoming election. Instead, the Lower Brule will have to wait until 2024 and 2026. Lyman County has had an at-large election process since 1992. That means candidates running for the five commissioner seats can live anywhere within the county. Lyman County contains part of the Lower Brule reservation and has a Native American population of 38%. With at-large elections, no Native American candidate has ever succeeded in winning a seat on the commission, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. To avoid a lawsuit, Lyman County and Lower Brule agreed that the county must establish two commissioner positions chosen by Native American voters. In October 2021, Lower Brule proposed five single-candidate districts, two of them with a Native American majority and three with a white majority. According to plaintiffs, that scheme was legal under existing South Dakota law. But in February, the Lyman County Commission enacted an ordinance establishing just two voting districts, one white with three commissioners and one Native American with two commissioners. The commission also voted to delay the changes until after the next election, leaving the at-large system in play.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Beginning this month, warrant officers retired from active duty in the U.S. Army will be able to join the Tennessee National Guard. The program has been talked about for years, but Tennessee is the first to implement it, Brig. Gen. Warner Ross, Tennessee’s assistant adjutant general-Army, said in a news release. Previously it was allowed only for soldiers deemed indispensable by the secretary of the Army. Now, nearly all retired active-duty Army warrant officers are eligible. The U.S. Army and National Guard Bureau updated their policies to make the change possible last year. Tennessee formalized its own state policy this month, according to the release. “This will greatly impact the readiness across our force as it allows our organization to supplement our ranks and hard to fill positions with highly qualified individuals,” Ross said.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A lawyer for the family of a 29-year-old Black man who was fatally shot last month by a Houston police officer said body camera video shows he was given only seconds to raise his hands before he was shot. Jalen Randle was shot April 27 as he exited a vehicle, police said. They said he was being pursued because he was wanted on three felony warrants. Police released video of the shooting Tuesday after Randle’s family demanded it, but Assistant Chief Thomas Hardin said in the introduction to the footage that the department is still in the early stages of its investigation. A spokesman for the Houston Police Department declined to comment further because of the ongoing investigation. The video shows the officer firing once almost immediately after yelling, “Hey, let me see your hands!” as he got out of a police car. After Randle fell to the ground, the officer uttered an expletive. Attorney Ben Crump said in a statement that the video clearly shows Randle had no time to comply with the officer’s orders before he was shot. Crump said Randle was handcuffed and dragged across the ground before officers rendered aid. “The brutality displayed in this video is extremely disturbing,” said Crump, one of the nation’s top civil rights attorneys.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: In a coordinated statewide campaign dubbed “Flip Blitz” by water managers, governments across Utah removed 135,000 square feet of “non-functional” grass on public property last week and replaced it with more water-friendly landscaping. The vast majority – about 115,000 square feet – was taken from lawns in Washington County, where the hot desert climate and years of debate over drought, population growth and controversial projects like the proposed Lake Powell Pipeline have made the area a kind of ground zero for water conservation proposals. “This is a good example of looking at how we can do a better job and have more effective landscaping,” said Zach Renstrom, the executive director of the Washington County Water Conservancy District. “And so this is a great opportunity for everybody to kind of get together and to show what we can do.” Some advocates for stricter water conservation said that while the event seemed to present a good opportunity to talk about water issues, they worried it seemed more performative and didn’t actually offer any substantial solutions to the concerns surrounding the county’s water future. But by being an example for others, officials said they hoped the government’s actions would encourage private businesses, homeowners and others to do the same.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A bill passed by the Legislature will give Vermont National Guard members an increased budget for college tuition. Those Guard members can now get a bachelor’s degree fully covered at all state schools including any Vermont State College institution or University of Vermont school. Previous benefits only paid for $11,592 of tuition a year, which fell short of some state university tuition rates, including UVM’s. The Guard will now pay up to $16,392 a year for tuition, which can also be used for a second bachelor’s degree or a master’s degree. If Guard members wish to attend a private college in Vermont, the Guard will cover tuition up to the in-state rate for undergraduate students at UVM. The new bill will also grant spouses and dependents of National Guard members stationed in Vermont immediate access to in-state tuition rates at state universities once they have moved to Vermont. As long as the spouse or dependent stays in Vermont, they have access to in-state tuition rates even if their family member in the Guard is transferred locations on military orders.\n\nVirginia\n\nMcLean: Northern Virginia voters have elected a progressive slate of candidates to a community center board after a controversy over a drag queen story hour. The normally low-key elections Saturday for three slots on the McLean Community Center Board attracted attention after complaints that the center co-sponsored a “Drag StoryBook Hour,” in which drag queens read books about gender fluidity to young children at a local library. Among those defeated in the election was Katharine Gorka, a former Trump administration official and wife of Trump loyalist Sebastian Gorka. She cited her opposition to the story hour as a top issue for her at a candidate forum earlier this month. The winning candidates in Saturday’s election – Kristina Groennings, Anna Bartosiewicz and Ari Ghasemian – had endorsements from Democrats. The board did not publish the candidates’ margin of victory. The community center board oversees a budget funded by a real-estate tax surcharge on property in the McLean area, one of the wealthiest areas of the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Scientists will set about 1,000 traps this year in their quest to wipe out the Asian giant hornet in Washington, the state Department of Agriculture said Tuesday. Scientists believe the hornets, first detected in the Pacific Northwest state in 2019, are confined to Whatcom County, located on the Canadian border north of Seattle. “We are doing pretty good right now,” said Sven-Erik Spichiger, who is leading the fight to eradicate the hornets for the state Department of Agriculture. “We know about where the nests are located in Whatcom County.” The insects are the world’s largest hornets, with queens reaching up to 2 inches long. They are considered invasive in North America for their ability to kill other bee and hornet species, which is how they got the nickname “murder hornets.” Hornets caught in traps help scientists find the location of nests. The state eradicated three nests last year, all near the town of Blaine, and there have been no confirmed reports of Asian giant hornet nests so far this year, Spichiger said. Most of the traps will be set in northern Whatcom County, but a few will be set in the city of Bellingham, he said. The agency is also encouraging residents to set their own traps to cover more ground.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A congressional watchdog has determined that U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney likely broke House rules when the West Virginia Republican accepted a trip to Aruba allegedly paid for by a campaign client and family friend. The latest allegations were included in a statement released Monday by the House Ethics Committee, which said it was extending the review of an Office of Congressional Ethics report sent to the committee in December. Mooney, who is backed by former President Donald Trump and has represented the state in the House since 2015, will face Democrat Barry Wendell, an openly gay former Morgantown City Council member, in November’s general election. Mooney easily defeated incumbent Rep. David McKinley in the May 10 GOP primary for the newly redrawn 2nd District. An ethics probe launched against Mooney last year initially was about whether he had used campaign cash to make personal purchases. In the latest OCE report, HSP Direct, a direct mail fundraising company that provides services to Mooney’s campaign committee, allegedly paid for a trip for his family to Aruba along with free lodging and event space in March 2021.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: One of the 10 Republicans who attempted to cast Electoral College ballots for Donald Trump in 2020 even though he lost Wisconsin said Monday that he is running to become chairman of the state elections commission, where he currently serves as a member. Robert Spindell has been an outspoken member of the bipartisan commission and supporter of the investigation into the 2020 election being led by a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice. Spindell has also traveled the state giving a presentation he calls “Thirteen Ways the 2020 Election was Rigged in Wisconsin.” “I am far and away the best qualified for (commission chair) and it would really help the image of the Wisconsin Elections Commission if I am chosen for that,” Spindell said Monday. The next chair of the commission will hold the position heading into the November election and in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election in battleground Wisconsin. The chair by state law approves the vote canvass following elections and certifies results. The chair also sets the agenda for the commission and can exert influence over how questions are framed, an important power on the board that is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. The commission scheduled a vote Wednesday to elect the next chair.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Scientists are using soy pellets dropped by helicopter to eradicate exotic lake trout from Yellowstone Lake, Wyofile.com reports. After extensive efforts to trap the unwanted fish failed, biologists tried the airborne pellets and deposited them over spawning sites, according to the newspaper. The method has proved efficient, with mortality rates for those trout approaching 100% even in those areas where the concentration of pellets was lowest, the Yellowstone biologists wrote in an article published in the American Fisheries Society journal.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/23/distancing-failures-equipment-roadblocks-testing-limits-news-around-states/111458426/", "title": "Distancing failures, equipment roadblocks: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the state surpassed 120 on Saturday, while health officials backed off a prior order that would have closed child day care facilities statewide. The Alabama Department of Public Health said child care facilities will be allowed to open but must keep the number of children in any room or other enclosed space below 12. The change followed an order Thursday that prohibited gatherings of 25 people or more and mandated closing child day care centers, preschools, schools and senior citizen centers. Dining in restaurants and bars also was prohibited, with only takeout ordering allowed. Health officials said the goal of slowing disease transmission is to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday clarified that limits on public gatherings did not apply to work and workplace events.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The mayor has announced his third emergency order in response to the coronavirus pandemic as more cases of COVID-19 are confirmed in the state and the city’s supply of swabs needed to test for the disease runs low. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz issued the “hunker down” order Friday, telling residents to stay at home as much as possible, KTVA-TV reports. The order is effective from Sunday evening until March 31. On Saturday, the mayors of Ketchikan, Saxman and the Ketchikan Gateway Borough in southeast Alaska issued a joint proclamation telling residents to stay at home as much as possible. As in Anchorage, grocery stores and other essential businesses will remain open. As of Saturday night, the state has 15 cases of people with the coronavirus, according to the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. “I’m asking people to do the right thing,” Berkowitz said at a news conference Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A second person stricken with the coronavirus has died in the state, which now has 152 confirmed cases, authorities said Sunday. The Arizona Department of Health Services and Maricopa County Department of Public Health said the latest man who died was in his 70s and had underlying health conditions. The state’s first reported death from COVID-19 was announced Friday. Authorities said that man was a city of Phoenix employee in his 50s who also had underlying health conditions. “As testing increases, we expect the number of positive cases to continue rising,” Gov. Doug Ducey said in a Twitter post Sunday. “It’s important that everyone takes this seriously.” Ducey announced a series of executive orders Thursday including shutting down bars and dine-in options in counties with confirmed cases, designed to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state rose by nearly 50, including more than 40 residents and staff of nursing homes, officials said Sunday. The state Department of Health reported that 165 people have tested positive for the illness caused by the coronavirus, up from 118 on Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said at a news conference that this was the largest daily increase in diagnosed cases in the state and comes as testing is ramping up. The vast majority of people who contract the virus recover within weeks. It causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but it can lead to more severe illness, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems. Dr. Nathaniel Smith, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health, said 19 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19, and six have been on a ventilator at various points.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Most Californians stayed at home on a Saturday unlike any its 40 million residents had ever seen before. Less than 48 hours after Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an unprecedented stay-at-home order to help curb the coronavirus spread, shopping centers and streets were empty. Churches were closed. Playgrounds deserted. However, stores and farmer markets were bustling, and many people took advantage of the beautiful spring weather and rushed to the outdoors. At beaches and parks, not everyone heeded calls to practice social distancing, prompting Newsom to call them out. “Those young people are still out there on the beaches thinking it’s time to party. It’s time to grow up, time to wake up,” he said at an evening news conference. “Time to recognize that it’s not just about the old folks; it’s about your impact on their lives. Don’t be selfish.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Hotels, motels and vacation rentals at the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park are closing to help stem the spread of the coronavirus as the tourism-dependent community discourages people from visiting. Under an order taking effect at noon Monday, all short-term lodging will be closed in Estes Park and the surrounding area. The order is set to stay in effect through April 17. Local workers, long-term residents of short-term facilities and people who are quarantined are exempt. The age and health of a significant number of the area’s population is at risk of having serious complications from COVID-19, and the move came at the urging of Estes Park’s hospital, according to an announcement from the town and Larimer County. At least six people have died because of the coronavirus in Colorado.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont urged residents to sign up for cellphone alerts Sunday, saying he will deliver a recorded message to more than 4 million phone numbers through the state’s CTAlert system about the coronavirus. The message from the state’s Emergency Operations Center in Hartford will urge all residents to stay home and will be accompanied by a text message with a link to Connecticut’s coronavirus website. In Greenwich, First Selectman Fred Camillo ordered all town parks and beaches closed as of 8 p.m. Sunday to keep people from congregating. There were more than 8,000 visitors to one town park Saturday, he said. Meanwhile, a nursing home resident in his 80s is the state’s fifth resident to die from the coronavirus, Lamont said Saturday. So far, 223 people in the state have been diagnosed with the virus, including 43 hospitalized for treatment.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Public health officials have confirmed 47 coronavirus cases in the state as of Sunday morning. A new round of testing will begin Monday at undisclosed locations in all three Delaware counties. As the number of cases continues to rise, state officials have instituted increasingly stringent guidelines and restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Gov. John Carney ordered Delaware beaches to close Saturday in response to packed beaches the day before, which was unseasonably warm. Many beach towns announced their own restrictions, including the closure of the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk, where businesses can now only offer takeout or delivery. “If people don’t listen to the guidance, if they don’t listen to what the governor’s saying, he has to impose additional restrictions,” Carney’s spokesman, Jonathan Starkey, said Saturday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Health Department officials say four members of the district’s Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have now tested positive for coronavirus, WUSA-TV reports. Officials said they are in the process of contacting anyone who had contact with the individuals to advise they self-quarantine. “This is a reminder of the heroic work our first responders are carrying out during these unprecedented times,” said Gregory Dean, the department’s chief. Washington, D.C., is under a state of emergency, with 39 cases of coronavirus reported in the district, prompting schools to close until April 1 and the government to operate on a modified schedule to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: More than 720 people in Florida have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday as he resisted an official’s call to issue a statewide “stay-at-home” order. The bulk of the coronavirus cases have been in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. There have been more than 11 deaths statewide, he said, including a third death at a Broward County nursing home. More mobile testing sites are coming online, and hundreds more are being tested each day, DeSantis said during a news conference Saturday afternoon in Tallahassee. DeSantis said new testing sites at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando and the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens will open next week. Also Saturday, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told residents to brace for a “stay-at-home order” in coming days. “It will be soon; I would be surprised if it’s not by Monday,” Castor told reporters Saturday. “Time is of the essence.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Three additional deaths were attributed to the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total to 23, with 600 confirmed cases reported statewide, according to health officials. While schools and colleges statewide have been closed, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has refrained from ordering restaurants and other businesses to shut down, leaving local governments to decide whether and how to impose restrictions aimed at slowing the outbreak. The 23 people who have died from COVID-19 in Georgia range in age from 42 to 85, and at least 19 of them had underlying conditions, according to Sunday’s Georgia Department of Health update. Dougherty County, where Albany is the county seat, appears to be particularly hard-hit, with four dozen confirmed cases and six deaths. Local officials there ordered residents to stay home unless they’re going to work, buying food, seeking medical care or exercising, and they urged people to report anyone seen violating the shelter-in-place order.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor has instituted a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine starting Thursday of all people traveling to the state as part of efforts to fight the spread of coronavirus. The order applies to returning residents as well as visitors. It applies to all arrivals at Hawaii airports from the continental U.S. and international destinations and extends to other private and commercial aircraft. Returning residents must quarantine themselves at home, Gov. David Ige’s office said. Visitors must quarantine themselves in their hotel room or rented lodging. People under quarantine may only leave their homes for medical emergencies or to seek medical care, the governor’s office said. They cannot visit public spaces such as pools, fitness centers or restaurants. Failure to follow the order is a misdemeanor and punishable by a maximum fine of $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both, the governor’s office said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state House ended its legislative session Friday after balancing fears of spreading the coronavirus with potential vetoes of several bills representatives will now be powerless to override. The House voted 32-28 to end the session a day after the Senate went home. They would have needed to stay five more days to wait out a veto decision by Republican Gov. Brad Little. “Under ordinary circumstance, we’d have stayed and let, and I believe the Senate would have stayed, and let the five days toll,” said Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke. The coronavirus “caused enough concern that has made people wonder about the wisdom of going home and coming back on Monday.” One bill that could be vetoed bans transgender people from changing the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a federal court ruling a previous Idaho ban was unconstitutional.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker criticized the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic Sunday, saying the state hasn’t received enough medical supplies, prompting an angry response from President Donald Trump. Pritzker said Illinois got a recent supply, but it was a fraction of what was requested from the federal government. The first-term Democrat, who has issued a statewide “stay at home order” amid the pandemic, said Illinois is buying supplies from the open market, as are other states also in need of supplies. “We’re all competing against each other,” Pritzker told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “This should have been a coordinated effort by the federal government.” Trump, who has said repeatedly that his administration is not to blame for the growing pandemic, lashed out on Twitter, saying governors should not be “blaming the federal government for their own shortcomings.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state reported two new deaths from the coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths statewide to six, public health officials said. Indiana has recorded 201 total cases, including 76 new cases announced Sunday. Of those, the highest number was in Marion County, which reported 35 new cases, followed by Hamilton County, which reported eight cases. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Friday delayed Indiana’s May 5 primary election until June 2. But he said he would need to see more signs of widespread spread of the virus before taking action such as the governors of California, Illinois and New York state in ordering nearly all residents to stay in their homes.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Health officials have confirmed 23 new cases of COVID-19 to bring the state’s total Saturday to 68 – up more than 50% from the day before. Johnson County reported five new cases, Polk County had four, Linn County had three, and Allamakee and Black Hawk counties each reported two new cases, the Iowa Department of Public Health said in a news release. The counties of Dubuque, Fayette, Henry, Muscatine, Pottawattamie, Story and Washington each had one new case. Those infected included six who are 61 years or older, nine who are 41 to 60 years old, and eight who are 18 to 40. The new numbers came a day after Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a state emergency declaration that includes the temporary suspension of penalties and interest on late property tax payments, prevents some home evictions, and allows bars and restaurants to sell unopened bottles of alcohol for consumption off premises.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Residents will be able to get medicine without an in-person visit to the doctor during the coronavirus crisis under a new executive order that Gov. Laura Kelly announced Sunday. Kelly, a Democrat, announced two new orders aimed at temporarily expanding health care access. She said in a statement that the orders “will make sure Kansas families can access needed care and supplies until we have weathered this storm.” Fifty-five cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, are now confirmed in Kansas. They include two deaths. One was announced in Johnson County on Saturday. The state’s first death from the virus, a Kansas City-area nursing home resident in Wyandotte County, was reported March 12. Another executive order issued by Kelly eases motor carrier rules and regulations such as weight restrictions. Kelly said the goal is to allow for quicker delivery of resources to address the pandemic.\n\nKentucky\n\nFranklin: Gov. Andy Beshear announced Saturday that a third person has died from the coronavirus as the total number of confirmed cases in the state increased to nearly 90. Beshear said the 67-year-old Anderson County man who died had several other health problems. “None of us have liked that this has happened, but we need to think about his family and provide all the support to him that we can,” he said. The Democratic governor also urged residents to continue social distancing in order to prevent COVID-19 cases as much as possible. He said members of the public should pursue assistance if they need as the virus continues to spread across the state, urging that there “is no stigma” to doing so. “Be that good neighbor,” Beshear said. “Every time there is a group where large groups are not absolutely necessary, we allow this coronavirus to spread.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has issued a statewide “stay at home” directive, ordering all 4.6 million people in Louisiana to stay at home starting at 5 p.m. Monday unless they’re performing an essential task like getting food or medicine. Workers in grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors’ offices and other critical infrastructure are exempt from the governor’s directive. “The bottom line is we are in a race against time when it comes to this coronavirus and its rapid spread in Louisiana,” Edwards said Sunday. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell had issued a similar order for that city two days ago. As of Sunday, coronavirus infections in Louisiana have climbed to more than 830. Twenty people in the state have died of COVID-19, state health officials said. Edwards warned that the state was on a similar trajectory in cases to Italy, the virus has overwhelmed hospitals, and Louisiana’s health system could soon be overloaded with patients.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Concerns about social distancing pushed the state to postpone the start of its season for commercial baby eel fishing by at least two weeks, officials said. The season for baby eels, called elvers, was scheduled to begin Sunday. It’s one of the most lucrative fisheries in the state. The baby eels are used as seed stock by Asian aquaculture companies and can fetch more than $2,000 per pound at the docks. But Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher said Friday that the nature of the elver fishery makes it “impossible to follow social distancing recommendations,” such as maintaining 6 feet of distance from other people as part of an effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in the state jumped by more than a dozen from Friday to Saturday to 70.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The mayor of the state’s most popular beach destination wants vacationers to postpone their trips as the state attempts to combat the spread of the new coronavirus. “We’re not encouraging people to come,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan told WBAL-TV on Saturday. “We don’t want them to be here and contract anything while they were down here in Ocean City, even if that’s possible.” Gov. Larry Hogan has reduced the permissible number of people statewide at gatherings from 50 to 10. He said this week that some people were still holding parties and cookouts and large gatherings, in violation of state law. Meehan said Ocean City will be enforcing all of Hogan’s initiatives: “We’re hoping people will wait for those good times to come back before they travel to the beach.” Maryland health officials reported 190 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Saturday, about 40 more than was reported Friday. Two people have died.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state reported its second virus-related death Saturday night as it prepared to open hundreds of day care sites for the children of medical professionals, emergency workers and others who are expected to keep working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second person in Massachusetts to died from a coronavirus-related illness was a Middlesex County woman in her 50s who had a preexisting condition, a release from the state health department said. On Friday, a Suffolk County man in his 80s was announced as the first person in the state to die from related illness. Gov. Charlie Baker announced Saturday that more than 300 sites will open Monday, with more to follow later. The rest of the state’s child care facilities have been ordered to shut down to help prevent spread of the coronavirus. More than 520 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Massachusetts.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that the state needs the federal government to provide not only more test kits and masks but also clear guidance on how best to fight the spread of the coronavirus. “We’re all building the airplane as we fly it right now. We’re doing the best that we can. We’re going to continue to be aggressive, and we’re continually monitoring what the next move we can make is,” she said on ABC’s “This Week.” “Frankly a patchwork strategy of each state doing what they can is – we’re going to do it if we have to, but it would be nice to have a national strategy.” She said she doesn’t want to fight with the White House but said a point will come in which failures will need to be examined. Michigan has reported 787 cases in total of COVID-19. Eight people have died.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state’s number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus rose to 169 on Sunday, up 32 from a day earlier. The state has had one death, a Ramsey County resident in their 80s who died Thursday. That person came in contact with an infected family member who had a history of international travel, said Kris Ehresmann, the Minnesota Department of Health’s infectious disease director. The person also had underlying medical conditions, she said. Sunday’s update noted that the virus had been confirmed in two new counties, Cass and LeSueur. Ehresmann told reporters during a conference call Sunday afternoon that 17 patients have been hospitalized so far. Ten remain hospitalized, including five in intensive care. The other seven are recovering at home. The 169 infected patients’ ages range from 10 to 94, Ehresmann said. Thirty-four health care workers have been infected, she added.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Confirmed coronavirus infections climbed to more than 200 in Mississippi, and the governor announced plans to provide quicker access to unemployment benefits for residents affected by the outbreak. The more than 200 cases were reported as of 6 p.m. Saturday, according to state health department figures updated Sunday. A single COVID-19 death has been reported in the state. Gov. Tate Reeves on Saturday took action to help relieve burdens on the state’s workforce, according to a news release. He signed an executive order instructing the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to expedite payments to unemployed workers and relax collection requirements on employers. The governor also suspended collection activity, including enrollment of liens and tax garnishments.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state rose to 90 Sunday, including at least five cases tied to one suburban St. Louis preschool. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is up from 75 on Saturday, according to the state health department. Three people have died in Missouri, one each in Boone, Jackson and St. Louis counties. At least five cases are tied to Temple Israel’s preschool in Creve Coeur. St. Louis and St. Louis County authorities on Saturday announced mandatory stay-at-home orders, effective Monday. Kansas City officials followed later Saturday with a similar order. The order in Kansas City and surrounding areas is set to begin Tuesday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: There were 34 confirmed cases of coronavirus cases in the state as of Sunday afternoon, up from 27 the day before and adding three cases from Cascade County into the mix. Gallatin County now has the most cases, with 10 confirmed incidents of the respiratory illness that is now a pandemic. The virus has surfaced in 11 of Montana’s 56 counties. So far there have been 10 cases confirmed in Gallatin County, six cases in Yellowstone County, four in Missoula County, three in Cascade and Lewis and Clark counties, two in Flathead and Silver Bow counties, and one each in Broadwater, Madison, Ravalli and Roosevelt counties. Health officials warned Sunday that there is evidence the coronavirus has been spreading in Gallatin County, stressing the need for the public to take precautions to prevent more people from being exposed to it.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials have confirmed 10 new cases of coronavirus to give the state a total of 49 cases. Douglas County health officials reported eight new cases Saturday. Five of the cases are related to travel, and three of the cases had contact with a previous positive case in the area. Health officials in Lancaster and Buffalo counties also announced the second cases in both those counties. Both of those new cases are family members of the first case in each county. Health officials said a 48-year-old Lancaster County man who tested positive for COVID-19 visited Charleston’s Restaurant and Freezing Moo in Omaha on March 15 before he was diagnosed with the illness. Anyone who was at those businesses that afternoon should monitor themselves for symptoms, such as a fever and cough, for 14 days.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: While the governor joined other U.S. officials invoking extraordinary measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the mayor of Las Vegas is pushing back against a shutdown of the casinos that power the city and the state economy. Governors in California, New York and Illinois have ordered millions of people to stay in their homes except for essentials and exercise, while Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other leaders around the country have told restaurants and other businesses to shut down. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman became an outspoken outlier by declaring that her city should be allowed to stay open for business. Nevada has tallied two deaths and more than 190 cases of COVID-19, almost all in the Las Vegas area. “Our economy depends on tourism and being open for dining, entertainment, gaming, sports,” Goodman said in a prepared speech before the Las Vegas City Council.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Retail stores are being ordered to temporarily transition to the use of single-use paper or plastic bags because of the risk that reusable bags could aid in transmission of the coronavirus. In the order issued late Saturday, Gov. Chris Sununu directed all grocers and retail stores in New Hampshire to transition to use only new paper or plastic grocery bags provided by stores “as soon as feasibly possible.” “Our grocery store workers are on the front lines of COVID-19, working around the clock to keep New Hampshire families fed,” the governor said in a statement. “With identified community transmission, it is important that shoppers keep their reusable bags at home given the potential risk to baggers, grocers and customers.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nParamus: Authorities say a drive-thru coronavirus testing center once again reached capacity Sunday morning shortly after opening, but the site will reopen Monday – and a second drive-thru center is also expected to open in Monmouth County. Bergen County Executive Jim Tedesco said on his Facebook page that the site at Bergen Community College would reopen at 8 a.m. Monday. He said the county has the most cases in the state and has recorded five deaths, so “it is important that we test as many symptomatic residents as possible.” The mass testing center was at capacity minutes after opening Saturday for its second day of operations. Hundreds of cars were waiting in lines, but less than 15 minutes after opening, police began turning people away. Tedesco urged people coming to the site, who must be New Jersey residents, to be patient. They will be screened for symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and coughing.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has grown to 57, and two local high schools’ students and staff are being advised to self-isolate because a student at one has tested positive for the disease. The 14 new cases include a baby boy and eight other people in Bernalillo County, which includes metro Albuquerque, and one each in Dona Ana, Lea, Sandoval, Santa Fe and Taos counties, according to the state Department of Health. Albuquerque Public Schools officials said the Department of Health notified them Friday that it was investigating a case involving a Del Norte High School student. The school’s students and staff and those of Nex+Gen Academy Magnet School also located on the Del Norte campus were advised to self-isolate “in an abundance of caution” and to contact the state if symptoms surfaced and required medical attention.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The governor said Sunday that he was exasperated that people are still ignoring his social distancing orders, saying he spent part of the previous day watching people clustering in groups and acting like it was just another nice spring day. “There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate. You would think there is nothing going on. In parts of New York City, it was just a bright, sunny Saturday,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. He said city officials must come up with a plan immediately to prevent people from congregating in parks or elsewhere, saying it was a matter of life and death. Nearly 2,000 people have been hospitalized in the state with the virus, and 114 have died, Cuomo said. More than 15,000 have tested positive statewide, including 9,000 in New York City. “I don’t know what they’re not understanding,” Cuomo said, his voice rising. “This is not life as usual.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDuck: People renting beach houses in counties that have blocked visitor access to the Outer Banks because of the new coronavirus should get their money refunded, a state panel says. The North Carolina Real Estate Commission ruled Thursday that state law sides with tenants in this situation, reports The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Virginia. Dare and Currituck counties have approved orders preventing visitors and non-resident property owners from entering the Outer Banks. And Hyde County has blocked visitor access to Ocracoke Island. Landlords who won’t refund money are open to a lawsuit, according to the commission. Monica Thibodeau, the owner of Carolina Designs Realty in Duck, said social media and phone calls have been mixed about the visitor prohibitions. The company manages vacation rentals for owners for a fee. “We’re trying to keep everybody happy as possible,” said Thibodeau, a member of Duck’s town council.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials say the state appears to be holding its own as the coronavirus crisis stretches on. The state Department of Health reported Sunday morning that labs tested 106 additional people for the virus between 3 p.m. Saturday and 9 a.m. Sunday, and all tests came back negative. That means the state is holding at 28 positives, three hospitalizations and no deaths. Meanwhile, two hospital executives said Saturday that while their workforce is keeping up with the number of the coronavirus cases, they’re asking former doctors and nurses to think about returning if the numbers continue to climb. Dr. Michael LeBeau of Sanford Health and Kurt Schley of CHI-St. Alexius Health said an order by Gov. Doug Burgum that eases licensing requirements will allow them to bring in people from other states, most of whom are already in their systems. They also put out a plea to local retirees.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Board of Pharmacy took an emergency 7-0 vote Sunday by telephone on a new regulation designed to prevent hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug – chloroquine – that are sold around the world under a variety of brand and generic names. They are malaria drugs that are seeing a surge in nationwide demand after President Donald Trump suggested they could treat people with the coronavirus, even though the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said science does not support that idea. Under the new regulation, pharmacists cannot dispense chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or sell them for a COVID-19 diagnosis unless it fulfills various prescribing requirements, including a positive test result, and is limited to a 14-day supply. They are prohibited from selling the drugs for prophylactic use for the coronavirus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A second person in the state has died of COVID-19 as the number of Oklahomans with the illness caused by the novel coronavirus increased by more than a dozen, health officials said Sunday. The man who died was in his 50s and lived in Pawnee County, west of Tulsa, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said in a statement. It did not provide further details on the circumstances of his illness and death. The number of people in the state who have tested positive for the virus increased to 67 Sunday, from 53 the day before. The health department said 11 of those people are hospitalized. Oklahoma County has the most cases, with 26, following by Cleveland County, with 13, and Tulsa County, with six.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state is reporting another death from COVID-19, bringing the total to four, as mayors and others urged Gov. Kate Brown to issue more restrictions to stop the spread of the virus. And a city on Oregon’s northwest coast, Warrenton, declared a state of emergency, banned camping and ordered campgrounds to close. The city also prohibited short-term rentals and home-stay lodging and told hotels to close after an influx of weekend visitors, who were told to leave within 24 hours. The Oregon Health Authority said the latest death was a 72-year-old woman in Marion County who had underlying health conditions. She tested positive March 15 and died Friday at Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside Medical Center. The state also reported 23 new confirmed cases of the disease, bringing the total to 137.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Health officials on Sunday reported more than 100 new cases of coronavirus in the state, for a total of more than 470. Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Saturday that people with mild symptoms do not necessarily need to get tested, and, after calling their doctor, they may be able to stay home, rest, and take fluids and anti-fever medication. Testing is being prioritized for symptomatic people who are health care providers, elderly, very ill or dealing with chronic medical conditions, Levine said. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania House State Government Committee Chairman Garth Everett, R-Lycoming, said Sunday that legislation is being drafted to delay the state’s primary from April 28 to June 2. Everett said he hopes to get the legislation out of his committee Monday and through the Republican-controlled chamber this coming week, to send it to the Senate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo has ordered all gyms, salons and other “close contact” businesses to close by Monday afternoon as the state works to prevent spread of the coronavirus. The Democratic governor announced the new measures Sunday, saying the state needs to be “more aggressive” in its response to the virus. Her new order also requires theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainment venues to close their in-person operations, and Raimondo is urging all residents to work from home if possible. The order requires gyms, fitness centers, hair salons, nail salons, spas and tattoo parlors to close by 5 p.m. Monday. Raimondo said it was a tough decision but vowed to help small businesses get back on their feet later. Any businesses that remain open will be required to keep 6 feet between customers, regularly clean surfaces and ensure proper hygiene among employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s largest public university said Saturday that 18 students living in a campus dormitory are being held in quarantine after one of them tested positive for the coronavirus. The University of South Carolina students were being kept in isolation “pending further investigation” to reduce risks of spreading the new virus, the school said in a news release. It said administrators learned late Friday that a student in a residence hall on the Columbia campus was confirmed to have been infected. Campus staff are making sure the quarantined students have food and any needed medical attention, according to the university. It said at least 11 other students and one faculty member have also tested positive for the coronavirus, but all were either off campus or in other states. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 across South Carolina exceeded 170 on Saturday, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. There were three deaths statewide linked to the virus.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The number of people testing positive for the coronavirus increased from 14 to 21, state health officials said Sunday, but Gov. Kristi Noem declined to order businesses to close as her counterparts have in some other areas of the country. Noem and South Dakota Health Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon told reporters the new victims apparently contracted the virus through travel or by interacting with another person who had it. However, Noem warned that Beadle County appears to be on the verge of community spread, a term that describes when the source is unknown. She urged local leaders in that county to impose social distancing measures, including limiting group sizes, but stopped short of issuing any executive orders. The Rapid City Journal reports Pennington County commissioners complained during a special Saturday meeting that coronavirus shutdowns elsewhere are going too far.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Sunday urged residents to work from home and ordered bars and restaurants to close for 14 days starting Monday with the exception of drive-thru, takeout and delivery services in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Lee’s sweeping order closed gyms and fitness centers from Monday until April 6. He also barred most visitors to nursing homes, retirement homes and long-term care facilities and prohibited social gatherings of 10 or more people. Residents were told to work from home “where feasible,” but Lee stopped short of mandating that people shelter in place. The order on bars and restaurants allows for the sale of unopened alcoholic beverages, including beer, for takeout or delivery orders as long as they are accompanied by food. In Nashville, Mayor John Cooper on Sunday ordered all nonessential businesses to close for 14 days starting Monday. The number of confirmed cases in Tennessee has risen to more than 370, with one death.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday said the National Guard could begin monitoring drive-in testing sites Monday, and the Republican declined at a news conference to follow the lead of other states with a statewide “shelter in place” order. But Abbott warned Texans that it could be coming if they don’t heed his previous orders Friday that limited social gatherings to under 10 people; closed schools, bars and gyms; and banned dine-in eating at restaurants. “Stricter standards will be taken,” if necessary, Abbott said. “If you don’t have an essential reason for leaving your home, you should not be leaving your home.” The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 334 people statewide have tested positive for the virus, up from 304 on Saturday, and officials in Dallas said a man in his 80s has become the sixth Texas resident with the disease to die.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported its first death related to COVID-19 on Sunday – a man over the age of 60 who had underlying health problems. The unidentified man from Davis County had been at Lakeview Hospital in Bountiful, near Salt Lake City, for two days before his death, the Utah Department of Health hospital operator Mountainstar HCA said in a joint announcement. The man tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, and health officials are working to identify and contact anyone who may have been in close contact with him. Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert said he and his wife extended their deepest sympathies to the man’s family and friends. “The pain this family must be feeling right now puts into perspective the sacrifices we are all making to keep one another safe and healthy. We encourage everyone to do their part by practicing safe health practices, including social distancing,” Herbert said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Health Department is urging the state’s long-term care facilities to take the temperature of all staff members before they enter the buildings where they work. Workers who show any signs of being ill are being told to stay home. The moves are part of the state’s effort to stop the spread of the new coronavirus in long-term care facilities. More than 10 cases of COVID-19 were reported at the Burlington Health and Rehabilitation Center. One patient there died of COVID-19. “This is perhaps the most complex public health event most Vermonters have experienced,” Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said in a statement. “And I can’t repeat this enough – it is extremely important for all of us, young and old, to take extra care to help protect the people most vulnerable to serious illness.” On Saturday, the health department reported the number of cases of COVID-19 in Vermont jumped more than 50%, going from under 30 to almost 50. Two have died.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam on Sunday offered a sobering timeline of efforts to diminish the intensity of the coronavirus outbreak, warning that life as we’ve known it will be disrupted “for a long time.” Health officials said the state’s load of positive COVID-19 cases had grown by 65 from the day before to nearly 220 as of Sunday, with three deaths, including a Fairfax County resident who died Saturday. The increase in cases is attributed in part to the increased testing capacity in the state, Northam said at a news conference, but it’s also because the virus continues to spread. “COVID-19 is going to be with us for a long time – months, not weeks. We need to begin adjusting to that reality,” he said. “It is difficult to live with uncertainty. But the sooner we all adopt these new ways of living, the sooner we will all get through this.” Northam said some people still aren’t heeding the strong advice to avoid nonessential gatherings of more than 10 people. “This is not a holiday; this is not a vacation,” he said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A second patient at Washington state’s largest psychiatric hospital has tested positive for the new coronavirus. The Western State Hospital patient was on a different ward from the one who tested positive last week, officials with the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a release Saturday. Both patients were being treated at a Pierce County hospital. Washington state leads the nation in coronavirus deaths with at least 94 fatalities and almost 1,800 positive cases. Officials also reported last week that a hospital employee had the disease and was recovering at home. After those reports, union hospital workers sent a letter to officials demanding that all employees who had contact with the sick patients and worker be tested for COVID-19. But state officials are asking workers to “self-screen” for symptoms instead and to stay home if they have symptoms.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice has a message about the coronavirus pandemic: It’s like a scary movie. In an apparent attempt to soothe a nervous public, Justice offered a rambling response to the virus in a statewide address Saturday night in which he declined to order a broad lockdown, issued dire warnings about New York state, urged people to follow existing protocols and admitted that perhaps his speech could have waited until Monday. “It’s like we’re all lost in a movie that we can’t relate to in any way,” he said during the roughly 25-minute address that left many on social media scratching their heads. He asked people to search their souls to ask if they believed it’s possible for thousands of West Virginians to die. He fell back on platitudes. He stumbled through math equations. “If we don’t act, and we don’t act as strongly as possible right now, we’re going to lose lives and lots of lives,” the Republican governor said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has asked federal officials for help in obtaining tens of thousands of additional pieces of protective equipment as the state continues to grapple with the coronavirus. Evers announced Saturday that he has directed state emergency management officials to ask the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help in obtaining gear for first responders, including 50,000 masks; 10,000 face shields, 11,000 coveralls, 35,000 pairs of gloves and 3,000 N95 masks, which are designed to ensure a very close facial fit. The state is also trying to obtain more equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile. So far the state has received about 52,000 N95 masks, 130,000 surgical masks, 25,000 face shields, 20,000 surgical gowns, 100 coveralls and 36,000 pairs of gloves from the stockpile. Those supplies are being distributed to health care providers in areas with community spread.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A shortage of testing capacity is making it harder for health officials in the state to determine just how many people have been infected with coronavirus, doctors said, while Gov. Mark Gordon sought to expedite delivery of supplies related to the virus. The nationwide testing shortage includes not enough equipment to reliably move swabs from clinics to labs, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Meanwhile, state guidelines limit testing to high-risk cases: the elderly, health care workers and those in contact with people who’ve been infected. People with milder cases, who make up over 80% of those with the COVID-19 illness, largely are not being tested. “Most providers feel like this is the time we should be testing; this is the time we should figure out where the clusters are,” Wyoming Medical Center chief of staff Dr. Andy Dunn said. “However, due to the scarcity of the supplies, it is what it is.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/03/offbeat-derby-keepsakes-art-lost-space-nunchucks-news-around-states/39438803/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A legislative committee has voted to make it a hate crime to target someone because of their sexual orientation or their employment as a law enforcement officer. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday took up a bill to add police officers to the groups covered by Alabama’s hate crime law. Current law allows heightened penalties if crimes were motivated by the victim’s race, religion, national origin, ethnicity or disability. State Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, a Mobile Democrat, added an amendment to include crimes that target someone because of their sexual orientation. Some Democrats have unsuccessfully pushed for years to add sexual orientation to the law. Figures said the bill was a good vehicle for the needed change. The committee approved the amendment and bill, which now moves to the full Senate.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The oldest original lighthouse in the state is in dire need of repairs. The Juneau Empire reports the paint on the 114-year-old Eldred Rock Lighthouse atop a cliff in the middle of Lynn Canal is peeling. But Eldred Rock Lighthouse Preservation Association board member Justin Fantasia says the greater concern is the chunks of concrete falling from the building. Fantasia was part of a team that went out to the lighthouse Monday to take stock of what needs to be repaired. The Eldred Rock Lighthouse Preservation Association, with the help of the Marine Exchange of Alaska, is starting the process of taking over the lighthouse to better preserve it. The U.S. Coast Guard currently owns it, but ERLPA Executive Director Sue York says she’s hoping to work out a lease where ERLPA can take over the lighthouse.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state may lift the legal restrictions around owning nunchucks. The House voted Thursday to remove nunchucks from the list of deadly weapons that are illegal to own in most circumstances. The weapons used in martial arts are made from two sticks or rods connected by a rope or chain. Arizona allows people to carry nunchucks to prepare for competition. But supporters say those who practice martial arts shouldn’t have to worry they’ll face charges. They say it’s highly unlikely someone would use nunchucks to commit a crime. Critics say that nunchucks can cause serious harm and that lawmakers should be focused on reducing gun violence. The measure now goes to Gov. Doug Ducey.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The first cultivator in the state to begin growing medical marijuana says it has finished harvesting its initial crop. BOLD Team spokesman Robert Lercher says the cultivator still expects to have the drug delivered to available dispensaries by May 12. The facility has previously estimated it would have about 200 pounds of product once the cannabis was dried and cured. The Department of Health said last month that it would automatically reissue its yearlong medical marijuana cards to the more than 10,500 qualifying patients who’d received them in the months before the plant could be sold. Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin says two other cultivators are growing and expect to harvest by summer.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Officials say the state had its slowest recorded growth rate ever last year as the country prepares for the 2020 census. The state is spending millions preparing for the all-important head count that distributes federal tax dollars and influences congressional boundaries. But new estimates released Wednesday by state officials say California grew by 0.47% in 2018, the slowest rate on record dating back to 1900. The sluggish growth rate comes as California and other states worry a new question on the census forms asking for people’s citizenship status could make it harder to count the country’s Hispanic population. It’s a concern in California, which has the largest Hispanic population in the country. The state’s population has been creeping toward 40 million people.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Riders in the city will soon be able to buy tickets for public transportation using the Uber app, the latest step on the ride-hailing company’s mission to become a one-stop shop for transportation. Potential Uber riders will see a transit option alongside UberX and Black, along with the price and trip duration, and will be able to purchase a ticket for the bus or train instead of hailing an Uber. Uber announced Thursday that it will be rolling out the feature to Denver customers over the next few weeks. Uber and its U.S. rival Lyft have been working with cities to include information about public transportation options in their apps. But this is the first time either company has made it possible for customers to actually buy tickets for public transportation on the app.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: UConn students will no longer need to buy a ticket to attend most of the school’s home athletic events. The school announced Thursday that beginning in the fall, students will simply need to swipe their Student ID for admission to football, basketball, soccer and hockey games. The school says their student sections will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis. UConn says there will be an exception for some high-demand basketball games, where free student tickets will be distributed in advance. Athletic Director David Benedict says students already contribute to the athletic department through fees and it was important to the department to eliminate any additional costs. The school says details of the policy will be announced in the summer.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: The garbage dumped on the state’s roadways, waterways, parks and other public areas has state officials talking trash. Gov. John Carney joined environmentalists and other elected officials Tuesday in Rehoboth to launch a statewide campaign encouraging Delawareans not to litter and to help clean up outdoor spaces. The campaign comes after a state Anti-Dumping and Anti-Littering Task Force issued a report last year with several recommendations to get residents to clean up their act. Those recommendations including enhancing penalties for unlawful dumping and substantial littering, considering legislation to make Delaware “plastic free,” and supporting public education and awareness campaigns.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The people of the district are pretty dirty, according to a Quality Logo Products study of 2,732 Americans’ hygiene habits across 25 locations. D.C. follows closely behind Seattle and Denver as America’s No. 3 grungiest city, WUSA-TV reports. Some Washington residents said they shower every four to five days – 6.8% of them, according to the study. More D.C. residents, 12.6%, said they brush their teeth every two to three days or less. And Washington residents apparently change their underwear the least often, with 18.4% of those surveyed saying they wear the same pair for four days or more. But according to the survey, people in the capital are the worst about washing their hands – 25.7% of those surveyed skip hand-washing “often” or “all the time.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Bay: A toddler stumbled upon a woolly mammoth tooth last weekend alongside a retention pond, uncovering evidence of the tusked beasts that roamed the Space Coast thousands of years ago. Monte Brigance, a retired offshore electrician from Livingston, Texas, was babysitting his grandson Colt Couch, who turns 3 on Wednesday, during the unexpected discovery. “He was throwing rocks into the pond. That’s his favorite thing to do: throw rocks in the pond that he picks up out of the bank. About half of this was sticking out of the soil, and he couldn’t pull it up,” Brigance said, holding the mammoth tooth. “Out of all the places my wife and I have been, looking for fossils – and yet we come to Florida and go to a pond, and there it is sticking out of the ground. It was a nice little find.” Ice Age creatures were common in Florida, particularly along the Atlantic Coastal Ridge.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson says she’s officially running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, after fellow Democrat Stacey Abrams announced she wouldn’t run. Tomlinson announced her candidacy this week for the seat now held by incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue, who in his first term has emerged as a close ally of President Donald Trump. Tomlinson had previously signaled that she’d run only if Abrams, who grabbed national attention during her unsuccessful run for Georgia governor last year, was out. In her announcement, Tomlinson took aim at Republican leaders, saying she wants to see a government in Washington “without all the crazy and the mean.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An investment firm that helps educators buy homes in high-cost communities has brought its services to the state. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports business executive organization Hawaii Executive Conference announced Landed’s Hawaii expansion Tuesday at Hawaii Community Foundation’s downtown headquarters. The San Francisco-based company invests in home purchases with educators by providing up to half of a standard down payment on a home, with a limit of $120,000, in return for repayment of that contribution in the future along with a sum totaling 25% of any gain or loss in value. Landed’s co-founder Alex Lofton calls it a “shared investment in the home.” Lofton says Landed has helped almost 200 educators buy homes since 2015.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federally run sheep research facility long targeted by environmental groups concerned about potential harm to wildlife is facing another legal challenge. The U.S. Department of Justice in court documents filed Monday in response to a lawsuit says the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Sheep Experiment Station in eastern Idaho correctly followed environmental laws in authorizing sheep grazing. Western Watersheds Project and two other groups in a lawsuit filed in February are challenging a decision allowing sheep owned by the University of Idaho to graze in the Centennial Mountains of Idaho and Montana this year. The groups say the areas contain essential wildlife habitat that’s a corridor for grizzly bears between Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. The groups also say bighorn sheep and greater sage grouse use the area.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Four pups of a critically endangered species of wolf have been born at Lincoln Park Zoo. A news release from the zoo says the two male and two female red wolf pups were born April 13 – the first new litter of red wolf pups at the zoo in nearly a decade. Curator Dan Boehm says the arrival of the pups comes at a time when scientists estimate there are fewer than 30 red wolves left in their native habitat of North Carolina. The wolves – named for their red-tinged fur – have over the years been driven to the brink of extinction by hunting. The zoo is taking part with other zoos in a Red Wolf Species Survival plan to increase the animals’ population.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: City officials are hoping to attract a developer to turn a plot of land along Lake Michigan into a lakefront destination. The northwestern Indiana city is seeking bids from developers interested in building hotels, restaurants, tourist-oriented retail, pedestrian-friendly commerce or unique attractions like a science center on the 21-acre site. The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports the city aims to sell the property and its beachside parking to a private enterprise for at least $4.25 million. The site in Gary’s Miller neighborhood is near the Indiana Dunes National Park’s western gateway. Gary officials will accept redevelopment proposals and sealed bids through June 19.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Tuition increases of 3.9% have been recommended to the Iowa Board of Regents. The regents are expected to vote on the proposal Wednesday at their meeting in Urbandale. The increases would take effect next fall at the University of Iowa in Iowa City and Iowa State University in Ames. But no increase was recommended for the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. Officials say Northern Iowa has a different competitive landscape and student body makeup. The tuition increases are being sought because the Legislature has approved an education budget that includes $6 million less than university officials had sought.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Senate has approved a bill that would prevent judges from lowering sentences for child sex offenders if they think the victims were willing participants in the crime. The bill approved Wednesday comes after a Leavenworth County judge in February reduced the sentence for 67-year-old Raymond Soden because he thought the 13- and 14-year-old girls involved in the case were “aggressors.” The Kansas City Star reports current state law allows judges discretion in sentencing for “substantial or compelling” reasons. The new bill prohibits judges from reducing sentences if a victim is a participant or aggressor in a sexually violent crime or electronic solicitation when the victim is under 14 and the offender is 18 or older. The bill now goes to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A website is taking Derby keepsakes to a stinky new level with preserved equine excrement. Yes, it’s 100% real horse poop in a jar. And it costs $200. Lexington-based Kentucky for Kentucky is selling preserved horse turds from 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm. The 16-ounce mason jar contains a Derby dropping preserved and suspended in clear epoxy resin. “Introducing Derby Turds,” its website says. “The first in a Dixieland Preserves line of bizarro Southern resin encapsulations by Kentucky artist Coleman Larkin.” The website describes the product as “equal parts art and novelty, these gorgeous nuggets of digested Kentucky bluegrass and whatever else horses eat were daringly harvested by the artist himself.” A portion of the proceeds will go to Old Friends Farm in Georgetown, where Silver Charm lives.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPort Fourchon: The Trump administration on Thursday moved to ease safety regulations adopted after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon blowout, the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a statement that the administration was acting to eliminate “unnecessary regulatory burdens while maintaining safety and environmental protection offshore.” The oil industry has been challenging the Obama-era rules, which govern the operation of offshore wells. Officials announced the final revisions at Port Fourchon, a hub of offshore drilling on the Gulf of Mexico. The audience included oil port workers in hard hats and reflective safety vests. Eleven people died in April 2010 when the Deepwater Horizon exploded, ultimately releasing more than 3 million barrels of crude.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: For the second consecutive year, an asylum-seeker from the state has made it to the final round of a national spoken poetry competition. The road to the Poetry Out Loud National Finals on Wednesday night was less bumpy for 18-year-old Joao Victor than for his predecessor. Last year, Deering High School junior Allan Monga of Portland had to sue as a noncitizen to participate in the event hosted by the National Endowment for the Arts. The Sun Journal newspaper reports that Victor came to the U.S. three years ago from Angola and speaks seven languages. He’s also fluent in the language of poetry. Victor said he was inspired by Monga, who fled Zambia. Monga recited Lord Byron’s poem “She Walks in Beauty.” He made the finals but did not win.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A great horned owl and at least seven bald eagles have been found dead along the state’s Eastern Shore this year, reminding officials of the eagles found fatally poisoned in the area in 2016. The Baltimore Sun reports state and federal wildlife officials are investigating the deaths, saying the Delmarva Peninsula has a “systemic” illegal poisoning problem. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information that furthers the investigation. This year’s first known poisoning happened in March. Authorities believe the birds were killed with the pesticide carbofuran, which was essentially banned from the nation’s market partly due to it being lethal to birds. Authorities say the birds may have eaten bait laced with the pesticide, sometimes sold under the name Furadan.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Legal marijuana has reached a milestone of sorts in the state as sales of recreational pot climb over the $100 million mark. According to the latest data from the state’s Cannabis Control Commission, retail pot shops have sold $104 million worth of product since the first stores opened last November. Nearly $7 million in total sales were reported last week, with customers spending an average of $41 per transaction. The increases reflect the steadily growing number of pot shops in the state, with 21 having now been awarded final licenses. The first recreational store in Worcester, the state’s second-largest city, opened Wednesday. But Massachusetts is still likely to miss its forecast of $63 million in marijuana taxes in the current fiscal year due to the initially slower-than-expected rollout of retail stores.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state’s schools would not have to reschedule up to four snow days that occurred during an arctic deep freeze under legislation sent Thursday to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her expected signature. The bill won final approval when Senate Democrats agreed to ensure it would take effect immediately. That was a reversal after they had effectively stalled the measure earlier in the week because majority Republicans stripped a House-passed provision that would have ensured some hourly school employees were paid for days canceled due to the weather – if their labor contract or employment agreement is silent on the issue. “It’s all for the kids and giving schools plenty of notice so they can do their proper planning,” said Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Clarklake Republican.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz says he supports legislation to ban the recreational hunting of wolves in the state if the federal government succeeds in removing them from the threatened list. An amendment to prohibit sport wolf hunting was added to a House environmental bill Tuesday. On Wednesday, the governor said that when he was in Congress he supported “delisting” wolves where populations had recovered, but not nationwide. And while he said he supports managing wolf populations, he doesn’t think sport hunting is appropriate. Minnesota held three wolf seasons before a judge restored federal protections 2014. Lt. Gov Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, says the issue is personal for her because she’s from the Wolf clan, and there’s a rule against hunting your own clan.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will start allowing people with felony drug convictions to apply for federal food assistance. The new policy takes effect July 1 and could affect as many as 67,000 people. Lawmakers approved the change in a bill aimed at reducing recidivism and shrinking the prison population. A 1996 federal law put a lifetime ban on people convicted of state or federal drug felonies from receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. However, state legislatures could opt out of the ban. Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia were the only states that had not opted out. Republican Sen. Sally Doty of Brookhaven pushed for the change, saying she saw “no reason to treat drug felons differently than those with violent offenses.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city is preparing to restore the building where the Negro National League was founded. The Kansas City Star reports the effort to upgrade the building near the 18th and Vine Jazz District comes just months before the 100th anniversary of the league’s founding. The Kansas City Council on Thursday fast-tracked an ordinance to take over the Buck O’Neil Research and Education Center. The building was known as the Paseo YMCA when independent baseball team owners met there in 1920 to establish what became the Negro Leagues. Under the ordinance, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum will donate the building to the city, which will spend $1 million from its one-cent sales tax for public improvements and more than $283,000 in state tax credits to restore the basement and ground level.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill that would allow emergency care providers to offer non-emergency medical assistance in an effort to reduce the number of 911 calls, especially in rural areas. Supporters say providers could fill gaps in the medical system by helping people manage their medicine or chronic illnesses, giving them a ride to their doctor’s office, or connecting them with other medical or mental health services. The bill, which Bullock signed Wednesday, allows the Board of Medical Examiners to create rules detailing the scope of the changes and a training program for paramedics and emergency medical technicians. Supporters say the measure could also help recruit volunteers who would be willing to do scheduled visits but don’t want to be on call for emergencies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Eight middle-school confirmation class members have decided against joining a Methodist church in protest of the denomination’s renewed ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy. The Omaha World-Herald reports the eight were scheduled to become part of the congregation Sunday at First United Methodist Church. But the seventh- and eighth-graders declined and issued a written statement instead. It says that if they were to join now, that would send the inaccurate message that they approve of the United Methodist Church’s “immoral” policies on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage. Last Friday the denomination’s judicial council upheld key portions of a plan adopted in February by the church’s legislative assembly and designed to strengthen the bans on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBTQ pastors.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Museum of Art’s $1.5 million space balloon is officially lost in space. Museum officials said Wednesday that the “Orbital Reflector” installation, more than three years in the making, cannot be located after a series of technical difficulties and complications from the government shutdown in January. Museum officials believe the piece, as planned, is orbiting Earth, but it will probably be a few years – rather than a few months – before it burns up in the atmosphere. In early December, the Reno-based museum celebrated as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched into space carrying a shoebox-sized package with the museum’s 100-foot-long, diamond-shaped balloon. Museum officials promoted it as the first-ever satellite sent into space strictly for art’s sake.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Supporters of a bill to repeal the death penalty are starting daily candlelight vigils outside of the Statehouse to express their hope that Gov. Chris Sununu will sign it or allow it to become law. Both the House and Senate have voted with veto-proof majorities to repeal the state’s capital punishment law. Sununu, a Republican, vetoed a death penalty repeal bill last June and is expected to do the same this year. The vigils, which started Thursday, are being led by the New Hampshire Council of Churches. The Rev. Jason Wells, the group’s executive director, says the people of New Hampshire have spoken clearly that the state can live without the death penalty.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The operators of a Jersey shore amusement park say a roller coaster there is safe after a pair of water-filled test dummies fell off during a recent test ride. The GaleForce coaster at Playland’s Castaway Cove was undergoing a routine safety check April 20 when the dummies plummeted into a hotel next door, damaging the building’s shingles and plywood. Park officials say the dummies had undetected leaks that made them lose their mass and shape, causing them to fall. They say that the same thing wouldn’t happen to humans and that nothing on the ride failed during the test, including the lap bar that secures riders. Officials say the coaster has run problem-free since the mishap and is tested daily for about two hours.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSilver City: Officials with the Gila National Forest are investigating vandalism at prehistoric rock art sites within the boundaries of the forest. They pointed Wednesday to damage done at Chloride Creek on the Black Range Ranger District. The damage includes names that have been scrawled onto rocks that are laden with prehistoric petroglyphs and pictographs. Officials say the southern New Mexico forest is home to more than 200 recorded rock art sites that, once damaged, can never be repaired to their original condition. They’re asking visitors to be respectful. That includes not touching the rock art, as oils from a single handprint can chemically affect the rock’s surface. It’s also illegal to collect or disturb archaeological materials on public land without a permit.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: More than 2,000 volunteers are expected to help clean up the shores of the Hudson River this weekend. The eighth annual Riverkeeper Sweep will be held Saturday, with volunteers cleaning up shorelines and fostering native plants up and down the river. There are more than 120 projects scheduled, including a cleanup of Iona Island off of Rockland County and cleanup by kayak near Glens Falls. Teams of volunteers are organized by local schools, businesses and organizations. People interested in volunteering can search locations and register at Riverkeeper.org/sweep.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A college student slain while confronting a gunman in his University of North Carolina-Charlotte classroom was given a hero’s send-off Thursday as his body was returned to his hometown with a police escort. Police motorcycles and other vehicles with blue lights flashing quickly left a funeral home and started their 150-mile journey west from Riley Howell’s college home in Charlotte to his mountain hometown of Waynesville. Traffic stopped along busy four-lane Charlotte streets as the procession went by. Howell died in his classroom Tuesday after charging and tackling the gunman who opened fire with a legally obtained pistol, authorities said. Howell’s decision to fight for the lives of others fit his character, said friend David Belnap, who attended a candlelight vigil Wednesday with a homemade T-shirt with “Riley Howell is a hero” written on the back.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Deer hunting licenses in the state are taking a big jump this year. The Game and Fish Department is issuing 65,500 licenses for white-tailed deer and mule deer, up 19% from 2018. It’s the fourth consecutive year of an increase. Game and Fish this year is also fully lifting restrictions on mule deer doe hunting in the west that were implemented eight years ago following a string of harsh winters. State Wildlife Chief Jeb Williams says it’s “shaping up for a pretty decent fall.” Hunters have through June 5 to apply for a 2019 license. This year’s regular gun season opens at noon Nov. 8 and runs through Nov. 24. State Tourism Division data shows that deer hunting contributes tens of millions of dollars to the state economy.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A class at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash College has helped out a fellow student by raising money to enable her to see color for the first time in her life. Savannah Allen’s dental hygiene program classmates say they were inspired to take action after learning that Allen’s participation in the program was in jeopardy due to her colorblindness. Being able to properly view a patient’s teeth and gums for indications of decay or disease is an important part of a hygienist’s job. As a first-year student, Allen’s inability to see colors didn’t pose a challenge until she began treating patients in the Dental Hygiene Clinic, according to the college. The students researched treatment options and started a GoFundMe page to raise the money for special glasses to help Allen see colors.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The city might introduce a minimum age requirement for electric scooters following the death last month of a 5-year-old scooter passenger. The Tulsa World reports the city’s community development and policy chief, Nick Doctor, presented to city councilors on Wednesday the Mayor’s Office’s proposal that would require the minimum age to either 16 or 18. Doctor says the proposal is one of several that aim to increase electric scooter awareness and ensure they’re being safely used ahead of the summer, when ridership is expected to jump substantially. A 5-year-old child was fatally struck by a car after falling off a Lime rental scooter operated by his mother in the city last month.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lawmakers in the House have approved an extra $2 billion in funding for the state’s struggling school system. The chamber voted 37-21 Wednesday following hours of floor debate. Democrats championed the package, saying it’s a necessary investment in Oregon’s public schools, which struggle with the lowest graduation rates in the nation. The vote comes a week before teachers across the state are planning a day of action in protest of decades of disinvestment in the public education system. But Republicans took issue with the proposed business tax to fund the measure, saying it would be passed onto consumers through higher prices. The tax package now moves to the Senate, where it needs a two-thirds vote. Even if it passes through the legislative process, opponents may move to put it to the ballot.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: With their bulging red eyes and deafening mating song, the 17-year cicadas are about to emerge. The insects have been waiting underground for nearly two decades, and millions are about to make their debut around western Pennsylvania, as well as parts of eastern Ohio and a small swath of West Virginia. Penn State Extension horticulture educator Sandy Feather tells the Tribune Review it takes several days of temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit for them to emerge. Temperatures around Pittsburgh are forecast to be in the high 60s and low 70s next week. Feather says they’ll be loud, but they don’t pose a threat to anything except very young trees. Adult cicadas don’t eat or bite and exist only to mate. They’ll all be dead by the end of June.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A Republican activist has sued lottery officials over the state’s legalization and launch of sports betting without first seeking voter approval. Daniel Harrop said Thursday that sports betting should stop pending a statewide referendum. Former Rhode Island Republican Party Chairman Brandon Bell and attorney Joe Larisa filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of Harrop, a member of the party’s central committee. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio has said the legal advice he has seen states that voters approved sports betting when they approved casino gambling, and he’s confident Rhode Island would prevail in any challenge. Harrop says he’s not opposed to gambling, but the state must follow its constitution and ask voters whether gambling should expand.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMoncks Corner: A school district will invest in student accessibility with a portion of funds recovered from a former district official’s $1.3 million embezzlement scheme. The Post and Courier reports Berkeley County School District officials agreed this week to use $300,000 to make playgrounds more accessible and help students with mobility issues. Former district CFO Brantley Thomas stole district money over 16 years in a variety ways, including taking funds from grants for special education students. He was sentenced this year to just over five years in prison on federal embezzlement charges. He was later convicted of related state charges and sentenced to 11 years in prison. The school district is now getting more than $2.2 million in legal settlements and restitution. It will also be getting Thomas’ pension.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpringfield: About 150 inmates took the opportunity to prepare for life after prison at a job fair this week. Ernesto DiFabio was among the men who met with roughly 20 employers at Mike Durfee State Prison on Monday. DiFabio says he’s a graduate of the prison’s automotive vocational program, where he learned how to change oil and replace car parts. The 43-year-old earned an Occupational Safety and Health Administration certification while behind bars. DiFabio says he can’t wait to earn a paycheck. Prison official Monica Wepking says more than 90% of vocational program graduates find a job after being released. She says roughly 8% of program graduates return to prison, well below the general prison population’s recidivism rate of 30%.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The nearly 700-foot-long, 150-foot-high Gatlinburg SkyBridge, the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in North America, opens May 17. Gatlinburg SkyLift, which runs the year-round chairlift that runs from downtown Gatlinburg to the top of Crockett Mountain, plans to open the new attraction. The SkyBridge stretches 680 feet across a valley and features glass floor panels to let visitors look down. “Guests will be able to walk across at their own pace, taking in the views and enjoying the spectacular setting before walking back when they’re ready,” says a post on Gatlinburg SkyLift Park’s Facebook page. The Gatlinburg SkyLift is currently operating, but guests have been unable to get off and enjoy the landscape since devastating November 2016 wildfires.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A 14-year-old boy is raising money to wipe out lunch debt in district schools. The Austin American-Statesman reports Ben Hofer, an eighth grader at St. Andrew’s Episcopal School, decided to tackle the lunch debt for three Austin district campuses for a school service project, Project Citizen. The original goal for his semester-long “LunchCounts!” project was to raise $3,200 to pay off the lunch debts at Akins High, Parades Middle School and Blazier Elementary because the campuses had among the highest balances in the district. But Ben exceeded the amount and now is trying to reach $7,000 to help pay off the debts at more schools. “I can see how having money some days and not having money some days can be very stressful for the kids and their parents,” Ben said. “Lunch is essential for your day. And the school loses money because of it. It’s just bad all around.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: At least one lawmaker thinks people should have beer with their karaoke – even in this conservative state. A new liquor law has come under scrutiny by legislators and business owners after beer licenses were denied to a karaoke lounge and an ax-throwing venue. Democratic Rep. Angela Romero said Wednesday that she plans to introduce an amendment to include karaoke venues among the new sites approved for beer sales. She hasn’t decided whether ax-throwing venues should be added. “When I’m out for a night of fun with friends and go to karaoke, I’d hope I could have a beer,” Romero said. The law represents a tightening of already strict liquor laws in Utah, where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints instructs members to avoid drinking alcohol.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city is planting a variety of young trees to offset expected damage from an ash-tree killing pest. The emerald ash borer has already been detected in Colchester, Milton and South Hero, and foresters estimate 150 million ash trees around the state are at risk. Last weekend, City Arborist V.J. Comai, other professionals, and volunteers planted about 60 trees among dominant stands of ash. Comai estimates that it would cost about $1.1 million to remove and replace the city’s 1,249 ash trees. The beetle has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in North America.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: The city has officially renamed its courthouse after civil rights leader Oliver Hill. The Roanoke Times reports that more than 100 people attended a naming ceremony Wednesday at now-named Oliver W. Hill Justice Center. Hill spent much of his childhood in Roanoke and went on to have a lengthy career as a civil rights lawyer. In 1954, he was part of a series of lawsuits against racially segregated public schools that became the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, which changed American society by setting the foundation for integrated education. He died at age 100 in 2007.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state faces a federal court order to fix under-roadway pipes that block migrating fish by 2030, but a budget passed by lawmakers shortchanges the work. That puts the state at risk of missing the deadline and could delay salmon recovery even as the Pacific Northwest’s orcas are starving. The Legislature’s two-year transportation budget, approved last weekend, devotes $100 million to fixing the pipes. That’s only about one-third of what Gov. Jay Inslee requested, but lawmakers said they couldn’t come up with any more. Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, says underfunding culvert removal now will make it almost impossible to meet the court’s deadline.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: A “Bridge to Nowhere” will have a destination in a few years. Gov. Jim Justice held a groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday for the start of work on a 3.8-mile addition to the King Coal Highway in southern West Virginia. The addition will make use of a bridge that was built a decade ago and dubbed the “Bridge to Nowhere” because the road stopped at the end of it. The governor’s office says the project will give motorists easier access to the Mercer County Airport. Justice says they’re “going to turn this into the ‘Bridge to Somewhere,’ and that somewhere is going to be your airport.” First, crews must cut through a mountain between the bridge and airport. The $57.5 million project is being funded through West Virginia Turnpike Authority bonds. It’s expected to be completed by November 2021.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city plans to extend its streetcar route to the Wisconsin Center District convention hall just in time for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Mayor Tom Barrett on Wednesday unveiled plans to extend The Hop to Wisconsin Avenue by next summer. He also announced engineering plans for two additional legs that would stretch the streetcar route north past Fiserv Forum into Bronzeville and south into Walker’s Point. The extension plans would amount to a major expansion of the 2.1-mile streetcar loop, adding about 2.4 miles of additional route. The plans must first be approved by the Common Council.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The east gate to Yellowstone National Park is opening for the season. The Cody Enterprise reports the entrance will be open Friday morning, but motorists can expect delays because of construction and possibly deteriorating weather conditions. The road between Canyon Village and Lake Village also is scheduled to open Friday. Roads from the west gate to Madison Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs to Old Faithful, and Norris to Canyon Village, opened in mid-April. Yellowstone officials say visitors should check road conditions before venturing into the park.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/31/atlantas-country-history-woodstock-weed-drive-thru-bobcat-news-around-states/39868927/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The Jefferson County Memorial Project is trying to establish a memorial to lynching victims to commemorate 30 people who were slain in the state’s most populous county. The organization has researched documented cases of racial lynchings in the county dating back to the 1880s. Members propose placing a monument in downtown Linn Park, which is home to a Confederate memorial that city leaders want removed. The monument would be a local version of the national lynching memorial in Montgomery, which honors about 4,000 people who were lynched nationwide. The national site includes steel slabs that can be obtained by groups or governments for local monuments. A news release says descendants of lynching victims are involved in the Birmingham project.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s Head Start early childhood education program is preparing to close pre-K classrooms and cut jobs due to budget vetoes. The Anchorage Daily News reports the program has lost its $6.8 million in state funding, which is used to unlock federal funds. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy last month vetoed line items equaling $444 million in cuts to the state operating budget. The federal program is Alaska’s largest provider of early childhood services, offering free pre-K, meals, medical care and other services to low-income children up to age 5. Alaska Head Start officials say they’re trying to quickly cut spending and take other measures before the school year begins. Officials say they hope legislators reverse the budget veto to the program.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: After confusion and outrage over Tempe Police Department’s new “positive ticketing” campaign, police officials promise no one will be pulled over for following the law. The department started an initiative Monday called the “Positive Ticketing Campaign.” KPNX initially reported officers would pull over and issue Circle K drink coupons to people following traffic laws. The social media response was swift and critical. Several hours later, Tempe police spokesman Greg Bacon clarified that officers won’t actually be pulling anyone over. He said a school resource officer may give a helmet-wearing, bike-riding student a coupon if they see the student around campus, or a patrol officer might hand a coupon to someone in line at an eatery if they saw them properly yield to a pedestrian. “No one is under any obligation to have a conversation with a police officer,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The U.S. Department of Transportation is awarding $10.5 million to help pay for improvements to a rail line corridor in southern Arkansas. The funding was announced by members of Arkansas’ congressional delegation. The project calls for improvements along the freight corridor, which runs from McGehee, Arkansas, to Tallulah, Louisiana. According to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, the project aims to provide faster and more affordable shipment for crops, fertilizers and other materials. Supporters say repairing the train tracks will create more business opportunities in Mississippi River Delta communities in Arkansas. The rail line was built in 1878 by the Memphis, Helena and Louisiana Railroad.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Three pharmaceutical companies collectively are agreeing to pay the state nearly $70 million to settle allegations that they delayed drugs to keep prices high, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Monday. The bulk of the money will come from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and its affiliates for paying to delay a generic narcolepsy drug, Provigil, from entering the market for nearly six years. Teva is paying $69 million, which Becerra says is the largest pay-for-delay settlement received by any state. Such agreements let the developers of brand-name drugs keep their monopolies over the drugs after their patents expire, thereby letting them continue to charge consumers higher prices. The drug developer pays the generic manufacturer to keep the cheaper version of the drug from entering the marketplace for an agreed period of time.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Federal land managers say they’re reviewing a protest letter from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources over the Trump administration’s management plan for public lands in the southwest corner of the state. Department Director Dan Gibbs sent the U.S. Bureau of Land Management a letter Monday saying the plan doesn’t do enough to protect the which is a threatened species, or migrating wildlife. Gibbs also objected to the way the plan was developed, saying the bureau gave state officials only one day to review it before making it public and opening a 30-day protest period. Bureau spokesman Steven Hall says the agency is considering the letter. The plan covers federal public land in Delta, Gunnison, Mesa, Montrose, Ouray and San Miguel counties.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Politicians and company executives have joined to flip the switch on the state’s newest power plant. Bridgeport Harbor Station Unit No. 5 was officially celebrated Monday with the flip of a giant switch, even though it has been providing power to Fairfield County for about a month. PSEG Power Connecticut LLC’s natural gas-fired plant overlooking Long Island Sound will provide 485 megawatts of power and replace the nearby coal-fired plant, which is scheduled to be retired in June 2021. The new plant can also run on ultra-low sulfur distillate as a backup. Construction began in June 2017. The new plant represents an investment of more than $550 million.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Gov. John Carney has signed the state’s plastic bag ban into law, moving to decrease single-use plastic and litter while protecting the environment. The law signed Monday goes into effect Jan. 1, 2021. News outlets report it will restrict establishments with more than 7,000 square feet of sales space or those with more than three locations from giving out single-use, noncompostable plastic bags. Business can instead provide customers paper, fabric or reusable plastic bags. Restaurants will be exempt, allowing them to supply plastic bags for some foods. Chemicals and live animals also can be contained in plastic bags. A second law Carney signed Monday will increase penalties for illegal dumping and create a fund for enforcing litter laws.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. House is preparing to hold its first full committee hearing since 1993 for a bill proposing to recognize the district as the nation’s 51st state. The hearing was postponed to avoid conflicts with congressional testimony by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The Washington Post reports both events initially were planned for July 24. Democratic Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton announced Monday that the hearing has since been rescheduled for Sept. 19. The bill has more than 200 co-sponsors in the House and calls for districtwide elections of two senators and one House representative. It says all district territory would be included in the declaration, save for specific exclusions of federal buildings and monuments. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, of Maryland, has said he’s supportive.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Insurance companies have yet to pay about 15% of claims made from Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle. Florida’s top insurance regulator told Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet last week that insurers have yet pay out more than 21,000 claims from last October’s Category 5 storm. Office of Insurance Regulation Commissioner David Altmaier says the figure is discouraging. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the law requires insurance companies to pay claims within 90 days of being filed, provided the claims are not contested.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Thousands of petitioners are hoping to stop the demolition of a downtown building where the first country hit song is believed to have been recorded. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Fiddlin’ John Carson likely recorded “Little Log Cabin in the Lane” in the building in 1923. Last month, a Myrtle Beach-based developer planning to build a 21-story, Margaritaville-themed hotel obtained a permit to tear the building down. The lot where the building currently stands would be used for dumpsters and grease traps next to the hotel’s first-floor restaurant. So far, more than 8,000 people have signed an online petition to preserve the building. Atlanta resident and architect Kyle Kessler, who started the petition, says he may stand between the building and the demolition crew if it stops the destruction.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city may lose $220 million in federal flood protection funding if local and state officials cannot agree on terms. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the Army Corps of Engineers must find a sponsor for its $345 million Ala Wai Flood Risk Management Project by Wednesday. The corps has proposed to build a wall around Honolulu’s Ala Wai Canal and install watershed flood-control structures. Officials say the corps needs the state or city to become project signatories, but neither has finalized the deal. The state has committed in theory to pay $125 million to receive $220 million in federal matching funds, while the city has agreed to serve as the project’s sponsor. Honolulu officials say the city is working out capital funding details with the state.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The federal government has paid $24 million to farms and dairies in the state in an effort to help them survive financial losses caused by President Donald Trump’s trade wars. But farmers and industry leaders across the state say the payments – ranging from $2 to $300,000 – don’t begin to cover what they’ve lost. Ririe wheat farmer Gordon Gallup told the Idaho Statesman the payments weren’t worth the drive into town. He received about $4,700 last fall. Farms and dairies are still feeling the effects of last summer, when several countries placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs on imported products like steel. The first round of payments for the 2018 crop year sent $24 million to Idaho farms and their local and out-of-state owners. On Thursday, the USDA said an additional $16 billion will be distributed to U.S. farmers this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot marked the 100th anniversary of the 1919 race riots by vowing the city will chart a more equitable future. Lightfoot made the pledge during a commemoration of the violence that has become known as Red Summer, when race riots spread across the United States as whites attacked blacks seeking equal rights, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. In Chicago, a black teen swimming in Lake Michigan was struck in the head with a rock and drowned after drifting toward the white section and angering beachgoers. A week of riots followed the death of 17-year-old Eugene Williams, with 38 people killed and more than 500 injured. Lightfoot on Monday spoke about the “forces of justice and injustice” that Chicago is “still reckoning with a century later.” She pointed to endemic poverty, inadequate health care and violence as problems the city must overcome.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Public Schools district is looking to shift high school students away from traditional school buses to the city’s bus system. The district and the IndyGo transit system will offer city bus passes to about 5,000 students in grades 9-12 as a two-year pilot project starts in August. WFYI-FM reports the passes will let the students travel by regular city bus routes to and from school but also use it year-round for traveling to jobs or extracurricular activities. District official Dennis Tackitt says the district spends more than $12 million a year on high school transportation. That could be cut to about $500,000 annually, or $100 per student, in payments to IndyGo. Tackitt says the plan is to end traditional high school bus service by fall 2021.\n\nIowa\n\nClinton: State safety regulators are proposing fines for two companies involved in a fire and explosion at a grain silo that killed a firefighter and injured another. Clinton fire Lt. Eric Hosette was killed in the Jan. 5 blast and fire at the Archer Daniels Midland Co. silo, and firefighter Adam Cain was injured. The Clinton Herald reports ADM is contesting the nearly $56,000 in penalties proposed by the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Bill Whitter’s Construction is contesting a penalty of nearly $7,800. Iowa OSHA issued ADM five citations, including one that said firefighters were not given adequate information to combat the fire. The agency says Bill Whitter’s Construction was cited because its employees assigned special tasks at the facility, such as bin entry and the handling of flammable or toxic substances, were not trained to safely perform the tasks.\n\nKansas\n\nSedan: A 15-foot-wide fiberglass eagle that perched for 21 years atop a rotating sign at The Wichita Eagle’s former building is getting a new home at a Boy Scouts of America camp. The Wichita Eagle reports that the eagle was removed during a 1988 attempt to modernize the exterior of the building, which later was demolished. From there it went to Camp Tawakoni near Augusta, where it honored the highest rank in Scouting – the Eagle Scout. But when the camp was sold in 2004, it wound up in storage at the Quivira Scout Ranch, where it was rediscovered this year when staff needed the shelf space it occupied. Ranger Paul King says the southeast Kansas camp plans to mount the bird on a pole or pedestal to greet future visitors.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State education officials say a growing teacher shortage has become critical, and they are launching a recruitment campaign. Education Commissioner Wayne Lewis says recruitment efforts could include using programs like Teach for America, working with universities on alternative certification routes and hiring based on work experience. Department of Education spokeswoman Jessica Fletcher says open teaching positions climbed from 6,200 in 2014-15 to 8,800 in 2016-17. The department says there were 5,000 openings earlier this year. News outlets report several issues are mentioned as possible reasons for the shortage, including pensions, politics, pay and the pursuit of higher test scores. Officials say the shortage is caused by teachers leaving the field and fewer college students pursuing an education degree.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s first medical marijuana products are one step away from pharmacies, with final testing planned for this week. Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain says if the product collected Monday from GB Sciences is free of contaminants, medical marijuana could reach patients early next week. Strain says he’s hopeful the testing will clear the product for release. Patients have been waiting years for medical marijuana, after lawmakers created the regulatory framework for dispensing therapeutic cannabis in 2015. Regulatory disagreements slowed getting the product to shelves, with patients, their advocates and lawmakers growing increasingly frustrated with the delays. Only the LSU and Southern University agricultural centers are authorized to grow medical marijuana.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state kicked off its celebration of its 200th birthday – and its separation from Massachusetts – by raising flags statewide Tuesday. The kickoff of Maine’s bicentennial coincides with the 200th anniversary of the vote to separate the District of Maine from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in July 1819. Maine became a state in March 1820. Gov. Janet Mills traveled with the Maine Bicentennial Commission on Tuesday to flag raisings at Presque Isle, Bangor, Portland and Augusta. The governor announced upcoming events that will mark the bicentennial over the next year and a half, including a time capsule, smartphone app and concert series. Sen. Bill Diamond, the Maine Bicentennial Commission chair, said grants are also available for community projects from parades to historic preservation efforts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials who visited public housing communities in the state capital over the weekend heard from residents expressing concerns about gun violence, mental health and living conditions. The Capital reports state Sen. Sarah Elfreth, Del. Alice Cain and Del. Shaneka Henson visited public housing communities in the Annapolis area Saturday. The lawmakers represent the area in the General Assembly. Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley and Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman joined them, as well as activists for gun-violence prevention. The campaign was prompted by the recent deaths of Edward Montre Seay, a rapper, and 16-year-old Elijah Wilson, who both were gunned down near public housing communities. Pittman says everyone with whom he spoke said fewer guns are needed. He says that “some said get rid of them altogether.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Newly released data shows city police are monitoring nearly 5,000 people – almost all of them young black and Latino men – through a secretive gang database. A summary provided by the department shows that 66% of those on its database are black, 24% are Latino, and 2% are white. Black people comprise about 25% of all Boston residents, Latinos about 20% and white people more than 50%. A lawsuit brought last fall by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups says Central American youths are being wrongly listed as active gang members “based on nothing more than the clothing they are seen in and the classmates they are seen with.” They say that’s led some to be deported. Boston police haven’t provided comment after multiple requests.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: A woman says she was suspended from her job with the state because she posted a customer service number on a billboard to help people cut through red tape at the Department of Health and Human Services. Kim Ehl was a general office assistant in Flint until she resigned this month. In April 2018, she rented a billboard to display a customer service number to provide answers about public assistance benefits. She says she was frustrated because office policy required that people leave messages with five levels of management before staff could provide the help line information. Spokesman Bob Wheaton told MLive-The Flint Journal that the department doesn’t discuss personnel matters but has a policy requiring all advertising to be approved by the department’s communications office.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State lawmakers have agreed on a plan to get emergency insulin to people who need it, but not on how to pay for it. A bipartisan working group started meeting after a bill to provide emergency insulin to diabetics failed to pass during the legislative session. Democratic Sen. Matt Little of Lakeville said Monday that the group has agreed on how the program would work. The plan calls for providing a 20-day supply to people who have a past or current insulin prescription and who meet certain financial requirements. Some could get an additional two months’ supply, depending on their circumstances. The Star Tribune reports the emergency medications would be available at most pharmacies. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz repeated his support Monday for a fee on drugmakers for insulin assistance.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: This city in the Mississippi Delta is installing speakers to play the blues and other types of regional music near downtown shops and restaurants. Mayor Carolyn McAdams tells the Greenwood Commonwealth the music will bring another mood and ambience to downtown. The city is installing 38 speakers that should be ready in time for the Bikes, Blues & Bayous ride on Saturday. In 2011, the city updated Howard Street with brick sidewalks and crosswalks and period lighting. At the same time, it installed conduits carrying electrical wiring underground for a future speaker system. Greenwood City Councilman Johnny Jennings says he has enjoyed outdoor speakers in other Mississippi cities. The controls for the Greenwood speakers will be in his office.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A proposal to restrict drink specials in this college town has lit up protesters. The Columbia Missourian reports that more than 100 people participated Monday in what was dubbed “A Protest Against Prohibition.” Seven bars and restaurants hosted the protest Monday before a public information meeting to discuss the proposed ordinance. If approved, the ordinance would prohibit drink specials, such as free samples and two-for-one drinks, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. Backers say it would reduce underage drinking, alcohol-related crashes and crime. But Alex Campbell-Graves, who performs as DJ Requiem at several Columbia bars, says he believes the City Council is trying to take away American rights that were fought for in the 1920s.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The city won’t be pursuing criminal charges against Secretary of State Corey Stapleton for using a state pickup truck to travel home to Billings on weekends. Legislative auditors found Stapleton put nearly 28,000 miles on the state vehicle for personal travel from January 2017 through June 2018, costing taxpayers $5,700. The attorney general’s office referred the investigation to Helena Police. City Attorney Thomas Jodoin wrote to the state Department of Criminal Investigations on Monday saying that the one-year statute of limitations on the alleged misdemeanor expired last month, so the city wouldn’t be filing charges. Auditors noted their findings didn’t account for any travel that may have occurred from July 2018 through April 2019, when auditors questioned the use of the vehicle and it was returned to the state motor pool.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city has been awarded a $2.6 million federal grant to buy more electric-powered public transit buses. The grant is from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration. The city plans to use the money to replace six diesel-powered buses. The grant will also fund three charging stations and additional training. The electric buses are expected to be in service the summer of 2021. Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird thanked Nebraska’s federal congressional delegation – especially U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer – for helping secure the grant. Manufacturer New Flyer says an electric bus saves 100 to 160 tons of greenhouse gases per year compared to a 40-foot diesel bus. StarTran Transit Manager Mike Davis says the newer buses will also improve overall reliability.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A jump in winnings by casinos in June helped push statewide revenue figures up a tick, to more than $11.9 billion to end the fiscal year. The Nevada Gaming Control Board on Tuesday reported total “gaming win” of a little more than $1 billion last month, up nearly 11.6% compared with June 2018. That pushed what had been a flat 12-month revenue comparison up to 0.8% from fiscal 2018. A year ago, the state reported a 3.2% increase from fiscal 2017. Gambling is second only to sales taxes as a percentage of the state’s $14 billion annual budget. The report says Nevada collected $55 million in percentage fee taxes based on June figures. That was up 15.9% from a year ago.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: A police officer says the kitten he was trying to pick up in a parking lot turned out to be a bobcat, which then jumped onto the roof of a Burger King. Stratham Officer Matt Callahan tells Seacoastonline.com he was on patrol Saturday and saw the “kitten” run under a car. It eventually climbed a tree near the restaurant. Once Callahan realized he was dealing with a young bobcat, he called state Fish and Game officers. He also stood in the drive-thru line to alert customers in case the bobcat decided to come down, but it climbed onto the roof and took a catnap. Callahan says he and the conservation officer climbed the roof and put the bobcat in a crate. The bobcat was released at a wildlife refuge.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A federal judge has upheld the state’s law that lowers the number of bullets a gun can hold. The judge sitting in Trenton on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun rights group. New Jersey passed a law last year that made it unlawful to possess firearm magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition, with some exceptions. The state says that’s enough for self-defense, and anything more could prove dangerous to bystanders. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs argues that the law only hurts law-abiding gun owners and homeowners because criminals will ignore it. An attorney for the group says it will appeal the ruling. Previously, a federal appeals court declined to grant an injunction to stop the law from taking effect.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Less than a third of all students in the state are proficient in reading, and only about one-fifth are proficient in math, according to numbers released Friday. The results from a revamped test in 2019 show that public school districts and charter schools saw a small jump in reading from the year before but a slight drop in math – though the scores are from separate exams. According to the results, only 32.7% of all New Mexico students tested proficient or better in reading. Meanwhile, just 20.3% tested proficient or better in math. Last year, results from the test called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers showed that about 31% of students tested were proficient or better in reading, and more than 21% were proficient or better in math.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A judge says the owners of the Woodstock music festival name can license it to create a marijuana brand marking the 50th anniversary of the famed gathering. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe on Monday rejected a claim that the deal would infringe on the name of another company, Woodstock Roots. Gardephe concluded the nature of the planned Woodstock-branded recreational marijuana and a competitor’s cannabis-related smoking paraphernalia are different. Woodstock Ventures, which produced the 1969 Woodstock festival, and Woodstock Roots sued each other last year. Woodstock Roots does business as Woodstock American Products. Woodstock Ventures argued recreational marijuana falls within its “natural zone of expansion” under federal trademark law. It is working on a deal with a major dispensary.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Tar Heel State now has a new state park and three new state trails. Earlier this month, Gov. Roy Cooper signed a bill adding Pisgah View State Park in Buncombe and Haywood counties to North Carolina’s state parks. He also signed bills adding three state trails: Northern Peaks State Trail in Watauga and Ashe counties; the Wilderness Gateway State Trail in the South Mountains range in McDowell, Rutherford, Burke and Catawba counties; and the Overmountain Victory State Trail, which stretches across nine counties. The Division of Parks and Recreation will also conduct a feasibility study that will further refine a corridor for the new Wilderness Gateway State Trail in Burke and Catawba counties. The division will report to legislators by Dec. 1.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A recent study by the U.S. Geological Survey says it could take hundreds of years for the salt concentrations in the Williston Basin to return to normal levels in groundwater. Brine makes its way up to the earth’s surface when oil and gas is extracted. Today, saltwater is injected back underground for storage. Decades ago, brine was dumped into temporary “reserve” pits at well sites or at central collection facilities known as “evaporation” pits. The Bismarck Tribune reports that brine contamination can make water wells unusable as global amphibian populations are in decline. The research analyzed water quality, sediment and tadpoles at 32 wetland sites across Montana and North Dakota in the Williston Basin. Some areas in the basin can meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s “acute” toxicity benchmark by 2045.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State prison officials say inmates may soon be offered tattoo removal services. The Dayton Daily News reports Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Director Annette Chambers-Smith says the state is researching costs and logistics of removing tattoos on prisoners’ faces, necks and hands. She says tattoos can hurt inmates’ job prospects once they are released. Chambers-Smith says funding could come from the department’s medical budget or from fees collected from inmates when they buy items from prison commissaries. She says the state will seek proposals from those who provide removal services. Department rules bar inmates from having tattooing equipment and from getting tattoos inside the prisons. The use of non-sterile equipment for tattooing can cause infections and spread diseases. Tattoos also can signal gang membership.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPawhuska: Director Martin Scorsese has visited the state and met with the principal chief of the Osage Nation to discuss filming his upcoming adaptation of “Killers of the Flower Moon.” The Tulsa World reports Scorsese and others involved in the film met with Principal Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear and other Osage representatives for about two hours to discuss how the movie will accurately portray the tribe’s culture, history and language. The movie is an adaptation of David Grann’s nonfiction book “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.” It documents the 1920s slayings of wealthy Osage tribal members after the discovery of oil on their land. Standing Bear said Scorsese told him Robert DeNiro will play cattleman William Hale. Leonardo DiCaprio is also set to star.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city is finalizing an $80,000 settlement to end a lawsuit by a former employee who alleged “extreme hazing” by city transportation workers. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Adam Rawlins said in U.S. District Court that he was subjected to verbal and physical hazing for several months in 2016, including one incident in which Rawlins was photographed while bound by zip ties and duct tape inside a city shed. A consultant later hired by the city found a “don’t snitch” culture within the maintenance operation of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. But city officials said the incident appeared to be isolated. The proposed settlement heads to the Portland City Council for approval Wednesday. The city’s risk management division found that “there is risk the city may be found liable.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A regatta that has been a tradition in the city for more than four decades has been canceled days before its scheduled opening. Attorney Charles Scholz told reporters Tuesday that the EQT Three Rivers Regatta’s promoter, LionHeart Event Group, hadn’t secured proper permits or paid vendors, including the state for use of Point State Park and police. Scholz said the regatta board had no choice but to withdrew its permit application. Officials said investigations had begun, and legal remedies would be pursued with an eye to bringing the regatta back next year. A summer tradition since 1978, the regatta features powerboat races, an “Anything that Floats” race, and various water stunts and concerts.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has enacted a “student loan bill of rights” to protect borrowers from deceptive lending practices. The law took effect with the governor’s signature last week. Treasurer Seth Magaziner says it provides important consumer protections. The law sets standards for student loan servicing to prohibit predatory behavior. It requires that student loan servicers register with the state and allows state regulators to examine their business practices. The state could penalize violators. Democratic Rep. Joseph McNamara, of Warwick, and Sen. Dawn Euer, of Newport, sponsored the legislation. Magaziner’s office says more than 133,000 Rhode Island residents, including 16,000 senior citizens, have a combined $4.5 billion in student loan debt. About $470 million of that is delinquent.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 100 students who are in juvenile jails across the state are getting their high school diplomas. The Department of Juvenile Justice said a ceremony with caps and gowns will take place Wednesday at the agency’s main prison in Columbia. DJJ Director Freddie Pough said in a statement that getting a high school diploma is an important step to show juvenile offenders that education can open up opportunities and change the direction of their lives. The agency has fewer high school graduates than in recent years. But officials say nearly two-thirds of the offenders in South Carolina’s juvenile prisons are in eighth or ninth grade, and many of them are on track to finish high school.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A political activist wants a federal judge to block a new state law that would place requirements on groups promoting ballot measures. Cory Heidelberger requested a court order Monday to prevent a bill passed by lawmakers from taking effect. The bill passed in the last session and is set to become part of South Dakota’s election laws July 1, 2020. Heidelberger argues the bill was intended to make it harder for groups to launch successful ballot measures. The lawsuit names Gov. Kristi Noem, Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg and Secretary of State Steve Barnett, all Republicans. In May, Heidelberger succeeded in getting an initiated measure that South Dakota voters passed in 2018 declared invalid. That measure placed restrictions on out-of-state money on ballot measures.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: A group of eight Girl Scouts from across the country spent part of their summer volunteering in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Their efforts included rehabilitating trails, cleaning campgrounds, removing invasive plants and providing educational programs to visitors. The park says the high schoolers worked alongside female leaders who taught them how to operate equipment and use hand tools. They also explored career opportunities in conservation and park management. The program was a collaboration among the Student Conservation Association, the Girl Scouts of America and the National Park Service.\n\nTexas\n\nWestphalia: A historic rural Roman Catholic church that had served its surrounding Central Texas farming community for more than a century has burned to the ground. Photos posted on the Austin Catholic diocesan Facebook page show the Church of the Visitation in Westphalia fully engulfed in flames Monday morning, being reduced to nothing more than ashes. The parish has served the faithful of southwestern Falls County, many of them immigrants from the northwest German region of Westphalia, since 1883. The church building dated to 1895 and was said to be the largest all-wood church in the state. Its stained-glass windows, more than 20 in all, were shipped to Westphalia from Germany. No injuries were reported. A statement from the diocese says the cause of the fire has yet to be determined.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: San Juan County paid a consulting firm nearly $500,000 to lobby against the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument and for the downsizing of it after it was created, according to newly released public records. The small county paid New Orleans-based Davillier Law Group $485,600 in 2016-2017 to prepare information packets sent to then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Davillier also researched how the creation of the monument would affect uranium mining in the area and if a president could rescind a monument based on national security concerns related to the uranium, the documents show. Davillier attorneys charged $500 an hour, and sometimes their bills included air travel.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Hikers and climbers can once again enjoy the state’s cliffs starting Thursday, as a crucial nesting season for one bird species comes to a close. For several months toward the end of spring through July, some cliffs around Vermont are closed so peregrine falcons can stand a fighting chance against extinction in the state. The falcons call those cliffs home, so the sensitive population could be harmed unless their habitats are closed off to human use during the birds’ nesting season. Since early May, the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife had closed 14 sites around the state so the birds could nest safely. The falcons were removed from the Vermont endangered species list in 2005 but are sensitive. Their decline is believed to be linked to the insecticide DDT, which wasn’t banned until the 1970s, and to human interference.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Collecting tolls in the Hampton Roads region generates about $180 million a year – nearly twice the size of the region’s fishing and farming sectors combined, The Virginian-Pilot reports – and it’s set to rise. The Virginia Department of Transportation and the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization are considering how far to extend Norfolk’s High Occupancy Toll Lanes. In addition, the Hampton Roads Transportation Accountability Commission is looking to HOT lanes to pay for about 10% of its $3.5 billion commitment to fix the area’s worst bottleneck at the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel. The panel’s six-year plan projects collecting between $3.5 million and $4.5 million a year, beginning in fiscal 2023.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap: A state law enabling individual criminal records to be cleared has taken effect. The New Hope Act took effect Sunday after unanimous passage in both houses of the Legislature. Officials say the new law streamlines and modifies the process for people with criminal records to vacate convictions. The law allows multiple misdemeanors to be vacated, rather than the previous law allowing removal of only a single misdemeanor. The law also adds some felony offenses to a list of convictions that can be removed. Those with criminal records are required to wait for specific time periods during which they must repay legal fees and exhibit good behavior. The waiting periods of three, five and 10 years are dependent on the crimes committed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Some state employees are getting a pay raise next month. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the move comes after the state Personnel Board voted last week to update salary schedules for the first time in a decade. Personnel Director Sheryl Webb said because it had been so long, the government’s first three pay grades were below minimum wage and unusable. She said officials had to balance the need for more competitive salaries with the reality that the state can’t afford multimillion-dollar pay adjustments. Under the new plan, the minimum salary at the lowest pay grade will increase from $16,008 to $18,249, and the maximum salary at the highest pay grade will increase from $114,888 to $117,182. There also will be proportionate increases for other pay grades.\n\nWisconsin\n\nBayside: Schlitz Audubon Nature Center is about to undertake the biggest land improvement project in its nearly 50-year history. The project, scheduled to begin Thursday and run through mid-September, will restore ravines that have deteriorated due to heavy storms, as well as aim to prevent those ravines from further damage. Audubon Center officials are particularly concerned about the north ravine area, the highest-quality natural area on the 185-acre property and home to a variety of flora and fauna, including the rusty-patched bumblebee, a federally endangered species, and the blue-stemmed goldenrod, a state endangered species. The north ravine has been destabilized in recent years as erosive stormwater has washed away the soil.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An American Indian tribe opposes a company’s plan to dump oil-field wastewater upstream of a river in central Wyoming. The Northern Arapaho Tribe says Aethon Energy’s plans to put more than 8 million gallons of polluted water into two creeks would affect tribal business opportunities. The creeks flow into the Wind River and Boysen Reservoir. Tribal officials tell Wyoming regulators in a recent letter that the pollution could harm tribal fishing and rafting guide businesses. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also has concerns. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality is reviewing public comments on the plan. Dallas-based Aethon says it would follow all regulations and offer more water protections than those required under previous permits. The Wind River flows through the Wind River Indian Reservation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/06/changes-churches-flex-facilities-learning-tv-news-around-states/111521678/", "title": "Changes at churches, 'flex facilities': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: COVID-19 infections continue to climb in the state as residents are now under an emergency order to stay home as much as possible. More than 40 deaths have been reported as of Sunday among more than 1,600 cases in the state. Gov. Kay Ivey’s order took effect at 5 p.m. Saturday and is scheduled to last until at least April 30. Ivey said she felt compelled to require people across Alabama to shelter at home as cases of the new virus continued to rise and as too many people ignored calls to isolate voluntarily. The emergency order allows people to leave home to get medicine, health care, food and other essentials. It also allows church services, weddings and funerals as long as long as fewer than 10 people are present, and they stay at least 6 feet apart.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration has launched a new virtual school for Alaska students in partnership with a Florida program, garnering some criticism from educators adjusting their lessons to online teaching amid the coronavirus pandemic. The state of Alaska signed a $525,000 contract through February 2021 with the Florida Virtual School, which had enrolled about 80 Alaska students by Friday, Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. “The ‘fourth-quarter solution’ that is suggested through the purchase of this Florida version of distance delivery is seen as an insult to most, if not all, teachers in the state who have been supporting their students,” Juneau Schools Superintendent Bridget Weiss said. The Florida Virtual School was recommended to Dunleavy’s education commissioner by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The Florida program has previously worked with Alaska schools, Alaska Education Commissioner Michael Johnson said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Amid the coronavirus pandemic that has forced the closure of many businesses and other tourism destinations, some Lake Havasu City residents are pushing for a closure of the popular lake that’s a spring break mecca for many college students. A petition, started by a local physician, to close the lake in northwestern Arizona to help slow the spread of COVID-19 had gathered more than 2,200 signatures as of late Saturday night. A counter-petition was started by Lake Havasu City firefighter Tony Rivello, asking Gov. Doug Ducey to keep the lake and Arizona waterways accessible. More than 1,400 people had signed that petition by Saturday night. Lake Havasu City Mayor Cal Sheehy wants visitors to stay home “to protect the safety of our citizens and you during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The Arizona Department of Health Services on Sunday reported 2,269 coronavirus cases statewide with 64 known deaths – an increase of 250 cases and 12 deaths since Saturday.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A church that officials had accused of disregarding restrictions on large group gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic has agreed to comply with the rules, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Saturday. Officials had threatened to issue a directive ordering Awaken Church in Jonesboro to comply with the rules. While Arkansas has restricted gatherings of 10 or more people, churches have been exempted as long as they “limit person-to-person contact and maintain appropriate social distancing of at least 6 feet to prevent the spread of this virus.” Arkansas officials have been discouraging large church gatherings since an outbreak at one church in Greers Ferry last month that infected more than three dozen members and resulted in at least three deaths. Hutchinson said officials believed the pastor of Awaken Church, Chad Gonzales, intended to continue holding large services. But Hutchinson said the church has been persuaded to comply with the state’s restrictions.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Federal judges on Saturday refused on procedural grounds to order the state to free thousands of prisoners to ease crowded conditions that attorneys representing inmates likened to a “tinderbox” ready to ignite with the rapid spread of the coronavirus. But the three judges invited inmates’ attorneys to file a new motion with either or both of two individual judges who oversee major class action lawsuits over inmate medical and mental health care. Both judges are members of the three-judge panel, which also includes a federal appellate judge. The judges virtually laid out a pathway for the inmates’ attorneys to seek help from the individual judges and perhaps come back to the special panel after they lay the proper groundwork. The special panel said it had no authority to address the coronavirus because it was convened 13 years ago to consider a different issue: whether general overcrowding was causing inhumane conditions.\n\nColorado\n\nCentennial: A member of Colorado’s Unified Command Group at the State Emergency Operations Center in Centennial just outside Denver has tested positive for the coronavirus, officials say. The Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said the worker tested positive Saturday. Spokeswoman Micki Trost said staffers who determine they worked in the same area in the prior 48 hours were being told to self-quarantine. Trost said medical screenings of staff were being increased from once daily to twice a day. A decontamination service cleans the facility daily. Colorado has 4,565 confirmed cases and 126 deaths because of the virus, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally Sunday morning.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday publicly announced financial incentives for nursing homes that agree to house only COVID-19 positive residents, a move aimed at preventing the system from being overwhelmed by the outbreak. The details of the additional funds – $600 per day for each person served, which is more than double the average daily Medicaid payment rate – come after the initial plan and a list of proposed facilities released earlier this week drew sharp criticism from a nursing home executive and family members who said it took some by surprise, creating an “uproar.” Besides the extra funds for the planned COVID-19 homes, the Democratic governor announced that all 213 nursing homes in Connecticut would be receiving a 10% increase in Medicaid funding, from April 1 through June 30, to cover expenses related to the outbreak. The three-month increase is expected to cost $35.5 million.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State officials are warning of an impending spike in coronavirus cases over the next two weeks and urging residents and businesses to heed restrictions on travel and gatherings. The number of deaths had more than doubled over the prior week to 14 as of Friday. The number of cases also had more than doubled and stood at 450 as of Friday afternoon, with more than 60 people hospitalized. Eight of the deaths were related to long-term care facilities. “The situation in Delaware is getting worse, and we expected it to,” Gov. John Carney said, adding that officials are particularly concerned about an expected surge in hospitalizations. Emergency management director A.J. Schall said hospitals are preparing for the surge, and officials are monitoring the integrity of the supply chain. CEO Wayne Smith of the Delaware Healthcare Association, a trade group representing the state’s hospitals, said he believes they will have adequate resources and staffing when the surge hits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the D.C. Humane Rescue Alliance is hosting several events this month giving away free pet food to those in need, WUSA-TV reports. The Pet Pantry program supplies D.C. pet owners in need with approximately half the food they need for their dogs and cats each month, determined by species and weight. Any pet owner who wishes to receive food for their pet through HRA’s Pet Pantry will be asked to complete an enrollment form the first time they come to pick up food. After enrolling the first time, pet owners will be given an identification card that must be provided during each subsequent visit. Food may be picked up once per month via any of the Pet Pantry’s distribution events for each animal who is enrolled in the program. The events will be held outdoors, and social distancing rules will be enforced, HRA says.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The coronavirus death toll in the state has now reached 218 people, and total cases have topped 12,000, according to statistics released by the state Department of Health on Sunday morning. The deaths have been heaviest in South Florida, where three counties have totaled 120 fatalities. That includes the death of Sgt. Jose Diaz Ayala of the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office on Saturday and Deputy Shannon Bennett of the Broward Sheriff’s Office on Friday. Palm Beach County has had 49 deaths, followed by Broward County with 40 and Miami-Dade with 31. The Department of Corrections also reported Sunday that two inmates and five staff members at a Santa Rosa County private prison have tested positive for the virus. Statewide, 26 state and private prison employees have tested positive, but the Blackwater River Correctional Facility is the only prison with inmates who have tested positive.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Coronavirus deaths exceeded 200 on Saturday as people statewide spent their first full day under the governor’s emergency order to stay home. Gov. Brian Kemp’s order that took effect Friday evening allows residents to get outside for exercise, shop for groceries, seek medical help and work at jobs deemed “essential.” Businesses including bars, gyms and theaters remain closed, and restaurants can only serve takeout or delivery orders. Gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited. The Republican governor’s action also reversed some tougher restrictions that had been imposed by city and county officials. Parks and beaches that had been closed by local emergency orders, for example, were reopened under Kemp’s statewide order. Angry that Kemp had overridden a local decision to close Georgia’s largest public beach, Tybee Island Mayor Shirley Sessions struck a defiant tone Saturday, saying beach parking lots remained closed, and no lifeguards were on duty.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said he will ask the U.S. military to postpone the world’s largest maritime exercises because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ige said at a news conference Friday that he would send a letter to Adm. Phil Davidson, the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, requesting that the Rim of the Pacific drills be postponed “until the COVID-19 situation here in the islands subsides.” The drills were scheduled to be held in Hawaii during the summer. The U.S. has more cases of the coronavirus than any other country. South Korea and Japan, major participants in the exercise, are also among the countries that have been hard hit by the pandemic. The Rim of the Pacific – or RIMPAC – exercises are held in Hawaii every two years. They brought 46 surface ships and 25,000 personnel from 25 nations to the islands in 2018. The exercises began in 1971.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gravity Payments, the tech company founded by an Idahoan that gained worldwide attention after offering employees a minimum salary of $70,000, has taken a huge financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic. The company, based in Seattle with a branch office in Boise, has seen its $4 million in monthly revenues plummet, the Idaho Statesman reports. With small businesses across the nation struggling because of virus that causes COVID-19, fewer transactions are taking place that require credit card processing from Gravity. “In a one-week internal from March 10 to March 17, we lost about 50% of our revenue,” founder and CEO Dan Price said by phone. “It was gut-wrenching.” Without a change in strategy or layoffs, Gravity would have four to six months before it went out of business, Price said. In response, Price cut his salary to zero. Ten employees volunteered to work for free temporarily. Two dozen others were willing to give up half their paychecks to ensure no one lost their job.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The governor and the mayor of Chicago on Friday re-christened North America’s largest convention center as a pandemic-battling field hospital and publicly hoped it would never see a single patient. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot toured a section of Chicago’s McCormick Place with the first 500 of what will be a 3,000-bed “alternative care facility” designed to relieve pressure on city hospitals from rapidly mounting COVID-19 cases. As for the transformed showroom floor, a vast honeycomb of steel wall-enclosed patient areas already fitted with a bed apiece, Pritzker hopes his statewide stay-at-home order, crippling business closures and the social-distancing guidelines will be enough to reverse the steeply rising curve of infections from the potentially deadly coronavirus. “That is honestly what we are praying for. If no patient ends up at McCormick Place, then we will have done our job,” Pritzker said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State health officials reported 11 more deaths from COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing the statewide total to 127. The Indiana State Department of Health announced 464 additional cases. Overall, there have been more than 4,400 cases. Officials in a Wells County community offered “isolation packets” for elderly residents who fear leaving home during the pandemic and need help. The packets that Ossian officials and police made available contained a color-coded paper system residents can hang on windows to communicate. Green signals the person is fine, yellow means help is needed for everyday errands like shopping, and red means urgent errands like prescription pickup, according to WANE-TV. “We know a lot of our residents are just worried about leaving their homes at all, and so we completely understand that,” said Ossian Sgt. Stephanie Tucker.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Two of the largest banks in the state did not take applications for the $349 billion small-business aid program that launched Friday. MidwestOne Bank and Bankers Trust announced they did not have enough information from the Small Business Administration to proceed. Bankers Trust said Friday that it expected to begin processing applications for the Paycheck Protection Program at noon Monday, starting with existing customers. Bankers Trust, which calls itself Iowa’s largest privately owned bank, said earlier that it was unable to accept applications until more guidance was available. “We are disappointed in this delay, as are other banks around the country,” the company said. MidwestOne is an SBA-preferred lender based in Iowa City that has dozens of branches in Iowa and four other states. “Banks in the U.S. do not yet have critical program details, or even a final format or place, to send requests to make loans to the federal government,” Vice President Kyle Long told customers in an email.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: More than 50 University of Kansas medical students are graduating early to participate in a program that will deploy them throughout the state to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The University of Kansas Medical Center said in a news release that the program will allow seniors to serve in areas of “critical need” before their residencies start in July at various locations throughout the country. Students from all three of the medical school’s campuses, in Kansas City, Salina and Wichita, have volunteered. Dr. Mike Kennedy, the medical school’s associate dean of Rural Health Education, said there are 34 counties in Kansas that have only one or two physicians. “Many rural physicians are already overworked, and the addition of a surge in health care utilization could overburden these physicians to the breaking point,” he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: About 50 people gathered at Maryville Baptist Church on Sunday for its 11a.m. service despite Gov. Andy Beshear’s repeated warnings against in-person services during the coronavirus pandemic. “If you’re still holding mass gatherings, church or otherwise, you are spreading the coronavirus. And you are likely causing the death of Kentuckians,” Beshear said in his Saturday briefing. “It’s that clear.” Maryville Baptist’s pastor, the Rev. Jack Roberts, previously said he planned to hold Sunday services in violation of the state’s ban on public gatherings unless the authorities intervene. He also said he would go to jail and to court rather than pay a fine for violating the March 19 order of Kentucky’s Department of Public Health. At its Sunday morning service, the church announced it would also hold services on Easter as planned.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A food pantry in the city has received nearly 2,500 pounds of shrimp to help families in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second Harvest Food Bank is the recipient of the donation, announced Friday by Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser and the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board. The donation, which will cover a few pounds each for families, was given by Ronnie Anderson and David and Kim Chauvin, owners of Bluewater Shrimp Company, based in Dulac, Louisiana. “I’ve always told people outside Louisiana that when they are here, we will treat them like family,” Nungesser said. Second Harvest supports more than 700 community partners and programs across 23 parishes, distributing more than 32 million meals to more than 210,000 people annually, according to its website. Nungesser said he will encourage state government to also purchase all excess inventories of Louisiana shrimp to send to the Second Harvest Food Bank.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor issued an executive order Friday requiring travelers to the state to self-quarantine for 14 days to lessen the chance of transmitting coronavirus. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the order applies to all travelers to Maine regardless of their state of residency. The order also calls on visitors not to come to the state if they are experiencing symptoms of the virus. The order suspended lodging operations such as hotels and motels starting at noon Sunday. It also says lodging can be provided for vulnerable populations, such as people who are at risk of domestic violence, Mills’ office said. The order lasts until at least April 30. “We are facing one of the greatest public health crises of the world in more than a century. But if we pull together, we can and will defeat this virus,” Mills said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Four additional residents at a nursing home beleaguered by more than 100 positive cases of COVID-19 have died, local health officials announced. The Carroll County Health Department said nine people living at Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy and diagnosed with the new coronavirus had died as of late Saturday. Gov. Larry Hogan said late last week that the new coronavirus has been confirmed in 60 different nursing homes in the state, with Pleasant View cases marking the most intense cluster. Maryland health officials reported Sunday more than 65 deaths overall related to COVID-19, or a 25% increase compared to Saturday. There were over 3,600 positive cases in the state. Seventy-seven of Pleasant View’s 95 residents and 24 staff members have tested positive, according to the Carroll County department’s own tally. Eighteen staff members had tested positive as of late last week. One Carroll County resident who also has died lived at the Carroll Lutheran Village retirement county in Westminster, the county health department said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker announced a new contact tracing program Friday that he said will help the state limit the further spread of COVID-19. The program will focus on alerting individuals who may have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 so they can self-quarantine or be tested themselves. Massachusetts will be the first state to launch such an initiative, Baker said. The program will deploy nearly 1,000 workers to connect with COVID-19 patients and their contacts. Baker said it was time to start going on offense against the disease. Dr. Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of Partners In Health, acknowledged the task will be difficult. “We are daunted by the challenge, but we are undaunted by the moral need to stop the epidemic,” she said. “Is it too late? It cannot be too late. We need to mitigate the suffering now.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State officials have issued an emergency order designed to speed up the reporting of COVID-19 deaths. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a directive late Saturday for funeral directors and medical professionals. It took effect immediately. Under the order, funeral directors have 24 hours to initiate a death record and submit it to the attending physician. Doctors have to attempt to certify the record within 24 hours of receipt, among other things. Michigan had reported more than 14,000 cases of COVID-19 with 540 deaths as of Saturday. The idea is to let public health officials more accurately understand the impact and inform plans for public health measures. “To inform sound decision-making and protect Michiganders, public health officials need accurate information about COVID-19 deaths as quickly as possible,” Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon said in statement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state government rolled out a new COVID-19 dashboard as a one-stop shop for residents to see the latest data on the state’s response to the pandemic as well as information on how to protect themselves. The website, which will be updated daily, includes detailed data on available ventilators and intensive care beds, personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators, and testing numbers. The information is critical for planners as the state prepares for a surge in cases in the coming weeks. The dashboard also includes the latest statistics on the spread of COVID-19 across Minnesota, jobless claims, the availability of child care for critical workers, and how well Minnesotans are practicing social distancing as measured by the decrease in freeway traffic, illustrated with graphics and charts.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Some houses of worship in the state are offering online services during the coronavirus pandemic. Others are inviting people to sit in vehicles outside the sanctuary to have socially distant prayer and maybe to hear a pastor’s message over the radio. Gov. Tate Reeves has said he does not believe government has the power to shut down churches, but he strongly prefers that people not gather in parking lots for worship. “It’s just hard to overcome our natural tendency to get out and say hello,” Reeves said Friday. Mississippi is under the Republican governor’s statewide stay-at-home order that began Friday evening and extends until the morning of April 20. People are being told to minimize their errands to essentials like grocery shopping. Many people moving around their communities may not know they have contracted the virus until well after they’ve infected others.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state is asking medical professionals who are not working to join a specialized state team that responds to critical health emergencies. “We are calling on all available medical professionals to support the effort to fight the virus by joining a critical reserve unit now focusing on providing care in high need areas across the state,” Gov. Mike Parson said Saturday. “Their efforts can help save the lives of their fellow Missourians.” Selected medical workers would become part of the Missouri Disaster Medical Assistance Team. The state is asking health care students, retired health care workers and those whose professional registration recently expired to apply online for the team. Parson issued a statewide stay-at-home order Friday, meaning Missouri has joined about 40 other states requiring residents to avoid going out except for essential purposes. The statewide order takes effect Monday and expires April 24.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s June 2 primary will be conducted by mail in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Same-day registration and voting will still be allowed, while a new law could mean election results will be available earlier than usual, officials said. Counties asked to be able to hold all-mail ballots to eliminate the need to staff hundreds of polling places and allow people to vote without being exposed to large groups in close quarters. In addition, many election judges are senior citizens, a group that is particularly at risk for a more severe illness and possibly death if they contract the coronavirus, elections officials said. The ballots will be mailed May 8 to active voters and will include return postage under a directive issued by Gov. Steve Bullock allowing counties to choose to hold all-mail elections.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts has expanded to all 93 counties an enforceable order that limits gatherings to fewer than 10 and closes many nonessential businesses and services. The expanded order Friday night was followed Saturday by news that a Nebraska State Penitentiary staff member tested positive for COVID-19 – the first confirmed case within the state’s prison system. The Douglas County Health Department also confirmed two additional deaths Saturday from the virus: a man in his 80s who was a resident of the Douglas County Health Center, a long-term care facility, and a woman older than 70. Both had multiple underlying medical conditions. That brought Nebraska’s total COVID-19 deaths to eight. Ricketts had earlier resisted expanding the order statewide, preferring a regional approach.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The U.S. government has approved a request to declare a major disaster declaration for the state, a move that will unlock additional federal assistance for residents affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Saturday. Sisolak said he was grateful to President Donald Trump and other federal officials “for their help, which will aid Nevada in responding and recovering effectively and efficiently from this disaster.” The governor’s announcement said the Federal Emergency Management Agency notified him of the approval of the request he submitted Tuesday. On March 12, Sisolak signed a state declaration of emergency, a required step to request a federal major disaster declaration. Sisolak’s request asked for help under a variety of programs, including assistance for unemployment, legal services, crisis counseling and mass care and emergency assistance. Federal help is needed because the public health crisis “is beyond the capabilities of the state, local and tribal governments,” Sisolak said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has set up 14 “flex facilities” to handle hospital overflow if it sees a surge in COVID-19 cases. The facilities include 1,600 beds, bringing the state’s total bed capacity to more than 5,000. They will not be used unless absolutely necessary, Gov. Chris Sununu said, and the communities hosting them will not face any costs. “While we hope the day never comes, we do have to be prepared,” he said. “We will be ready.” Meanwhile, the nonprofit trust that operates Lakes Region General Hospital in Laconia and Franklin Regional Hospital is the first beneficiary of a new $50 million emergency fund for health care facilities. LRGHealth will get a $5.2 million, zero-interest loan that will help it limit the number of staff facing furloughs, Sununu said. Those furloughed workers also could find temporary jobs through a new Department of Employment Security system to redeploy health care workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New powers for the state’s local and county governments to restrict short-term rentals took effect Sunday night, part of the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. The state’s emergency management director, state police Col. Patrick Callahan, issued an administrative order aimed at hotels, motels, guest houses and private residences. The additional local authority does not extend to people housed under a state-led shelter effort, to those in temporary residence under emergency or other housing assistance, or to health care workers staying somewhere on a temporary basis. Gov. Phil Murphy said shore communities have reported people trying to temporarily relocate there from areas hard-hit by the coronavirus spread, but those communities can lack the health care infrastructure that a surge in patients would require. Murphy urged state residents to remain in their primary residences during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: With the state’s schools shut down for the rest of the school year because of the coronavirus outbreak, three public television stations on Monday will begin broadcasting class lessons for home learning for students in grades K-5. The participating Public Broadcasting Service stations are KENW-TV at Eastern New Mexico University’s Portales campus, KNME-TV at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and KRWG-TV at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. The Albuquerque school district will provide four hours of instruction each weekday morning, which KENW called “an ambitious and vital new broadcast initiative.” The daily lesson plans will be broadcast each day, and they will then be available later for individual “on-demand lessons,” KNME said. Academic subjects include English, math and science, according to the Albuquerque district’s website.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers hunkered down Sunday as the city entered a critical phase in the coronavirus crisis – a period authorities warned would bring soaring death tolls and even more challenges for an overburdened health care system. Those venturing outdoors for groceries or exercise largely heeded the city’s new guidance to wear face coverings such as scarves or bandanas – a sight far less common a week ago. Signs of quarantine were becoming ubiquitous as many New Yorkers faced their fourth week of isolation. In Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill neighborhood, even a Little Free Library had been emptied to avoid spreading germs, the books replaced by a handwritten note. The city canceled all of spring break for its public schools and, in a controversial reversal, called for classes to be held on the start of Passover and Good Friday. School officials announced the decision Friday, saying it was important to keep remote learning uninterrupted, though the announcement roiled the city’s teachers union.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Three residents of a central North Carolina nursing home have tested positive for COVID-19, public health officials announced Saturday as overall cases statewide exceeded 2,400. The three cases occurred within the population of the Springbrook Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Clayton, the Johnston County Health Department said in a news release. Information released Saturday morning from the state Department of Health and Human Services showed six COVID-19 outbreaks at nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities statewide. It wasn’t immediately clear if the six included the Clayton cases. An outbreak is defined as two or more laboratory confirmed cases. Nearly 30 cases have been linked to an adult care home in Northampton County, the county health department said. One resident at the adult care home who tested positive died in a Virginia hospital late last month, his daughter said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWillow City: A small-town bar owner who was cited five times in four days for violating Gov. Doug Burgum’s order to close downplayed risks from the coronavirus and said he prefers “a dangerous freedom to a peaceful slavery.” David Corum, owner of Gunslinger’s in Willow City, said he understands there’s “a face, there’s stories, there’s loved ones” associated with the virus, but “you also have to be realistic and pragmatic” about the scope of the problem. “Three dead out of 760,000 people? 5,000 dead out of 330 million people?” Corum said. “You’re just not going to convince me this pandemic is the threat they claim it is.” Corum said he and certain county officials “go way back,” and he believes some of the motivation behind the citations is political. He also noted that President Donald Trump and Burgum can be seen standing closer than 6 feet to others in the rooms at recent meetings. “The hypocrisy is outrageous,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Gov. Mike DeWine said Saturday that he won’t require people to wear cloth masks in public but is strongly encouraging their use. He also said he has signed an executive order removing training requirements for mental health and marriage counselors to make remote “telehealth” visits more accessible. DeWine said at his daily briefing in Columbus that he will be wearing cloth masks sewn by his wife, Fran, when he is out in public. “They’re not a substitute for social distancing, but it’s something we can do and should be accepted,” he said. The state is working to procure more N95 masks for medical workers and people working on the “front lines,” DeWine said. He noted that the state has heard from doctors and nurses who have been wearing the same mask throughout the day. Without providing details about where it is coming from, DeWine said a plane is due to arrive Tuesday with the state’s first shipment of personal protection equipment.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Battered oil prices and the state’s economic shutdown in response to the coronavirus are expected to punch a $416 million hole in this year’s state budget, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Friday. A panel led by Stitt will meet Monday to declare a revenue failure, and lawmakers will return to the state Capitol to help shore up the budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30. Lawmakers have about $1 billion in savings, and the state is expected to receive about $844 million as part of the $2 trillion federal aid package. The shortfall is even larger than budget officials projected last week. The Legislature is returning for a special session that was automatically triggered Thursday when Stitt declared a statewide health emergency that gives the governor sweeping new powers to help battle the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Hospital workers in the state are astounded at the community response to an effort to provide those on the front lines of the coronavirus fight with protective masks. Oregon officials have been disappointed in the response by the federal government to its requests for protective gear. They requested 1 million N95 masks and received about 70,000. Of 1 million surgical masks requested, 287,000 have been received, according a state report. Much of the gear is faulty or past expiration dates. Faced with shortages, Salem Health, which runs two hospitals and several clinics, announced March 26 that it would hand out kits for people to make masks. So many cars lined up to receive the kits that a traffic jam ensued, and some had to be turned away. The people returned home and began assembling the blue masks using cutting boards and sewing machines. Then they began dropping them off last week. By Friday, the last day for dropoff, 10,942 assembled masks had been delivered, said Elijah Tanner, a Salem Health spokesman.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s health secretary issued new standards Sunday for cleaning large buildings that remain open during the COVID-19 shutdown. Dr. Rachel Levine’s order, which applies to building that are at least 50,000 square feet, requires building owners to maintain usual cleaning and follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to routinely clean and disinfect areas that are often touched. The types of buildings covered by Levine’s order include warehouses, factories, offices, airports, grocery stores, government facilities, hotels, colleges and universities, and residential buildings that have 50 units or more. Building owners also must make sure that there are enough workers to perform the cleaning properly and, if they have security, that they are sufficient to control access, keep order and enforce social distancing. The order takes effect early Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRichmond: Three men are facing misdemeanor charges for driving to the state to play a round of golf in violation of an order that requires out-of-state visitors to self-quarantine for 14 days during the coronavirus pandemic, police said. The Massachusetts men parked at a McDonald’s restaurant in Richmond on Wednesday and loaded their gear into a car with Rhode Island plates, which drove them just down the street to Meadow Brook Golf Course, Richmond Chief Elwood Johnson said. Golf courses in Rhode Island remain open, but only for residents. McDonald’s employees tipped off police. Police caught up with them when they returned to their cars. Gregory Corbett, 51, of Attleboro, Tyler Pietrzyk, 22, of Taunton, and Nye Cameron, 22, of Taunton, were charged with a petty misdemeanor, Johnson said. “It’s not the most heinous offense, but the reality is that we’re living in a whole different world this month, and it’s important we all follow the rules to keep one anther safe,” Johnson said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus has risen to at least 40, health officials said Saturday. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control reported that confirmed infections statewide have exceeded 1,900. Charleston County had more than 270 confirmed cases and one death, while Richland County had more than 240 cases and six deaths. Two sheriff’s offices in the state said they each have an employee who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Lexington County Sheriff Jay Koon said one of his deputies was recovering in isolation at home and “in good spirits” after getting his positive test results Friday. The York County Sheriff’s Office said one of its employees also had a confirmed case of the virus, and four additional staffers were in home isolation as an extra precaution.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A state lawmaker who was among several family members to contract the coronavirus has died. State Rep. Bob Glanzer died about 8 p.m. Friday at Avera McKennan Hospital & University Health Center, his son Tom said in a Facebook post. Tom Glanzer and Senate Majority Leader Lee Qualm both confirmed Bob Glanzer’s death to the Associated Press. The 74-year-old lawmaker had fallen ill almost two weeks ago, part of a cluster of COVID-19 cases around Huron, South Dakota. Glanzer’s wife, brother-in-law and sister-in-law all had the virus, and Glanzer’s 51-year-old niece, Mari Hofer, died of it, according to Hofer’s husband, Quint Hofer. Glanzer was a retired agriculture loan officer and a past manager of the South Dakota State Fair.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A fifth person has died from a coronavirus outbreak at a nursing home that saw more than 100 people test positive. Sumner Regional Medical Center spokesman Kyle Brogdon confirmed the death from the Gallatin Center for Rehabilitation and Healing. State health officials have said more than 70 residents and more than 30 staffers tested positive at the facility, which was temporarily evacuated but has since allowed some residents to return. The state contracted out a deep cleaning and disinfecting of the facility March 29, and state Health Department nurses surveyed it starting Wednesday to ensure it was safe for residents to reenter, Department of Health spokeswoman Shelley Walker said. Residents who tested negative or tested positive and recovered have since been allowed to reenter the facility, while residents who tested positive and are recovering remain at hospitals, Walker said. A Cookeville nursing home has also seen an outbreak, saying Thursday that 44 people there had tested positive for COVID-19 – 28 patients and 16 staff.\n\nTexas\n\nOrange: State troopers started stopping and screening travelers entering Southeast Texas from Louisiana on Sunday, in accordance with an executive order from Gov. Greg Abbott. Troopers stopped vehicles at a visitors center on Interstate 10 near Orange, about 100 miles east of Houston, and required travelers to complete a travel form, said Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Stephanie Davis, who told KFDM-TV no one was being turned back. “The established screening stations will take place on major roadways … including interstate highways and other high-volume routes,” Davis said in a statement. Sunday was the first day troopers conducted the screenings, a week after Abbott’s order was issued, Davis said. The order also calls for travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the state. State health officials on Sunday reported at least 6,669 cases and 118 COVID-19 deaths in Texas, up from 6,100 cases and at least 105 fatalities Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Leaders from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sat 6 feet apart inside an empty room as the faith carried out its signature conference Saturday by adhering to social distancing guidelines that offered a stark reminder of how the global coronavirus pandemic is affecting religious practices. Speeches that largely commemorated the 200th anniversary of events that led to the creation of the church by founder Joseph Smith were made in a small auditorium in Salt Lake City and livestreamed to members around the world. It was the faith’s first crowd-free conference since World War II, when wartime travel restrictions were in place. Church President Russell M. Nelson acknowledged the unusual circumstances and the major impact COVID-19 is having on the world during his opening speech. The faith known widely as Mormon church has closed its temples and churches and brought home thousands of missionaries. He said the empty auditorium and seating arrangements were done to be good “global citizens” and prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State officials said they are so desperate to find medical professionals to help with the COVID-19 response that they’re even willing to use veterinarians to help with care for people. Vermont is in the process of preparing almost 1,000 hospital beds in “medical surge facilities” statewide to help relieve pressure on existing hospitals when the COVID-19 peak arrives, which is currently expected later this month. While officials are capable of setting up the extra beds, they don’t know who will staff them, so they are asking for help from a Medical Reserve Corps of retirees, students and others with some sort of medical experience, including veterinarians. They posted a volunteer sign-up location online. “We need to build our reserves,” Gov. Phil Scott said Friday. Erin Forbes, a small animal veterinarian in Essex Junction and the spokeswoman for the Vermont Veterinary Medical Association, said part of their oaths as veterinarians was to protect the public, and she felt some of Vermont’s vets would probably be willing to help.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam is instituting a hiring freeze of state employees and telling agency heads to look for ways to cut budgets in response to the coronavirus. Northam chief of staff Clark Mercer told agency heads in a Thursday memo obtained by the Associated Press that a recession is coming and that state revenues will be far below “even our most pessimistic forecast” from last year. On top of that, Mercer said, the state is having to spend heavily on fighting the virus, including buying medical supplies and efforts to help vulnerable populations. “All of this will cost the commonwealth extraordinary sums,” Mercer wrote. Northam’s administration has not directed agency heads to come up with a specific figure, saying the total financial impact of the virus is not clear. Mercer also warned that the recently passed federal stimulus, which directs billions to state governments, will not be a cure-all.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee on Friday vetoed hundreds of millions of dollars of spending in hopes of making a dent in the loss of state revenues as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to keep the state’s economy largely shut down. Inslee vetoed nearly two dozen bills in their entirety, as well as more than 140 separate budget items in the $53.4 billion state supplemental budget passed by the Legislature last month that will save the state $445 million over the next three years. The vetoes include a bill that created a pilot program to review and vacate criminal convictions based on current statutory eligibility requirements and another bill that established recycled content requirements for plastic beverage containers. Also vetoed was a bill creating a prescription drug affordability board. Areas of the budget that did not see reductions were those that dealt with public health, homelessness and child care, Inslee’s budget office said. Inslee called the savings “a substantial step to try to right our fiscal ship that we know will be in very, very troubled waters.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A nursing home patient with underlying health conditions became the third person in the state to die from the new coronavirus, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health and Human Resources said the 76-year-old man was a resident of the Sundale nursing home in Morgantown, where 21 residents and eight staff members tested positive for the virus. Gov. Jim Justice has tightened restrictions on people in Monongalia County and five other counties to try to curb coronavirus hotspots. Three of those counties are in the eastern panhandle. Meanwhile, a hearing is scheduled in federal court on a bid by lawyers to have several convicted felons released from prison due to the virus. The move is opposed by the state Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation, law enforcement groups and emergency responders.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democrats and liberal groups on Sunday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to let stand an extended absentee voting period for the state’s spring primary, an election unfolding amid public health fears due to the coronavirus. The groups argue that a federal judge’s order last week extending absentee voting from Tuesday to April 13 is critical for a fair election and to protect public health. They said the crush of absentee ballot requests – more than 1.1 million, far more than any previous election – has made it impossible for clerks to get them out to voters and get them back in time to beat what had been an 8 p.m. election night deadline. Separately, a group of Wisconsin mayors on Sunday urged acting Health Secretary Andrea Palm “to step up and stop the State of Wisconsin from putting hundreds of thousands of citizens at risk” through in-person voting. Wisconsin is scheduled to conduct in-person voting Tuesday despite health concerns.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon expressed frustration Friday about growing public focus on his reluctance to issue a statewide stay-at-home order rather than on his call for personal action to control the spread of the coronavirus. Gordon also announced an extension of his order shutting down schools and a range of business – including bars, dine-in restaurants and theaters – from April 17 until April 30. Wyoming Medical Society President Dr. David Wheeler and others have called for a stay-at-home order similar to ones issued in other states, including Colorado, Idaho and Montana. But Gordon criticized state and local stay-at-home orders in Colorado as loaded with too many exceptions to be more effective than his plea for personal action. “I’m telling you to stay home,” Gordon said. “What are you waiting for? Are you waiting for ‘mother may I?’ Or are you taking care of yourselves and practicing the common sense that we expect?”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/13/tide-fan-frenzy-valentine-volunteers-ventilator-theft-news-around-states/115288124/", "title": "Tide fan frenzy, valentine volunteers: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Thousands of excited football fans partied in streets around the University of Alabama after the Crimson Tide defeated Ohio State for the national championship, ignoring pleas for common sense and safety at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Students and others poured out of jam-packed bars near campus as time expired in Miami late Monday, gathering on University Boulevard in an area called “The Strip,” traffic cameras and images posted on social media show. Many of the fans screaming and cheering as they pressed against each other in the street didn’t wear face masks. The scene was exactly what officials feared before the game as they urged people to watch at home and celebrate privately. More than 5,300 people have died in Alabama from the illness caused by the coronavirus, and about 404,000 have tested positive. About 14,200 people have tested positive in Tuscaloosa County, making it one of the worst in the state for the virus in overall numbers, and about 175 COVID-19 patients are being treated by DCH Regional Medical Center, located in the city. People lined up to get into bars an hour before kickoff despite police warnings.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Data from the Alaska Department of Corrections shows more than 40% of the people incarcerated in the state have been infected with the coronavirus. Case counts have exceeded 100 inmates in at least six prisons, Alaska Public Media reports. Jeremy Hough, the department’s facilities director, said the high numbers are partially a result of the state’s robust inmate testing program, which has conducted an average of four tests per person since the pandemic began. The department has clear policies about masks and hygiene and goes beyond recommendations for prisons from the federal Centers for Disease Control, including providing cleaning supplies, masks and educational materials, Hough said. “I can’t think of anything that we should be doing more than we already are,” Hough said. “I can tell you that there are several people that argue that we’re doing too much.” But advocates and families have said overcrowding, inconsistent precautions and a general lack of transparency from the department are among the causes for the high infection rate. Some lockups have used gym floors to house inmates, which advocates claim makes ensuring proper hygiene an impossibility, especially during a pandemic.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Schools that have lost students during the pandemic would see their funding cut under a proposal Gov. Doug Ducey outlined Monday in his annual State of the State address, which hardened his long-standing resistance to school and business closures. The Republican governor warned schools he expects them to offer in-person instruction as teachers gain access to the COVID-19 vaccine. “We will not be funding empty seats or allowing schools to remain in a perpetual state of closure,” Ducey said. “Children still need to learn, even in a pandemic.” Ducey wants to fund public and charter schools based on current enrollment, not at pre-pandemic levels, said Getchen Conger, Ducey’s deputy chief of staff. That could open up big holes in budgets for schools, which statewide have seen enrollment decline by about 4%, according to the Department of Education. The governor would not defund virtual education, Conger said. Ducey has refused pressure from Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, a Democrat, to pause in-person learning amid a rise in coronavirus infections that is crushing hospitals. Hoffman said she believed that “many educators will take (Ducey’s plan) as a slap in the face, especially those who have been teaching from home since March under these very difficult circumstances.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Hospitalizations for the illness caused by the new coronavirus set a second record high in three days Monday, the state Department of Health reported. The 1,371 COVID-19 hospitalizations bested the record of 1,346 set Saturday. “Today’s report of 31 additional hospitalizations will add to the load of our health care workers,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “The better news in the new cases are starting to slow somewhat. Let’s work toward a true downward trend.” The 1,268 new cases brought the total number since the Arkansas outbreak started in early March to 256,344, the health department reported. Active COVID-19 cases numbered 25,534 on Monday, almost 2,000 fewer than Sunday, but 38 new deaths increased the state’s COVID-19 death toll to 4,081.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Several gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park have tested positive for the coronavirus in what are believed to be the first known cases among such primates in the United States and possibly the world. The park’s executive director, Lisa Peterson, said eight gorillas that live together at the park are believed to have the virus, and several have been coughing. It appears the infection came from a member of the park’s wildlife care team who also tested positive for the virus but has been asymptomatic and wore a mask at all times around the gorillas. The park has been closed to the public since Dec. 6 as part of California’s lockdown efforts. Veterinarians are closely monitoring the gorillas, and they will remain in their habitat at the park, north of San Diego, Peterson said. For now, they are being given vitamins, fluid and food but no specific treatment for the virus. “Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well,” Peterson said. Wildlife experts have expressed concern about the coronavirus infecting gorillas, an endangered species that share 98.4% of their DNA with humans and are inherently social animals.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Life hasn’t looked the same since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last March, but the virus isn’t stopping troops of loyal volunteers from keeping one of the city’s sweetest traditions going. Starting Feb. 1, a pared-down group of volunteers will begin stamping the thousands of valentines that come through Loveland from across the world as part of the Sweetheart City’s 75-year-old valentine re-mailing program. Valentines will be stamped with a special 2021 collector’s stamp and Loveland postmark before being sent on to their final destinations. In years past, roughly 50 volunteer stampers – a lot of whom are senior citizens – sat in close quarters at the Loveland Chamber of Commerce as they stamped stacks of red, white and pink envelopes with each year’s specially designed Sweetheart City markings. But with many volunteer stampers in a higher-risk category for COVID-19, the program has given its regular volunteers the opportunity to sit out stamping. Those who are healthy with no preexisting health conditions can participate as long as they are willing to wear a mask and socially distance the entire time, according to Loveland Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Mindy McCloughan.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Residents age 75 and older will be able to begin signing up for COVID-19 vaccination appointments next week, a process Gov. Ned Lamont promised Monday will be more orderly than in states where senior citizens have waited outdoors in long lines. The Democrat said vaccines will be administered by appointment only, and people will be able to sign up online or by telephone, tentatively beginning Monday. Meanwhile, medical organizations across the state are also planning to reach out to many eligible for Phase 1B, urging them to get vaccinated. Some of that advanced registration work is expected to begin Thursday. There are already more than 100 vaccination sites across the state, said Josh Geballe, Lamont’s chief operating officer. The state is planning to move into more broad-based, appointment-only vaccination clinics soon, as well. The first one, Lamont said, is expected to open at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, where the UConn football team plays, in the next 10 days. Other large sites are being considered as well. People should not contact their own doctors for vaccination appointments, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Legislature is considering exempting unemployment benefits that were paid in 2020 from state income taxes. The proposal would be accomplished through a bill lawmakers introduced Monday with the support of Gov. John Carney. It would also waive the 13-week waiting period before the state could “trigger on” to pay extended unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment. The proposal comes after more than 160,000 people filed for unemployment last year as a result of businesses shutting down temporarily or permanently due to Carney’s emergency orders to slow the spread of COVID-19. That record rate is drastically more than what the state Labor Department and its Division of Unemployment are used to seeing and has given the state government an unprecedented and overwhelming deluge of paperwork since the spring. As a result, people across the state have waited weeks, if not months, before seeing a penny of their due assistance. The General Assembly returned to work Tuesday for the first time in six months and will conduct committee meetings and floor debates over Zoom to avoid spreading the virus in Dover’s Legislative Hall.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University has announced its participation as a clinical trial site to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Novavax’s new COVID-19 vaccine, WUSA-TV reports. Novavax is the fifth company to launch a large-scale trial in the U.S. The two-shot vaccine won’t need to be kept at extremely cold temperatures or require special freezers, making it much more accessible. Novavax researchers are looking for 30,000 volunteers to participate in this trial, specifically seeking those who are the most at risk. “We believe that diverse participation in COVID-19 trials will go a long way toward encouraging potentially life-saving vaccination when it is available,” said Howard University President Dr. Wayne A.I. Frederick,, a practicing surgeon at Howard University Hospital. “Our goal through participation is to ensure a safe and effective product is developed to address the needs of Black, Latino and other minority communities.” Vaccine hesitancy is an issue Fredrick has said could lead to larger issues down the road. He is worried about what the future may look like for Black Americans if mindsets do no not shift around the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday amid a recent surge in COVID-19 cases and some concerns over security in the wake of last week’s attack on the U.S. Capitol. It was a generally subdued opening to the work of lawmakers, whose regular session starts in March. The only committee to meet extensively Monday was the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee. Members of the public and lobbyists not directly involved in the hearing had to monitor proceedings blocks away from an arena at Florida State University. Lawmakers have been mindful of the pandemic that has sickened nearly 1.5 million Floridians and killed more than 23,000. A procedural briefing for committee leaders had to be postponed because state Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, the chair of the Rules Committee, announced Sunday that she tested positive for the coronavirus. The pandemic will be front and center in this week’s legislative agenda, including a discussion Wednesday by the Senate Health Policy Committee on the state’s response to the outbreak.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Republican majority leader of the state Senate announced Tuesday that he tested positive for the coronavirus during mandatory testing at the Capitol. Sen. Mike Dugan, whose district includes Carroll, Douglas and Paulding counties, said in a statement that he was experiencing “minor” symptoms and would isolate at home. Dugan said he received the positive result Tuesday morning, the second day of Georgia’s legislative session. He was tested Monday. “I had results prior (to) noticing any real symptoms,” Dugan said. Both chambers of the Legislature are requiring members and staff to take twice-weekly saliva tests to try to slow the spread of the virus. Both chambers also require face masks. The mask requirement is a new policy in the state Senate, which made mask-wearing optional during the final days of last year’s session – despite having several members sickened by COVID-19 in March. Dugan was at the Capitol on Monday during the opening day of the legislative session. He also attended a watch party last Tuesday for Georgia’s two Republican U.S. Senate candidates, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who lost their bids to Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Businesses are anticipating a possible tripling of unemployment taxes that could slow the recovery of the economy that has been crippled by the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Labor and Industrial Relations must notify employers of the state unemployment tax rate no later than March 15, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The applicable tax rate takes effect this month, with the payments due by the end of April. Individual tax contributions by employers are calculated according to unemployment insurance fund utilization. Businesses that made cuts to their workforce or reduced employee hours face higher unemployment taxes. The Grassroot Institute of Hawaii anticipates Hawaii’s yearly unemployment tax on businesses is set to automatically triple in 2021 to an average of 3.65%, or $1,757 per employee, up from 1.11%, or $534 per employee. Labor and industrial relations department spokesman Bill Kunstman said it is “unlikely that the average employer’s unemployment tax rate would go to the max, as the average employer has sufficient reserves to prevent that trigger.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Legislature says a judge shouldn’t force its leaders to make additional accommodations for lawmakers during the pandemic. Two Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Sue Chew of Boise and Muffy Davis of Ketchum, sued the Legislature and House Speaker Scott Bedke last week, saying the Statehouse is unsafe for them and others with chronic health conditions because coronavirus precautions are being ignored. Chew, who has diabetes and hypertension, and Davis, a paraplegic with compromised lung function, contend that conditions at the Statehouse violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. They want a judge to order Bedke and the Legislature to allow lawmakers to participate remotely and make other coronavirus-related work accommodations. On Monday, attorneys for Bedke and the Legislature asked a judge to refuse the request, contending that Davis and Chew aren’t being singled out because the rules apply to all and saying that the rules don’t have a disproportionate impact on lawmakers with disabilities. Many legislators don’t wear masks or follow other federal and state recommendations designed to reduce the virus’s spread.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s top doctor received a COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday at a suburban Chicago clinic after delivering an emotional address about the difficulties of the pandemic for health care workers and her own family. Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said she was getting vaccinated for her children and her husband, who was diagnosed earlier this year with a medical condition that put him at a higher risk. She said she wanted to see family members again for real hugs, not virtual ones. “I hugged and cried with my mother in person during my father’s burial in February, and I am desperate to touch and hold and kiss my sweet mother again,” she said before getting the shot at a Cook County clinic in North Riverside. “I can’t wait until we have enough for every single person so we can put this nightmare behind us.” Illinois officials said Tuesday that the state has received has received roughly 870,000 vaccine doses. Nearly 640,000 have been delivered to providers, and about 231,000 are going to long-term care facilities through a federal government partnership. The state is currently offering the shots to health care workers and residents and employees of nursing homes.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city will tap nearly $13 million to provide rental assistance, housing for the homeless and other pandemic relief efforts intended to aid vulnerable residents. The Indianapolis City-County Council voted 23-0 Monday night to direct $12.9 million from the city’s general fund to the relief efforts as city officials await possible additional federal funding. Indiana’s capital has already spent the $168 million it received last year coronavirus relief aid approved last March by Congress. That funding went toward food and rental assistance, combating homelessness, and aid for local businesses, among other uses. Mayor Joe Hogsett said in a statement that even though Indianapolis residents have begun receiving a vaccine, “the effects of COVID-19 continue to threaten far too many in our city.” The city’s funding includes $6 million for rental assistance, $2 million for non-congregate shelter for high-risk homeless residents, $1.9 million for coronavirus contact tracing efforts and $300,000 for food assistance.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A second, larger round of federal dollars meant to ease the coronavirus pandemic’s toll on public schools delivered $345million to the state this week. The Iowa Department of Education announced it received the funds Monday. This round of COVID-19 relief for schools is more than four times the amount the state received last spring through earlier federal pandemic aid. Iowa’s public school districts will get 90% of the funds, while the remainder will fund “state-level educational efforts” related to the pandemic, the release said. “Schools can use this funding to measure and address unfinished learning and contend with other coronavirus-related challenges,” Ann Lebo, director of the Iowa Department of Education, said in a statement. “That includes the need for increased professional development, educational technology, cleaning supplies and other sanitation measures, facility repairs, upgrades to improve air quality in school buildings, summer learning, supplemental after-school programs and mental health services.” Unlike last spring’s round of funding, this one will not go to any non-public schools.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are reviewing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, though U.S. government data showed Monday that the state’s inoculation rate no longer lagged most other states. Top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature were unhappy with what they considered a rocky vaccination rollout, in part because a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report at the end of December showed Kansas ranking last among states for its inoculation rate. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and officials in her administration said repeatedly that the state’s low ranking was due to slow reporting by vaccine providers. The House and Senate health committees planned to have separate hearings Tuesday on the state’s vaccine distribution, only a day after the Legislature opened its annual 90-day session. The CDC said Monday that Kansas is now up to 2,650 shots per 100,000 residents and that 25 states have lower vaccination rates. Dr. Lee Norman, head of the state health department, and Kelly said providers have been concentrating on giving the shots first and reporting the data later. They’ve also said some providers were not fully trained on the system the state uses to provide data to the CDC.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Graffiti proclaiming COVID-19 as a fraud was spray-painted on the home mailbox of the state’s top public health official in an action Gov. Andy Beshear denounced Monday as an attempt to “create fear.” The weekend vandalism occurred at the home of Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky’s public health commissioner. Stack frequently speaks at the governor’s press conferences, taking a high-profile role in Beshear’s efforts to combat the coronavirus. “Because of his work, thousands of people are alive today that wouldn’t be,” Beshear said at a press conference. “And whether you agree or disagree with the steps that ultimately I made the calls on, trying to create fear in his family is the lowest form of low.” The Democratic governor had a message for whoever is responsible: “The cowards out there that did it, we’re working to find you.” The words “COVID is PCR fraud” were spray-painted on Stack’s mailbox, Beshear said. PCR is a standard test for COVID-19. The state on Monday surpassed 305,000 COVID-19 cases and is approaching 3,000 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state on Monday boosted distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to the elderly, increasing the number of doses available to people age 70 and older in the second week of eligibility and expanding the locations where they can get the shots to include every parish of the state. The Department of Health’s list of pharmacies offering the vaccine to the elderly, which numbered 107 last week, grew to 209 pharmacies and health clinics across the 64 parishes this week. Gov. John Bel Edwards’s administration also was steering thousands more doses to the facilities for vaccinations of people 70 and older and a broader cohort of health care workers than were eligible in the first weeks of immunizations. Demand remained certain to exceed supply, with each facility estimated to receive about 100 doses of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine for distribution this week. That’s about double the doses released to the pharmacies last week. People still need to make an appointment to get a shot. “Eligible residents must contact a participating provider and make an appointment with them. Patients who arrive without an appointment will not be vaccinated,” the health department stressed in a statement.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Food pantries across the state are seeing a surge of demand as coronavirus cases and unemployment claims rise. More than 60% of food pantries in Maine saw increases in clients in November, the Good Shepherd Food Bank said. “There is a desperate need out there,” Don Bisson, executive director of the Biddeford Food Pantry, told The Portland Press Herald. The Biddeford pantry has seen a 25% increase in demand compared to this time last year. Food pantry operators say they have plenty of food for the people who need it now. But they say they will need aid to help families as the pandemic continues. Meanwhile, the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles has reinstated regular deadlines that were extended due to the pandemic. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has rescinded a March executive order that eased requirements for renewals. The reinstated deadlines and requirements apply to driver’s licenses, driver permits, state identification cards, commercial driver licenses and numerous other credentials that have expired since Mills first declared a state of civil emergency. Driver license vision screenings that were waived last year are also back in effect.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has confirmed its first two cases of a more contagious coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom. Two Anne Arundel County residents tested positive for the variant and are in isolation, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. Little information was available about the cases, which Hogan said he learned about minutes before a 1 p.m. news conference. One of the two people who tested positive had recently returned from travel abroad, Hogan said, and the other person is their spouse. Contact tracing is underway to determine with whom who the couple may have interacted. Hogan said the family has two children who are also quarantining, though they have not been tested. Hogan said the person may have traveled to multiple continents. A private lab that handled the person’s coronavirus test identified strange sequences and sent the sample to the Maryland public health lab, Hogan said. The state lab and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both confirmed the presence of the U.K. variant. Hogan said it is likely that the variant has already spread to every state but has not yet been identified everywhere.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is preparing to open its first mass vaccination site this week at Gillette Stadium as it ramps up efforts to get shots into arms and help stem the spread of the coronavirus. The site will open Thursday by first administering vaccinations into staff members, Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday at a press conference. Starting Monday, the site will begin giving shots to first responders. At first the site will have the capacity to administer up to 300 doses a day. Baker said capacity will expand over time to up to 5,000 doses a day or more, eventually extending to the general population. “These vaccines are safe and effective,” Baker said. On Monday, the state began administering vaccine doses to first responders – including police, firefighters and EMTs. Baker said eligible vaccine recipients will be able to schedule appointments on the state’s COVID-19 vaccine website. The next phase of the vaccine plan will focus on congregate care facilities, he said. Vaccines are not expected to be available to the general public until April.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A 65-vehicle drive-in theater is coming to downtown Detroit as part of efforts to boost the city amid the coronavirus pandemic. Detroit-based Bedrock real estate and Emagine Entertainment are scheduled to open the Monroe Street site this month with 1993’s “Jurassic Park.” Family-friendly movies will be shown on a 60-foot-by-32-foot outdoor digital projection screen on the site of a future office, retail and residential development called the Monroe Blocks. The drive-in will feature outdoor seating, pedestrian paths, concession pavilions, lighting and warming areas. Mask-wearing, social distancing and other COVID-19 guidelines will be enforced while visitors are outside their vehicles. Patrons will be able to order food from some downtown restaurants and have it delivered to their vehicles. The area had been the home of Detroit’s first theater district in the early 1900s. The drive-in is part of Bedrock’s “Decked Out Detroit” initiative with Rocket Community Fund, one of Bedrock’s efforts to support Detroit small businesses and the community during the pandemic.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state launched a dashboard Tuesday to provide more information on the status of vaccination efforts. The dashboard includes data on the numbers of doses promised to the state by the federal government, doses shipped to Minnesota providers and doses administered. The website will be updated daily, though the figures will lag by a few days because providers have up to three days to submit data. The dashboard shows 144,503 people had received at least one dose of vaccine from providers in the state as of Saturday, including 7,392 who’d gotten their second dose. The figures include health care workers employed in Minnesota who live in neighboring states but don’t include shots given by federal programs. As of Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has promised 541,100 doses to Minnesota. The first are going mostly to front-line health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The Minnesota Department of Health on Tuesday reported 1,335 new coronavirus cases and 13 new deaths, raising the state’s totals to 438,867 cases and 5,724 total deaths. The broad trends in new cases, deaths and hospitalizations have been downward recently.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Residents who are 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions will now be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Tate Reeves announced Tuesday. The announcement comes less than a week after the state made vaccinations available for Mississippians 75 and older. Drive-thru sites for vaccinations have been set up across the state. The vaccine is also available at some private clinics. The development means the vaccine is available to health care workers, those 65 and older, and individuals with health conditions. Reeves said teachers will be on the list of those next eligible. “We are working ahead of schedule, but we are never working fast enough,” the Republican governor said Tuesday at a media briefing. People eligible to receive the vaccine can make an appointment at COVIDvaccine.umc.edu or by calling the COVID-19 call center at 1-877-978-6453.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: The St. Louis Blues won’t be playing to an empty arena when they open their first homestand next week. The NHL team said Monday that it will allow a very small crowd made up of medical workers and public safety employees who have been on the front lines during the coronavirus pandemic. The Blues are set to open the truncated schedule with two games at Colorado on Wednesday and Friday, followed by a four-game homestand that begins Jan. 18 against the San Jose Sharks. The Blues plan to allow fewer than 300 fans. The team said it is working with health care systems and public safety organizations to identify front-line workers for January home games. Invited fans will sit in “socially distanced seating pods” throughout the plaza level of the Enterprise Center, the team said. The opener also will include a puck drop honoring front-line workers. Face coverings will be required for all fans and staff, and cash will not be accepted in the building under new anti-virus protocols. Hospitals remain dangerously close to capacity across the state. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said inpatient bed capacity statewide is at 22%, but it’s as low as 11% in some areas.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A state House committee held a hearing Tuesday on a bill to limit the power of the governor to address declared disasters lasting longer than two months, instead shifting it to lawmakers for dealing with emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Current law in Montana gives the governor the power during declared emergencies to issue executive orders and spend federal emergency funds received by the state without approval from the Legislature, which meets every other year. Under the bill, approval from the Legislature would be required if a governor wants to extend a state of disaster beyond 60 days. The bill would make it easier for lawmakers to convene special sessions during declared disasters. Legislators would get the ability to end emergency executive orders issued by the governor and could also assume the role of allocating federal emergency funds. The bill comes in response to the emergency declaration, still in place, issued by former Gov. Steve Bullock in March. It gave the Democrat the ability to issue statewide mandates and allocate coronavirus relief funds without input from the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: More than 40% of the state’s 90,000 health care workers have received the first of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine as distribution ramps up. State health officials said 78,074 of the 144,363 doses Nebraska has received so far have been administered, primarily to health care workers. Residents and workers at long-term care facilities have also begun getting vaccines as part of the first tier of distributions in Nebraska. About 10,000 people have received both doses of the vaccine. Gov. Pete Ricketts said Tuesday that health officials are still working through first-tier recipients, and some areas of the state have started vaccinating the next high-priority group: people who are at least 75 years old. Ricketts encouraged people to get vaccinated but said he opposes mandates for vaccines or coronavirus tests. Nebraska also plans to launch a website and telephone hotline that will allow people to register for vaccinations. “There’s a variety of channels” where people will be able to sign up, Ricketts said. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has increased over the past two weeks from 798.86 new cases per day Dec. 28 to 1,003.71 per day Monday.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Roughly two-thirds of the COVID-19 vaccine doses the state has received from the federal government remain in vials. Only six states have administered fewer doses per capita than Nevada, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. Now, four weeks after receiving its first vaccine shipment, Nevada is making changes to its distribution plan. Public health officials announced Monday that once all front-line health care workers and long-term care facility residents are offered vaccines, providers will be directed to concurrently vaccinate high-risk groups – including residents with underlying conditions and workers the state deems essential, such as teachers, service industry workers, legislators and mining industry workers. The plan also lowers the age threshold for priority distribution from 75 to 70. Nevada Health Bureau Chief Candice McDaniel attributed the incomplete rollout to a lack of advance notice from the federal government, which alerts officials of how many doses are scheduled to be delivered no more than a week in advance. Gov. Steve Sisolak said the federal government had put state and local vaccination teams in “an impossible position” to guess how many people to prepare to vaccinate.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Residents who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or were previously infected with the coronavirus no longer need to quarantine after being exposed to an infected person or after traveling, according to new guidance from the state Division of Public Health Services. Under previous guidance, anyone who was exposed to the virus was advised to quarantine for 14 days, while those returning to New Hampshire after traveling outside of New England were told to quarantine for 10 days. An update issued Monday says those quarantine periods are unnecessary if someone is at least 14 days past their second dose of the vaccine or if within 90 days of being infected. The guidance still urges people with prior infections to get vaccinated. And officials continue to discourage any nonessential travel, even for those who are vaccinated or had previous infections, because “protection is not 100%, durability of immunity is still unknown, and there are new circulating strains” of the virus that are being investigated.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The COVID-19 vaccine is giving the Garden State a sense of promise that people will be able to gather and celebrate together again, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday during his third State of the State address. The annual address is typically given during a joint legislative session in the Trenton statehouse, but because of coronavirus distancing rules, Murphy prerecorded the roughly 35-minute speech, which was aired on social media, including YouTube. The outbreak, as it has across the world, took hold of the agenda in New Jersey, with restaurants and bars still facing capacity limits, many schools teaching remotely, and masking and distancing requirements firmly in place. So far, about 233,000 people have been vaccinated, out of about 400,000 doses the state has received. Murphy wants to have nearly 5 million adults inoculated by June. “We will begin to see the light on the horizon get a little brighter,” the Democrat said. “Be assured, we will get back to being able to gather and celebrate with our families and friends. We will be able to see all our children back in the schools they love. We will see our economy recover and flourish.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is recommending a 3.3% increase in state general fund spending in the coming fiscal year to devote more to public education and health and workplace safety programs, as authorities grapple with the economic hardships and mounting death toll of the pandemic. The budget proposal presented Monday to the Legislature would boost general fund spending by $236 million to $7.3 billion for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2021. The Democrat-led Legislature convenes Jan. 19 for a 60-day session as New Mexico battles an unrelenting pandemic with major uncertainties about future economic recovery. Tight restrictions on public gatherings and nonessential business remain in place across most of the state. At the same time, the state has reserves of roughly $2.5 billion at its disposal, and proposals are on the table this year to tap more money for education from the state’s $20 billion land grant permanent fund. Finance and Administration Secretary Debbie Romero said a one-time burst of spending worth $475 million also is recommended for pandemic relief, with details left to negotiations with the Legislature.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The state expanded eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine again to allow anyone over age 65 to get it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday. Cuomo said the state is following new federal guidance, which now means more than 1 in 3 New Yorkers is eligible to get vaccinated. The federal government will also no longer hold back required second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, a move expected to practically double supply. People who are age 75 and up and a much longer list of workers – including transit employees, grocery clerks, teachers, police officers and firefighters – became eligible to get the vaccine Monday. Cuomo has warned that it will take six months to vaccinate 7 million New Yorkers, less than half of the state’s 19 million residents, if the state keeps receiving only 300,000 vaccine doses a week. He said it was unclear as of Tuesday morning how the federal government’s new move would affect New York’s weekly allocations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreensboro: Appalachian State University and the University of North Carolina-Charlotte have delayed the start of in-person classes as the number of coronavirus cases rises across the state. The Greensboro News & Record reports in-person classes at Appalachian State won’t begin until Feb. 1, two weeks later than originally planned. UNC-Charlotte said Monday that it is pushing back face-to-face classes by a month. Both institutions are part of the UNC System. They will start their spring semester classes with remote instruction later this month. UNC-Chapel Hill was the first public university in North Carolina to push back the start of in-person undergraduate classes. It announced last week that undergraduate classes will be held online for the first three weeks of the semester. North Carolina reported a record 11,581 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday. The state also reported nearly 6,000 new cases Monday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Supporters of amending the state’s constitution to legalize recreational marijuana are taking another run at the issue, after failing to collect enough signatures to get it on the 2020 ballot. Secretary of State Al Jaeger said the group filed the petition Monday. If approved, backers would have one year to turn in at least 26,904 valid signatures to put it to a vote in November 2022. Petition-gatherers fell just shy of 24,000 signatures in last year’s effort. Organizers said they were hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. Proponents of recreational marijuana have said they were encouraged by similar measures that were approved by voters in neighboring South Dakota and Montana in November.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed a bill that would have lifted his health department’s order on county fairs, allowing rides, games and grandstand events. Senate Bill 375, which DeWine rejected Monday, would have eliminated an order limiting county fairs to junior fair activities for 4-H, FFA and other youth organizations. The bill would have created a working group to study and recommend protocols to conduct county fairs and festivals in a safe and hygienic way. However, DeWine vetoed that proposal, saying he would consult with health officials at the state and local level before the 2021 fair season. “It is imperative that such fairs be conducted in a safe manner that reflects the facts on the ground at the time,” DeWine wrote in a veto message. “A blanket recission of the current order does not achieve the goal of working together to properly plan the upcoming fair season while ensuring the public health and protection of the people of Ohio.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma State Department of Health has begun making COVID-19 vaccines available to the nearly 150 members of the Legislature. The Health Department offered vaccines to lawmakers this week, said John Estus, spokesman for House Speaker Charles McCall, citing “continuity of government and due to their frequent travel and public interaction across the state.” Some lawmakers work in health care settings and have already received vaccines through their work. House Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols, R-Oklahoma City, said he plans to take the COVID-19 vaccine, but he will wait until doses are available to the general public. The state is continuing to vaccinate health care workers, first responders, residents in long-term care facilities and Oklahomans age 65 and older. The second phase of the state’s vaccine plan also includes teachers and those with severe underlying medical conditions, but it has not begun widespread vaccinations for those groups. Legislators returned to the Capitol last week to prepare for the session that begins Feb. 1. Many did not wear masks, despite a rule that Capitol visitors wear masks inside when physical distancing is not possible.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A gym that made headlines for violating COVID-19 restrictions and remaining open in defiance of public health orders was fined an additional $126,749, Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials said Tuesday. Courthouse Club Fitness was fined for “willfully continuing to potentially expose employees to the infectious coronavirus,” OSHA officials said. The fine is the largest penalty issued to an employer by Oregon OSHA for a violation related to COVID-19 and comes two months after the agency tasked with enforcing compliance to Gov. Kate Brown’s pandemic restrictions fined the gym $90,000. A series of protests, some involving far-right groups, outside OSHA employees’ homes followed the issuance of the initial fine. In counties with the “extreme risk” designation, indoor gyms are required to remain closed. With one of the highest case rates in western Oregon, Marion County remains in the “extreme risk” category.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will speed up vaccines for seniors ages 65 and older at the urging of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state health director Rachel Levine said Tuesday. Levine said she would review new recommendations from the federal government and make changes to the current rollout plan. “We’re still waiting to hear the exact recommendation and the exact plan,” Levine said during a news conference. “They are recommending that we start vaccinating those 65 and older. We want to see the whole plan as they’re rolling it out.” No exact timeline was provided. The current phase 1A includes nurses, doctors and school nurses, as well as residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Under the current plan, phase 1B was to include residents age 75 and older, those with significant health issues and essential workers. Changes recommended by the federal government could lead to seniors ages 65 and older being added to phase 1B. Levine described a careful balancing act of ensuring drug delivery to those most at risk while, at the same time, making sure vaccines never go to waste.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The number of people who have died of COVID-19 is approaching 2,000, according to state Department of Health statistics released Tuesday. With 23 more fatalities reported, the total number of virus-related deaths during the pandemic has climbed to 1,970. Nationally, almost 378,000 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The health department also reported more than 660 new confirmed cases of the disease from the previous day and a daily positivity rate of 5.7%. The latest seven-day average positivity rate in Rhode Island is now 6.56%. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in the state has risen over the past two weeks from more than 767 on Dec. 28 to more than 1,128 on Monday, according to the project. There were more than 400 people in the state’s hospitals with the disease as of Sunday, up slightly from the previous day.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The General Assembly opened up its 2021 session Tuesday promising not to let COVID-19 stop its work and with the largest Republican Senate majority in modern times changing rules that could limit lengthy debates. It was a much different opening day. There were lawmakers in masks – although not all of them – and elbow taps and fist bumps replaced hugs and handshakes. There was extra security in fatigues and uniforms, supplementing the typical Statehouse security in suits after last week’s mob violence at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. The Senate welcomed six new members to the 46-seat chamber. Three are Republicans who replaced Democrats. They didn’t change leadership, electing Republican Harvey Peeler of Gaffney as the Senate president. He first took the role two years ago when voters approved a constitutional amendment taking the lieutenant governor out of the role of presiding over the body. Peeler is requiring all senators and staff to wear masks in the Legislature, where nearly half the members are over age 60. But in his opening speech, he told senators they would not stop meeting because of the virus.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: For the second straight day, no new deaths have been reported in the state from COVID-19, according to data released Tuesday morning by the South Dakota Department of Health. A total of 244 more cases were confirmed, although the number of active cases is now 4,751, a drop of more than 350 from Monday. With no new deaths reported, the death toll of COVID-19 in South Dakota remains at 1,585. Hospitalizations statewide fell to 240, with 42% of hospital beds available across the state and 35.7% of adult intensive care beds available. South Dakota has so far avoided the surge in cases being seen around the country, where many states are reporting their highest weekly death tolls of the pandemic thus far. The state health department reported that a total of 46,714 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the state to 39,245 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A group of doctors that has been pushing Gov. Bill Lee for a statewide mask mandate turned its attention to the Legislature on Tuesday, the first day of the 2021 legislative session. Speaking to reporters via videoconference, Dr. Diana Sepehri-Harvey, a Franklin primary care physician, addressed Lee’s stance that individual personal responsibility, not a mandate, is the best way for Tennessee to fight the virus. “This is a global pandemic, so it cannot be fought by individuals,” she said. “We need to come together with a cohesive response. We are asking our state representatives to do the job Gov. Lee has not.” Despite the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in Tennessee, where more than 7,800 people have died, it seemed unlikely that lawmakers would act on the call for a mask mandate. In the GOP-dominant General Assembly on Tuesday, few lawmakers were wearing masks themselves. Meanwhile, Tennessee’s largest county resumed COVID-19 vaccinations Tuesday after it ran out of doses provided by the state last week. The Shelby County Health Department said vaccinations resumed by appointment, though all appointments for January are filled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A field hospital in a convention center opened Tuesday as COVID-19 cases continue to soar. For now the facility has 25 beds and can expand if needed. “This Alternate Care Site in central Texas will reduce the burden on local hospitals and help ensure that Texans diagnosed with COVID-19 receive the care they need,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement. Dr. Mark Escott, the interim Austin-Travis County health director, said last week that the convention center could be pressed into service as a field hospital as cases surge from gatherings for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Other parts of Texas, including the Rio Grande Valley, opened makeshift hospitals last year as COVID-19 bore down. Now Texas is working to rapidly ramp up vaccinations. Cities throughout the state are using new mass hubs for people to get shots, but the effort is still limited by the supply of medicine coming from the federal government. Texas has seen a surge in newly confirmed coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths. More than 13,000 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized statewide Monday, state health officials reported, and nearly 30,000 Texans have died in the pandemic.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state prison inmate has sued the Utah Department of Corrections to stop the movement of inmates among buildings, an alleged lack of mask and glove use by prison officials, and other measures he claims spread the coronavirus. Damon Christ, who is serving time for theft, alleges the practices contributed to COVID-19 outbreaks at the Draper facility, The Deseret News reports. Since October, more than 1,200 inmates have been infected, and 12 have died. Christ said he tested positive for the coronavirus in November. “I’m not asking for money damages. I’m not asking to be released,” Crist said of his 3rd District Court lawsuit. “I’m just saying, ‘Look, the department is moving people recklessly. It’s causing mass outbreaks, and it’s infecting and killing people.’ ” A department spokeswoman declined comment, citing pending litigation. The department previously has said it consults health officials in moving inmates among buildings and quarantining those who test positive from the general prison population. Judge Keith Kelly has ordered the department to respond to the allegations within 30 days.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has seen more new coronavirus cases in the past five days than it did from May through September, officials said Tuesday. The increase follows a spike in cases after Christmas, but it’s too soon to say whether there has been a similar spike following the New Year’s holiday. Nevertheless, officials expect the number of new cases to increase from the current average of more than 160 cases a day to nearly 300 by early February, said Mike Pieciak, the Vermont commissioner of financial regulation, who manages COVID-19 statistics for the state. During a regular twice-weekly virus briefing, Gov. Phil Scott and others urged Vermonters to follow long-standing guidance designed to reduce transmission of the virus: wearing masks, maintaining social distance and avoiding crowds. The increase comes as the state continues with its plan to vaccinate health care professionals and older adults living in long-term care facilities – people who are at the greatest risk of death from COVID-19. State officials are expected to outline this week their plans to continue the vaccination program focusing on the oldest, and most vulnerable, Vermonters first.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: A COVID-19 outbreak at Envoy of Staunton is alarming officials. The 170-bed certified skilled nursing facility has 167 active coronavirus cases and has reported 14 deaths, according to the Virginia Department of Health’s dashboard on COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities. That is an increase of 100 cases in less than one month since the nursing home’s second outbreak was reported Dec. 10. According to the Virginia Department of Health, there were no related deaths at the time. Now 14 people have died. The first outbreak at the facility was reported to the health department on Aug. 10. According to the health department, an outbreak in a long-term care facility is confirmed when there are two or more laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases in the facility with onset dates within one 14-day incubation period. As of Monday, Virginia had recorded 403,386 coronavirus cases and 5,393 COVID-19-related deaths, according to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A respiratory therapist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center has been sentenced to three months in prison after pleading guilty to stealing a ventilator and other medical equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic and selling it for personal gain. Gene Wamsley, 42, of Bonney Lake, must remain on nine months of home confinement once he’s released from prison under the sentencing ordered Monday by U.S. District Judge James Robart. “This is an extremely serious offense, quite independent of the COVID-19 pandemic; this was exploiting patients,” Robart said during the hearing. U.S. Attorney Brian Moran said the fraud impeded efforts to care for the elderly and veterans. “Stealing money is bad enough, but stealing equipment needed for life-saving therapies shocks the conscience,” he said in a statement. Wamsley admitted stealing three machines and selling them on eBay. Investigators also found that Wamsley stole a $9,950 respirator and sold it on eBay for $6,000. He also stole ventilators. Wamsley was ordered to pay $132,291 in restitution to cover the loss of the thefts, prosecutors said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMadison: A county health department has been barred from distributing the COVID-19 vaccine until state officials conduct a “clinical monitoring visit,” officials said. The Boone County Health Department hasn’t received any vaccine since Dec. 30, when it mistakenly gave 44 people an antibody treatment instead of vaccinations, news outlets report, citing a statement from the Department of Health and Human Resources. The county agency can resume giving vaccinations after state officials conduct the visit, which will include “a review of agency policies and procedures,” Health and Human Resources spokeswoman Allison Adler said. The visit is expected this week, she said. “The intent of this process is to provide agency leadership and clinical personnel with recommendations for improving patient care practices and outcomes and the utilizations of agency resources,” Adler said. At least one other facility, Madison Medical, is distributing vaccines in the county.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Senate overwhelmingly passed a scaled-down COVID-19 relief package Tuesday, drawing a pledge from Gov. Tony Evers that he would sign the measure if it can clear the Assembly. The Republican-controlled Legislature passed a COVID-19 relief deal in April but did nothing to address the pandemic all summer and fall. Evers and Republican legislative leaders began talking about a second package late last year but couldn’t come up with an agreement. Assembly Republicans passed their own package last week. Evers, a Democrat, said he opposes it. Senate Republicans pared the proposal back, removing numerous provisions the governor and other Democrats opposed. They passed the package 29-2 on Tuesday afternoon and sent it back to the Assembly. Senate Republicans removed a host of contentious provisions Assembly Republicans tucked into the package, including a prohibition on local health officials closing businesses for more than two weeks at a time and requirements that school boards vote every two weeks on whether to continue all-virtual learning, that the governor submit plans for spending federal COVID-19 aid to the Legislature and that Evers create a plan to reopen the state Capitol building.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Most rivers in the state will be at below-average levels this spring, according to a report released Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The report estimated the North Platte River, which runs through Casper, will be at less than half of its average where it enters the Nebraska Panhandle, KTWO-AM reports. USDA Hydrologist Jim Fahey said spring runoff values will be about 80% for Wyoming, while the Yellowstone and Shoshone rivers are estimated to be closer to 100%. He also said the state started the new year with dry soil conditions, hindering initial runoff projections. “We will just have to see how the rest of the winter goes and, more importantly, how the upcoming spring pans out with precipitation,” Fahey said. The report came after the National Weather Service in Riverton said drought conditions are not expected to improve.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/07/24/ironman-idled-masks-navajo-nation-news-around-states/112351822/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa:The Tuscaloosa City School Board voted 6-2 to move forward on opening with a virtual-only system for the first nine weeks. “There’s really no good recommendation in this plan,” School Superintendent Mike J. Daria said, stressing the unknown factors in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and presenting an adapted version of last week’s reopening plan. He urged the phased reopening, erring on the side of caution. “That is the model I’m asking you to consider,” he told board members at a Tuesday meeting. “My thinking is we ease back into school, so we can stay in school.” For the first nine weeks, students will work fully virtual, with “limited face-to-face interaction.” The hope is the second nine weeks will be in-person, if that follows governmental and health agency guidelines. “The only thing I want to do (tonight) is tell the community what our plan is,” Daria said. The 84-page version of the Recovery and Reopening 2020-2021 plan can be found on the district’s website at www.tuscaloosacityschools.com, under Board Meeting Minutes & Agendas.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Mayor Ethan Berkowitz is limiting gathering sizes and the number of people allowed in bars, restaurants and entertainment venues in response to rising coronavirus cases. The order takes effect Friday and said that because of a “resurgence” in cases there is a need for increased restrictions on public interactions “to preserve health and save lives in our community.” Of the 92 new resident cases statewide reported by the Alaska health department Wednesday, 42 were from the Municipality of Anchorage, which also includes Chugiak and Eagle River. “We are experiencing exponential growth at this time,” Anchorage Health Department Director Natasha Pineda said, noting in part the average daily rate of cases based on a seven-day average. She said there is widespread community transmission. Berkowitz’s order bars indoor gatherings of more than 25 people. Outdoor gatherings involving food and drink can have no more than 50 people, with some exceptions, such as farmers’ markets, where distancing is maintained and onsite eating is discouraged, and drive-in events, where people stay in separate, spaced vehicles and food or other goods are not passed between vehicles. Bars and nightclubs will be limited to 25% of maximum building occupancy. Restaurants and breweries will be held to 50% of their indoor capacity and outside areas limited to table service with tables at least 10 feet apart. Indoor entertainment and recreation venues, including gyms and theaters, will be limited to 50% capacity, the order states.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez signed an executive order Wednesday to keep parts of the tribal government closed through mid-August, citing surges of coronavirus cases off the reservation. Executive branch divisions, departments and offices that were set to reopen July 27 will stay closed until Aug. 16. The decision was based on recommendations and data from health care experts, the Farmington Daily Times reported. Tribal officials are evaluating steps for reopening the government in phases. Meanwhile, the Navajo Nation Council voted Wednesday to overturn the veto of a bill to cancel the tribe’s primary election that’s held in line with Arizona’s primary on Aug. 4. Navajo voters typically narrow the list of candidates for local chapter officials in the primary. Instead, the winner will be decided by plurality vote in the November general election. Nez had urged lawmakers to come up with alternative voting methods.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he believes it should remain up to local school districts rather than the state whether to require all students to wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when classes resume next month. Hutchinson said he doesn’t think a broad rule on masks for students should be issued statewide, despite a recommendation from pediatricians for a stricter requirement in K-12 schools. Arkansas this week began requiring masks to be worn in public when social distancing isn’t possible, but the order exempts children under 10. Hutchinson said some schools might have enough room for students to socially distance in class without requiring a mask. “I think there ought to be some flexibility for the social distancing and the environment the students are in,” Hutchinson said, who noted some districts have already approved such requirements. “I think there has to be some flexibility there.” The Arkansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday recommended stronger mask requirements for K-12 students as the group said it couldn’t support a return to in-person classes next month.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will spend $315 million more to buy hundreds of millions of protective masks as the coronavirus continues to ravage the state, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. A new contract with Chinese manufacturer BYD will provide the state 120 million tight-fighting N95 respirator masks and 300 million looser-fitting surgical masks. California’s initial $1 billion deal with the company was signed in April. The state will soon launch a competitive bidding process to try to get even more protective masks at lower prices and is encouraging manufacturers within the state to make equipment, Newsom said. “We decided to think outside the box, we did something big and bold,” he said during a news conference at a Sacramento warehouse where masks and orher protective equipment are stored. But as he promoted California’s efforts, he acknowledged the equipment isn’t always getting to the workers who need it, something he blamed on hospital systems and local governments. The administration will be “more aggressive” in making sure masks reach front -line workers, Newsom said. Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, could not immediately provide more details on what the state will do to improve distribution to workers. Carmela Coyle, president of the California Hospital Association, challenged Newsom’s comments suggesting hospitals are not appropriately distributing equipment to workers. Hospitals can only access the state supply of protective equipment through local and regional coordinators and only when the hospital is dangerously low on gear, she said. Hospitals distribute gear based on guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she said.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: Health officials in western Colorado have reported the first confirmed death from COVID-19 in the county on Tuesday. Mesa County Department of Public Health Executive Director Jeff Kuhr said the person who died was identified as a woman in her 80s who had underlying medical conditions, The Daily Sentinel reported. He declined to provide further information due to privacy regulations, such as where or how she contracted the virus. “I do think that this is the time for people to know that this person was in such a condition with a compromised immune system that she wasn’t out in the community,” Kuhr said, adding that the message here is that people should be thinking about others and who they could potentially infect. About 33% of infections in the county in the past two weeks are people ages 10 to 29, he said. “If they’re not worried about themselves, I would appreciate it if they would be worried about infecting others in the community,” he said. “Unfortunately, that ended up with our first death in Mesa County, and we don’t want any more deaths.” Mesa County has recorded 201 confirmed virus cases as of Tuesday and 71 newly confirmed cases in the last two weeks, health officials said. Seven other people are currently hospitalized.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Unionized nursing home workers rallied outside the state Capitol on Thursday, demanding that state lawmakers ensure there’s adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. The New England Health Care Employees Union, SEIU 1199 is also demanding “accountability of state officials and employers and respect for workers who denounce hazardous situations from the front lines.” A dozen unionized nursing home workers have died during the pandemic from COVID-associated causes. The union said it planned to “occupy” the south side of the state Capitol when members of the House of Representatives meet in a special legislative session to vote on four bills, none of which pertain to long-term care facilities. The state Senate is scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The union members won’t be alone. Protests are also planned concerning a police accountability bill that lawmakers are expected to consider. State Capitol Police said they’re expecting large crowds on and around the Capitol grounds.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Gov. John Carney said he is “mad as hell” that residents of his state have again been placed on a quarantine list issued by New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Carney made the comment during a news conference Tuesday, saying that it “doesn’t make any sense” why people from Delaware must now quarantine for 14 days when traveling to the three states. “We are better today than we were when we were first put on the list two weeks ago,” Carney said at the news conference. “And we are better today than we were last week when we were taken off the list. We shouldn’t be on the list.” The advisory issued Tuesday included states if their seven-day rolling average of positive tests exceeds 10%, or if the number of positive cases exceeds 10 per 100,000 residents. Delaware has a positivity rate of 4.2% and about 105 coronavirus cases a day on a five-day average, health officials said Tuesday. The governor believes Delaware was added back to the list for two days this month where there were more than 100 daily confirmed cases in the state. “As I said to Govs. Cuomo and Murphy last week, we’re going to be on and off, unless we stop testing,” Carney said at the news conference, referring to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. “And we’re not going to stop testing.” Delaware was taken off a quarantine list by the three states and Pennsylvania last week after Carney voiced opposition to the move. He also said the state was being “penalized” for its small population and expanding coronavirus testing, the Delaware News Journal reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A D.C.-based company is working to meet people where they are to get them screened for COVID-19 on other underlying health problems, WUSA-TV reported.. Live Chair, a startup company, is working with a team of physicians and local barbers to provide the coronavirus screenings for barbershop customers. “Live Chair Health is a service deeply focused on preventing African American men from dying too young from preventable causes,” said Andrew Suggs, the company’s CEO and co-founder. He has been working with barbershops for years to help them improve their operations and client management through an app platform. Suggs said his father recently died because of congestive heart failure. He said after watching his father’s quality of life deteriorate, he knew the company had to do more to serve the unique social spaces barbershops provide.“Pre-COVID, we equipped and trained barbers on how to take blood pressure readings, and then we equipped the shop with the weight scale so that we were able to take weight and then also gauge BMI,” Suggs said. “So, blood pressure, BMI, and weight. Then, after the client was screened, we provided the client with a health risk assessment.” However, those health screenings stopped when the coronavirus shut barbershops and salons down. Now that many of them are starting to reopen again, those same groomers were given thermometers and screening techniques to monitor for COVID-19 exposure.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Floridians dramatically cut their social interactions in March when the coronavirus pandemic hit the state, but by June, their contacts returned to close to normal, just before cases and deaths began spiking, a university study whose preliminary results were released Wednesday showed. The study came as Florida recorded more than 100 new coronavirus deaths for the seventh time in two weeks, giving it the nation’s highest daily average for fatalities for the past week. The University of West Florida study using cellphone locations showed Floridians cut their social interactions by two-thirds between early March when the state’s first coronavirus cases were reported and March 21, the day after the state ordered a ban on indoor dining at restaurants but before a broader statewide economic lockdown was enacted. The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, tracked cellphone locations for adults who agreed to have that information recorded and covered about 5% of the U.S. population. Interactions remained well below prepandemic levels for about two months as schools and universities closed and the state closed and then slowly reopened sectors of its economy. During that period, Florida’s rate of positive tests dropped from 11% to 2%, its rate of new cases flattened and its daily average death toll dropped from 60 to 30. By late May, however, contacts had returned to a level that would allow significant spread of the virus and were back to near-normal in June as Florida’s economy reopened, the study showed. That occurred even though many people were still working from home, schools were closed, restaurants were limited to 50% indoor capacity and officials asked residents to keep unnecessary interactions to a minimum and avoid large crowds. It was during June that Florida’s positivity rate for coronavirus tests skyrocketed from about 3% to 16%.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta:As Augustans increasingly comply with face-mask rules and recommendations, Mayor Hardie Davis said he is confident his mask mandate will hold up in court. Davis joined the governments in Atlanta, Savannah, Athens and other Georgia cities July 10 by signing an order requiring masks be worn in all public places. Gov. Brian Kemp followed with an order specifically prohibiting local governments from requiring masks. Kemp’s subsequent lawsuit attempting to enjoin Atlanta Mayor Keith Lance Bottoms from requiring masks and shuttering businesses could likely spell the end of Kemp’s anti-mask order, Davis said. Georgia Municipal Association, the lobbying arm for Georgia cities, has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Atlanta that Davis said will back cities’ ability to enact mask and other pandemic requirements. A hearing in the case is scheduled for July 28. “The brief argues that the governor does not have the authority to usurp home rule that is conferred upon cities by the General Assembly,” said Davis, a former state senator and representative. “That will be the argument that is taken to the court.” Although state law gives the governor authority to issue orders during public health emergencies, it also expressly gives cities authority to do so, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: The annual Ironman World Championship in Hawaii has been canceled for the first time in its 43-year history. The competition is considered one of the most important Ironman triathlon events. Participants swim 2.4 miles, ride bicycles for 112 miles and then run a marathon, which goes for 26.2 miles. The 2020 competition was initially postponed from Oct. 10 to Feb. 6, 2021. But organizers decided Tuesday to cancel it because of continuing coronavirus concerns and the risks of international travel, West Hawaii Today reported. The Tribune-Herald reported that a study found that 2019’s World Championship event generated an estimated total economic impact of $72 million for the state. The Big Island played host to about 2,500 athletes from 75 countries. “The coronavirus strikes again at the heart of Kona,” Kona-Kohala Chamber of Commerce economic development committee chair Ross Wilson told The Tribune-Herald. Wilson added: “While the reasons for canceling are understandable, how can Kona not be disappointed? It reminds me of an old friend or a family member that delays a trip to visit but you know they’re coming next year.” The 2020 Ironman 70.3 World Championship in Taupo, New Zealand, was also canceled for similar reasons.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Supreme Court should reject Gov. Brad Little’s request to put on hold an online signature-gathering effort during the coronavirus pandemic, backers of an education funding initiative said. Reclaim Idaho in documents filed Tuesday at the request of Justice Elena Kagan said online signature-gathering won’t harm the state as Little contends, and that the state is likely to lose the case anyway. The Republican governor filed an appeal last week after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his request to stay an order allowing online signatures until the case is decided on its merits. State officials said Idaho has never allowed electronic signatures for ballot initiatives, and contends it undermines the state’s election process. The funding initiative backers are trying to get on the November ballot would raise $170 million for K-12 education by raising Idaho’s corporate tax rate and increasing taxes on individuals making $250,000 or more annually. Reclaim Idaho said Little’s statewide stay-at-home order in late March didn’t include exceptions for ballot initiative signature-gathering. The group in the lawsuit against Little and Secretary of State Lawerence Denney, also a Republican, said they violated the First Amendment-protected process of signature gathering, a form of political speech. U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill late last month agreed with Reclaim Idaho and ordered the state to choose between accepting online signatures or simply putting the education funding initiative on the November ballot. When Idaho didn’t respond, Winmill ordered the state to collect online signatures or allow Reclaim Idaho to do so.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago:Gov. JB Pritzker extended the ban on evictions until Aug. 22 as the state continues to grapple with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came on the same day the Illinois Department of Public Health announced nearly 1,600 new cases of the coronavirus, the largest daily increase in July. It was at the end of June that the state moved to Phase 4 of Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan, allowing much more of the state’s economy to reopen. The ban on housing evictions was scheduled to expire at the end of this month. “I take this step today because I want to ensure we have support in place for those who are most vulnerable,” Pritzker said at a news conference. Illinois lawmakers put into place two programs – each with $150 million in funding – to provide assistance to renters and homeowners at risk of losing their housing because of the pandemic. With many people out of work because of the pandemic, thousands faced eviction for not paying rents or foreclosure for not paying mortgages. Pritzker said that renters can begin applying for assistance the week of Aug. 10 and homeowners can apply beginning the week of Aug. 28. Pritzker said that through the fall, renters can receive grants of up to $5,000 and homeowners can receive grants of up to $15,000. The grants are available through the Illinois Housing Development Authority.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State attorney general Curtis Hill believes Gov. Eric Holcomb has overstepped his authority in issuing a statewide face mask mandate and that only the Legislature can make violations a criminal offense. Hill issued an advisory opinion Wednesday night, just hours after Holcomb announced the mask order taking effect Monday to help slow the coronavirus spread. Hill’s opinion responded to a request from state Senate majority leader Mark Messmer of Jasper and four other Republican senators about Holcomb’s legal authority to impose a mask mandate. The opinion, which does not block the governor’s action, said the state’s emergency law doesn’t give Holcomb authority for the mask mandate without the consent of the Legislature. Hill said the governor should call the Legislature back into session. “By this point in the pandemic – more than four months since the emergency declaration – it’s time to show some deference to the branch of government actually charged by our state constitution with the responsibility for enacting laws,” Hill said in a statement. The governor’s office didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Thursday. Hill is on his way out of office after failing to win the Republican nomination for reelection earlier this month. Holcomb opposed Hill’s bid and had called for him to resign over allegations that he drunkenly groped a state lawmaker and three other women during a party.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The first confirmed coronavirus outbreak at an Iowa meatpacking plant was far more severe than previously known, with more than twice as many workers becoming infected than the state Department of Public Health told the public, newly released records showed. The department announced at a May 5 news conference that 221 employees at the Tyson Foods pork processing plant in Columbus Junction had tested positive for COVID-19. But days earlier, Tyson officials told Iowa workplace safety regulators during an inspection that 522 plant employees had been infected to their knowledge, documents obtained through the open records law showed. A dozen of the plant’s roughly 1,300 workers were believed to have been hospitalized by then, and two died after contracting the virus, Tyson officials told the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The discrepancy adds to mounting questions that the state health department faces about its handling of public information during the pandemic. The department last week forced out its longtime spokeswoman, who said she was ousted for pushing hard to fulfill media requests and that the agency’s delays and scripted talking points were embarrassing. On May 5, Sarah Reisetter, the health department’s deputy director, said the Tyson plants in Columbus Junction, Perry and Waterloo and two other workplaces had confirmed outbreaks. Reisetter said the Waterloo plant had 444 positive cases, but county officials said days later it actually had more than 1,000. As for Columbus Junction, department spokeswoman Amy McCoy said the 221 case figure announced by Reisetter reflected the results of the department’s testing and what it “could verify from our data systems” at the time.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas schools will be allowed to reopen in mid-August after Republican officials on Wednesday again thwarted a plan from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly aimed at reversing a resurgence in reported coronavirus cases. The GOP-controlled State Board of Education on Wednesday rejected a proposal from Kelly to delay the restart of K-12 classes for three weeks until after Labor Day. Decisions on when school buildings reopen will be left to the state’s 286 local elected boards. Republican officials and conservatives outside state government have argued that it’s inappropriate for Kelly to impose “one size fits all” pandemic measures. Top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature made similar arguments for weeks to pressure Kelly into lifting statewide restrictions on businesses and public gathering, which she did May 26. Kelly said in a statement that its vote “puts our students, faculty, their families and our economy at risk.” The state’s top public health official, Dr. Lee Norman, warned the board that children can be ”very active disease spreaders.” “A school cannot be a safe island in an unsafe community where there is a marked increase in the number of cases,” Norman said. The board’s action prevents Kelly from issuing an executive order setting Sept. 9 as the start of classes for both public schools and private ones that are accredited by the state. The governor already had ordered them to have students and staff wear masks and have them checked daily for fever, and those mandates still stand.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:If Kentucky sees a “sharp uptick” in coronavirus cases, Gov. Andy Beshear said he might close bars and reduce restaurant’s in-person capacity to 25%. Those two steps, part of the White House guidance for worsening states, were recommended after wearing masks, which are mandated in Kentucky and some surrounding states. In previous days, Beshear’s administration has pleaded with people to wear masks as a way to avoid taking those steps that would result in layoffs. “We don’t want to do it,” Beshear said Wednesday. “If we have a surge, we can’t not do what all the national health experts and the vice president personally has suggested.” Beshear on Wednesday announced 518 additional coronavirus cases in Kentucky and a new seven-day rolling positivity rate of 4.92%, up from 4.37% on Tuesday. Thirteen of those new cases are children younger than 5, spread through seven counties.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Because Louisiana’s July bar exam was canceled by the coronavirus pandemic, recent law school graduates can practice law without the exam, the Louisiana Supreme Court said in an order Wednesday. But the court also said the graduates must take extra courses and go through mentoring by the end of 2021 to keep their law licenses. “The additional educational and mentoring requirements … will serve as guardrails to ensure the competency and integrity of the newly-admitted attorneys during their first year of practice,” the court said in a news release. Chief Justice Bernette Johnson wrote the order and said the action was “not only warranted, but necessary during this public health crisis.” Three of the seven justices dissented, two of them describing the change as a giveaway to more than 500 people who have earned law degrees since the start of December. The state Supreme Court estimated that 441 would qualify, deputy administrator Robert Gunn said in an email. “Gifting a license to practice law is wrong,” wrote Justice William J. Crain. He said only three other states – Washington, Oregon and Utah – have waived the bar exam because of the pandemic. The bar exam was waived in 1953 because of the Korean War, according to the court’s news release.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: Bates College is considering putting up students in local hotels as it tries to figure out where to safely house them during the coronavirus pandemic. The college told students recently it is “working quickly to add to our existing housing resources” to ensure everyone has a place to stay. “We need to make sure we can house our new and returning students,” spokeswoman Mary Pols told the Sun Journal. The college also needs extra beds for students who might fall ill. Adding to the difficulty: It’s unclear how many of its 1,800 students are going to show up at its campus starting in about a month.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Anyone over the age of 2 in Baltimore will be required to wear a face covering in public starting Friday, the same day that indoor dining will be suspended again to stop a recent spike in coronavirus cases. City officials announced the measures are scheduled to go into effect at 5 p.m. and will last at least two weeks. The city’s health department will monitor case counts, deaths and other metrics to determine whether to extend the measures beyond that period. “These decisions were not easy, but are rooted in current data and trends we’re seeing in COVID-19 cases in Baltimore City,” Dr. Letitia Dzirasa, the city’s health commissioner, said in a statement Wednesday. “When considered together, this information warrants the implementation of restrictions to help halt the further spread of COVID-19.” Bars and restaurants will be allowed to continue to offer outdoor, takeout and delivery services. During a news conference to announce the changes, Dzirasa said the mask requirement applies to situations in which people cannot social distance, but not to activities like dog walking or where individuals “are not around people.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Landlords have filed a legal challenge to the state’s moratorium on evictions during the coronavirus pandemic. Landlords in a federal lawsuit filed this month argued the pause on evictions that was extended by Gov. Charlie Baker this week through mid-October, is unconstitutional, Richard Vetstein, an attorney for property owners, told the Boston Herald on Wednesday. The defendants are the state and the state Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development. The moratorium violates the constitutional right to petition the judiciary; the right of free speech under the First Amendment; the right to just compensation for an unlawful taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment; and is an unconstitutional impairment of their leases, Vetstein said. Vetstein represents a nurse who is owed $20,000 in back rent. “She’s a blue-collar nurse, and is in serious financial difficulty because of this,” Vetstein said. “When a tenant can’t pay, that burden flows down to the landlords.” The state said it does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Lawmakers began approving a plan Wednesday to address a $2.2 billion state budget hole caused by the coronavirus pandemic, relying on a mix of federal funding, the state’s cash reserves and budget cuts. Legislators meeting for a joint session of the House and Senate appropriations committees approved drawing $350 million from the state’s $1.2 billion “rainy day” fund, the second time the state has done so in 15 years. The panel also signed off on an executive order from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cutting nearly $667 million that includes reduced funding to state agencies and a hiring freeze. The bipartisan committees deemed the move an effective solution to address the shortfall caused by shutdowns related to the coronavirus outbreak. The vote was 15-1. “This has been very intense, especially I think, over the last two to three weeks time,” said Midland Republican Jim Stamas, Senate Appropriations Committee chairman. “I think we found a way to come together to find a solution.” Whitmer, a Democrat, and Republican legislative leaders announced an outline of the plan earlier in the summer. It also relies heavily on federal funding, using what’s left from the $3 billion Michigan got from the federal coronavirus relief law.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul:Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday he is mandating Minnesotans wear face masks to help stem the spread of the coronavirus following a recent rise in cases statewide. At a news conference that included state officials, business owners and infectious disease experts, the Democratic governor cited support from businesses and health care experts, along with a recent rise in the positive infection rate, for the mandate. Walz said a 90% to 95% compliance rate on the mask order can dramatically reduce the infection rate and slow the spread of the virus statewide. “This is the way – the cheapest and most effective way – for us to open up our businesses, for us to get our kids back in school, for us to keep our grandparents healthy and for us to get back that life that we all miss so much,” Walz said. The executive order – which goes into effect on Saturday – requires masks be worn in businesses, public buildings and other indoor spaces where people gather, but allows room for cities to adopt tougher requirements. Children 5 and under are exempt from the order, along with individuals with a medical condition, a mental health condition or disability. Businesses must post signs to inform customers of the mask requirement and make sure they comply. Violations of the mandate are a petty misdemeanor that comes with a fine of up to $100 for individuals, and a fine of up to $1,000 or up to 90 days in jail for businesses.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State leaders continued to express concern Wednesday over the impact that rapidly increasing cases of coronavirus and hospitalizations will have on the state’s health care system. The Mississippi State Department of Health reported that 490 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 on June 27, followed by 602 on July 1. On Wednesday, 942 people were hospitalized with the virus. “That is a 55% increase in patients in the month of July,” Gov. Tate Reeves said at a media briefing. “We’ve added over 340 patients in less than three weeks, in less than 20 days.” Reeves and State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs have repeatedly warned in recent days that hospitals in Mississippi are running out of beds. In the past week, the state’s top hospitals have had from zero to only a handful of beds available for urgent patients. At Wednesday’s briefing, Reeves once again implored Mississippians to wear masks. He referred to President Donald Trump tweeting Monday that wearing a mask is patriotic. “If you love the president, join him, be patriotic and wear a mask,” Reeves said. “If you don’t like the president, then just wear a mask to spite him.”\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson:The city will be testing its wastewater to help monitor trends of new COVID-19 outbreaks as part of a statewide program, according to city officials. The city’s utilities department agreed to participate in the program in the hope it could provide an early warning sign, according to a news release from the city. “Not only is participating in this program cost-effective since the samples will be taken in conjunction with our normal sampling process but it will also provide important data to state officials that has the potential to protect the health and well-being of our community,” said Mike Ray, Branson utilities director, in the release. Branson plans to conduct this monitoring for at least a year. This venture is funded through a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and monitored by the Department of Health and Senior Services, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the University of Missouri in Columbia. “Raw wastewater samples are collected by communities across the state, including Branson, and then are submitted via courier to the University of Missouri,” the news release stated. “There, a team of scientists conducts a molecular analysis that looks for genetic markers of the virus.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has agreements to expand surveillance testing for COVID-19 a week after Gov. Steve Bullock said such testing would have to be put on hold because of a backlog at an out-of-state lab the state was using. “Surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals is a powerful tool in helping slow the spread of the virus in our Montana communities,” Bullock said in a statement Wednesday. A lab at Montana State University will be able to process 500 tests per day, starting as early as next week, he said. “Montana State University has been an enthusiastic partner in helping find a Montana solution to our testing capacity and I am incredibly grateful for their partnership as we work together to protect the health of Montanans,” Bullock said in a statement. The Department of Public Health and Human Services will determine what Montana populations need to be tested and will ship the samples to the lab at MSU for processing, the governor’s office said. Health officials have said nationwide delays in processing tests over the past several weeks have hurt their ability to trace the contacts of those who have tested positive for the respiratory virus, risking further spread.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state health department’s online coronavirus tracker on Wednesday showed more than 600 new cases of the virus since the beginning of the week, including 264 cases on Monday and 343 on Tuesday. The state’s total stood at 23,190 by Wednesday. The site also shows nine COVID-19 deaths so far this week, bringing the state’s total to 310 since the outbreak began. The increases come as at least one Omaha-area health system reported a testing policy change in the face of testing supply shortages. CHI Health announced Tuesday it would suspend its policy of testing patients for the virus ahead of elective procedures. The system said Abbott Laboratories, which manufactures the supplies CHI Health uses for coronavirus testing, can’t meet current demand for the supplies and informed CHI that it would limit shipment of those supplies over then next four to five weeks. “By suspending preprocedural tests, we are able to preserve tests for people experiencing symptoms in the communities we serve,” CHI Health said in a news release. CHI Health centers will continue to perform elective surgeries, despite the suspension in preprocedure testing.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: As Congress negotiates a second coronavirus aid package, every local government in Nevada besides Clark County and Las Vegas is waiting for relief money the state received from the U.S. government. The delay has stymied local response efforts amid rising virus cases, officials said. The relief package passed in March sent $150 billion to state and local governments. It disbursed funds directly to cities and counties with more than 500,000 residents and asked states to distribute funds to smaller jurisdictions. Gov. Steve Sisolak said June 11 that $149 million of Nevada’s $1.25 billion in coronavirus rescue money would go to smaller cities and counties on a per capita basis. But local officials awaiting the funds said the pass-through mechanism has delayed the delivery of relief dollars and hampered their ability to help small businesses, purchase medical supplies and provide services as staff transitions to remote work. Last week, the governor sent paperwork outlining that, once disbursed, half the funds must be spent before Sept. 1 and all by Dec. 31. Cities and counties will be paid after the Governor’s Finance Office processes eligibility paperwork, Sisolak’s spokeswoman Meghin Delaney said Wednesday. The federal government sent $295 million of Nevada’s rescue money to Clark County and $119 million to Las Vegas. Under Sisolak’s formula, which treats cities and counties the same, Eureka County will receive $371,000, Washoe County will receive $20 million and the city of Reno will get $47 million. Delays have set the stage for similar quarrels between state and local officials across the U.S. for months, including in Arizona and Idaho.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Providing more coronavirus-related data on race and ethnicity and promoting testing awareness among high-risk populations, especially people of color, are among the recommendations of a group working on strategies to address disproportionate impacts of the pandemic in New Hampshire. The Governor’s COVID-19 Equity Response Team, established in May, released its first report Wednesday. It recommended that data should be included that can be used by service providers and community members to understand the impact to their specific communities. The report also recommended that data should include indicators of quality and spread of contact tracing in affected communities; testing ability in those communities; and data arranged by race in ethnicity in those categories. It also recommended mandating mask use in “high-infection rate areas and high-risk situations or environments.” Other recommendations are grouped under categories such as organizational cultural effectiveness; equitable data practices; and increasing knowledge about communities at risk for experiencing disparities.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:More than 245,000 cloth masks are being donated to NJ Transit from a federal agency to help out commuters who forget or lose their mask at certain stations. About 10 million masks from the Federal Transit Administration have been distributed to 458 transit agencies and Amtrak since June, according to a NJ Transit press release announcing the donation. “Last week, and continuing through the end of this week, NJ TRANSIT Customer Service Ambassadors began distributing masks at numerous stations. Customers were provided with the FTA-donated cloth masks if they needed a face covering,” the release said. “Major terminals will maintain a limited supply of masks at customer service offices in the event customers forget or lose their masks.” Transit agencies across the country are working to implement new rules for public transportation so people can safely return to trains, buses and light rail. Customers are encouraged to spread out as much as possible, UV light technology for disinfecting is being experimented with on vehicles, enhanced cleaning procedures are still in place, and riders are required to wear masks. Following suit with other transit agencies in the region, the 50% capacity cap on riders in each vehicle has been lifted for NJ Transit and private carriers that operate in the state. The agency also resumed its normal schedule to accommodate social distancing as ridership slowly returns.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials with major health care providers in Albuquerque said they are having to temporarily stop COVID-19 testing for people who are asymptomatic as the number of confirmed cases in the state rise. An unanticipated disruption in testing supplies has forced University of New Mexico Hospital, Presbyterian and Lovelace health system locations to limit testing to only people who show symptoms. Presbyterian also will continue testing for those who have been exposed to someone with a confirmed infection. Statewide, New Mexico has been ramping up testing over recent weeks, building up the capacity to test several thousand people a day. Nearly 490,000 tests have been done since the pandemic began. The health care systems in Albuquerque are telling people without symptoms or known exposure, as well as workers looking for clearance by their employers, to check the New Mexico Department of Health website for alternative testing locations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city has reached its goal of performing 50,000 coronavirus tests a day, and its contact tracing effort has potentially prevented thousands of new infections, officials said Thursday. Mayor Bill de Blasio said four new clinics operated by the urgent care company MedRite will bring the total citywide daily testing capacity to 50,000. “This is the number we’ve been wanting to get to for quite a while. We will now have that capacity,” he said. Dr. Ted Long, the head of the city’s contact tracing effort, said the median wait for test results citywide is now two days, down from more than double that a week ago, but he acknowledged that waits at some testing sites have been much longer. Long said the city’s contact tracers have identified more than 17,000 contacts of people who tested positive and have instructed those who were experiencing symptoms of the virus to isolate at home, an effort that he estimated might have prevented thousands of new cases. Some models suggest that each person who is infected with the coronavirus can infect an average of 2.5 other people, Long said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Officials in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County and a handful of other towns are restricting alcohol sales after 11 p.m. to help fight the spread of the coronavirus. The Charlotte Observer reported that the ban started Thursday night. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department leaders have said they will enforce the order. Other towns that said they will enact such an order include Davidson, Matthews, Mint Hill and Pineville. Mecklenburg County Manager Dena Diorio said officials are enacting the restrictions after seeing videos of people in restaurants and bars not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. “It is unfortunate that we must take these steps due to the poor decisions by some bad actors,” Diorio said during a news conference. “We hope that by taking this step, we can begin to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.” The order is set to run until Aug. 7. But it could be rescinded earlier or extended past that date. Restaurants that don’t sell alcohol can still operate under their normal hours assuming they follow social distancing and mask requirements.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state plans increased statewide testing for the coronavirus in the days leading up the reopening of the state’s 11 colleges and universities this fall, officials said Wednesday. North Dakota University System Chancellor Mark Hagerott said he was optimistic face-to-face and online classes could resume on the planned Aug. 24 school start. “We’re confident we can move forward in about a month,” Hagerott said during Gov. Doug Burgum’s weekly COVID-19 briefing. Hagerott’s comments came as the number of deaths in the state approached triple-digits and the number new cases and hospitalizations was the highest since the pandemic began. The state Board of Higher Education has scheduled a meeting Thursday to discuss new testing policies and other precautions, such as requiring masks, Hagerott said. “The strategy is still unfolding,” he said. Joshua Wynne, the state’s chief health strategist recently appointed by Burgum, said students will be returning to classes from well beyond North Dakota’s boarders. He asked that students participate in the testing that he called a “relatively easy process.” University system spokeswoman Billie Jo Lorius said in an interview that all colleges and universities already have indicated they would reopen this fall, with precautions.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The Ohio Bar Examination is being delayed until Oct. 5-6 when the test will be administered online, the Ohio Supreme Court said. The court is making the allowance for the exam to be done remotely by computer for the first time because of the coronavirus crisis. “The safety of the exam takers and the staff who administer the exam is our top priority, and that’s why the court felt compelled to make this change,” Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor said. Originally, the bar exam was scheduled for July 28-29 but the court in May, citing the COVID-19 crisis, decided to postpone administration of the test to Sept. 9-10. Now the court is allowing the test to be taken online. The high court in May also took the unusual step of allowing recent law school graduates to obtain a temporary license to practice law in Ohio until the applicant got their results from the September bar examination. O’Connor said the court recognized the need for law school graduates to start work and the significant economic hardship that the bar exam delay would impose. The temporary license has been now extended until the applicant receives the results from the Oct. 5-6 test. Those with temporary licenses can: enter appearances, draft legal documents and pleadings, provide legal services to clients and provide other counsel consistent with the practice of law in Ohio. Those with a temporary license have to be supervised by a person with a law license. The court also is allowing a temporary license holder who is practicing law the option of taking the bar examination in February 2021 and extending their temporary license privilege until results are received then. For those who pass the bar exam in October, the planned date for the next swearing-in ceremony for new attorneys is tentatively scheduled for Dec. 14.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The governing body for high school activities in Oklahoma plans for sports, including football, to start on time in the fall while the organization is prepared to adjust as it navigates the coronavirus pandemic, it’s director said Thursday. “Our plan is to move forward as scheduled with those activities, knowing that before we start competitions, there may have to be a delay, or if we do get started, there can and probably likely will be interruptions where we have to stop for a while and start again.” said Oklahoma Secondary Schools Association executive director David Jackson. Jackson said in a worst-case scenario, all sports would be played in the spring and extend into late June. In that case with the OSSAA trying to stagger the schedule so multisport athletes could still play more than one sport. Jackson the OSSAA will provide schools with health guidelines, but local districts will create protocols for dealing with positive virus test results and decide whether or not to allow fans at their events. He said he hopes to have fans for state competition, when the OSSAA takes over control of events.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown said she is expanding the state’s COVID-19 mask order to also apply to children 5 years and older and that she is decreasing the capacity of indoor venues from 250 people to 100. The governor said these new mandates, which go into effect Friday, are necessary to help slow the increasing spread of the coronavirus. On Tuesday, the total number of confirmed and presumptive virus cases in the state topped 15,000. “When we see the numbers rise, we must respond,” Brown said. Currently anyone who is 12 years or older must wear masks inside public spaces and in outdoor areas where they cannot maintain 6 feet of physical distancing. The mandate will now apply to anyone 5 years or older. “These younger children can be infected by COVID-19. These younger children live with families,” Oregon State Health Authority Epidemiologist Dean Sidelinger said. In conjunction with the mask expansion, Oregon’s Department of Education announced that school students will be required to wear face coverings during in-person instruction if they return to the classroom in the fall. The department will distribute 5 million face coverings to school districts for students and employees to wear to help with the new requirement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Every region of Pennsylvania has seen an increase in the rate of positive coronavirus cases and failing to stop that could jeopardize the reopening of schools for the fall semester, the state’s top health official said Thursday. In addition, Health Secretary Rachel Levine said the majority of counties have seen increases in the number of new cases. “It’s critical to drive down the case counts now in terms of the rise of new cases in order to prepare for schools to reopen,” Levine said during a news conference Thursday. “If we don’t do that now, that would put that in jeopardy.” In response to the rise in new cases, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration last week imposed a new round of restrictions targeting bars, restaurants, nightclubs and indoor gatherings to slow the virus’ spread. In July, Pennsylvania’s 14-day rate of new cases per 100,000 residents has risen by more than 50%, from below 60 to 90. The seven-day positivity rate – based on the Health Department’s daily public disclosures of the number of people who are newly confirmed to be positive and the number of people who tested negative – has gradually increased in July, from about 4.5% to 5.8%. Deaths have declined in July, although hospitalizations are on the rise across the state, according to state data.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: More than 1,000 people have died of coronavirus-related illness in Rhode Island, the state Department of Health said. The agency reported four new fatalities, bringing the statewide coronavirus death toll since the pandemic began earlier this year to 1,001. In response, Gov. Gina Raimondo ordered state flags at all state agencies and buildings to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims. “This pandemic has taken a terrible toll on our state, and my heart breaks for the thousands of Rhode Islanders who have lost someone to this virus,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “We must continue to do everything we can in their memory to protect our neighbors, friends, and family from COVID-19.” The flags will stay at half-staff until sunset on Sunday. In addition, the State House will be illuminated through Sunday in red, white and blue to honor all Americans who have lost their lives during the pandemic, she said. The state also reported more than 75 new confirmed cases of the disease Thursday, for a total of more than 18,100 known cases since the pandemic began. The new confirmed cases were out of more than 3,500 tests administered, for a positive rate of about 2.1%. The number of people in the hospital with the coronavirus was at nearly 70 as of Tuesday, the latest day for which the information was available, roughly the same as the previous three days. Seven of the patients were in intensive care.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State and local education officials are still trying to determine how to return students to school in several weeks – whether in person or online – as COVID-19 cases spike across the state. Clemson University announced Wednesday that all students will start classes virtually on Aug. 19, with in-person classroom learning delayed until Sept. 17. And for younger students, education officials promised the new school year in public schools would be nothing like what happened in March, when the virus caused the sudden closings of buildings as teachers and administrators scrambled to implement online learning in days. Attendance will be taken every day and there will be academic standards just like a typical school year, state Education Superintendent Molly Spearman told a small group of House members Wednesday. “The expectations will be much higher – that students must be engaged every day,” Spearman said. There has been no summer vacation for Spearman and local school administrators across the state as they try to revamp decades of education norms, such as classes of 20 or 30 students, buses full of children and even recess. Meanwhile, COVID-19 cases continue to climb. For more than a month, South Carolina has been in the top four states for newly diagnosed cases adjusted by population.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem met with senior members of President Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday in Washington. The Republican governor discussed the response to the coronavirus pandemic in meetings with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Health Alex Azar. The governor’s spokesman Ian Fury said Noem discussed with Azar how a vaccine for COVID-19 could be distributed. Pence tweeted after their meeting, ”I ensured her that we will make sure South Dakota has whatever it needs to protect the health and safety of its people.” Fury said that Noem planned to meet with several other members of the president’s team during her trip, but a meeting with Trump was not scheduled. Noem has seen her national profile rise among conservatives as she took a hands-off approach to the pandemic, avoiding orders for lockdowns or business closures. The governor’s pursuit of a national spotlight has led to speculation that she has political ambitions beyond South Dakota, but she has said she is content to remain in her home state.\n\nTennessee\n\nBristol: Coronavirus cases at an East Tennessee nursing home have nearly doubled in less than a week, officials said. The Christian Care Center in Bristol reported 92 cases on Wednesday, up from 51 cases on Friday, Director Jennifer Skaggs said in a statement, the Bristol Herald Courier reported. The cases include 66 residents and 26 employees, she said. There are 120 residents at the home, according to the Tennessee Department of Health, meaning that more than half have tested positive. Three residents who tested positive for COVID-19 have died, five are hospitalized, 23 have recovered and 35 are in isolation, Skaggs said. Half of the workers who tested positive have recovered and half are still-isolating, she said. Sullivan County Regional Health Department Director Stephen May said the nursing home has been working diligently with health officials to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Although some big cities in Texas are reporting signs that an alarming surge in cases of the coronavirus might be leveling off, officials in counties along the border with Mexico said the outlook there remains bleak. Dallas County officials said the number of hospitalized coronavirus patients dropped below 1,000 on Tuesday for the first time in more than two weeks, and officials in Houston are seeing signs of optimism. But along the border in Starr County, Judge Eloy Vera said “we’re very close to losing the situation” and plans to issue voluntary stay-at-home recommendations this week. He said it would be similar to one issued Monday in Hidalgo County, which set a curfew and recommended that all nonessential businesses cease any activity that can’t be provided at curbside or by takeout. The orders, however, are not enforceable under Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s past mandates that do not allow local officials to set their own stay-at-home restrictions. Meanwhile, Texas is pressing ahead with plans for high school football this fall. The University Interscholastic League, which governs high school sports in Texas, released guidelines that push back the start of the football season for the largest schools into late September. Attendance will be limited and masks will be required.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah is among the many U.S. states fighting a surge in coronavirus cases, but officials said Wednesday the Salt Lake City area is bucking the trend after the county issued a mandate a month ago for people to wear masks. There’s no statewide mask order in Republican-led Utah, and face coverings remain contentious, as seen at a recent public meeting that was abruptly ended when dozens of people without masks packed the room. After Gov. Gary Herbert allowed Democratic leaders in Salt Lake County to impose their own mask rule, the county’s share of cases in the state steadily declined despite its denser population. “Today we’re sharing data that indicates that face coverings and other interventions implemented by Salt Lake County are having a positive impact,” county Mayor Jenny Wilson said. “These actions are saving lives, protecting health and stabilizing the spread of COVID-19 cases.” Based on data in Salt Lake County, Wilson called on the governor to order a statewide mask requirement. The number of new cases reported daily in Salt Lake County is nearly down to levels seen in June. However, case numbers in the state as a whole have doubled in the same time frame.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The last of the remaining foreign ski workers who have been stranded at Vermont’s Jay Peak resort during the coronavirus pandemic were on their way home to Peru on Thursday, officials said. “We are all very grateful that they will all be with their families soon,” said Melissa Sheffer, the resort’s director of rooms and community engagement, of the college students who work seasonally at the resort. Jay Peak has been providing them food, free accommodations, trips to the store, health checks, hiking trips, and a canoe outing, she said. The resort took the five employees to Boston on Wednesday and they flew to Miami and got on a plan to Lima on Thursday morning, Sheffer said. A sixth extended her visa and moved in with friends in the area, she said. U.S. ski areas employ about 7,500 J1 visa holders each year, according to the U.S. Ski Areas Association. Many had planned to fly home in March, but when the pandemic closed Peru’s borders, some were stranded.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Norfolk International Airport said its passenger numbers for June dropped by more than 75% compared the same time a year ago. The Virginian-Pilot reported Wednesday that only about 94,000 people flew out of Norfolk that month because of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, the number was 385,000. The drop in June is actually not as bad as it was in May, when traffic was down 87%. In April, passenger numbers fell by 94%. The drop in passenger travel was even higher at Richmond’s airport for those months. Meanwhile, Virginia has been added to the list of states from which travelers must quarantine after arriving in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools Superintendent Denise Juneau has decided against having students return to the classroom in the new year school, saying the prospect of in-person learning is impossible amid rising coronavirus infection rates. Juneau said Wednesday that she’s recommending a fully remote learning model when school resumes in the fall. The school board is expected to vote on how to proceed during the pandemic at its next regularly scheduled meeting on Aug. 12. “The current trajectory of infection in King County and the most recent data and information from public health makes it clear that resuming school in-person this fall is impossible,” Juneau said in a news release. Juneau’s latest recommendation has been endorsed by the principals labor union and the teachers union. The district is also at the bargaining table with the Seattle Education Association for a new teachers contract.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice was encouraged Wednesday by what he initially thought was a recent drop in confirmed statewide cases of the coronavirus. But the cautious optimism was short-lived. The number of positive cases in the state has doubled in the past month. Twice this month, the daily confirmed cases in the rural state surpassed 170. So Justice had reason for hope when he announced an increase of just 30 positive cases Tuesday.“I always am a believer that one robin doesn’t make spring,” Justice said at a news conference. “This is more like one robin right now. We’ll go and we’ll watch these numbers for a few more days.” But state health statistics released after the governor spoke proved there’s a lot of work left to do. Tuesday’s figure was revised upward later to 141, and the three-day total so far this week of 324 confirmed cases meant the virus scare isn’t slowing down. Wednesday’s number of active confirmed cases, 1,594, was the highest since the pandemic began. Justice said there are virus outbreaks involving churches in at least eight counties: Boone, Grant, Logan, Mason Kanawha, Raleigh, Taylor and Wood. The governor on July 6 issued an executive order mandating face coverings when people are inside buildings, although he has declined to impose a penalty for noncompliance.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The body that oversees Wisconsin high school sports recommended Thursday that schools offer fall sports but delay start dates by several weeks as the coronavirus surges across the state. The Wisconsin Interscholastic Association Board of Control voted 8-3 to approve pushing back the start date for girls golf, tennis and swimming to Aug. 17. Girls and boys cross-country also will start on that date. Sports that create a higher risk of virus transmission and infection, including football, volleyball and soccer, will start the week of Sept. 7. Whether the WIAA will offer any postseason state championship tournaments remains unclear. Board members said they just want to get the fall seasons started. The board also ordered WIAA staff to start putting together a plan that would allow schools that opt out of fall competition to offer those sports in the spring. Teams that begin playing in the fall but have to stop because of infections or other reasons could resume their seasons in the spring.\n\nWyoming\n\nRawlins: Testing of inmates, staff and health care workers at Wyoming’s maximum-security prison has detected at least 10 cases of the coronavirus, corrections officials said Wednesday. Wyoming was among just a couple of states with no known coronavirus infections among inmates. Testing to date has revealed three inmates, one staff member and six health care workers with the virus. As of Wednesday, 876 inmates and workers at the Wyoming State Penitentiary had been tested. Full results were pending. The tests were part of a plan to screen all Wyoming inmates over the weeks ahead. A case of coronavirus in a contract health care worker last week prompted the department to begin testing at the Wyoming State Penitentiary a couple weeks earlier than planned. The prison was locked down because of the positive results and contact tracing was being done.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/24"}]}

These changes are based on the cost of living, or the amount of money needed to support a basic standard of living.\n\nIn October, SNAP benefits increased 12.5% compared to the previous year, according to Forbes Advisor. Eligibility requirements are also set to change, following the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) signed by President Joe Biden in June.\n\nHere's what you need to know about changes to SNAP:\n\nChanges to eligibility by age\n\nAble-bodied adults without dependents between ages 51 and 52 must prove they are actively working, training or in school in order to qualify for SNAP benefits this year.

He spoke to the crowd gathered in the United Center for just under an hour.\n\nThe convention will last through Thursday and will feature many more headlining speakers like Barack and Michelle Obama, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, former President Bill Clinton and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Everything will conclude with remarks from Vice President Kamala Harris, who will officially accept her nomination for president.\n\nBiden's time on the stage was preceded by a passionate speech from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, remarks from Hillary Clinton and first lady Jill Biden and an appearance from Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden's daughter Ashley Biden introduced him to the stage, saying he was \"the OG girl dad\" and calling on Americans to \"Work harder than you have ever worked before in your life\" this election season.\n\nRead the entire speech from Biden here.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden remarks DNC night one:\n\nThat was my daughter!\n\nThank you.\n\nI love you.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n[Crowd cheers “Thank you, Joe”]\n\nI tell you what, to my dearest daughter Ashley. God, love you. You’re incredible. Thank you for the introduction and for being my courageous heart, along with Hunter and our entire family, and especially our rock, Jill. It was those of you who know us, she still leaves me both breathless and speechless. Everybody knows her, I love her more than she loves me. She walks down the stairs, and I still get that going boom, boom, boom. You all who know me, know I’m not kidding.\n\nLet’s give a special round of applause to our first lady Jill Biden.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression, for real, he’d say “Joey, family is the beginning, the middle and the end.”\n\nAnd I love you all, folks. And America, I love you!\n\nFolks, let me ask you.\n\n[Crowd cheers “We love Joe”]\n\nLet me ask you. Are you ready to vote for freedom?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nAre you ready to vote for democracy and for America?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nLet me ask you. Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?\n\n[Crowd: “Yes!”]\n\nAs president and vice president of the United States.\n\nMy fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, nearly four years ago, in winter, on the steps of the Capitol, on a cold January day I raised my right hand, and I swore on oath to you and to god to preserve, protect and defend the constitution and to faithfully execute the office of the president of the United States. In front of me, in front of me, was a city surrounded by the national guard, behind me a capitol just two weeks before had been overrun by a violent mob.\n\nBut I knew then, from the bottom of my heart, that I knew now, there is no place in America for political violence. None. You cannot say you love your country only when you win. In that moment, I wasn’t looking to the past, I was looking to the future.\n\nI spoke to the work at hand. The moment we had to meet, it was, as I told you then, a winter of peril and possibility. Of peril and possibility.\n\nWe were in the grip of a once-in-a-century pandemic, historic joblessness, a call for racial justice long overdue, clear and present threats to our very democracy.\n\n[Crowd cheers “We love Joe”]\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd yet, and yet I believed then, and I believe now, that progress was and is possible just as it is achievable. And our best days are not behind us, they’re before us. Now it’s summer, the winter has passed. And with a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed. Democracy, democracy has delivered. And now, democracy must be preserved.\n\nYou’ve heard me say it before, we’re facing an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole; I mean it literally.\n\nWe're in the battle for the very soul of America.\n\nI ran for president in 2020 because of what I saw at Charlottesville in August of 2017. Extremists coming out of the woods, carrying torches, their veins bulging from their necks, carrying Nazi swastikas and chanting the same exact antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the early thirties.\n\nNeo-Nazis, white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, so emboldened by a president then in the White House that they saw as an ally. They didn’t even bother to wear their hoods. Hate was on the march in America.\n\nOld ghosts, and new garments, stirring up the oldest divisions, stoking the oldest fears, giving oxygen to the oldest forces that they long sought to tear apart America.\n\nIn the process, a young woman was killed. When I contacted her mother to ask about what happened, she told me. When the president was asked what he thought had happened. Donald Trump said, and I quote, “There were very fine people on both sides.” My god. That’s what he said. That is what he said and what he meant.\n\nThats’s when I realized I had to listen to the admonition of my dead son. I could not stay on the sidelines, so I ran.\n\nI had no intention of running again. I just lost part of my soul, but I ran with a deep conviction. An America I know and believe, and an America where honesty, dignity, decency still matter. An America where everyone has a fair shot, and hate has no safe harbor. An America where the fundamental creed of this nation that all of us are created equal is still very much alive.\n\nAnd a broad coalition of Americans joined with me. 81 million voters voted for us. More than any time in all of history.\n\nBecause of all of you in this room and others, we came together in 2020 to save democracy. As your president, I been determined to keep America moving forward, not going back, to stand against hate and violence in all its forms, to be a nation where we not only live with but thrive on diversity, demonizing no one, leaving no one behind, and becoming the nation that we professed to be.\n\nI also ran to rebuild the backbone of America – the middle class. I made a commitment to you that I’d be a president for all America, whether you voted for me or not.\n\nWe have done that. Studies show the major bills we have passed actually delivered more to red states than blue, because the job of the president is to deliver to all America.\n\nBecause of you, I’m not exaggerating, because of you, we’ve had one of the most extraordinary four years of progress ever. Period.\n\nWhen I say we, I mean Kamala and me.\n\nJust think about it. COVID no longer controls our lives. We’ve gone from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the entire world.\n\nRecord 60 million new jobs, record small business growth, record high stock market, record high 401Ks. Wages up, inflation down, way down, and continuing to go down. The smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years and yes, we both know we have more to do, but we’re moving in the right direction.\n\nMore Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history. And after, as a young senator beginning to fight, we got in a fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate low-prescription drug prices, we finally beat big pharma.\n\nAnd guess who cast the tie breaking vote? Vice President, soon to be President, Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of land. Instead of paying $400 a month for insulin seniors with diabetes, will pay $35 a month. The law we passed, already includes, starting in January, every seniors’ total prescription cost can be capped at $2,000, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.\n\nAnd what we don’t focus on, and our Republican friends doesn't seem to understand, our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money.\n\nYou know what we just passed saved? It saved $160 billion dollars over the next decade.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole. It’s because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices ... to the big pharma.\n\nBut look, folks. Thank you, Kamala, too. Look.\n\nFolks, how can we have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world?\n\nDonald Trump promised infrastructure week every week for four years, and he never built a damn thing.\n\nBut now because of Kamala and I’ve done, remember we’re told we couldn’t get it done, remember when we came into office, we couldn’t get anything passed?\n\nBut right now, we’re giving America an infrastructure decade, not week.\n\nWe’re modernizing, our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our trains, our buses.\n\nRemoving every lead pipe from schools and homes so every child can drink clean water. Providing affordable high-speed internet for every American no matter where they live. Unlike, not unlike, what Roosevelt did with electricity.\n\nAnd so much more. We are uniting the country. We're growing our economy. We're improving our quality of life and we’re building a better America. Because that’s who we are.\n\nHow can we be the strongest nation in the world, without leading the world in science and technology?\n\nAfter years of importing 90% of our semiconductor chips from abroad, which America invented those chips. Our CHIPS and Science Act meant the private companies from around the world are now investing literally 10’s of billions of dollars to build new chip factories right here in America. And over that period, they’ll create tens of thousands of jobs. And many of those jobs, so-called fabs, the buildings that make those chips, are being constructed now.\n\nAnd guess what? The average salary in those fabs, the size of a football field, will be over $100,000 a year and you don’t need a college degree.\n\nBecause of you and so many electeds out there, American manufacturing is back. Where those to say we wouldn’t lead the world in manufacturing? 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Our Republican friends, and others, made sure they’d go abroad to get the cheapest labor. We used to import products and export jobs, now we export American products and create American jobs. Right here in America, where jobs belong.\n\nWith every new job, with every new factory, pride and hope is being brought back to communities throughout the country that were left behind. You know, you’re from them many of you, you know what it’s like when that factory closed, where your mother, your father, your grandmother, grandfather worked, and now you’re back, providing once again, proving that Wall Street didn’t built America, the middle class built America and unions, unions built the middle class.\n\nIt's been my view since I came to the Senate. That's why I’m proud to have been the first president to walk the picket line and be labeled the most pro-union president in history. And I accept it. It's a fact. Because when unions do well, we all do well.\n\nYou got it man, you got it.\n\nI agree. I’m proud.\n\nLook, remember we were told we couldn’t get anything done. We couldn't get anything done in the Congress. Well with your support, we passed the most significant climate law in the history of mankind.\n\nFor $370 billion dollars, cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030, launching a climate corps, similar to AmeriCorps or Peace Corps creating tens of thousands of jobs for young people in the future who are going to make sure this continues.\n\nCreating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy for American workers including the IBW installing 500,000, 500,000 charging stations all across America.\n\nAnd in the process, reducing carbon emissions, and we’re seeing it, we’re seeing to it that the first beneficiaries environmental issues are those fence lines communities that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution. Louisiana and Delaware, Route nine, all the factories, all those chemical factories are right next to the poorest neighborhoods. They’re the ones we’re going to bring back.\n\nAnd how, how can we be the greatest nation in the world without the best education system in the world?\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican friends, that not only they can't think they can’t read very well. Seriously, think about it.\n\nLook at their Project 2025. Want to do away with the Department of Education.\n\nWell during the pandemic, Kamala helped states and cities get back their get back their schools back open, and we gave public school teachers a raise, we created apprenticeships with businesses in the communities, putting students on path, to a good paying job, whether or not they go to college.\n\nAnd by the way, we’re making college a hell of a lot more affordable. Increasing Pell grants by $900. Over $15 billion dollars for HBCUs, minority service, including Hispanic institutions and tribal colleges.\n\nWe kept our commitment to provide more student relief than ever by lifting the burden of helping millions of families so they could get married, start a family, buy a home and begin to build family wealth and contribute to the community, and grow our economy.\n\nIt's not costing us, it’s creating more wealth.\n\nWe fundamentally transformed how our economy grows. From the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down.\n\nYou know, my dad used to say there wasn’t a whole hell of a lot to drop down on my kitchen table at the end of the month. I come from basic middle-class family: Three-bedroom house, four kids, a grandpop living with us, decent neighborhood, but never a penny to spare. And look, that top-down notion, it never worked. Lota Democrats didn’t think it worked, thought it worked, but it doesn’t.\n\nAnd when we did all that, what we’ve done, everybody could do well. Everybody. Donald Trump calls America a failing nation.\n\n[Crowd boos]\n\nNo, I’m serious. Think about this. Think about this.\n\nHe publicly, he says to the whole world.\n\nI’m going to say something outrageous, I know more foreign leaders by their first names than and know them well than anybody alive just because I’m so damn old.\n\nAnd I’m not joking.\n\nThink of the message he sends around the world, when he talks about America being a failing nation. He says we’re losing. He’s the loser. He’s dead wrong. Many of you are very successful people who travel the world.\n\nName me a country in the world that doesn’t think we’re the leading nation in the world.\n\nWithout America, not a joke, think about it, I’m being literal, who could lead the world other than the United States of America? Well guess what? America’s winning and the world’s better off for it.\n\nAmerica is more prosperous, and Americans are safer today than under Donald Trump.\n\nTrump continues to lie about crime in America, like everything else.\n\nGuess what? On his watch, the murder rate went up 30%, the biggest increase in history. Meanwhile, we made the largest investment, Kamala and I, in public safety, ever. Now, the murder rate is falling faster than any time in history.\n\nViolent crime has dropped to the lowest level in more than 50 years. And crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the oval office instead of a convicted felon.\n\nFolks, distinguished senator from the Senate from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence.\n\nAnd what makes me ashamed when I travel the world, which I do, more children in America are killed by a gunshot than any other cause in the United States. More die from a bullet than cancer, accidents, than anything else in the United States of America. My god. That’s why Kamala and I are proud, we beat the NRA and we passed the first major bipartisan gun-safety law in 30 years.\n\nI'm serious. That comes from here. And now it’s time to ban assault weapons again.\n\n[Crowd cheers]\n\nAnd demand universal background checks. It’s hard, I never thought I’d stand before a crowd of Democrats and refer to a president as a liar so many times. No, I’m not trying to be funny. It’s sad.\n\nTrump continues to lie about the border. Here’s what he won’t tell you. Trump killed the strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States. That we negotiated with the Senate Republicans, took four weeks.\n\nOnce it passed, and everybody acknowledged most expansive border change in history, he called senators to say, “Don’t support the bipartisan bill.” He said, “It would help me politically and hurt him politically.” My god. No, I’m serious. Think about it. Not a joke.\n\nNot trying to be funny, but it's sad that Trump continues to lie about the border. Here’s what he won’t tell you: Trump killed the largest, strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States that we negotiated with Senate Republicans in just four weeks. Once it passed and acknowledged the border change in American history, he called Senators and said, \"Don’t support the bipartisan Senate bill.\" He said it would help me politically and hurt him politically. My God. Seriously, think about it—it’s not a joke. Even ask the press who don’t like me, and they’ll tell you that’s true.\n\nTypically Trump, once again putting himself first and America last. Then I had to take executive action. As a result of the executive action I took, border encounters have dropped over 50%. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office. And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they are \"poisoning the blood of America\" or \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting Dreamers and more.\n\nAnd here’s what else I believe in: protecting your freedom — your freedom to vote, your freedom to love who you love, and your freedom to choose. The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that you heard earlier tonight — the U.S. Supreme Court majority wrote the following: \"Women are not without electoral or political power.\" No kidding. MAGA Republicans found out the power of women in 2022, and Donald Trump is going to find out the power of women in 2024. Watch.\n\nAnd Trump’s MAGA Republican right-wingers seek to erase history. We Democrats continue to write history and make more history. I’m proud. I’m proud to have kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, a symbol for every young woman in America that you can do anything. I’m proud I kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and that taps into the full talent of our nation. The most diverse Cabinet in history, including the first Black woman of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President — and who will soon serve as the 47th President of the United States. She is good.\n\nLook... thank you, Kamala (chanting). Folks, I’ve long said we have many obligations as a nation, but I got in trouble years ago for saying I make no apologies. We have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home — and when they don’t. That’s why I’m so proud to have written and signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever helping veterans and their families exposed to toxic materials like burn pits and Agent Orange.\n\nI was around during the Vietnam War. It’s hard — no one was able to prove that their illness was a consequence of Agent Orange, and no one was able to prove initially that because they lived near burn pits, like my son did in Iraq for a year, that it was the cause of their illness. But because of the PACT Act, a surviving spouse with two children is now eligible for a stipend of about $3,000 a month, and those children who lost a parent are eligible for tuition benefits to go to college and get job training. It’s already helping over 1 million veterans and their families so far. Well, I love them, and I’m so proud of my son’s service. We get it.\n\nGuess who doesn’t get it and doesn’t respect our veterans? We know from his own chief of staff, four-star General John Kelly, that Trump, when in Europe, would not go to the gravesites in France of the brave service members who gave their lives for this country. He called them \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" Who in the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? Those are not the words of a person worthy of being Commander-in-Chief — period. Not then, not now, not ever. I mean that. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Just as no Commander-in-Chief should ever bow down to a dictator the way Trump bows down to Putin.\n\nI never have, and I promise you, Kamala Harris never will. We will never bow down. When Trump left office, Europe and NATO were in tatters. Not a joke. The \"America First\" doctrine changed our whole image in the world. Well, I spent — they gave the hours, about 190 hours total — my counterparts, heads of state in Europe, to strengthen NATO. We did. We united Europe like it hadn’t been united for years, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO. Ten days before he died, Henry Kissinger called and said, \"Not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their shoulder at Russia with dread.\"\n\nWell, guess what? Putin thought he'd take Kyiv in three days. Three years later, Ukraine is still free! When I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. They haven't. No one's saying that now!\n\nWe'll keep working to bring hostages home, end the war in Gaza, and bring peace and security to the Middle East. As you know, I wrote a peace treaty for Gaza. A few days ago, I put forward a proposal that brought us closer to that goal than we've been since October 7th.\n\nWe're working around the clock, my Secretary of State and I, to prevent a wider war, reunite hostages with their families, and surge humanitarian aid, health services, and food assistance into Gaza now. To end the civilian suffering of the Palestinian people, and finally, finally, finally deliver a ceasefire in this war.\n\nThose protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides. Just as we worked around the clock to bring home wrongfully detained Americans and others from Russia, in one of the most complicated swaps in history, but they're home. Kamala and I are going to keep working to bring all Americans wrongfully detained around the world home. I mean it.\n\nFolks, I've got five months left in my presidency. I've got a lot to do. I intend to get it done. It's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your president. I love the job, but I love my country more.\n\nAll those people who said I should step down, that's not true. We love our country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. In 2024, we need you to vote. We need you to keep the Senate. We need you to win back the House of Representatives. We need you to beat Donald Trump.\n\nKamala and Tim, President and Vice President of the United States of America. Look, they'll continue to lead America forward, creating more jobs, standing up for workers, growing the economy, lowering the costs to American families so they just have a little more breathing room. We've made incredible progress with more work to do.\n\nKamala and Tim will continue to take on corporate greed and bring down the cost of insulin to $35 a month, not just for seniors, but for everyone in America. They'll cap prescription drug costs at a total of $2,000, not just for seniors, but for everyone. And folks, that's going to save Americans tens of billions of dollars.\n\nFolks, they'll make housing more affordable, building 3 million new homes, providing $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, more than the $10,000 we approved. Donald Trump wants new taxes on imported goods, food, gas, clothing, and more. You know what that would cost the average family, according to the experts? $3,900 a year in taxes. No, that's just a fact. Kamala and Tim will make the child care tax credit permanent, lifting millions of children out of poverty and helping millions of families get ahead.\n\nAnd you know what Trump did? He created the largest debt any president has in four years with his $2 trillion tax cut for the wealthy. Well, Trump has a new plan. He wants to provide a $5 billion tax cut for corporations that are very wealthy. Read it. It would put us further in debt. And folks, you know we have 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? 8.2%. If we just increase their taxes, as we proposed, to 25%, which isn't even the highest tax rate, it would raise $500 billion new dollars over 10 years. And they'd still be very wealthy. Look, Kamala and Tim are going to make them pay their fair share.\n\nThey'll protect Social Security and Medicare. Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare. Kamala and Tim will protect your freedom. They'll protect your right to vote. They'll protect your civil rights. And you know Trump will do everything he can to ban abortion nationwide. Oh, he will. You know Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can to stop him. And that's why you have to elect senators and representatives who will restore Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe ancient Greeks taught us that character is destiny. Character is destiny. For me and Jill, we know Kamala and Doug are people of character. It's been our honor to serve alongside them. And we know that Tim and Gwen Walz are also people of great character. Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made when I became our nominee. And it was the best decision I made in my whole career.\n\nNow that we've gotten to know each other, we've become close friends. She's tough. She's experienced. And she has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story. And like many of our best presidents, she was also vice president. But she'll be a president our children can look up to. She'll be a president respected by world leaders because she already is. She'll be a president we can all be proud of. And she will be a historic president who puts her stamp on America's future.\n\nThis will be the first presidential election since January 6th. On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country. And that threat, this is not hyperbole, that threat is still very much alive. Donald Trump says he will refuse to accept the election result if he loses again. Think about that. He's promising a bloodbath if he loses, in his words. And that he'll be a dictator on day one, in his own words. By the way, this sucker means it. No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Anybody else said that in the past, you'd think he was crazy, you'd think it was an exaggeration, but he means it. We can't let that happen.\n\nFolks, all of us carry a special obligation: Independents, Republicans, Democrats. We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024. The vote each of us casts this year will determine whether democracy and freedom will prevail. It's that simple. It's that serious. The power is literally in your hands. History is in your hands. Not hyperbole. It's in your hands. America's future is in your hands.\n\nLet me close with this. Nowhere else in the world could a kid with a stutter and modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, grow up to sit behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. That's because America is, and always has been, a nation of possibilities. Possibilities. We must never lose that. Never.\n\nKamala and Tim understand that this nation must continue to be a place of possibilities. Not just for a few of us, but for all of us. Join me in dedicating your whole heart to this effort. And with all my heart, I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz camp have ever seen.\n\nEach of us has our own American story. For me and my family, there's a song that means a lot to us. It captures the best of who we are as a nation. The song is called \"American Anthem.\" There's one verse that stands out, and I can't sing worth a damn, so I'm not going to try. I'll just quote it: \"The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day. What shall our legacy be? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart, when my days are through. America, America, I gave my best to you.\"\n\nI've made a lot of mistakes in my career. But I gave my best to you. For 50 years, like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our nation. And I've been blessed a million times in return for the support of the American people. I really have been too young to be in the Senate because I wasn't 30 yet, and now I'm too old to stay as president. But I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nI can honestly say, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, giving my word as a Biden: I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States Senator. I mean it.\n\nFolks, we just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America! And there's nothing we cannot do when we do it together.\n\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops.\n\nThank you.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/15/delaware-ranked-1st-u-s-foreclosure-rate-data-company-finds/7218522002/", "title": "Delaware ranked 1st in U.S. for foreclosure rate, data company finds", "text": "Delaware had the highest foreclosure rate in the country this year, according to a nationwide realty data analysis.\n\nOne in every 1,705 housing units in Delaware had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2021, according to the report from ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nOf the state's three counties, Kent County saw the highest foreclosure rate at the start of this year, with one in every 1,281 housing units seeing a foreclosure filing. New Castle County saw one in every 1,691 and Sussex County saw one in every 2,094.\n\nWhile the First State ranked first in terms of its foreclosure rate this past quarter, it was 31st in the total number of foreclosure filings, according to the data.\n\nThe state had 254 filings — showing that even a small change in the small state can have a big impact on its ranking. And some state officials questioned the data.\n\nAlso, foreclosure filings were down 74% compared to this time last year when Delaware had 990 filings in the first quarter.\n\nThe state saw 268 filings in the second quarter, 123 in the third quarter and 132 in the fourth quarter, according to ATTOM Data Solutions — all significantly lower than 2019 rates, likely thanks to efforts from the state to prevent foreclosures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNationally, the report said that foreclosures were up 9% in the first quarter compared to the end of last year, but down 78% from a year ago.\n\nIllinois ranked second with foreclosures in one in every 2,175 housing units, and Florida was third with one in every 2,237 housing units.\n\nEVICTED DURING COVID-19:Blind man wrongfully evicted from Wilmington home sues court system, landlord\n\n“The foreclosure moratorium on government-backed loans has virtually stopped foreclosure activity over the past year,” said Rick Sharga, executive vice president of RealtyTrac, an ATTOM Data Solutions company, in a statement.\n\n“But mortgage servicers have been able to begin foreclosing actions on vacant and abandoned properties, which benefits neighborhoods and communities. It’s likely that these foreclosures are causing the slight uptick we’ve seen over the past few months.”\n\nAddressing foreclosures in Delaware\n\nThe Delaware State Housing Authority launched a mortgage assistance program in August to help people struggling to make their payments during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThat program was paused at the end of last year because the state was unsure if the federal government would continue to help fund the program, according to Jessica Eisenbrey Welch, a spokeswoman for the Delaware State Housing Authority.\n\nThe state spent nearly $2 million to help more than 300 households, she said in an email.\n\nThe state expects more funding this year thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which is the federal stimulus package, but it's not clear when the money will be available and the state is still waiting for federal guidance, Eisenbrey Welch said.\n\nAt the end of last year, Delaware ranked 9th in the country for foreclosure rates, the data showed.\n\nDelaware is one of 20 states that have a judicial foreclosure process, and because this process tends to be longer those states typically have the highest percentage of foreclosure loans, according to Eisenbrey Welch.\n\n\"The state’s judicial foreclosure process, plus the mortgage mediation program that further extends the process to protect homeowners, tends to push up the number of loans shown as 'in foreclosure,'\" she said.\n\nDELAWARE RECOVERY:These 7 charts show exactly what happened to Delaware's economy\n\nThe Delaware Department of Justice, which manages a mediation program to help people avoid foreclosure, questioned the data report's methodology and conclusion.\n\nIn an email, DOJ spokesman Mat Marshall cited how the Mortgage Bankers Association ranked Delaware 11th in loan foreclosures last quarter in the nation.\n\n\"While our Q1 2021 participation data is not yet finalized, our preliminary figures do not show a significant change in the number of mediation-eligible foreclosure filings and certainly nothing that would give us cause to believe that Delaware moved from 11th in the nation to 1st,\" Marshall wrote.\n\nThe Department of Justice offers help for homeowners facing foreclosure.\n\nMore information can be found at https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/fraud/cpu/automediation or by calling (800) 220-5424.\n\nSarah Gamard covers government and politics for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/joe-biden-presidency-delaware-work-from-home/index.html", "title": "Biden has spent more than a fourth of his presidency working from ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden spent the weekend at his home in Delaware, where he met up with his wife, other family members and – if they followed usual practice – Willow the cat and Commander the dog.\n\nIt’s a familiar weekly ritual. As of this point in his presidency, Biden has spent more than a quarter of his time working from his home state of Delaware, either at his house in Wilmington or his Rehoboth Beach property.\n\nSome 21 months into his term, Biden has made 55 visits to Delaware, totaling some or all of 174 days as of Sunday, according to a CNN analysis of presidential schedules and a tally kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime unofficial statistician of the White House press corps. In addition, Biden has made 19 visits, or all or part of 64 days, to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland.\n\nHe has now surpassed even the getaway time of former President Donald Trump, so often criticized by Democrats for his regular departures from the White House to stay at one of his personal homes. At this point in his tenure, Trump had spent about 135 days at either his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, or his home at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump also had spent 23 days at Camp David.\n\n“President Biden is deeply proud of his roots and his family and it has been a staple of his time in public life to never lose touch with either,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said to CNN. “Presidents of the United States are constantly on the job, regardless of their location – whether they’re on a state visit overseas or just 100 miles from the White House for a short trip to Wilmington, DE. And as all Americans can agree, it’s important for leaders to avoid becoming ensconced in Washington, DC.”\n\nThe comforts of home can be a salve for the commander in chief while carrying out one of the world’s most demanding jobs. The American president is never truly “off,” and – in fact – Biden, like all presidents, has a whole remote White House apparatus that travels with him to facilitate that round-the-clock enterprise, with the most state-of-the-art capabilities, resources and technology traveling with him wherever he goes.\n\nSome argue that Biden can now lean into the normalcy of working from home, which millions of Americans had to rely on when Covid-19 forced isolation from offices and public spaces. “WFH” is not just a shorthand for being productive at the home office, it’s become a professional way of life for many.\n\n“It is 2022, not 1922. If the rest of the country can work from home, so can the president of the United States,” said Michael LaRosa, a director at a DC-based public affairs firm and former press secretary to first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\n\n“He spent (practically) every weekend in Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate, and his eight years as vice president,” LaRosa said. “This is nothing new. The Bidens have never lived in Washington, DC.” When he was a senator, Biden commuted back to Delaware almost every night by train – earning the nickname “Amtrak Joe” – and the train station in Wilmington is named for him.\n\nThe physical presence of a president is, however, meaningful for some, at least in ritual.\n\nThe statistics – 236 days away from the White House in Delaware and Maryland in less than two years on the job – are significant for the modern presidency. The job has been set in the nation’s capital near the Congress and the Supreme Court, in part for its symbolic power, for more than 220 years. Being in that power center brings a higher level of transparency thanks to the proximity to the national media, along with White House rules about press access and public records about who comes and goes.\n\nWhenever the president is actually in the Oval Office, for example, that presence is honored by the solemn watch of a stone-faced US Marine posted outside the West Wing.\n\n“A special challenge that Biden faces, because of his age, is that people will assume the worst if he’s not always visible. That is something that comes with being the oldest president in office,” said Tim Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, who notes presidents have had a “moveable Oval Office” for decades. “Perception is important in American politics.”\n\nThe optics of WFH or WFWH\n\nA president of the United States who doesn’t consider the White House his primary home does not go unnoticed by the media, or critics. But the executive mansion’s primary residents have generally found it stifling.\n\n“I always say I don’t know whether it’s the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the prison system,” former President Bill Clinton famously mused during a 1993 interview.\n\nKnoller, who during his 32-year career with CBS News covered the personal habits of six presidents, concurs.\n\n“It may look luxurious, but it can be suffocating to live and work there day in and out,” Knoller said.\n\nTrump’s trips to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were fodder for op-eds and lent themselves to critics painting a portrait of a president unwilling to give up the trappings of a luxe off-duty lifestyle. And though many days were spent on the golf course – 125 or so at this point in Trump’s presidency, compared to Biden’s 19 on the links – Trump was still the leader of the free world. Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, traveled home much less frequently while in office but was frequently dinged – by Trump, among others – for the amount of golf he played.\n\n“(Ronald) Reagan and (George W.) Bush both spent lots of time at their private ranch homes,” said Knoller of two other former presidents who escaped the White House with regularity.\n\nKnoller tabulated time away for presidents, he says, because the numbers “added color to my reporting and gave insight to the president’s needs and activities.”\n\nAccording to Knoller’s count, George W. Bush spent all or part of 490 days – more than a year – at his Texas ranch during his eight years in office. Reagan spent nearly a year, all or part of 349 days, at his California ranch during his two terms. If Biden were reelected and kept up his current pace of trips to Delaware until the end of a second term in office, he would far surpass both Reagan and Bush in time away from the White House.\n\nHowever, post-pandemic culture has blurred the boundaries of what defines a workplace.\n\n“Our concept of being ‘on the job’ has shifted, and that may actually change the way we think about where our president needs to be,” Naftali said.\n\nSome of Biden’s biggest political wins came this summer, after all, when he was isolating in the residence of the White House after testing positive for Covid-19. Photos showed him tie-less, often working in the second-floor Treaty Room or reading papers with his feet up on the Truman balcony, Commander by his side.\n\nIt was a view into what Biden’s work from home life may be like when he’s in Wilmington or Rehoboth.\n\n“It’s a bit antiquated to think that because he is not physically in the White House on the weekends, that he is not working,” LaRosa said. “He never stops being President and he never stops working. Just ask the first lady.”\n\nA weekly ritual\n\nBiden has the advantage of a more normalized routine in his trips away from Washington.\n\nThe White House residence staff has by now perfected the choreography of managing, packing and planning the departure of the President and first lady most Fridays, the day, statistically, the Bidens normally split town.\n\nThe ushers know which bags are to be brought downstairs – it’s a light-pack, most of the couples’ needed belongings are already in their Delaware homes, a person familiar tells CNN. While Biden occasionally plays golf at a local course when in Wilmington, his other activities – seeing his grandchildren, taking casual social visits, going to church – don’t require multiple outfit changes.\n\nIn Rehoboth, he rides his bike and he and the first lady like to set up a big, blue umbrella on the sandy beach in front of their house and sunbathe or read in reclining chairs. Outside of swimsuits, joggers and polo shirts, it’s not a multiple-suitcase situation.\n\n“The biggest issue is usually the pets,” said the person familiar with the weekend planning for a presidential getaway to Delaware.\n\nCommander, now one year old and no longer a small puppy, and Willow, the barn cat adopted by Jill Biden, are “almost always” on the Delaware visits. While many American families leave their pets at home with caretakers for the weekend, or book them at pet-sitting facilities, the Bidens take theirs with them.\n\nThey like to be around their pets at all times – when Joe Biden was isolating at the White House with Covid-19 this summer, he was kept company by Commander; likewise, when Jill Biden had her bout with Covid, she spent the her rebound case isolation period in Rehoboth, with Willow.\n\nThe animals frequently travel to Delaware via van, with support staff, but occasionally they are in vehicles solely dedicated to their transportation, says the person. Willow, in particular, is not a fan of noisy, whirring helicopter blades, said another person familiar with the feline’s habits. In June, there was a rare sighting by White House press members of Willow in her crate, being carried by a residence staffer to Marine One for a weekend at Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Biden’s Delaware visits, of course, no matter how quick, have a significant footprint beyond those of the paws of their pets.\n\nSecret Service coordinates with law enforcement on all movements – several highway exits must close for the presidential motorcade, locals in both Wilmington and Rehoboth must at times wait on traffic patterns or be swept by agents with handheld magnetometers just to walk down the beach if one of the Bidens is there, as one neighbor of the Bidens in Rehoboth Beach told CNN.\n\nThe large presidential apparatus helps ensure that the President is able to perform his duties with the full input of his advisers, even if they’re not with him in person.\n\n“Unless we discover his being away from Washington results in him bobbling the ball as JFK did on the eve of the Bay of Pigs operation, there shouldn’t be an issue,” says Naftali, referring to Kennedy’s canceling of an air strike on a Sunday, without full consultation and full consideration, a move the former President later regretted.\n\n“But if Biden is in touch virtually and telephonically, in this era, leadership doesn’t have to involve always being physically present in Washington, D.C.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/12/who-is-running-for-office-in-delaware-elections-2024/70302805007/", "title": "Delaware 2024 election: Who is running for office?", "text": "Editor's Note: This story will no longer be updated.

It would raise Delmarva Power's total electric distribution rates $72.3 million annually, or roughly 25%.\n\nTo raise distribution rates, utilities must go through the Public Service Commission. Over several months, the utility's request is scrutinized by the commission, which hears arguments from Delaware's Public Advocate and other \"interveners,\" as well as public comment. The sides often work toward a compromise between the utility's and public advocate's positions decided by the commission.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHow much will my Delmarva Power bill increase?\n\nDelmarva Power wants to raise rates for space heating customers — customers that use electricity to heat their homes — by 13.2%, an addition of more than $11 to an average monthly bill. Residential customers who use another source for heat face a 10.6% increase, equivalent to a $10.41 per month increase for a typical customer.\n\nDelmarva Power spokesperson Zach Chizar said the company determined the revenue required to cover the costs of residential space heating customers had fallen behind that of non-space heating residential customers.\n\nThe rate increase is a combination of a requested distribution rate increase and the Distribution System Improvement Charge. DSIC, started in 2019, is placed on customer bills to provide a more routine way to pay for infrastructure and reliability expenses. It adjusts every six months and is automatically folded into the rate request.\n\nThe proposed cost increases will go into effect on July 15 but are subject to a refund based on the Public Service Commission's decision. A law passed by the General Assembly in 2018 allows utilities to implement the charges as the case is proceeding so they can recover costs related to capital improvements and associated expenses.\n\nWhy does Delmarva Power want to raise rates?\n\nThe company says the most significant factors driving its proposed rate increases are inflation, investments in system reliability and safety and increased costs to \"harden\" the grid against more frequent severe weather.\n\nIn their application to the Public Service Commission, Delmarva Power cites the impact of Tropical Storm Isaias and other severe weather events in 2020 that affected thousands of customers. The company expects the effects of climate change to make these events more frequent in future years.\n\nThe storms occurred after Delmarva Power's last rate increase request, which was submitted in March 2020. The company says it has since invested in its system to \"mitigate flood risks,\" repair and replace equipment damaged from storms and modernize.\n\nAccording to an infrastructure plan prepared for the commission, Delmarva Power is planning more than $430 million worth of improvements through 2024. A large component of the improvements is replacing decades-old wooden poles with larger steel poles, Chizar said.\n\n\"[The rate increases] are necessary for us in order to continue to provide the reliable service our customers expect,\" Chizar said.\n\nAnother element of Delmarva Power's argument is that as remote and hybrid work and electric transportation proliferate in future years, customer expectations for reliability will increase. The company's application also says that having a financially strong utility benefits customers by allowing the company to attract capital on \"reasonable terms.\" If Delmarva Power is viewed as a more risky investment, it could face challenges accessing needed funds, which would increase costs for customers.\n\nWhat is the Public Advocate's position?\n\nThe Public Advocate has been trying to reel in Delmarva Power's spending for several years to keep rates manageable.\n\n\"While we acknowledge reliability is extremely important, we are also very cognizant of affordability for customers,\" Delaware Public Advocate Andrew Slater said. \"This is one of the largest requests we've ever seen.\"\n\n\"They see inflation as a significant issue for them. I'd like to point out that inflation is a big issue for customers,\" Slater added. \"We need to really make sure we keep rates affordable for customers.\"\n\nDelmarva Power's merger with Exelon in 2016 capped spending for several years, but since those caps were lifted, spending has increased significantly. The planned $430 million spending through 2024 represents an increase of 155% over Delmarva Power's 2019 plant spending, according to the Public Advocate division.\n\nSlater said Delmarva Power's reliability already rates among the best in the nation. He argued at some point the continued investment reaches \"diminishing returns,\" and said the commission needs to make sure what is being invested is \"to the benefit of customers.\"\n\nSlater said the investments will increase sales, which is good for the utility, but from the customers' perspective, the state needs to continue to consider energy efficiency and renewable sources. He suggested \"non-wire alternatives\" should be a larger part of the state's approach moving forward.\n\n\"We are going through a generational shift in energy and we need to be prepared for that,\" Slater said. \"We need to have a wholistic approach to distribution planning.\"\n\nChizar said that although Delmarva Power has strong reliability now \"it's not just if we don't touch it, it's going to be perfect.\" He said they need to continue to upgrade and repair equipment to maintain reliability. He cited the company's payment assistance programs when asked about the impact on customers’ finances.\n\nWhen did Delmarva Power electric rates last increase?\n\nThe Public Service Commission approved a $16.7 million increase on Aug. 5, 2021. Delmarva Power had asked for an increase of $24.4 million.\n\nAre there rate increases for natural gas customers?\n\nDelmarva Power filed requests for electric and natural gas rate increases separately.\n\nThe company in March requested a $19.5 million natural gas increase, equaling a monthly increase of about $11 for typical customers. The increase went into effect on a temporary basis on Aug. 14. Natural gas supply rates have increased nearly 60% over the past two years, according to the Division of the Public Advocate.\n\nWhen and where are there opportunities for public comment?\n\nWritten comments may be sent by mail to Delaware Public Service Commission, Docket No. 22-0897, 861 Silver Lake Blvd., Suite 100, Dover, DE 19904, or by email to psc@delaware.gov. The Public Service Commission will hold an in-person public comment session once a procedural schedule is established.\n\nHow can I get help with my Delmarva Power bill?\n\nThe Delaware Energy Assistance Program offers grants to homeowners and renters to help pay for home heating and cooling. The state administers the program through Catholic Charities with money from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. More information is available on the state's website at dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dssc/liheap.html.\n\nDelmarva Power customer care representatives can be reached at (800) 375-7117 to discuss payment options.

Without visas, Lindy’s staff has dwindled to less than 25 people, and those remaining are working overtime to try and keep up with production demands.\n\nLocated in Woolford, Maryland, Lindy’s is among several other picking houses on the Eastern Shore that have been faced with this challenge.\n\nBut it’s not just the picking houses that are hurting — it’s the entire crab industry and its consumers.\n\n\"The bad part is that nobody in the chain is making more money,\" Vincent said. \"It would be a little bit easier to stomach if crabbers were making more money or workers were getting paid more. But what's happening is, it's a lack of efficiency that's creating that price difference.\"\n\nThis shortage of H-2B visas for temporary immigrant workers at Eastern Shore crab picking houses has caused a spike in market prices, but that isn't the only reason for the increased cost, industry workers say.\n\nCold temperatures extended into the spring months this year, killing about 35 percent of adult female blue crabs and delaying the start of this year's harvest, according to a May report by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\nThe overall blue crab population in the Chesapeake Bay has decreased by roughly 84 million since last year due to the cold weather, according to the report.\n\nThe DNR report indicated the current crab population to be approximately 371 million, which is below target levels but not considered unsafe.\n\nThis bad weather put picking houses about a month and a half to two months behind schedule, said Harvey Linton, owner of Linton's Seafood, Inc., who has been in the crab business for 51 years.\n\n\"It put us so far behind with the crabs not being there that prices got high,\" Linton said. \"If the crabs don't pick up, then you're not going to see any crab meat in Maryland for days. It's going to sell on the market as fast as it comes.\"\n\nEven with the delay, though, picking houses don't have enough workers to handle the harvest.\n\nThis year, the Trump administration decided to provide H-2B visas for immigrant workers through a lottery system, rather than on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nAfter the lottery in April, Maryland crab picking houses were short about 200 workers from the usual 500 that receive visas every year.\n\nAbout half of the eight crab picking houses along the Eastern Shore were lucky with the lottery and made it out with enough workers, said Jack Brooks, president of the American Seafood Jobs Alliance.\n\nThe others are in jeopardy, he said.\n\n\"It's just a horrifying set of circumstances with our colleagues basically being shut down by government's inaction,\" Brook said. \"It's just criminal the way these businesses have been treated.\"\n\nLindy's was one of the unlucky ones and has yet to receive any visas. Vincent said they are missing about 75 percent of its workforce.\n\nAs a result, Lindy's has significantly reduced its production. Vincent said they are trying to make the best out of a bad situation.\n\nAlthough production is down, Vincent said Lindy's has been fortunate in that it has able to retain all of its American truck drivers and dock workers.\n\n\"The H-2B workers support those positions so that's been a little bit of a struggle, but so far we've been successful in being able to keep everybody,\" she said.\n\nDue to the challenges crab pickers have faced this year, the quantity of processed crab meat and bushels of whole crabs have not met the market demand, causing prices to go up.\n\nFive years ago, Linton said he would pay about $23 for jumbo lump and roughly $15 for backfin. Prices now are on average about $5 higher for both, he said.\n\n\"Some of these places are getting as high as $55 a pound for jumbo lump,\" Linton said.\n\nSupply and demand\n\nLast year, Maryland harvested just under 33.5 million pounds of blue crab, which had a dockside value of more than $53.7 million, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Data for this year's harvest won't be available until the end of the year.\n\nWith the higher demand, crab meat will often be sold as mixed bags with backfin meat, rather than purely jumbo lump or another variation, Linton said. But Maryland crab meat is highly desired, so as long as the meat is local it will sell — often at a higher price.\n\n\"At this time of the year you have people vacationing in different areas all across the United States and they are spending money, so they want the good Maryland crab meat,\" Linton said. \"There's a large demand for it right now. I'm paying prices that I haven't paid in five or six years, maybe longer.\"\n\nThe demand for Maryland crab meat also increased after the Maryland Department of Health warned against eating Venezuelan crab due to numerous Vibrio infections this summer.\n\nMore:As Delaware coastal waters warm, risk of deadly bacteria rises\n\nBackground:Shortage of blue crab pickers forces Maryland seafood shops to shut down\n\nWhen crab meat is scarce, consumers are faced with high prices, Linton said. Prices will drop once there's more crab meat in stock.\n\nFor Vincent, her fear is that some of Lindy's usual vendors will turn away from carrying Maryland products and buy from other areas due to the inconsistency in the market this season.\n\nAs a wholesaler, Linton works with several different picking houses. One told him that they are only picking crabs every two or three days, rather than every day, because there aren't enough crabs.\n\n\"So even if they've got visas, how much money are (the pickers) gonna make because they're only working two or three days a week if it continues like this,\" Linton said.\n\nWhile the blue crab population decline caused a slow start to this year's season, DNR anticipates a boost from the younger crabs later in the season around August.\n\nThe late abundance will benefit the crab market as a whole, but processing these larger catches will prove to be a difficult task for those who lack the workforce.\n\nWhen the summer ends and children go back to school, the demand for crab goes down significantly. Crab pickers will have to work hard and quickly to get this late summer crab harvest ready for the fall and winter market, Linton said.\n\nVincent said she's worried about how Lindy's will handle the next big wave of crabs if it doesn't have the workers it needs. She added that the business reapplied for the October visa lottery with the hopes that it will receive better results this time.\n\n\"Oh I'm hoping and praying,\" she said. \"If we don't get the workers, I don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"A permanent fix\"\n\nAfter being hurt by the visa system, small business owners and managers, like Vincent, have called on Congress to set things right.\n\n\"We've been very adamant about calling our representatives and making sure they understand what a big deal this is for us,\" Vincent said.\n\nCongressman Andy Harris, who represents the Eastern Shore, has been listening to the concerns of these small businesses and working to find a solution.\n\nAt the end of July, Harris announced his amendment to address the lack of visas for temporary immigrant workers had passed the House Committee on Appropriations. If the Senate approves the amendment, it could change the current system to accommodate a higher number of visa applications before the next summer season begins.\n\nHarris' amendment would make returning workers exempt from the annual 66,000-visa limit. If this exemption is still not enough to accommodate workforce needs, then the Department of Homeland Security will distribute visas proportionately so all businesses will receive at least some workers.\n\nThis amendment will ensure no one is \"frozen out\" of temporary workers, Harris said.\n\n\"I want to solve this problem going forward with a permanent fix so that we don't have to revisit this year after year with our workers and our employers always worrying whether or not they are going to get the workers they need to keep business going,\" Harris said.\n\nVincent said she is optimistic the amendment will make it through the Senate.\n\nIf it does succeed, the legislation could give Lindy's back its workforce. The company has very little turnover — almost all of its H-2B workers return each year — so this amendment would greatly benefit them, Vincent said.\n\n\"Of course it hasn't crossed the finish line yet, but it could potentially be huge,\" Vincent said.\n\nMore:Blue crab population in Chesapeake Bay down for second year\n\nMore:H-2B visa logjam may put Shore employers in summer hiring bind", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/03/15/tri-state-mall-claymont-demolished-summer/7000038001/", "title": "Tri-State Mall in Claymont to be demolished this summer", "text": "The businesses in Claymont's Tri-State Mall will soon be moving out, clearing the way for the mall to be demolished and replaced with a logistics warehouse.\n\nTenants of the lower-level strip center portion of the mall property, located off Naamans Road near I-95 and the Delaware-Pennsylvania border, have received notices that their leases will soon be terminated.

That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare.\n\nThe bridge also had its busiest month ever, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles in August, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000.\n\n“It says something about the loyalty of our customers when the Delaware Memorial Bridge can set so many all-time records despite lane closures associated with our capital investment projects on the bridges and approach roads,” said Thomas J. Cook, Executive Director of the Delaware River and Bay Authority, in a statement.\n\nOfficials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather.\n\n“Not only was the fall and early winter one of the warmest on record, but the region did not experience the tropical or winter storms that have a significant effect on overall traffic during a more typical season,” said Vincent P. Meconi, the Authority's Chief Operations Officer.\n\nAll those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million dollars, up roughly $27 million from the previous year.\n\nFor passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5 dollars. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.\n\nWhile 2019 was an overall record-breaker, the top traffic day ever was Thanksgiving weekend a decade ago when on November 29, 2009, when 79,488 vehicles crossed.\n\nJared Whalen is a data reporter looking in the numbers to find stories about Delaware.

The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule.

July 16 The number of people tested displayed in the dashboard dropped by less than 300 people due to a new method being used that improves the quality of the demographic information about people tested and removes duplicates. The change also affects the numbers in the 'Total People Tested' graph and 'People Tested by Day' graph. A new map on the dashboard, 'Percent of Population Tested by County,' shows the percent of residents by county that have been tested.\"\n\n___________\n\nTakeaways from Gov. Scott's Friday news conference include the following:\n\nVermont's Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine gave an update on the Manchester situation (with 59 people who had positive antigen tests): 17 had PCR tests, \"which is recommended to confirm the positive antigen result.\" Of this group, two tested positive .\n\nSchool re-openings: Scott said he expects Vermont will use a hybrid model featuring remote and in-person learning. Dr. William Raszka with the UVM Health Network noted children seem less likely to transmit the virus that causes COVID-19. State Epidemiologist Dr. Patsy Kelso named strategies like: daily screenings; testing symptomatic people; contact tracing; using physical distancing and facial coverings.\n\n\n\n___________\n\nThe Fletcher Free Library announced updated services in a July 16 news release.\n\nThese include allowing scheduled computer time, \"brief visits to collect materials and receive library support\" and outdoor seating (\"when staffing allows\").\n\nThe library has a Kids' Open Air Hours service that will allow youth to pick and chat about books.\n\n\"Weather permitting, the FFL Youth Department will staff a table on the library lawn in front of the historic Carnegie building at 235 College Street on Saturdays from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm and Wednesdays from 1 to 3 pm,\" the news release stated. \"FFL requests that participants wear masks and maintain social distance.\"\n\nThe library also has mystery bags with youth books.\n\n\"The bags are available at Open Air Hours and at the front desk and the list of themes is on the Kids’ webpage at fletcherfree.org,\" the news release stated. \"There is no bag limit.\"\n\n___________\n\nThursday, July 16, 2020\n\nNine new cases of COVID-19 were reported to the Health Department.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation. Deaths remain at 56.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,099 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease, with a total of 77,624 people have been tested.\n\n_________\n\nA preliminary outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Windham County was announced by state officials Tuesday during Gov. Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15. The second round is expected to launch in October, and will cover between June 16 to Sept. 30.\n\n_________\n\nBurlington School District will host a series of town hall meetings this week, inviting community members to learn about and participate in the district's plans to reopen schools this fall.\n\nThe meetings will be conducted virtually via Zoom and split between two days to allow both families and staff the opportunity to ask questions and hear from school administrators about the reopening.\n\nThe town hall meeting for families will meet 7 p.m. on July 15, whereas a meeting for staff will be conducted the following day, at 7 p.m. on July 16.\n\n“This is a key moment in our planning process,\" said Tom Flanagan, the new superintendent for Burlington School District when began his tenure on July 1st.\n\n\"We need to hear from the community in order to finalize our plans and inform our families so they can start planning their lives.\"\n\nFor more information, those interested can visit the district's website via this link. The meeting will also be aired live through the district's YouTube and Facebook pages. Interpreters will be available to translate the meeting.\n\nMonday, July 13, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,301.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Eight hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56.

Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Dr. Scott Harris, head of the Alabama Department of Public Health, said it takes five or six weeks for someone to gain the maximum amount of immunity after the initial vaccine in a two-shot process. That means time is nearly up for people to start the vaccination process and have “the safest possible Thanksgiving,” he said. Harris said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays won’t be as deadly as last year because of vaccinations and the large number of people who have antibodies after contracting COVID-19, but there are no guarantees. “We just don’t know,” he said. While statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that more than 2.6 million people in Alabama have gotten at least one vaccination, only 2.1 million residents, or 43% of the state’s population, are fully vaccinated – among the worst rates in the nation. More than 14,700 people have died of COVID-19 in Alabama, giving the state the fourth-worst death rate nationally, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck off the coast early Monday in what the Alaska Earthquake Center called an aftershock of an 8.2 quake from late July. Monday’s earthquake was felt throughout the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. It occurred about 70 miles east of Chignik, a community of about 90 people on the Alaska Peninsula. Chignik is about 450 miles southwest of Anchorage and 260 miles southwest of Kodiak. The center had not received reports of significant damage but also relies on self-reporting, said seismologist Natalia Ruppert. Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson for Alaska’s emergency management office, said the office was contacting communities and had no reports of damage so far. The U.S. Geological Survey on Twitter had reported a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 that was later revised to 6.9, which ties another earthquake that hit Alaska in August. The two 6.9 quakes were the largest aftershocks tallied since the United States experienced its largest earthquake in the past half-century, the magnitude 8.2 quake that struck south of the Alaska Peninsula on July 28. It was widely felt but caused no major damage in the sparsely populated region closest to it.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Opponents of a nearly seven-year-long process to exchange Oak Flat, a 2,200-acre site in Tonto National Forest, to a copper mining company cheered to learn that a recent survey found 74% of likely Arizona voters do not approve of the mine. And a new report has revealed the mine would use enough water to supply a city of 140,000 annually for its estimated life. Legislation to repeal the land deal has been pushed forward, and a lawsuit filed in January will be heard in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals this month. To obtain the ore, Resolution Copper plans to use a method known as block cave mining. Eventually, the ground under Oak Flat would subside, leaving behind a crater about 1,000 feet deep and nearly 2 miles across. Opponents also fear underground water channels and major aquifers might be damaged or destroyed. Oak Flat is a sacred site to Western Apaches and holds great cultural significance for other tribes in the region. Known to the Apaches as Chi’chil Bildagoteel, Oak Flat had been withdrawn from mining claims since the Eisenhower administration. To boot, it’s one of Arizona’s rare riparian habitats, providing water and shelter for animals, birds and plants, including the Emory oak, a staple in Apache peoples’ diets for centuries. And the area is popular with recreationists.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The city violated state law with its removal last year of a historical display that included a Confederate flag, a judge ruled. In an order filed last week, Sebastian County Circuit Judge Gunner DeLay found that the city is in violation of the Arkansas State Capitol and Historical Monument Protection Act, which didn’t take effect until April of this year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. DeLay found that the flags and bronze markers that were removed from Riverfront Park in April 2020 are a “historical monument” even though they are no longer displayed. The display was put up in 2001 and also included the French flag and old 15-star and 20-star American flags, among others. This June, attorney Joey McCutchen filed a lawsuit alleging the city violated the new state law by not replacing the display or obtaining a waiver from the Arkansas History Commission. An email exchange in June 2020 among City Administrator Carl Geffken and other officials indicated the flags were initially removed because they were tattered and needed to be replaced. Geffken wrote that he and others discussed changing the flags flown at the park after the May 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. He also said his decision to remove the flags would maintain “a piece of history from potential harm.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Beach: A Southern California beach that was closed more than a week ago because of a leak of crude oil from an undersea pipeline reopened Monday, far sooner than many expected. Huntington Beach’s city and state beaches reopened after officials said water quality tests revealed no detectable levels of oil-associated toxins in the ocean water. Early Monday morning, surfers bobbed in the waves, and people walked along the shoreline, some with dogs jumping and playing in the water. Andrew Boyack, a 54-year-old commercial photographer, was eager to get back to surfing the waves he usually rides three or four times a week. “There’s lots of guys out, so I figure it’s probably all right, and I guess they tested it,” he said while rinsing off at an outdoor beach shower. Huntington Beach and nearby coastal communities reeled from last week’s spill that officials said sent at least about 25,000 gallons and no more than 132,000 gallons of oil into the ocean. It was caused by a leak about 5 miles off the coast in a pipeline owned by Houston-based Amplify Energy that shuttles crude from offshore oil platforms to the coast. The cause is under investigation, and officials said they believe the pipeline was likely damaged by a ship’s anchor several months to a year before it ruptured. It remains unknown when the slender, 13-inch crack in the pipeline began leaking oil.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Body camera footage released Friday in the case of a police officer accused of using a chokehold during an arrest shows him putting his arm around a man’s neck and holding it there for about 10 seconds shortly after handcuffing him. While holding the standing man around his neck during the June 7 arrest at a city building in Greeley, Officer Kenneth Amick accused him of trying to grab the officer’s hands. The man denied it, his voice distorted, while still in the hold. Amick released the chokehold after another officer stepped toward them and said: “Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.” A judge ordered the release of the video Thursday, siding with a coalition of news media. The coalition argued that it should be released under a Colorado law enacted this year in response to nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. It generally requires that footage be made public, upon request, when a complaint is lodged against a police officer. Amick, charged with second-degree assault, is scheduled to enter a plea Oct. 22. Weld County District Court Judge Vincente Geraldo Vigil had earlier blocked the release of footage after Amick and prosecutors argued it could prejudice a potential jury. On Thursday, he ruled such concerns can be dealt with during jury selection, KDVR-TV reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Online gambling is coming to the state, on a limited basis. A “soft launch” beginning Tuesday will allow several hundred people to open accounts to wager for a seven-day period. The state marked the first day of its long-awaited rollout of legalized sports and internet wagering Sept. 30, when Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods held events to mark the grand opening of temporary sports betting venues. In addition to the two tribal casinos, the Connecticut Lottery Corporation, the state’s quasi-public lottery, will offer online sports wagering and retail sports betting at 15 locations. The soft launch allows people to gamble using their phones, tablets and other online devices. Once the launch is completed, online gambling will be available statewide. “After more than a decade of advocacy and negotiation, statewide sports betting and iGaming is finally coming to Connecticut,” Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, told the Hartford Courant. ”We’ve made it to the finish line, and we’re excited to finally launch.” The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, which operates Foxwood, has partnered with DraftKings Inc., and Mohegan Sun, operated by the Mohegan tribe, has partnered with FanDuel. The lottery’s partner is Rush Street Interactive.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The University of Delaware is bringing to fruition its plans to develop a science and technology-focused campus at the sprawling former Chrysler plant in the city. The university on Thursday officially opened the Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center, a six-story, 220,000-square-foot building designed to bring together UD students, researchers and industry workers focused on “life-saving medicines and transformational treatments.” It’s one of a series of buildings to open or break ground amid the COVID-19 pandemic at what’s now the UD Science, Technology and Advanced Research Campus. The new innovation center – nicknamed AP BIO by officials – is among the most advanced UD facilities. Charles Riordan, UD’s vice president of research, scholarship and innovation, called it “the most interdisciplinary building” in the school’s history. It houses the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals, a federally sponsored private-public partnership that aims to accelerate biopharmaceutical innovation; the Delaware Biotechnology Institute, a support and research group formed by Delaware’s research organizations; the university’s department of biomedical engineering; and research laboratories in pharmaceutical discovery and molecular and medical sciences.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new bike path is in the works for the National Mall, WUSA-TV reports. This week, the D.C. Department of Transportation, in partnership with the National Park Service, will begin implementing safety improvements on 15th Street, including two-way protected lane for bicyclists. “This project will improve pedestrian safety for visitors to the National Mall and create a north-south bicycle connection between the White House, National Mall and the Jefferson Memorial,” Mike Litterst, chief of communications and spokesperson for the National Mall and Memorial Park, said in a release. NPS said it will install an additional projected lane on East Basin Drive Southwest next spring that will connect with the multiuse trail on the 14th Street bridge. Construction on 15th Street will last through the fall and involve temporary lane closures for drivers. When the work is complete, there will be three lanes open to drivers on 15th Street – one southbound and two northbound. Pedestrians and bicyclists can continue to use the sidewalks along 15th Street until the project is complete, but they should expect a limited number of disruptions due to construction activity.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The activist who led a movement to allow most former felons in Florida to vote has gotten more of his own civil rights restored under a new state clemency program. Desmond Meade, head of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, announced in a Twitter video Saturday that he can now run for office, serve on a jury and take the bar exam to become a lawyer. Meade has a law degree from Florida International University. “This is good,” Meade said on the video. “The restoration of my civil rights definitely helped remove some hurdles for me.” Meade, 54, was a leader in the successful 2018 effort to enact a voter-approved constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to felons whose sentences are complete. The GOP-led Legislature later passed a measure requiring all financial obligations such as fines to also be completed, which critics said primarily disenfranchises minorities and poor people. Meade, who served time for drug and firearms offenses, already had regained the right to vote. The other rights were automatically restored under a policy adopted in March by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet. Meade last month was awarded a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” of $625,000 in recognition of his work. He said it will be used to pay off law school loans and continue his work for people convicted of felonies.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: City officials say bars and restaurants are toasting a successful trial run at serving to-go orders of beer and cocktails in aluminum cups. Georgia’s oldest city recently ended a two-month pilot aimed at seeing whether businesses can reduce their use of plastic cups by switching to aluminum ones that people can reuse or recycle. Sipping from to-go cups of alcohol on the streets of the downtown historic district has long been a part of Savannah’s bustling nightlife. City Alderman Nick Palumbo pushed for the trial to let businesses test the aluminum cups. The City Council agreed to temporarily add aluminum alongside paper and plastic cups allowed for serving to-go drinks during the pilot period. Bars and restaurants ended up using about 50,000 aluminum cups. “We know that diverted 50,000 pieces of plastic out of the waste stream, out of our environment, which is just a huge hit,” Palumbo said. Carey Ferrara of the Gaslight Group, which owns several Savannah restaurants, agreed the pilot was successful. She said the biggest downside is that the aluminum cups cost at least four times more than plastic. She said businesses might be able to reduce the extra cost by combining their orders. “We can work together to purchase the cups in a quantity to make the price low enough for us,” Ferrara said.\n\nHawaii\n\nNaalehu: Two strong earthquakes struck off the coast of the Big Island on Sunday, rattling residents and causing items to fall off shelves. The U.S. Geological Survey said the first quake had a magnitude of 6.1 and struck about 17 miles south of Naalehu. The agency said a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck about 20 minutes later in the same area. The National Weather Service in Honolulu said there was no tsunami threat. At a gas station in Naalehu, the refrigerator display doors were opened by the shaking, and items fell to the ground. No injuries were immediately reported. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said there was no damage from the earthquake at airport runways, commercial harbors or highway bridges.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Press Club has dropped its request that a judge hold Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin in contempt of court for refusing to turn over public records related to her education task force. Attorneys for the state press association and the lieutenant governor’s office filed the agreement to drop the contempt request Friday afternoon, according to court documents. McGeachin and her chief of staff, Jordan Watters, have repeatedly ignored requests for comment from the Associated Press. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. The task force was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system, something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” The lieutenant governor lost the lawsuit, and Fourth District Judge Steven Hippler ordered her to release the documents. But McGeachin didn’t immediately release the materials, and a few weeks after Hippler’s ruling she formally asked the judge to reconsider the matter. Her office finally released the records shortly after the Idaho Press Club asked the judge to hold McGeachin in contempt of court.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Old State Capitol has reopened to visitors after interior renovations were completed. Visitors will see a new feature, an education gallery and video room. Exterior work on the dome of the building continues, but indoor plaster work and painting is finished, allowing the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to open for tours Thursday. Its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. The building served as Illinois’ Capitol from 1840 to 1876. Abraham Lincoln served in the Legislature there and in 1858, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, delivered his famous “House Divided” speech in the Hall of Representatives. When work began in March, officials indicated the building would only be closed through April. But officials said the project met with unforeseen delays, according to historic sites superintendent Justin Blandford. Combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, the reopening was delayed. The $1.5 million project, under the management of the Illinois Capital Development Board, involves installing a new roof on the drum that supports the dome and restoration of the drum’s columns and windows. Work on the outside of the dome is marked by the construction scaffolding that surrounds it.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Former Vice President Mike Pence climbed on horseback during a ride by a veterans group trying to reduce suicides among military veterans. Pence joined members of the nonprofit organization BraveHearts for a Saturday ride in Fort Wayne aimed at raising awareness about the suicide issue. The national group uses the riding and care of horses in therapy for veterans suffering with depression or other emotional troubles. Pence rode for part of the route, talked and posed for photos with residents and riders, and spoke during a ceremony at the ride’s conclusion. The former Indiana governor said he was inspired by the group’s recognition that some veterans have wounds “that can’t be seen with the human eye.” “They are the burden of the heart and the mind that over generations in America that have really gone unspoken of,” Pence said. “But I’m proud to say now we’re recognizing as a nation the unseen injuries of our heroes.” About 30 horses and riders followed the full 20-mile route through Fort Wayne – a distance referring to the estimated 20 veterans a day who die from suicide.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Debates over COVID-19 mitigation strategies and how race should be discussed in classrooms are fueling frenetic energy around suburban school board races. A wave of conservative candidates and their supporters are urging their neighbors to take their frustrations to the polls. Although the races are nonpartisan in Iowa – party ID doesn’t appear on the ballot – they’re gaining attention from Republican leaders at both the state and national levels. In Waukee, a slate of parents backed by the local Republican Party is warning about “harmful ideology” in schools. In Southeast Polk, a candidate hosted an event for parents to get their mask mandate exemption forms notarized. And in Ankeny, a school board candidate who inspired the state’s law prohibiting mask mandates in schools has the endorsement of Gov. Kim Reynolds. Their platforms are part of a nationwide backlash from the defining events of 2020: the coronavirus pandemic and the rise of attention on racial justice issues after the murder of George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota who was choked to death by a white police officer. The rancor has risen to such a level across the country that a nonprofit that represents school boards has asked federal officials to step in to protect elected officials and school leaders from physical violence.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A major water line break that forced residents to boil their water before using it for several days highlights concerns about aging infrastructure in the state’s largest city. The water main break that forced the boil order last week happened after the city’s water plant lost part of its power supply, so the pumps sending water throughout the system automatically shut down. The boil order was lifted for Wichita on Saturday. “That was an abrupt shutdown,” Director of Public Works and Utilities Alan King said. “When we brought the pressure back up and to pressurize the system, that was a rapid decrease in pressure (followed by) a rapid increase in pressure, and both of those are not friendly to pipes, especially older pipes.” The Wichita Eagle reports that a 2017 assessment found 99% of the city’s water treatment plant was in poor condition, and the entire raw water pipe system was in very poor condition. Recent reports have said Wichita’s water supply needs hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and near-constant repair and replacement. The city is aware of the fragile state of its water supply and has budgeted $10 million a year in its most recent capital improvements plan for repairs, replacements and maintenance of distribution lines. A new water plant under construction won’t be ready until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nKentucky\n\nRadcliff: It was no small feat, but now a local landmark is part of the Guinness Book of World Records. What started as a sharp idea in 2017 has turned into a crowning moment for Red Hill Cutlery and its owners, Lonnie, Jason and Josh Basham. The company has received confirmation that it does indeed own the world’s largest pocketknife at 34 feet, 6 inches. The business will hold a formal celebration this week. “It means a lot for us,” Jason Basham said. “It gives us an identity that sets us apart from any other knife store of its kind.” The idea started when the family began building a new location for Red Hill Cutlery and its American Pocketknife Museum in Radcliff. They gathered inspiration from a Barlow pattern pocketknife in Lonnie Basham’s personal collection. Josh Basham said the pattern has been interwoven with American history dating back to the 1600s. “The Barlow goes back to Huckleberry Finn,” he said. “You can go back in history, and the Barlow was one of the most notorious knives carried by U.S. presidents.” The world’s largest pocketknife is held open by a single pin, Lonnie Basham said. “We could pull out that one pin and it would close, but it would take a crane to do it because it’s so heavy,” he said. A community event acknowledging the Guinness recognition is set for 1 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The city hopes a temporary shift to once-weekly garbage collections will help address the piles of trash and debris that have piled up along streets across much of New Orleans. Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration announced the change to its solid waste collection Saturday as a way to bring a level of consistency to residents. “We are collectively beginning to see the progress on the ground, but it’s time to bring some predictability so that our residents can better prepare for their trash collection,” Director of Sanitation Matt Torri said in a statement. The city’s two primary solid waste contractors, Metro Service Group and Richard’s Disposal, are supposed to collect garbage twice a week, but they have fallen behind throughout the year primarily because of staffing shortages brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. After Hurricane Ida, the situation worsened. Torri said the shift to once-weekly pickup is “temporary,” but the administration is not committing to any collection schedule in the future. Cantrell announced Sept. 23 that she had hired four emergency contractors to clear out the backlog while Metro and Richard’s resumed regular collections. That effort is expected to last a month and cost and estimated $20 million to $30 million, The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Prices for the state’s most beloved export are much higher than typical right now because of high demand and the possibility that those who catch lobsters are having a slower season. Maine lobsters usually become less expensive over the course of the summer because of the increase in catch off the state’s coast. But this year, wholesale prices that typically fall to the $8 or $9 per pound range never fell below $10.50. And they’ve soared even higher in early fall, eclipsing recent records and causing consumers to fork over more money at seafood counters. Members of the industry said interest in lobster from food processing companies and international buyers is driving heavy demand for the crustaceans. Meanwhile, the fishing season might be slightly off the pace of recent years, so supply is stretched thin, they said. “The season has been maybe a little bit below average, but the price has been pretty decent, so I think we’re going to be OK,” said Kristan Porter, a lobster fisherman and president of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association. America’s lobster industry, based mostly in Maine, goes through pricing ebbs and flows over the course of a typical year. Lobsters are typically heavily fished in summer, when they shed their shells and many reach legal size.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lumped into the “Other” racial and ethnic category, American Indians and Alaska Natives are effectively invisible on the state’s COVID-19 website. More than 120,000 people who identify as Native American live in Maryland, but without public-facing numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is a mystery how many the disease has affected – and how many resources should be allocated to help them. “Not only is that bad public health, but it’s also very dehumanizing for American Indians and Alaska Natives on our native lands,” Kerry Hawk Lessard, executive director of the health services nonprofit Native American Lifelines of Baltimore, told Capital News Service. The Maryland Department of Health puts American Indians and Alaska Natives in the “Other” category for COVID-19 cases and death numbers “due to low statistical occurrence given the population of Native Americans in the state,” department spokesperson Andy Owen wrote in an email to Capital News Service. However, American Indians and Alaska Natives are at the highest risk for death and hospitalization from COVID-19 among all races and ethnicities, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There is no regulation that requires this manner of reporting,” Owen wrote.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Kenya’s Benson Kipruto won the pandemic-delayed Boston Marathon on Monday when the race returned from a 30-month absence with a smaller, socially distanced feel and moved from the spring for the first time in its 125-year history. Although organizers put runners through COVID-19 protocols and asked spectators to keep their distance, large crowds lined the 26.2-mile course from Hopkinton to Boston as an early drizzle cleared and temperatures rose to the low 60s for a beautiful fall day. They watched Kipruto run away from the lead pack as it turned onto Beacon Street with about 3 miles to go, and he broke the tape in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 51 seconds. Diana Kipyogei won the women’s race to complete the eighth Kenyan sweep since 2000. Marcel Hug of Switzerland won the men’s wheelchair race earlier despite making a wrong term in the final mile, finishing the slightly detoured route just seven seconds off his course record in 1:08:11. Manuela Schar, also from Switzerland, won the women’s wheelchair race in 1:35:21. Hug, who has raced Boston eight times and has five victories here, cost himself a $50,000 course record bonus when he missed the second-to-last turn, following the lead vehicle instead of turning from Commonwealth Avenue onto Hereford Street.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: One of the city’s most iconic landmarks, a site familiar to music lovers around the world, is gearing up for a dramatic new look. The Motown Museum has unveiled renderings that depict a crisp, lush, bustling outdoor plaza at Hitsville U.S.A. Officials say they’re aiming to create a welcoming hangout for visitors, inspired by the days when artists and fans strode Motown’s front lawn in search of musical opportunity and glory. And they want to foster a Motown experience before guests even step through the doors. The space, part of the museum’s ongoing $55 million expansion, will be a mix of hardscapes and softscapes: The plaza will be tiled with granite pavers and adorned with benches, flower beds and foliage, including a new line of trees on the property’s west side. A new surround-sound system will envelop visitors in Motown songs as they step onto the grounds, while the space will be bathed in light at night. A permanent stage will host scheduled performances and pop-up music sets, helping address one of the most common questions from tourists in Detroit: “Where can I go to hear Motown music?” The front-yard transformation, now underway and scheduled for completion next summer, is the second of three construction phases in the museum’s expansion project, launched in 2016.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state imposed an emergency order Monday blocking importation and movement of deer into and within the state to slow the spread of chronic wasting disease from deer farms and protect the state’s wild deer herd. “This disease poses a clear, immediate and serious threat to Minnesota’s wild deer, and these actions reflect what’s at stake,” Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a news release. The decision came after the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported last month that a Wisconsin deer farm where the disease was detected sold nearly 400 deer to 40 farms across seven states in the past five years. The Minnesota DNR said it learned Sept. 27 that Minnesota farms received five deer from the Wisconsin farm. A farm in Stillwater received two of the deer in 2016. That farm has since closed, and the deer were shipped back to Wisconsin in 2019. The other three deer went to a farm in Clear Lake in 2017. That farm is active but under quarantine. Regulators have yet to approve a live test for CWD, which is similar to mad cow disease. It attacks deer’s brains, causing them to act strangely, lose weight and die. It’s always fatal to deer or elk. It’s caused by an abnormal proteins, prions, that can persist in the environment and spread to other deer.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Child care providers are complaining that they are being forced to endure financial hardships, with some even being forced to close their doors, because of the challenge of accessing federal funds through the Mississippi Department of Human Services. Deloris Suel, president of the Child Care Directors Network Alliance, told WLBT-TV the state has failed to distribute half a billion dollars in federal money meant to help support child care providers from the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan Act. Bob Anderson, executive director for the Department of Human Services, told the television station the agency is not sitting on federal child care money, but officials want to distribute the funds “responsibly, prudently and carefully” and within the parameters of state and federal guidelines. Anderson said the state will be reviewed and audited for every dollar that is awarded. Anderson said that during the pandemic, the state provided thousands of dollars of cash grants to child care providers, and it’s still waiting for hundreds to provide documentation on how the funding was spent. Suel said many child care providers don’t understand the process because it is too complicated and filled with barriers. She said a lot of providers are struggling to stay afloat.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Elected officials have voted to remove two courthouse murals that show a white man pointing a gun at a Native American man and an attempted lynching. The Boone County Commission made the decision Thursday after lawyers raised concerns. The murals, painted by Sidney Larson in 1994, will be placed in storage. The murals depict multiple scenes from Columbia’s history, including when Southern guerrillas terrorized Union loyalists in 1864. Another scene shows a white man being punished for stealing a cow. Three shirtless Black men also are shown chained by their ankles as they carry a plank. The majority of those who spoke at a public hearing late last month were in favor of the murals’ removal from the courthouse. Among them them was attorney Gary Oxenhandler, who said having the art in the courthouse is a wedge. “Boone County can either be a justice leader or an embarrassing media soundbite,” he said at the hearing. “I have never met a person of color who needed to be reminded their ancestors were lynched by mobs or beaten by police.”\n\nMontana\n\nBusby: Researchers are looking for the graves of nine soldiers killed in the Battle of the Rosebud, the largest battle of the Plains Wars. The fighting involved the U.S. government, committed to confining the Indigenous peoples of the continent to reservations, and the Cheyenne and Lakota who continued to resist, the Billings Gazette reports. To prevent their bodies from being discovered, men under the command of Gen. George Crook built a massive fire over the grave. Once it was snuffed out, they rode horses over the burned earth and covered any trace of who laid below. With much of the battlefield largely unchanged over the next 145 years, a team of researchers conducted a survey last week trying to find those nine men. The hunt for the soldiers’ grave – one of several projects intended to clarify the events of a day often overshadowed by the obliteration of Lt. Col. George Custer and his 263 soldiers – is the result of a partnership among Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, tribal officials, the State Historic Preservation Office and faculty with Colorado Mesa University. “What we’re trying to do is put together the physical history of the battle and see how it fits with Native American oral accounts and written records. We look at it as a crime scene, quite in the literal sense,” said Doug Scott, an expert in forensic and military archaeology with Colorado Mesa University.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials are refusing to release presentations the state has received from a nonprofit group that is analyzing criminal justice data to help Nebraska deal with severe overcrowding in its prison system. Gov. Pete Ricketts’ office refused the Omaha World-Herald’s request for those reports from the Crime and Justice Institute because the group of state officials who heard the presentations isn’t a public body, and officials said the information is still in draft form. “If there’s any legislation that comes out of it, it will go to a hearing just like any other bill, and the public will have a chance to weigh in on that,” Ricketts said. At some point, he said, data will be released in support of any prospective legislation. The director of the Nebraska ACLU, Danielle Conrad, said it doesn’t make sense to her that presentations given to a committee composed of public officials would be considered drafts. The ACLU, which has opposed Ricketts’ proposal to build a new prison, said state officials should uphold Nebraska’s “strong and proud tradition of open government” and release the reports. State Corrections Director Scott Frakes is expected to address prison overcrowding concerns when he testifies before the Legislature on Wednesday, but it doesn’t appear likely he will address the work state officials are doing with CJI.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials report a dramatic increase in drug overdose deaths in the state between 2019 and 2020. Accidental overdoses among Nevadans totaled 788 in 2020, a 55% increase from 510 in 2019, the Nevada Overdose Data Program reported Thursday. The number of overdose deaths among people younger than 25 nearly tripled, from 38 in 2019 to 106 in 2020. According to the state’s drug overdose reporting system, 1 of every 2 overdose deaths involved a person with a mental health problem, while 3 in 4 overdose victims had an identified substance misuse problem not related to alcohol. The opioid overdose antidote naloxone is available free statewide, and the overdose data program encourages Nevadans to learn about the life-saving resource. Naloxone can be obtained in Nevada without a prescription. In 2015, Nevada adopted the Good Samaritan Overdose Law, which protects a person from prosecution for many narcotics-related offenses when seeking medical assistance for another person for a drug-related emergency.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Department of Insurance has launched the state’s new HealthCost website to help people compare prices across health care facilities. The site, launched Friday, also includes information on health insurance and an interactive tool to compare hospitals’ quality of care, cleanliness and customer satisfaction. The site can be accessed at nhhealthcost.nh.gov. NH HealthCost, created by the Insurance Department in 2007, uses paid claims data collected from New Hampshire’s health insurers to show patients – insured and uninsured – an estimated price for a procedure. Patients can access the total costs of their procedures, including physician fees, lab fees and facility fees.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMaplewood: Outrage swept social media Friday over allegations that a teacher had pulled a hijab from the head of a second grade student. For Muslims, many of whom view the hijab as an expression of faith, the alleged episode was hurtful and offensive and highlighted what community leaders say is a larger problem of bias in the classroom. “This is really a wake-up call for districts,” said Nagla Bedir, founder of Teaching While Muslim, a New Jersey-based nonprofit focused on education and anti-bias training. “A lot of schools across the country have tried to be more inclusive and anti-racist, but part of anti-racism is also (teaching about) Islamophobia.” The South Orange-Maplewood School District said it was investigating the allegations, which were detailed in an Instagram post Thursday by Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Maplewood native who said she is friends with the child’s mother. The bronze-medal winner was the first Muslim American woman to wear a hijab while competing at the Olympic Games. Muhammad said the teacher “forcibly removed” the girl’s hijab in class. The teacher “told the student that her hair was beautiful and she did not have to wear hijab to school anymore,” she wrote. “Imagine being a child and stripped of your clothing in front of your classmates. ... This is abuse.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A coalition of environmental groups is raising concerns about Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s plans to turn the state into a hydrogen fuel hub. The Democrat, who is running for reelection, has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 45% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. The Natural Resource Defense Council, the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center and two dozen other organizations argue in a letter sent to the governor and other top elected officials last week that large-scale development of hydrogen risks incentivizing new oil and natural gas fields. Hydrogen fuel cells can power vehicles to reduce transportation emissions, but most energy used to produce hydrogen comes from natural gas. Some are hopeful that hydrogen can be produced by using electricity generated from solar or wind power to separate hydrogen and oxygen in water. However, the letter warns of excessive water use in a state where the commodity is already scarce. The groups urged the governor to focus on wind and solar energy instead. Lujan Grisham has expressed interest in speaking at a climate change conference next month. Earlier this year, she asked President Joe Biden to exempt oil and gas producers in New Mexico from a drilling moratorium.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s annual Columbus Day Parade returned Monday after being canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Marching bands and floats traveled up Fifth Avenue as spectators waved green, white and red Italian flags. Organizers said 35,000 marchers took part in the parade, and tens of thousands more watched. Billed as the nation’s largest celebration of Italian American pride, the Columbus Day Parade has faced criticism in recent years from activists who fault the 15th-century explorer Christopher Columbus for his brutal treatment of Indigenous people in the West Indies. Some communities have responded to the controversy by replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day, and President Joe Biden on Friday issued the first-ever presidential proclamation of Indigenous Peoples Day, which was observed Monday along with Columbus Day. Born in the Republic of Genoa, part of modern-day Italy, Columbus sailed from Spain in August 1492 and landed on an island in the Bahamas on Oct. 12 of that year. Many of the native people were forced into servitude. Multitudes died of disease. Spain repopulated the workforce with African slaves. President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed the first national Columbus Day in 1892 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of his “discovery” of the Americas.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The N.C. Department of Transportation has signed a $432 million contract to rebuild 8 miles of Interstate 95 through one county with an eye on eliminating a recurring flooding problem. Flooding resulting from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018 closed the highway in Robeson County for several days, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Starting next year, contractors will begin work on widening I-95 from four lanes to eight and replace bridges at three interchanges. Contractors will use fill dirt to raise the highway above its current elevation through Lumberton, said Matt Lauffer, NCDOT’s hydraulics design engineer. Lauffer said the work aims to raise all bridges and culverts high enough to handle a 100-year flood, plus provide an 18-inch cushion so items floating underneath can pass. The project also calls for a new, higher bridge to carry I-95 over the Lumber River, where floodwaters left the interstate impassable for several days after both hurricanes. Construction on the Lumberton section of I-95 is scheduled to begin next summer and be completed by late summer 2026. NCDOT expects to award two more contracts to widen another 15 miles of I-95 between Lumberton and Fayetteville, starting next fall.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The abrupt closure of a photography business has left couples in a four-state area scrambling to locate wedding photos or find new photographers for upcoming nuptials. Glasser Images owner Jack Glasser said in a statement Friday that due in large part to COVID-19, the Bismarck studio “simply couldn’t keep up with our ongoing costs, debt repayment, salaries, rent and other business expenses.” He told customers in an email that he cannot offer refunds. The move has Johnny Thompson and wife Crystal Brunner-Thompson wondering if they will ever receive photos of their August wedding. They paid more than $2,000 for the Bismarck event. “I’m an only child,” Brunner-Thompson said. “My parents are never going to get to do this again. I have no photos with my parents. I’d never seen my dad get emotional. It’s just stuff you can’t get back.” Glasser Images photographed weddings throughout the Dakotas, Minnesota and Colorado without charging for travel costs, according to the company website. The North Dakota Attorney General’s Office said it had fielded more than 170 complaints about the situation by Friday afternoon and was investigating. Glasser’s attorney, Tim O’Keeffe, told The Bismarck Tribune he and Glasser will try to talk with customers in the coming days.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Alumni of Ohio Wesleyan University are speaking out after their alma mater was used to film a U.S. Senate campaign ad that demonizes athletes who kneel during the national anthem. GOP candidate Mike Gibbons released an ad last month that paints Democrats, corporations and media as anti-faith and claims they want to “replace God with government.” The video also takes aim at former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who started a movement after he refused to stand during the anthem to protest racial injustice. “I believe in an America where we kneel in devotion, not disrespect,” Gibbons says, as an image of Kaepernick flashes across the screen. The ad also shows an anti-critical race theory sign. Gibbons’ campaign filmed the ad at OWU’s Selby Stadium, which one former student who played football there quickly noticed. Alumni say the ad is divisive and contrary to the Delaware, Ohio, liberal arts school’s values of diversity and inclusion. Gibbons, who played football at Kenyon College, is running in the crowded race to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman. The ad was part of a $10 million ad buy aimed at keeping him on air until the May primary.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Architectural consultants hired by the Oklahoma County Criminal Justice Advisory Council have shared two multimillion-dollar options for the future of the Oklahoma County Jail, but some citizens are calling for investments in social services instead. The options, one to build an entirely new facility and a second to renovate the existing facility and add an annex, both come with price tags of several hundred million dollars. A new facility valued at $300 million would allow the county to abandon the current, troubled, 30-year-old high-rise facility. Renovation, according to architectural consultants John Semtner and Jeff Bradley, is possible but would mean added time and complexities due to years of deferred maintenance and the requirement to move detainees while each floor of the 13-story building is being worked on. Still frustrated with what they view as a lack of overall progress by the jail trust, some citizens called Thursday’s meeting at which the options were unveiled a sales pitch rather than a listening session. Others argued with assessments of the size of the jail. Many residents cited concerns that building a new, possibly bigger jail would just lead to county officials trying to fill it, recreating the same conditions that exist in the current jail.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown is requesting disaster relief from the federal government for the state’s strained commercial salmon industry. The governor submitted the formal aid request last week to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Brown wrote that the economic return from commercial salmon fishing along most of the coast since 2018 has been less than one-third of what it was in previous years. She said the trend is having severe effects on already distressed rural communities and businesses that depend on salmon. “While economic assistance will be essential to address the impacts of closures and restrictions on our salmon fisheries, it is vitally important that federal, state, tribal, and local governments continue to work together to recover and restore salmon populations and develop management strategies to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our salmon fisheries,” she said in the letter. State Rep. David Gomberg, D-Otis, is the chair of the Legislature’s Oregon Coastal Caucus, which urged Brown to seek disaster aid. If the relief money comes through, Gomberg said it will help buy time while longer-term solutions are worked out. There is no timeline for when the U.S. Department of Commerce might make its decision.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nKennett Square: President Joe Biden attended his nephew’s wedding in the state where he was born Monday before returning to Washington for the week. The president and his wife, Jill Biden, attended the wedding of Cuffe Owens, the son of Biden’s sister Valerie Biden Owens, to Meghan O’Toole King. King is a former cast member on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” while Owens is an attorney. The event was held at Biden Owens’ home. King shared a photo of the two on Instagram in September, writing: “meet my man.” Joe Biden had a quiet weekend in Wilmington, Delaware, visiting church early Sunday but otherwise keeping to his home. King was previously married to retired MLB player Jim Edmonds.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Johnson & Wales University is suing its insurer over financial losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic, alleging the company breached its contract because it did not allow the university to claim pandemic-related economic losses. The university, whose main campus is based in Providence, said the American Guarantee & Liability Company’s current policy does not have preventive pandemic-related coverage in its insurance policy to cover economic losses. As a result of the pandemic, the university said it lost enrollment, tuition, housing and dining revenues while expensing additional COVID-19 safety protocols. In the lawsuit, Johnson & Wales asked the court to rule that the insurer must cover its financial losses “totaling many millions of dollars.” A spokesperson for Zurich Insurance Group, American Guarantee’s parent company, did not respond to an email seeking comment. The company has also not yet responded to the lawsuit in court.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An appellate court is set to debate a lawsuit challenging South Carolina’s abortion law about a week after the U.S. Supreme Court considers a similar measure in Mississippi. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has tentatively scheduled the South Carolina case for oral arguments the week of Dec. 6, according to an order from the court posted Friday. Planned Parenthood is suing South Carolina over the measure, which was signed into law by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year and requires doctors to perform ultrasounds to check for a so-called fetal heartbeat. If cardiac activity – which can typically be detected about six weeks into pregnancy – is detected, the abortion can only be performed if the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest or if the mother’s life is in danger. Opponents have argued that many women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks and that with such an early deadline, the law gives women little time to consider whether to have an abortion. Medical experts say the cardiac activity is not an actual heartbeat but rather an initial flutter of electric activity within cells in an embryo. They say the heart doesn’t begin to form until the fetus is at least 9 weeks old, and they decry efforts to promote abortion bans by relying on medical inaccuracies.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Boy Scouts of America are set to sell a campground to the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Department for $2million. Department officials confirmed at their October meeting that the Boy Scouts are ready to finalize the sale of the 223-acre campground to the agency in late November. The state appraised the property at $3.59 million earlier this year. The campground sits between Newton Hills State Park and the Johnson Game Production Area. Boy Scout leaders have talked about selling it since 2011. A push from national Scout leaders to upgrade existing facilities led them to approach GFP officials about a sale last year. The campground was built during the 1930s and would require extensive improvements to bring it up to Boy Scouts of America standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State agriculture officials are offering to share the costs with landowners who are interested in improving the forests and watersheds on their properties near two rivers. The state Department of Agriculture says the Duck and Elk Watershed Initiative is open for applications until Oct. 29. The counties in the watershed of the Duck and Elk rivers include Bedford, Coffee, Dickson, Franklin, Giles, Hickman, Humphreys, Lewis, Lincoln, Marshall, Maury, Moore and Williamson. Eligible activities include tree planting, forest improvement, invasive plant management and prescribed burning. The activities should be implemented from January through May of next year. The Division of Forestry is offering free site visits and consultations on action plans to improve the watershed.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Executions in the nation’s busiest capital punishment state face delays amid legal questions about Texas’ refusal to allow spiritual advisers to touch inmates and pray aloud as condemned individuals are being put to death. It’s unclear when Texas may carry out another execution after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to hear religious freedom claims from death row inmate John Henry Ramirez. The court blocked his execution last month, about three hours after it could have been carried out. Several other inmates have since made similar claims, and courts have put some of their executions on hold. “It would be unusual for somebody who has the same issue to not get a stay while the Supreme Court is deciding that issue. It would be very unusual,” said Michael Benza, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. A ruling from the Supreme Court could be months away. It’s set to hear oral arguments Nov. 1. Ramirez says the state is violating his religious freedom by not letting his spiritual adviser lay hands on him and pray out loud as he is executed. Texas prison officials say that direct contact poses a security risk and that prayers said aloud could be disruptive.\n\nUtah\n\nFarmington: An unexpected snowstorm forced the rescue of dozens of runners in a long-distance trail race in the mountains of northern Utah. None of the 87 or so runners rescued Saturday was hospitalized, though several were treated for hypothermia, and one was hurt in a fall, according to Davis County Sheriff Kelly Sparks. “We feel very fortunate today that there were no serious injuries,” Sparks said. The 50-mile race in the Francis Peak area between Ogden and Salt Lake City began at 5 a.m. Severe weather struck about four hours later. Some runners were wearing just shorts and a T-shirt, authorities said. Race organizers had told runners to expect rain, but the rain turned to snow, runner Kelcey McClung Stowell said. “We thought, ‘We’ll be OK once we get to Francis Peak, and then we start coming down the mountain. We’ll be out of the snow, and it’ll be fine,’ ” Stowell said. “But it just turned terrible. It was just like a blizzard up there.” Temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and as much as 18 inches of snow fell in strong wind. Rescuers using snowmobiles and other vehicles caught up with runners on the route and got them out of the mountains, KSL-TV reports. All runners were accounted for by 2:45 p.m.\n\nVermont\n\nWeybridge: After erosion washed away some graves at an old cemetery near a riverbank, the remains of two Revolutionary War soldiers and others buried there will be moved to a new resting place. Revolutionary War soldier Josiah Clark, who fought at the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill in Massachusetts, was buried in the Stow cemetery in Weybridge in 1835. Erosion over the years left his grave perched on the edge of the steep eroding bank, so his bones were exhumed in 2019. Revolutionary War soldier William Haven is also buried there, a bit farther back from the bank. The roughly 20 graves eventually will be moved to the Old Weybridge Hill Cemetery. An archeological team from the University of Vermont is now working to remove graves along the bank, starting with the ones most at risk, Tom Giffin, president of the Vermont Old Cemetery Association, said Monday. “I feel relieved that they’ll not be washed over the bank and go down Otter Creek. I thought that was awful wrong,” Giffin said. “My big thing is this is a history of the United States, as well as a history of Vermont, as well as a history of Weybridge.” The archeological team, including students, started its work last week, and the first reinternments are expected to take place next spring.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: More than $33 million in U.S. Department of Justice grants has been awarded to 26 Virginia-based public and nonprofit organizations to fund programs that address violence against women, a federal prosecutor says. Acting U.S. Attorney Raj Parekh said in a news release Friday that the grants will provide funding and essential services to vulnerable communities – especially women, people with disabilities and immigrants – who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. The department’s Office on Violence Against Women selected organizations from across the Eastern District of Virginia to receive funding through 42 separate grants. The money will allow the organizations to better address a wide variety of needs and issues facing victims of domestic and sexual violence. The recipients include state government entities that provide services throughout the commonwealth, as well as nongovernmental organizations that provide technical training and assistance nationwide. In addition, grants were awarded to universities to combat domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking on campus. Multiple nonprofit organizations that provide direct services to victims and survivors in the district also received funding.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A mandatory payroll tax to fund the state’s new long-term care program will start coming out of most workers’ paychecks in January. The insurance benefit, dubbed the WA Cares Fund, is a first-in-nation public insurance program aimed at helping older residents age in their own homes, The Seattle Times reports. The plan, signed into law in 2019 through the Long Term Care Trust Act, will use a 0.58% payroll tax to pay up to a $36,500 benefit for individuals to pay for home health care and an array of services related to long-term health care including equipment, transportation and meal assistance. The plan is expected to save $3.9 billion in state Medicaid costs by 2052, and eligible beneficiaries will be able to begin collecting benefits starting in 2025. The program has drawn both ire and praise from advocacy groups and politicians. Advocates cite a rapidly aging population and high premiums on the current private long-term care market, while critics have lambasted the plan as expensive, unnecessary and inflexible in terms of eligibility and payout.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nDavis: Two locations have been added to a new program to protect rare plant and animal species. Bald Knob and the Canaan Valley wetlands are the first sites in the West Virginia Natural Areas Program, the state Division of Natural Resources said in a news release. The program places extra protection on areas with significant conservation needs under the agency’s administration. Both areas are within the Canaan Valley Resort State Park. The areas include more than 2,200 acres of rare conifer swamps and red spruce forest with more than 40 rare plants, 12 rare invertebrates and several animals unique to the area, the agency said. “These two areas have the state’s highest concentration of federally listed species and species of greatest conservation need, and this designation is going to give us the awareness and resources we need to make sure they are properly managed,” said Scott Warner, the division’s assistant chief of wildlife diversity.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: Gov. Tony Evers issued a formal apology Monday for the state’s role in Native American boarding schools, joining with tribal leaders at an Indigenous Peoples Day event. Evers signed an executive order that also formally supported the previously announced U.S. Department of the Interior investigation into the schools and asked that anything done in Wisconsin be conducted in consultation with the state’s tribes. Wisconsin is home to 11 recognized American Indian tribes. Starting with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the U.S. enacted laws and policies to establish and support Indian boarding schools across the nation. For more than 150 years, Indigenous children were taken from their communities and forced into boarding schools that focused on assimilation. Records show that Wisconsin was home to at least 10 day and boarding schools attended by thousands of American Indian children between the 1860s and 1970s, the governor’s office said. Additionally, hundreds of children were sent from Wisconsin to attend out-of-state schools, the governor’s office said. The lack of available and reliable documentation related to the schools makes it challenging to know the full scope of what happened in Wisconsin, Evers’ office said.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: A lab at the University of Wyoming is monitoring wastewater in six communities to track the coronavirus’ presence in the state, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Funded by an $800,000 state grant, the university’s College of Agriculture and Natural Resources is regularly testing wastewater from Cowley, Deaver, Hudson, Laramie, Pinedale and Powell as part of a 30-town tracking effort to see where COVID-19 may be going undetected, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/17/rare-butterfly-spotted-gator-attack-georgia-guidestones-news-from-around-50-states/50499899/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Public officials said they have identified the state’s first known cases of monkeypox, a disease that has emerged in more than 50 countries and most U.S. states. The Alabama Department of Public Health said in news releases that two cases have been identified. The first was in Mobile County and the second in Jefferson County. Dr. Rendi Murphree, an epidemiologist with the Mobile County Health Department, said monkeypox can be transmitted through close person-to-person contact.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Authorities are searching for a grandmother whose 2-year-old grandchild was found alone and abandoned for two days in a locked car that was stuck in mud on a rural Alaska road. The search for Mary Dawn Wilson, 69, is being concentrated around the community of Healy, Alaska State Troopers said. The abandoned Ford Focus was found Thursday on Stampede Road, just outside Healy and off the Parks Highway. The child appeared to be in good health and was handed over to the state Office of Children’s Services, the statement said. Officials said evidence in the car indicated that the child and car were abandoned Tuesday when the vehicle became stuck, troopers said. There were indications she tried to free the car, Alaska State Troopers spokesperson Tim DeSpain said. Wilson was the last known person with the child, the statement said,\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:There has been a sharp decrease in traffic fatalities in Arizona this year after a deadlier-than-usual year in 2021, according to preliminary data from the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. Traffic fatalities between January and June fell from 626 deaths in 2021 to 350 deaths in 2022 – a 44% decrease. Although the data provided didn’t offer a monthly breakdown of alcohol-related traffic fatalities, the current count of 51 alcohol-related deaths is far less than half of 2021’s 230 total death count.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The St. Scholastica Benedictine Sisters said they have begun to demolish their former monastery building. The monastery, built in 1924, was considered unsafe and unlivable. It had sustained flooding, mold and wall damage, the sisters reported. In February 2019, the sisters moved out of the monastery to live in a more energy-efficient building. “The decision to demolish the former Monastery Building is not one that the Benedictine Sisters made lightly or without years of research and discernment,” according to a news release. Work to demolish the monastery had been planned for June but started July 11.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The international terminal at San Francisco International Airport was evacuated on Friday night after a bomb threat, and authorities found a potentially incendiary device, officials said. One person is in custody. The bomb threat was reported about 8:15 p.m. and authorities discovered a suspicious package, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Investigators at the airport “deemed the item possibly incendiary.” A man was taken into custody but other details were not immediately available. The terminal was evacuated “out of an abundance of caution,” police said. Hundreds of travelers were forced to leave the terminal.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A flash flood rushed through Buckhorn Canyon on Friday night, killing two people and destroying a house. Multiple reports of flash flooding in the Crystal Mountain and Glen Haven areas started coming in shortly before 5 p.m., Larimer County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson David Moore said. Included in those calls was a report of a camping trailer that had been washed away in the upper-to-middle section of the canyon with an adult woman and a female child inside. Crews immediately started searching for them, and both were found dead at about 7:30 p.m., Moore said. The area in Larimer County received nearly an inch of rain in a short period of time, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Connecticut Lottery Corp. has settled a lawsuit filed by its former vice president over the handling of her complaint to the FBI of possible wrongdoing in the quasi-public agency. Under the settlement agreement, obtained in an open records request by The Hartford Courant, Chelsea Turner and her attorneys will be paid $450,000 and she is absolved of any wrongdoing. Turner was suspended from her job in July 2019, a week after she testified at an administrative hearing about how she had contacted a friend of hers in the FBI in 2014 about possible wrongdoing by another lottery official. An FBI investigation ended with no charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A rare Hessel’s hairstreak butterfly was spotted in southern Delaware earlier this year, the first time anyone had seen the endangered species on the Delmarva Peninsula since 1995. The two-tailed, iridescent-green butterfly has a wingspan of just an inch and lives atop Atlantic white cedar trees, which are somewhat rare themselves. Hessel’s hairstreaks in Sussex County are “in the middle” of known populations in the New Jersey Pine Barrens and southeastern Virginia.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Members of the DC Council are calling on Mayor Muriel Bowser to act as Arizona and Texas officials continue to bus hundreds of migrants to Union Station, WUSA-TV reported. Gov. Greg Abbott and other Texas officials started busing people seeking asylum to D.C. in April after the state voiced opposition to President Joe Biden lifting Title 42, a public health policy that allowed the government to quickly expel migrants and asylum seekers who come to the U.S. from countries where an infectious disease is present. A letter from 10 councilmembers called on District government to provide contingency funding toward the purchase of travel tickets, food, petty cash, cellphones and emergent medical needs of arrivals until it receives money from federal or philanthropic entities to address the issue. Bowser’s office has not responded to multiple requests from WUSA-TV about efforts to assist asylum seekers.\n\nFlorida\n\nEnglewood: Authorities said a Florida woman was found dead after falling in a pond and being grabbed by two alligators. The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office told news outlets the elderly woman was seen falling into the pond along a golf course in Englewood late Friday and struggling to stay afloat. While she was in the water, two alligators were seen grabbing her, authorities said. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Two alligators have been removed from the area, but it’s not known whether those were the reptiles involved. The cause of death has not been determined. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says alligators are more active when temperatures rise.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens:Law enforcement continued to try and identify the person who bombed the Georgia Guidestones in Elberton, but tips from the public have slowed. “The amount of leads have definitely slowed, but we’re still getting a few through telephone calls,” said Jesse Maddox, an agent for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. “We haven’t been able to put anything new out because there’s nothing new.” The Guidestones, known as America’s Stonehenge and erected in 1980 in Elbert County, were heavily damaged during the predawn hours of July 6. Residents in the area off Georgia Highway 77 heard the loud blast. There have been some discussions in Elbert County of rebuilding the monument, which became a popular tourist destination, but no decisions have been made. Anyone with information is asked to contact the GBI office in Athens at (706) 552-2309. Anonymous tips can be submitted at (800) 597-8477.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A Pittsburgh man who was charged with manslaughter in the strangulation death of a college buddy he was vacationing with in Hawaii was found not guilty by a jury. Jurors reached their verdict last week after a trial on the Big Island, where Benjamin Fleming was vacationing with two friends he knew since attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. They were staying at a vacation rental in Kailua-Kona last year when a night out drinking ended in a deadly fight. Fleming was charged with manslaughter after an autopsy showed that Abhishek Gupta of Pittsburgh was strangled. Authorities said an argument between the men turned physical.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant in eastern Idaho designed to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste that has had numerous setbacks appears to be making progress, officials said. The U.S. Department of Energy said lastg week the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory recently treated more than 100,000 gallons of simulant over seven weeks. The department plans additional testing and then a shutdown to make sure the plant is ready for radioactive waste. The department said increasing amounts of radioactive waste will be mixed with simulant when the plant is fully operational. The department didn’t give a timeline.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield:About 150 Lutheran High School students will be displaced because of mine subsidence at the facility on the far west side of the city. Subsidence is the sinking of land surface, commonly resulting from underground mining. The problems, including cracking of walls and dropping of floors, were discovered by staff members a little over two weeks ago, said Zack Klug, the interim principal. Students’ families were informed by the school’s board of directors via email Saturday. Klug said he received a report from a Springfield engineering firm recommending the move. Engineers from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Illinois Mine Subsidence Insurance Fund have also done inspections on the school, which was built in 1978, and have recommended the building not be occupied. Klug said engineers told him a newer part of the high school, dating from 2017, is safe. Staff will stay there now until a better plan is developed, Klug said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Weeks of heat and scant rainfall have left most of Indiana facing either drought or unusually dry conditions while farmers hope significant precipitation falls soon. The U.S. Drought Monitor showed more than a third of Indiana with abnormally dry conditions and another 44% of the state gripped by a moderate drought centered over central, western and southwestern Indiana. Moderate drought or abnormally dry conditions cover nearly 80% of the state as of Tuesday, according to Thursday’s national drought update.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Police identified the 11-year-old girl who drowned Wednesday in the Raccoon River. At about 5:57 p.m. Wednesday, Des Moines police and fire department rescue personnel responded to the river in a wooded area northeast of the 6000 block of Creston Avenue after a child fell into the water. Diamond Mathis, 11, reportedly got off a raft on which she was floating with two other children, went under the water and did not resurface, Des Moines Police spokesperson Sgt. Paul Parizek said in a news release. Officers from the Metro STAR Unit located Mathis’ body about 12:20 p.m. Friday in the Raccoon River near where she was last seen.\n\nKansas\n\nLansing: The state prison in Lansing was placed on lockdown Friday night after a fight among inmates sent one prisoner to a hospital and left at least three corrections employees injured. The incident happened about 7 p.m. in a section of the facility that houses violent offenders, said Sarah LaFrenz, a spokeswoman for state Department of Corrections officials. She added the event led to the “loss of control” over one part of the prison. Corrections spokesman Randall Bowman confirmed in a text message the hospitalized inmate was stabbed. He said the rest of the facility had been placed on lockdown as a precautionary measure. A tactical unit was deployed during the altercation and additional staffing brought in from other facilities. All men had returned to their cells “with minimal resistance” by about 10:30 p.m., corrections officials said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Leak detection and repair crews have identified and fixed waterlines in the western Kentucky town of Marion – work that’s estimated to be saving more than 100,000 gallons of water a day, Gov. Andy Beshear’s office said. An engineering report will lay out the scope of work needed to complete a water connection from Marion to Sturgis Water Co., the governor said. The Kentucky National Guard continues to distribute bottled water. More than 398,000 bottles of water provided by the state and from donations have been handed out, he said. Beshear declared a state of emergency in Marion after the town of nearly 3,000 people began running out of water when a levee was breached on Lake George – the town’s main water supply.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:The ramp on Interstate 20 eastbound to I-220 westbound (Exit 26 near Louisiana Downs) will be closed Monday as part of the ongoing I-20/I-220 Barksdale Air Force Base Interchange Project, which began in May 2019. The closure is expected to take approximately two months. During that time, construction on a new segment of roadway will be built extending southward leading to a new access point to the base. The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development will have detour signs in place for an alternate route.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The U.S. House approved a bill that would allow Native American tribes bound by a state land claims settlement in Maine to get the benefit from federal laws going forward. The proposal, attached to a defense bill approved Thursday, won’t change how the tribes are treated under state law but would update federal law to allow future laws passed by Congress to apply to the tribes. U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who introduced the bill, said tribes in Maine deserve the same benefits as other federally recognized tribes under federal law. The proposal faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Chief Kirk Francis of the Penobscot Nation said in a statement Friday that tribal members “look forward to working with our senators on getting final passage through Congress this year.” Wabanaki tribes in Maine are governed by the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980, which stipulates they’re bound by state law. That sets them apart from the other 570 federally recognized tribes. Both chambers of the Maine Legislature advanced a bill to amend the land claims settlement to restore rights that tribes forfeited, but it stalled under a threat of veto from Democratic Gov. Janet Mills.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Demand is surging for concealed carry permits in Maryland in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. The Washington Post reported Friday that Maryland State Police said they have received 11 times the usual number of permit applications to carry a gun. The surge came after Gov. Larry Hogan’s order to bring the state in line with the high court’s ruling on June 23. Hogan directed state police on July 5 to suspend the state’s “good and substantial reason” standard for permits to carry handguns. The threshold for that standard included showing a person’s life is in danger from threats or working in a job that could put them in contact with people who are dangerous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city and the union representing about 10,000 teachers and other employees of the city’s public school system have reached a tentative contract agreement that provides for pay raises and an overhaul of the way the district approaches special education, both sides said in a statement. The contract came at a time of transition for the troubled system, which recently hired a new superintendent and staved off a state takeover by pledging to implement immediate improvement efforts in several key areas. The agreement announced Thursday includes additional investments to support the changes needed for special education, including funding for additional support for students with individualized education programs and English learners. The three-year agreement also includes annual wage increases of 2.5%, plus an additional 2% over the length of the contract. The deal now requires ratification by union membership and approval by the Boston School Committee.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:About 200 people attended the Detroit Police 2nd Precinct’s vigil Friday afternoon in honor of Officer Loren Courts, 40, who was killed in the line of duty July 6. Courts was fatally shot when he and his partner, Amanda Hudgens, 29, responded to a call about shots fired in the Fiskhorn neighborhood on Detroit’s west side. The shooter, later identified as Ehmani Davis, 19, died when other officers on the scene returned fire. Neighborhood resident Shawna Lancaster, who witnessed the incident, attended the vigil in a homemade T-shirt featuring Courts leaning against his vehicle. “I am one of the people he saved,” she said tearfully. “Showing up – this is the least I can do.” Detroit Police Chief James White led the vigil, which was attended by members of Courts’ extended family. “We’re rocked and we are hurt,” he said, speaking on behalf of the police department, “we are rocked, but we are not defeated.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The number of people who died of drug overdoses in Minnesota climbed by more than 20% last year. State Department of Health records showed at least 1,286 people in Minnesota died of overdoses in 2021. And, most of the deaths were caused by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, which saw a 32% increase in fatal overdoses compared to 2020. About 450 other deaths were caused by methamphetamine overdoses and 151 were caused by cocaine. Minnesota’s numbers mirror increased drug overdose deaths across the country as fentanyl has been mixed with other drugs such as cocaine.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A $1.6 million lawsuit is the latest development in the ongoing garbage contract dispute in Jackson. WAPT-TV reported Friday that Richard’s Disposal filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi and is seeking more than $1.6 million in restitution. The New Orleans-based company has been collecting trash in Jackson since April 1 but has yet to be paid because the Jackson City Council said the company does not have an approved contract. Earlier this week a judge ruled Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba did not have the power veto a contract the city council had not approved. Judge Larry Roberts issued his ruling Friday in a dispute among Jackson officials over who will be paid to collect garbage, news outlets reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nGrain Valley: An intoxicated pilot was arrested after landing a small aircraft early Friday on Interstate 70 southeast of Kansas City after radioing that he had run out of fuel, authorities said. The landing at about 2:30 a.m. east of Grain Valley, roughly 20 miles southeast of Kansas City, closed westbound lanes of the highway for more than 21/ 2 hours, KCTV reported. The plane had a “minor collision” with a guardrail but otherwise didn’t hit anything, the Missouri State Highway Patrol tweeted. The pilot was the only person on board. He suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital for treatment after his arrest, the patrol said. Online records showed the single-engine plane was 19 minutes into its flight from Warrensburg, Missouri, which is located about 20 miles southeast of the landing site. The patrol said the pilot radioed that he had run out of fuel and had to make an emergency landing on the highway.\n\nMontana\n\nDenton: A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the site of the Wolf Creek Bridge, which was rebuilt after a wildfire in December. The Montana Department of Transportation, Frontier West, and Morrison Maierle worked in a short time frame to reopen the bridge. The west entrance road to Denton was burned down by a fire in December. The outdated bridge has since been rebuilt to withstand various weather conditions and meet current codes. Kyle Dubbs of the Montana Department of Transportation said the old structure was a wooden bridge. The recent construction has allowed for safety slopes to be added, the road to be widened, with better drainage and a steel structure.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway now controls nearly 20% of Occidental Petroleum’s stock after picking up another $250 million worth of shares of the oil producer last week. Berkshire has been investing heavily in Occidental this year, including buying up more than $1.2 billion of the Houston-based company’s stock this month. After the latest purchases that Berkshire disclosed Wednesday, Buffett’s Omaha-based conglomerate now owns nearly 180 million Occidental shares worth more than $10 billion. That gives Berkshire control of 19.2% of the company.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The corporate owner of several Las Vegas-area casinos said Friday it plans to demolish three shuttered hotel towers and sell the properties that have been closed since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. Red Rock Resorts said its Texas Station in North Las Vegas, neighboring Fiesta Rancho in Las Vegas and the Fiesta Henderson property will be razed “to reposition the land for sale,” although an ice rink at Fiesta Rancho will remain open.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSeabrook: U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is requesting a full review of what caused an emergency alarm to be falsely activated at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station early last week after what she called “a breakdown in communications” transpired between the plant, state and local officials. The emergency alarm went off Tuesday morning, warning many in the area that there was a problem at the plant and advising them to evacuate the vicinity. The state Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency and NextEra Energy put out statements Tuesday saying the alarm was false more than 30 minutes after beachgoers in nearby Hampton and Rye said they heard announcements at about 11 a.m. about the beaches being closed because of a problem at the plant. Brian Booth, the plant’s site vice president, sent a letter to Gov. Chris Sununu on Friday, saying the siren system was inadvertently activated during routine testing. He wrote the company is investigating and will take steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again, WMUR-TV reported. The plant is about 40 miles north of Boston and 10 miles south of Portsmouth. It has operated since 1990.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBlairstown: A girl who was dubbed Princess Doe after her remains were found 40 years ago in a New Jersey cemetery has been identified as Dawn Olanick, 17, of West Babylon, New York, authorities announced Friday. Charges have been filed against the man they believe killed Olanick, the Warren County, New Jersey, prosecutor’s office announced. The suspect, Arthur Kinlaw, 68, is currently serving 20 years to life in Sullivan County, New York, on two first-degree murder convictions. Kinlaw tried to lure Olanick into prostitution and killed her after she refused, authorities said, according to Lehigh Valley Live. Her remains were found July 25, 1982, in Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, in northwestern New Jersey near the Pennsylvania border. Authorities have said she was beaten beyond recognition.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: County boards led by Republicans are urging New Mexico legislators to require photo identification at polling locations, approve new procedures for purging voter registration rolls and prohibit the use of ballot drop boxes that aren’t supervised directly by people. The Otero County commission in southern New Mexico on Thursday endorsed a resolution on a 3-0 vote that advocates for changes to the state election code. Sandoval County commissioners approved a nearly identical resolution in June after an outpouring of public anger over election procedures in the state’s June 7 primary. Residents of both counties have questioned the accuracy of election results and given voice to conspiracy theories about voting systems that have rippled across the country since former President Donald Trump lost re-election in 2020.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has a campaign war chest seven times the size of Republican challenger Lee Zeldin ahead of the November election. State campaign finance reports due Friday showed Hochul has $11.7 million in the bank, compared with $1.6 million reported by Zeldin, a U.S. representative from Long Island. The fundraising gap between the candidates is steep in a state where Democrats already have the voter registration edge and legislative super majorities.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: The flagship school of North Carolina’s university system said it has reached a settlement with the journalist who shunned the school in an extended dispute over tenure and joined a historically Black university. David Boliek, chairman of the Board of Trustees at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the settlement with Nikole Hannah-Jones was for less than $75,000 and was approved by school Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz, news outlets reported. Attorneys representing Hannah-Jones, including the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., last year threatened to take legal action, including filing a federal discrimination lawsuit, against UNC-Chapel Hill and its board of trustees over the failure to give her tenure, news outlets reported at the time. Boliek said the settlement reached by the university was to resolve that “potential legal action,” and that a formal lawsuit was never filed by Hannah-Jones’ attorneys.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: President Joe Biden has issued a major disaster declaration for many of North Dakota’s 53 counties which sustained damage caused during a series of snow storms in April. The declaration was approved for 40 of the state’s 53 counties, and allows for FEMA assistance to help recover from the storms’ damages. The spring storms knocked out power to more than 10,000 residents, caused more than $57 million in damage and later led to spring flooding.\n\nOhio\n\nMason:Kings Island’s Diamondback roller coaster celebrated a milestone recently, giving its 20 millionth ride, as 23-year-old Grace Timmons from Seymour, Indiana, became the coaster’s lucky rider according to a release from park officials. Timmons said she thought she was being pranked when she was informed of her lucky ride. “I was looking for the cameras,” she told park officials, after being assured it was not a prank. The Diamondback opened in 2009 and features a 230-foot first drop and 5,282 feet of track at speeds of up to 80 mph. Timmons received Diamondback-themed gifts to commemorate the event. Kings Island’s 50th Anniversary continues at the park until Labor Day weekend.\n\nOklahoma\n\nDavenport: The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority is planning to add new connections for Davenport and 13 other towns along Route 66, communities that hope the access will bring them new businesses and residents. The turnpike authority has been embroiled in conflict since it announced plans for Access Oklahoma, a 15-year, $5 billion plan to expand the state’s toll road network. The authority is being sued over plans to build toll roads between Oklahoma City and Norman that opponents said will uproot more than 600 homes and businesses. But in towns like Davenport, which once considered themselves economic victims of past turnpike expansions, the new plans are receiving much warmer responses. The new Davenport interchange is one of 14 planned along the Turner, Indian Nation, H.E. Bailey, Kilpatrick and Cimarron turnpikes as part of Access Oklahoma.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The central section of the State Capitol building has closed for extensive renovations as part of the yearslong Capitol Accessibility, Maintenance and Safety project. Colloquially known as the ’38 building (because it was constructed in 1938), this part of the Capitol includes the visitor’s area, gift shop, both House and Senate chambers, offices for the Secretary of State and State Treasurer and the iconic rotunda. It also houses many of the nonpolitical legislative agencies, as well as working areas for journalists and lobbyists. The ‘38 building is scheduled to reopen in January 2025, in time for the start of the legislative session that year. The Capitol wings will remain open throughout the project to lawmakers, staff and the public. The wings were constructed in 1977 and contain the offices for each representative and senator, as well as legislative leadership office suites.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJennerstown: Six of the nine men trapped in a flooded mine in southwestern Pennsylvania two decades ago gathered at a raceway over the weekend to kick off 20th anniversary celebrations of the dramatic rescue that ended their 77-hour ordeal. The six took in the races at Jennerstown Speedway in Somerset County, only miles from the Quecreek Mine, sitting with former Pennsylvania Gov. Mark Schweiker, news outlets reported. Blaine Mayhugh, John Phillippi, John Unger, Robert Pugh, Ronald Hileman, and Thomas “Tucker” Foy came to the track at intermission to applause from the crowd. Miners broke through stone into the uncharted mine shaft on the night of July 24, 2002, releasing millions of gallons of water and trapping them more than 200 feet below the surface. Crews drilled a small shaft and lowered a small metal capsule, bringing them up one by one until the last was lifted to safety early on the morning of July 28.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A woman sitting in the outdoor eating area of a restaurant died after she was struck by a vehicle, police said. The driver was traveling through the parking lot of Tommy’s Clam Shack on Friday afternoon and inadvertently hit the accelerator, striking a couple who were sitting at a table, police said. The woman, identified as Susan Hjerpe, 66, suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to a hospital, where she later died, police said. Her husband, Carl, also was hospitalized and is in stable condition. Police said Saturday an accident reconstruction team is still investigating the incident.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Some scientists said water seeping deep into the ground might be causing a swarm of earthquakes in the midlands region of South Carolina. More than 60 earthquakes have been recorded since December in an area near the towns of Lugoff and Eglin, about 20 miles northeast of Columbia. Now, some geologists suggested an initial December quake might have allowed water from the Wateree River to seep into new cracks opened by the quake, setting off additional temblors. The idea is that water moving above ground can increase pressure on water below ground. That downward pressure, in turn, can cause the earth to move. “We think it probably ought to be looked into,’’ said Scott Howard, the state’s chief geologist with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Five earthquakes with a magnitude of more than 3 have been recorded in the area. The largest quake was 3.6 in magnitude last month, an event that was felt across the region.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nLead: In a former gold mine a mile underground, inside a titanium tank filled with a rare liquified gas, scientists have begun the search for what has been unfindable: dark matter. Scientists are pretty sure the invisible stuff makes up most of the universe’s mass and said we wouldn’t be here without it – but they don’t know what it is. The race to solve this enormous mystery has brought one team to the depths under Lead. The idea is that a mile of dirt and rock, a giant tank, a second tank and the purest titanium in the world will block nearly all the cosmic rays and particles that zip around – and through – all of us every day. But dark matter particles, scientists believe, can avoid all of those obstacles. They hope one will fly into the vat of liquid xenon in the inner tank and smash into a xenon nucleus like two balls in a game of pool, revealing its existence in a flash of light seen by a device called “the time projection chamber.” By the time the experiment finishes, the chance of finding dark matter with this device is “probably less than 50% but more than 10%,” said Hugh Lippincott, a physicist and spokesman for the experiment in a Thursday news conference.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city of Madisonville has been given Main Street accreditation, the state said. Madisonville joins 42 other Tennessee communities that are accredited through the state program and Main Street America, part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the state Economic and Community Development Department said. Madisonville is the county seat of Monroe County in southeast Tennessee. The program offers training, support and grant opportunities to help with downtown revitalization projects.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Some hospitals in Texas have reportedly refused to treat patients with major pregnancy complications for fear of violating the state’s abortion ban, the Texas Medical Association said in a letter last week. The association did not name the hospitals but said it has received complaints that hospitals, administrators and their attorneys might be prohibiting doctors from providing medically appropriate care in some situations, The Dallas Morning News reported. Texas law bans most abortions after about six weeks of a pregnancy. A total ban – that includes an exemptions if a woman’s life or health is danger – will take effect in the coming weeks following last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A recount will be required in the Republican primary race for Utah House District 72 after Toquerville businessman Joe Elison beat Hurricane businessman Willie Billings by just seven votes. In the final results canvassed Tuesday by the Washington County Commission, Elison had 4,131 votes to 4,124 for Billings, giving him the inside track to represent the eastern part of Washington County in the state Legislature. State law allows for a recount if the race is within .25% once all the counting is done, but the losing candidate needs to request it. Billings submitted a letter to the county clerk’s office officially making that request.\n\nVermont\n\nMiddlebury: A sheriff arrested on June 28 by the state police on multiple charges related to sexual and domestic assault pleaded not guilty and was then expected to be released on unsecured $100,000 bail. Peter Newton, 50, of Middlebury entered the pleas during an afternoon court appearance in Burlington, outside Addison County where the sheriff was arrested while he was conducting contractor work at a construction job site in his hometown. During the arraignment, Newton was served with what in Vermont is called an extreme risk protection order – known more generically in other states as a red-flag law – that prevents him from possessing firearms.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Quarantining after exposure to COVID-19 is no longer recommended for unvaccinated, asymptomatic children in child care, K-12 schools and camp settings, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said. The guidance announced Thursday night by the Republican governor’s office also said masking is no longer routinely recommended in those settings, except in limited circumstances. The latest guidance said people who test positive still should isolate at home, regardless of vaccination status, and those who have symptoms should begin isolation and undergo testing. Youngkin said the guidance, which is a departure from federal recommendations, is aimed at easing the strain on work and family life many parents of young children have experienced as care and school settings have closed for quarantine periods in response to a small numbers of cases.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two voting change options will be on the November ballot after the Seattle City Council approved an alternative to a signature-driven effort – and either would change the city’s primary election process. In a special meeting Thursday, the council OK’d asking voters to consider ranked-choice voting alongside approval voting, The Seattle Times reported. Voters currently choose one candidate in a primary election and the top two proceed to the general election. The move away from more traditional voting has gained momentum across the country as advocates seek more equitable elections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Eligible West Virginia households will receive a one-time summer feeding benefit for children, the state Department of Education said. The program will provide $391 per eligible child to be deposited onto the child’s West Virginia-Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer card, the department said. The funds can be expected during August. The state estimated the funding will go to approximately 255,000 children, representing nearly $100 million in additional federal funding, the department said in a news release. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and administered by the state Education Department and the state Health and Human Resources Department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge ruled against the state prison system Thursday, saying its COVID-19 visitor policy that barred Catholic clergy from meeting with inmates for more than a year violated state law and the state constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee filed a lawsuit in 2021 demanding state corrections officials relax their COVID-19 protocols and allow ministers to visit inmates. The policy was in place from March 13, 2020, until June 21, 2021. The archdiocese alleged that the Department of Corrections’ policy prevented clergy from the archdiocese from meeting in-person with inmates to provide spiritual guidance, communion and penance, violating a state law that grants clergy of all faiths weekly visits with prisoners and inmates’ constitutional right to freedom of religion. Attorneys and DOC employees such as psychologists and social workers were allowed to see inmates under the policy if the visitors followed health and safety protocols such as temperature checks, coronavirus tests and wearing masks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Harriet Hageman, former President Donald Trump’s pick to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the race for Wyoming’s lone House seat, holds 52%-30% lead in a new poll, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. No other challenger received more than 5% support. Only 11% of voters were undecided.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/19/flag-fix-fire-starters-piggie-pageant-news-around-states/50252431/", "title": "Flag fix, fire starters: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville: Three former workers at a church day care center have been indicted on more than three dozen charges of abusing children ages 2 and younger, some of whom were harmed on video, authorities said Tuesday. A special grand jury returned charges after watching security videos that showed children being hit, kicked and punched, according to court records and prosecutor C.J. Robinson, who spoke at a news conference. “When you have videos in crimes of this nature, it leaves very little doubt,” he said. The 44 total charges against Susan Baker, of Prattville, Leah Livingston, of Wetumpka, and Alicia Sorrells, of Deatsville, stem from their work at a day care operated by Journey Church of the River Region, Robinson said. All three women were arrested earlier this month. Each person was indicted on charges of child abuse and failure to report child abuse, officials said. An attorney for Sorrells said she will be acquitted once jurors consider the evidence. Livingston doesn’t have an attorney to speak on her behalf, and a lawyer for Baker wasn’t immediately available. Church leaders have cooperated in the investigation, Robinson said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State lawmakers tasked with negotiating a budget deal reached a tentative agreement Tuesday that would pay residents more than $3,000 this year, but the final amount would depend on whether the Legislature can muster the votes needed to access a key savings account. The tentative agreement calls for a dividend from the state’s oil-wealth fund in the range of $2,500 this year, plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. However, half the funding for the energy check would come from a budget reserve account that requires three-fourths support in each the House and Senate to access. Payments to residents could be about $3,200 or $3,850 depending on whether the vote threshold is reached, according to estimates shared with reporters by the office of Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, the Senate Finance Committee co-chair. He chaired the conference committee, which met for the first time Sunday and announced the tentative agreement Tuesday, the day before the legislative session was scheduled to end. The negotiated package is subject to a vote by the House and Senate. Stedman said the budget is a good one, with a “healthy dividend,” capital projects around Alaska, and attention to K-12 education and the university system. He said the dividend is a “sensitive issue” to negotiate, with splits among lawmakers over what the size should be.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two more bills restricting responses to the coronavirus pandemic are heading to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey’s desk, including one that would affect the ability of future state leaders to respond to another airborne disease and a second blocking the state from ever requiring schoolchildren to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Tuesday’s state Senate votes were the latest moves by GOP lawmakers to limit what they have called government overreach. The Republican-controlled Senate approved a bill that would ban any state or local government agency from requiring face masks to be worn in their buildings. The measure already passed the House and got no support in either chamber from minority Democrats. They have argued it removes one of the most effective measures to prevent the spread of a respiratory disease like COVID-19. Senators also approved a bill barring the state Health Services Department from adding a COVID-19 vaccine to the list of inoculations required to attend public schools. It replaces a measure passed last year that only banned mandates for vaccines given federal emergency use authorizations. That measure, too, is heading to the governor’s desk and got no support from minority Democrats.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has raised another $601,000 in her bid for governor, continuing to far outpace her Republican and Democratic rivals. Sanders, who is seeking the Republican nomination in the state’s May 24 primary, reported having more than $7 million cash on hand for her campaign. Monday was the deadline for campaigns to file their monthly fundraising reports with the state. Sanders faces former talk radio host Doc Washburn in the GOP primary. Sanders reported spending more than $838,000 last month. She has raised nearly $15 million since launching her campaign last year. Chris Jones, the front-runner in fundraising among the five Democrats seeking the party’s nomination, raised more than $161,000 last month and spent more than $147,000. Jones has raised $1.8 million since entering the governor’s race and has about $108,000 on hand. The other candidates seeking the Democratic nomination are Anthony Bland, James “Rus” Russell, Jay Martin and Supha Xayprasith-Mays.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Dozens of environmental and anti-nuclear organizations expressed opposition Tuesday to any attempt to extend the life of California’s last operating nuclear power plant, challenging suggestions that its electricity is needed to meet potential future shortages in the nation’s most populous state. Last month, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom raised the possibility that the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant – which sits on a coastal bluff halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles – could keep running beyond a scheduled closing by 2025. His office said the governor is in favor of “keeping all options on the table to ensure we have a reliable (electricity) grid.” In a letter to Newsom, groups that included San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace, the Oregon Conservancy Foundation, the Snake River Alliance and the Ohio Nuclear Free Network said the plant is old, unsafe and too close to earthquake faults that pose a threat to the twin reactors. “Your suggestion to extend the operational life of the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility is an outrage,” they wrote. “Diablo Canyon is dangerous, dirty and expensive. It must retire as planned.” The Democratic governor has no direct authority over the operating license for the plant. He floated the idea that owner Pacific Gas & Electric could seek a share of $6 billion in federal funding the Biden administration established to rescue nuclear plants at risk of closing.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who shot and wounded two demonstrators while apparently aiming at a Jeep that was headed toward the crowd during a protest to bring attention to police violence in suburban Denver in 2020 was sentenced Tuesday to 120 days in jail followed by five years of probation. Samuel Young, 24, had been convicted in March of two counts of second-degree assault, four counts of attempted manslaughter and a single count of illegally discharging his gun, The Denver Post reports. “It all happened so fast, there was no time to think, just to react,” Young said in court. “My reaction was wrong. … I cannot take bullets back. I immediately regretted what I’d done and wanted to repair the damage.” Several hundred people who attended the July 2020 protest in Aurora had walked onto a highway and blocked all its lanes. A Jeep approached from behind the protesters and headed toward the crowd, prompting Young to fire five shots. Two hit the back of the Jeep, and two hit fellow protesters. One man was shot in the leg and another grazed in the head. A woman also broke her leg when she leaped from the highway. The driver, who pulled off the highway and contacted police, was not charged. The protest was organized in support of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after being injected with ketamine by first responders called to the scene of an arrest.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Justice has given the green light to National Guard members on active duty for their states to join labor unions, despite a U.S. law that makes it a felony for military personnel on active federal duty to unionize. The agreement, finalized Tuesday, settles a lawsuit filed in federal court in Connecticut by labor unions against Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department, seeking collective bargaining rights for Connecticut National Guard members on state duty ordered by the governor. Already, the case has prompted some National Guard members in Texas to unionize. A 1978 federal law makes it a criminal felony for members of the armed forces, including the National Guard, to join or attempt to form a labor organization. But the statute only applies to service members when they are on active federal duty ordered by U.S. military officials, according to the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School, which represented the unions in the lawsuit, filed in November. “Before this case, unions were understandably deterred from organizing state active duty National Guard members due to the potential for criminal penalties,” Rekha Kennedy, a Yale law student working for the clinic, said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Staffing challenges mean there won’t be lifeguards at the Savannah and Johnnie Walker beaches this summer, a city official said. City Manager Ann Marie Townshend said the city was not in a position to safely guard the two municipal beaches. The city didn’t want to inadequately staff the beaches and create a “false sense of security,” she said. The city intends to return to a full lifeguarding staff in the future, Townshend said. Meanwhile, people should continue following beach rules and be careful while swimming and enjoying the beach, she said. Many Delaware resort towns have increased pay or benefits to attract more summer employees. Lewes recently increased lifeguard pay from $13.49 per hour to $16 per hour to compete with neighboring municipalities. In the past, Lewes has had lifeguards patrolling from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the summer. Last year, Lewes hired eight lifeguards, two fewer than has been typical. Beaches were unguarded for a weekend in August due to low staffing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: This Friday the district is celebrating Bike to Work Day, encouraging locals to reduce their carbon footprint and get some exercise to boot, WUSA-TV reports. Another incentive: The price of gas in the Washington metro area is at a 10-year high, with the cost per gallon in the district averaging $4.84 as of Wednesday, according to Gas Buddy. The Bike to Work Day tradition is coordinated by a network of transportation organizations in the D.C. area called Commuter Connections, as well as the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. The first 15,000 people who register online to participate are eligible to receive a free T-shirt at any of the event’s pit stops. There are more than 100 pit stops for Bike to Work Day, located throughout D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Those who register will be entered into a raffle to win a free bike donated BicycleSPACE, Three Points Cycles and Bikes@Vienna. Those looking for a biking buddy can join a free Bike to Work convoy led by experienced biking commuters. And Capital Bike Share is offering free unlimited rides of up to 45 minutes per trip on its standard bikes. Its e-bikes will be offered at 10 cents per minute. Bike to Work Day in D.C. started with a small group of riders in 2001, and by 2017 the day saw an all-time high of 18,700 people participating.\n\nFlorida\n\nBunnell: A 17-year-old gay student who was suspended for leading protests at his high school against the state’s so-called Don’t Say Gay legislation says school administrators are now stopping him from running for senior class president. Because of the disciplinary infractions he received for leading the protests at Flagler Palm Coast High School in March, school administrators are preventing him for running for the elected student body office, Jack Petocz said in a letter posted on Twitter on Tuesday. The school is located about 30 miles north of Daytona Beach. “I am continuing to be punished for standing up for my identity and against widespread hatred,” Petocz wrote. “We shouldn’t be subject to abuse both in Tallahassee and at-home.” In an email, school district spokesman Jason Wheeler said Flagler Schools was not permitted to speak about individual students’ disciplinary records. Requirements for individual on-campus clubs or organizations are set by the schools or clubs themselves, he said. “The district has no say in setting those requirements or in how those requirements are enforced,” Wheeler said. Petocz is being honored next week with an award at the 2022 PEN America Literary Gala for organizing students to protest the Florida legislation and fighting book bans. PEN America is a New York-based nonprofit that advocates for free speech and is made up of novelists, journalists and other writers.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Republican head of the state election board said Tuesday that a recently released film alleging ballots were illegally collected and dropped off during the 2020 presidential election falsely suggests there were tens of thousands of illegitimate votes in Georgia. Still, State Election Board Chairman Matt Mashburn promised a “fair” investigation of its claims. “It’s not going to be a witch hunt,” he said at a meeting of the board. “It’s going to be done soberly and with great care by people who know what they’re doing.” The movie, called “2000 Mules,” paints an ominous picture suggesting Democrat-aligned ballot “mules” were supposedly paid to illegally collect and drop off ballots in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It has been praised by ex-President Donald Trump as exposing “great election fraud,” but election security experts say it is based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. Mashburn, who said he watched the film, said it suggested there were 92,000 “illegitimate, manufactured votes” in the state, but he said that’s not true. Even if a ballot is illegally dropped off, it goes through the same checks as other ballots to ensure the vote is legitimate, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Police Commission has narrowed down the competition for the next police chief to four finalists. Seven people vying for the job spent last week going through an assessment process that included a mock press conference. The four highest scorers advanced as finalists: Scott Ebner, Mike Lambert, Arthur “Joe” Logan and Ben Moszkowicz. Lambert and Moszkowicz are Honolulu police majors. Lambert heads the training division. Moszkowicz heads the traffic division. Logan is a retired Army major general who was head of the Hawaii National Guard. Ebner is a retired New Jersey state police lieutenant colonel. Out-of-state consultant PSI Services LLC was contracted for $145,777 to assess the candidates, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The commission will take over the remainder of the selection process, which includes allowing the public to interact with the finalists, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s been more than a year since former Chief Susan Ballard retired. Interim Chief Rade Vanic took his name out of the running for the permanent position in March, KITV reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Powerful state House Speaker Scott Bedke has won the GOP primary for lieutenant governor. The fourth-generation rancher who is generally considered an expert on Idaho’s water issues defeated state Rep. Priscilla Giddings in a race called Wednesday following voting in Tuesday’s primary. The race was another battle between an establishment Republican in Bedke against a far-right candidate in Giddings. Bedke got about 52% of the vote and Giddings 43%, while Daniel Gasiorowski received the remainder. Giddings was censured by her House colleagues late last year after publicizing the name of a 19-year-old intern who reported she was raped by another House lawmaker. Bedke was appointed to a House seat representing south-central Idaho in 2001 by Republican Gov. Dirk Kempthorne. Following redistricting, he won the GOP primary and general election. He ran mostly unopposed ever since. He became speaker in 2012 by defeating then-Speaker Lawerence Denney, now Idaho’s secretary of state. Bedke will face Democrat Terri Pickens Manweiler in the November general election for lieutenant governor, a post Democrats last held in the 1970s in deeply conservative Idaho.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Archdiocese of Chicago has agreed to pay $1.2 million to a man who alleged he was sexually abused at 12 years old by a defrocked priest who was convicted of sexually abusing several boys, the man’s attorney announced Tuesday. The settlement of the case before a lawsuit was filed was announced in a news release by attorney Lyndsay Markley and marks the latest chapter in the story of Daniel McCormack, one of the most notorious pedophiles in the history of Chicago’s archdiocese. McCormack, who pleaded guilty in 2007 to sexually abusing five children while he was a priest at St. Agatha’s parish in Chicago, was released from prison last fall and has registered as a sex offender with the Illinois State Police. According to published reports, he was listed at that time as living in Chicago’s Near North neighborhood. The settlement follows other similar settlements in which the archdiocese has agreed to pay men who alleged they were abused by McCormack when they were children. In all, the archdiocese has paid well over $12 million to men who filed lawsuits or settled cases involving McCormack before filing lawsuits. The archdiocese declined to comment on the settlement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republicans aren’t showing signs of putting the brakes on rising state gasoline taxes even as Indiana’s government continues its streak of fast-growing tax collections. Hoosiers are now paying about 56 cents per gallon in state taxes on gasoline – the highest-ever level shown in state records – and it will increase next month based on rising fuel prices. Democrats have been calling over the past week for Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to issue an emergency order suspending the gas tax or for the GOP-dominated Legislature to do so when lawmakers hold a one-day meeting next week. Republicans shrugged off a push in March by Democrats for a gas tax suspension projected to cost about $125 million a month as national gasoline prices surged past $4 a gallon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Republican legislative leaders argued that much of the gas tax money was dedicated to the state’s highway construction program, and they instead pushed through a plan for gradually cutting Indiana’s individual income tax rate over the next seven years. Indiana’s average price hit $4.60 for a gallon of regular as of Wednesday, according to AAA. State Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute, said that a gas tax suspension would be in “the best interest of Hoosiers” and that “where there’s a will, there’s a way.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Jackson Elementary will retain its name but honor a new historical figure going forward. The Des Moines School Board voted unanimously to change the name during its Tuesday meeting. Students launched the name change campaign about two years ago while researching a class assignment. During a school board meeting last month, Jackson students cited the seventh U.S. president’s ownership of enslaved people and mistreatment of Native Americans as just two of several reasons they were advocating for a name change. The children argued Mary Jackson, NASA’s first Black female engineer, was a better fit in part because the school’s name should reflect its diverse student body. Mary Jackson’s story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.” Of the elementary school’s nearly 400 students, 25% are white, roughly 36% are Hispanic, 12% are Black, and about 20% are Asian, according to state data. Parents, students and staff attending the meeting quietly cheered and clapped following the vote. Jackson fourth grader Maximus Vannavong, who spoke at last month’s meeting, said he was “happy that it changed and got approved.” Board Chair Dwana Bradley thanked the students for their hard work. “It’s very important and valuable and people do listen and pay attention when you use your voices,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republicans on Wednesday improved their chances of flipping the state’s only congressional seat held by a Democrat, when the Kansas Supreme Court upheld the new congressional map they drew. The map slices territory out of the Kansas City-area district Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids has carried by a 2-to-1 margin and replaces it with three counties that ex-President Donald Trump carried by more than 40 percentage points in 2020. Republicans argued that Davids still would have carried the new district two years ago and that the map was a fair way to rebalance the number of residents in each of the state’s four districts after 10 years of population shifts. Attorneys for the Kansas voters and voting rights group that challenged the map urged the state Supreme Court to declare that broad language about “inalienable natural rights” and “equal protection and benefits” in the state’s bill of rights bars overly partisan and racial gerrymandering. But the justices apparently didn’t see it that way. Their decision bucks what has been a trend in a small but growing number of states since the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision in 2019 that complaints about partisan gerrymandering are political issues and not for the federal courts to resolve.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: After a disastrous showing last summer that included long lines and a severe lack of water for attendees amid blazing heat, the Railbird Festival “will take a pause in 2022,” according to a Tuesday post on the event’s Twitter account. More than 30,000 people flowed into the music festival at Keeneland in Lexington in August 2021 as attendees anxiously awaited bands like My Morning Jacket, Dave Matthews Band, Leon Bridges, Jason Isbell and Bendigo Fletcher. However, with anticipation came perspiration as the two-day event held in the middle of summer was sold out, which meant long lines for everything, including water. During the first of the festival’s two days, patrons were expected to bring empty bottles to fill while at the event but were not allowed to bring any water within their containers. That, mixed with the 20- to 30-minute lines to access the limited water stations placed around the grounds, angered attendees as temperatures reached 90 degrees. According to its Twitter account, Railbird Festival said organizers have taken the criticisms and concerns from former festivalgoers “to heart” and are “working hard behind the scenes to create an exceptional experience for the next edition of the festival.” The fest will reopen June 3-4, 2023, at its new downtown venue, Red Mile Gaming & Racing.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state lawmaker’s attempt to set restrictions on what public schools can teach about race was rejected by a House committee Tuesday, with some panel members saying the legislation needlessly encroached on state and local education officials’ duties, while other said the legislation was so broadly written it could squelch classroom debate. Both bills were by Rep. Ray Garofalo, a St. Bernard Parish Republican who lost his chairmanship of the House Education Committee last year after pushing similar legislation over the objections of the House leadership. Garofalo was back before the same panel during a livestreamed meeting at the Capitol in Baton Rouge. His House Bill 1014 listed several teaching restrictions, including forbidding teaching that anyone of any race bears “collective guilt” for past actions by members of the same race; that the United States is “systemically racist”; or that anyone should be “adversely or advantageously treated” on the basis of race. Similar bills have been proposed or passed in a number of Republican-controlled states in response to the recent spate of publicity about “critical race theory,” an academic framework dating to the 1970s that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions. Critical race theory is not a fixture of K-12 education but has become a catchall political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history.\n\nMaine\n\nDyer Brook: Residents of a town in far northern Maine are experiencing trouble with mail delivery that officials blame on roads full of potholes. Officials with the U.S. Postal Service told Dyer Brook officials last week that mail carriers were suspending deliveries because of unsafe roads, WGME-TV reports. Officials said deliveries have resumed as the potholes are starting to get filled in. WGME-TV reports residents were told mail would be held in a neighboring town during the service disruption.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: More than 3,000 customs, hot rods, street machines, classics and muscle cars will assemble for various car shows, contests, parades and live auctions in the city from Thursday to Sunday for the 31st annual Cruisin’ event. Residents and visitors alike are reminded to tap the brakes as they cruise along Coastal Highway, as the resort town will be designated a special event zone for the rest of the week, meaning lower speed limits. Violators will face increased fines and penalties for violations and, in extreme cases, arrest. The Ocean City Police Department will remain on high alert during the entirety of the event. Officers from the Ocean City Police Department, Maryland State Police and the Worcester County Sheriff’s Office will strictly enforce all traffic laws. Officers will also enforce all laws for spectators who incite drivers for spinning of wheels or burn-outs, as well as for the driver. According to the OCPD, significant traffic congestion and alternate traffic patterns are anticipated throughout the weekend. Due to the high traffic volume, all motorists are advised to plan their drives accordingly to ensure they arrive at their destinations safely and on time.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The commission put together to study the racial implications of the Massachusetts state seal and motto has voted unanimously to recommend that both be replaced. The Special Commission on the Official Seal and Motto of the Commonwealth, made up of lawmakers, members of Indigenous tribes, historians and others, made the decision at its meeting Tuesday, GBH News reports. The current seal that appears on state flags, which dates to the late 19th century, features a depiction of a Native American man beneath a colonist’s arm brandishing a sword. Critics say it references the defeat of local tribes at the hands of English colonists centuries ago. The state’s Latin motto –which translates into English as, “By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty” – dates to about 1659 and is attributed to English politician Algernon Sydney, according to the secretary of state’s office. Brian Boyles, co-chair of the 20-member commission, pointed out at Tuesday’s meeting that the face on the seal was based on a photograph from the Bureau of Ethnology in Washington, D.C., of Thomas Little Shell, a Chippewa leader who never lived in Massachusetts. “No Native residents were consulted in this selection,” Boyles said. The next step is seeking new designs to the seal and motto.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A prosecutor said Wednesday that he will only decide whether to charge a white police officer in last month’s fatal shooting of Patrick Lyoya, a Black man, after he finishes discussing it with experts. Kent County prosecutor Chris Becker acknowledged that the “investigation appears to be moving painstakingly slowly,” six weeks after Grand Rapids Officer Christopher Schurr shot Lyoya in the back of the head during a struggle. “It is imperative that I review all the facts and evidence before making a charging decision,” Becker said. “In this situation, my decision can only be made by taking the time to gather all the available information, both from (state police) and from state and national experts.” State police submitted a report April 28, but Becker said he requested more information. “I ask for your continued patience,” he told the public in a statement. Schurr killed Lyoya, 26, on April 4, minutes after stopping his car because the officer said it didn’t match its license plate. Lyoya didn’t produce a driver’s license and began to run. The officer quickly caught him, and the pair grappled on someone’s lawn while a bystander recorded video. Schurr shot Lyoya in the head after demanding that Lyoya “let go” of his police Taser.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCass Lake: The federal government will soon return nearly 12,000 acres of land in northern Minnesota it wrongfully took from the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe decades ago. The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs thought it had the power to sell tribal tracts without the consent of the majority of the owners, a misinterpretation of an Interior Department order back in 1948, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Tribal District 3 Representative LeRoy Staples Fairbanks III said the land transfers were acts of outright theft. “They mailed out letters to people. If they didn’t get a response, they took them as ‘yes.’ They took them as approval,” he said. Fairbanks said he asked his staff to begin looking into the issue in 2012 after hearing from community members for many years. Then-President Donald Trump signed legislation in December 2020 allowing for the return of the land, which is located within the Chippewa National Forest in Cass County. The land is expected to be returned to the tribe in the coming months now that the band has submitted its survey detailing each of the parcels involved. Fairbanks said the Leech Lake band’s relationship with the Cass County leaders played an important role in getting the Leech Lake Reservation Restoration Act signed into law.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: A Catholic elementary school that primarily serves Black and Hispanic families in the Mississippi Delta is closing after more than 70 years, following a sex abuse scandal, declining enrollment and a steep decrease in donations. St. Francis of Assisi School in Greenwood notified teachers and families Friday that it will close at the end of this week, the Greenwood Commonwealth reports. It joins more than 200 other Catholic schools in the U.S. that have closed permanently during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the National Catholic Educational Association. The school in Greenwood was founded in 1951 and is run by the Franciscan Friars of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Province, a Wisconsin-based religious community that opened a mission in an impoverished part of Mississippi. In recent years, the school in Greenwood has been tarnished by a clergy sex abuse scandal dating back to the 1990s. Paul West, a former friar who was a teacher and principal, was convicted in April of abusing a former student at the school. The Mississippi attorney general’s office later dropped a second set of charges against West in the abuse of another student as the 62-year-old former friar began a 45-year prison sentence.\n\nMissouri\n\nPotosi: A prosecutor is seeking to vacate the conviction of a man who spent nearly two decades behind bars for the 1998 death of his mother – a crime he and others insist he did not commit. Washington County Prosecuting Attorney Joshua Hedgecorth has asked a judge to set aside 38-year-old Michael Politte’s second-degree murder conviction, the Kansas City Star reports. Politte was released from prison last month, two months after he was granted parole. Politte was just 14 when Rita Politte died in a fire at the family home in the eastern Missouri town of Hopewell. Michael and a friend were also in the home but managed to escape the blaze. Politte’s lawyers said the boys were awakened by smoke and scrambled to escape, before Politte found the burning body of his mother. Investigators said the fire was started with gasoline and determined Rita Politte had also suffered blunt force head trauma. The investigation focused on her teenage son as the main suspect, and four years later he was convicted as an adult and sentenced to life in prison. The only physical evidence investigators had to link him to the crime was what they said was the presence of gasoline on the teen’s shoes. But that finding was based on now-discredited fire investigation techniques, and the state has conceded there was no gasoline on his shoes.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Residents who want to cast a vote in next month’s primary election must be registered with their county elections office by noon June 6, under an order by the Montana Supreme Court. The justices, in a 4-1 ruling Tuesday, said changes to election laws passed by the 2021 Legislature will remain in effect for the June 7 primary. District Court Judge Michael Moses of Billings had ruled last month that a law ending Election Day voter registration appeared to unconstitutionally burden the right to vote, and he temporarily blocked it for this year’s primary election. The Supreme Court lifted that injunction, agreeing with Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen that three local elections have been successfully held under those laws. The court also noted the plaintiffs – the Montana Democratic Party, Native American organizations and youth advocacy groups – had not challenged the laws prior to the earlier elections. Sheila Hogan, executive director of MDP, has said the 2021 voting laws were an attack on the constitutional right to vote and more greatly affected young, Native, elderly or disabled voters and others who might have difficulty getting to the polls. Western Native Voice, whose work includes registering Native Americans to vote, said in recent years its largest voter registration days have been on election days.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The City Council has approved a redevelopment plan for a downtown property to become a skyscraper housing Mutual of Omaha’s headquarters, the Omaha World-Herald reports. The plan involves the city buying an existing parking garage and Mutual adding a block of downtown property as part of its $600 million proposal, according to the newspaper.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: People start more wildfires that burn more acres in the state than natural events like lightning. In the past four years, Nevadans – either intentionally or unintentionally – started 1,419 fires, while natural events such as lightning started 1,015 fires. Those human-sparked fires burned 776,125 acres, nearly 48,000 acres more than started naturally. In 2018, illegal fireworks set off near Winnemucca started the largest fire in Nevada’s history, burning 439,000 acres. Other significant causes of human-started fires include arson, power lines that brush against vegetation, chains dragging behind trailers causing sparks, target shooting, and campfires. The most notable year was 2020, when nearly half of the 491 wildfires in Nevada were sparked by human causes. While Nevada’s largest, most destructive fires have not been caused by target shooters, “there is just a lot of them in the wildland urban interface areas, drawing down resources needed on other wildland fires,” said Kacey KC, Nevada state forester and fire warden. Part of that is due to Nevada’s rapid growth – the state is one of the fastest growing in the nation. Areas that were once remote locations for target shooting and discharging fireworks are now close to residential areas.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPeterborough: A 168-year-old company known for its handwoven, hardwood baskets is closing its factory and stopping production, partly because of an insect pest that has been destroying ash trees. The Peterboro Basket Company has been in business since 1854. The company said in a recent announcement that the baskets “are principally made of U.S. grown, Appalachian White Ash,” which is also typically used for baseball bats and ax handles. “For some years the Emerald Ash Borer beetle has reduced the availability of the wood used to make the baskets,” the company said. The emerald ash borer has destroyed tens of millions of trees in the U.S. and Canada. The company said other extreme labor shortages, ongoing supply chain issues and owners who are “ready to retire” are among the other considerations in deciding to close. The factory plans to produce its last basket this summer or fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCedar Grove: Gov. Phil Murphy announced proposed legislation Wednesday that would create licensing for police that he said would make it easier to fire rogue officers. “It will send a strong message that we are rebuilding the bonds of trust between the police and residents, especially in Black and brown communities,” Murphy said during the announcement at the Essex County Police Academy in Cedar Grove with Acting Attorney General Matt Platkin. New Jersey has been grappling with the question of licensing police officers for at least the past four years. Licensing was one of several recommendations the Asbury Park Press made in its police misconduct series “Protecting the Shield” that were embraced by then-Attorney General Gurbir Grewal after its publication in January 2018. The series highlighted the fact that New Jersey stands nearly alone in the nation in failing to license police officers. Rhode Island and Hawaii are frequently mentioned as the other states without licensing. But police licensing is a broad catch-all that obscures some of the details of the process of removing a police officer from policing, which varies around the country. Decertification is more to the point. But decertification as it has stood in New Jersey for decades doesn’t have any teeth.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A conservative-backed foundation that aims to post online registration records for voters across the country urged a federal judge Tuesday to override objections by New Mexico election regulators who say the initiative violates state law and would discourage people from registering to vote out of privacy concerns. The VoteRef.com website does not list details of how people voted regarding candidates or initiatives. The Voter Reference Foundation has posted voter rolls from at least 20 states that can be searched by names or addresses to verify where people live and view whether they voted in various past elections. A companion website highlights the difference between the number of ballots cast according to certified election results and the number of people listed as having voted on registration rolls at various points in time as local registrations are added and purged. Eddie Greim, an attorney for Voter Reference Foundation, urged a federal judge to intervene and ensure voter rolls can be published online to provide direct accountability and allow people to vet the accuracy of most registration records submitted by others. New Mexico election regulators say the unprecedented efforts flouts state statutes that limit the acquisition and sharing of voter registration rolls to governmental activities and political campaigns.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says he’s considering a run for Congress after a legal battle over the state’s political maps opened up a seat in Brooklyn. The two-term Democrat, who left office at the end of 2021, said Wednesday that he’s formed an exploratory committee for New York’s 10th Congressional District. The Democratic-heavy district will include a large slice of western Brooklyn, where he lives. New York’s 10th District is currently represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler, but the state’s political maps are being redrawn under supervision of a New York judge after a court found they were unconstitutional and gerrymandered in favor of Democrats. The court this week unveiled new proposed maps that significantly draw a number of New York City-based districts. Nadler said he believed the maps were changed so much that they are also unconstitutional, but if the proposed districts become final at the end of this week, he intends to run in the 12th District representing Manhattan. The primary contest has been pushed back from June to Aug. 23. De Blasio toyed with running for governor this year before deciding to sit it out. He also had a short-lived run for president in 2019.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The General Assembly returned Wednesday to Raleigh for its traditional budget-adjustment work session, but lawmakers aren’t getting out of the blocks quickly. The House and Senate gaveled in and out sparsely attended floor sessions at midday Wednesday. Republican leaders in both chambers say committee meetings and recorded votes won’t occur until next week. The delay is not surprising given that dozens of incumbents have been back home competing in Tuesday’s primaries. Lawmakers began introducing bills Wednesday. The chief job for lawmakers is to approve changes to the second year of the already-enacted two-year budget. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper made recommendations last week. House Speaker Tim Moore told reporters Wednesday that he expected the session to last five or six weeks. That’s in line with Senate leader Phil Berger’s recent comments that he and Moore were aiming to adjourn the session around July 1, when the new fiscal year begins. Other legislation pending from 2021 likely to be debated now include bills that would legalize medical marijuana and sports wagering. Moore said he didn’t expect cannabis legislation, which has yet to clear the Senate, to be considered in the House until 2023.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDevils Lake: Horizon Financial Bank is holding its first ever “Piggie Pageant,” featuring nothing but locally made piggy banks. Teaming up with a third grade class from Sweetwater Elementary School, bank representatives read students “The Story of the Original Piggie Bank” and talked to the kids about the importance of savings their money. Sami J. Lindenberg, bookkeeper for the bank, said they also donated the book to the classroom library, explained the rules of the pageant to the kids and instructed them to paint their own piggy banks for the competition. Community members are invited to cast their ballots for their favorite pig. Voting, to last through Friday, is anonymous and can be done by stopping into the bank or online, through Horizon’s Facebook page. After the pageant is over, the piggies will be returned to the students to take home and keep.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Judges would be required to consider criminal suspects’ threat to public safety when setting bail amounts under legislation and a separate proposal for a state constitutional amendment being advanced by Ohio House Republicans. The GOP proposals follow a ruling by a divided state Supreme Court earlier this year that said a $1.5 million bond for a Cincinnati man accused of fatally shooting a man during a robbery was too high. The measures were scheduled for votes in the House on Wednesday, but they were pulled from the agenda. House Speaker Bob Cupp said more discussion was needed on how the proposals mesh with bigger conversations on changes to the state’s bail system. Lawmakers must weigh a number of issues, including people stuck in jail on nonviolent offenses “simply because they can’t afford to get out,” said Cupp, R-Lima. The Ohio Supreme Court majority said safety concerns expressed by the victim’s family members and evidence that the suspect presented a false ID when confronted after fleeing to Las Vegas weren’t factors relevant to the amount of bail. The court said public safety concerns could be met by other requirements, such as electronic monitoring, which was done in the case of the Cincinnati murder suspect, according to court records.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Republican leaders in the state House and Senate announced an agreement Tuesday on a $9.8 billion spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year – the largest in state history. Unlike previous years, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt was not included in a statement announcing the agreement, and his office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. “This year’s budget agreement reflects that the Oklahoma Legislature prioritizes education, law enforcement and healthcare,” Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat said in the statement. Among the key provisions is a plan to send “inflation relief” cash payments in December of $75 to each individual taxpayer and $150 to married couples who file jointly. The deal includes a $32.5 million increase in funding to the Department of Human Services to eliminate the waiting list of more than 5,000 developmentally disabled Oklahomans to receive state services. While the average budget increase was about 10%, some state agencies received boosts, while others had a reduction in funding. Public schools received a modest increase of about 0.54% over last year’s budget, while colleges and universities saw an increase of about 7.45%. The House and Senate saw their budgets increased by 19% and 15%, respectively, while the budget for the governor’s office remained flat.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Voters in Multnomah County have elected a female sheriff for the first time in history. Current Undersheriff Nicole Morrisey O’Donnell, a 26-year veteran of the agency, handily won the top job with two-thirds of the vote and will replace Sheriff Mike Reese on Jan. 1. Reese could not run for reelection due to term limits. Morrisey O’Donnell received key endorsements from Reese, former Govs. Barbara Roberts and Ted Kulongoski, and the mayors of three cities –including Portland – that contract with the county for law enforcement services, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Morrisey O’Donnell called the day a win for the community and “trailblazers everywhere.” “I promise to work every day to reduce gun violence, bring compassionate solutions to the homelessness crisis, and collaborate with partners to make our community safer,” she said in a statement. “I know it’s a big task, and I’m honored and encouraged by your trust in me.” Morrisey O’Donnell was hired by the sheriff’s office in 1996 as a corrections deputy and was appointed undersheriff in August, making her the first woman in Multnomah County to serve as second-in-command in the sheriff’s office. She previously led both the agency’s corrections and law enforcement divisions, the newspaper reports.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: One of the Legislature’s most powerful Republicans lost a primary race, and another was in real danger Wednesday of going down to defeat, both targeted by challengers from the right. As vote counting continued, state Sen. Pat Browne of Lehigh County was a few dozen votes behind school board member and pilot Jarrett Coleman. State Rep. Stan Saylor of York County lost to Wendy Jo Fink, who promised to eliminate school property taxes. Both incumbents were attacked for being Harrisburg insiders. Saylor was elected in 1992 and Browne in 2005 after a decade in the state House. They chair the Appropriations Committee in their respective chambers. The committees are the conduit for the state budget legislation and play a prominent role in much of the Legislature’s business. Another longtime House Republican from York County also was looking at a possible defeat: Rep. Keith Gillespie was trailing badly to Joe D’Orsie, the communications director at an Apostolic Church. Gillespie was first elected 20 years ago. On the Democratic side, 12-year incumbent Rep. Pam DeLissio lost to nurse Tarik Khan in a Philadelphia district.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNarragansett: Members of the Narragansett Indian Tribe will be able to walk onto Narragansett Town Beach for free this summer despite the objections of some residents who voiced concerns about overcrowding. The Town Council narrowly voted to approve the change late Monday night during a raucous meeting that lasted for more than four hours. “It’s about the beach, but in many ways, it’s about more than just the beach,” said Town Council President Jesse Pugh, who introduced the resolution along with Councilwoman Deb Kopech. Typically, anyone over the age of 12 must pay a $12 admission fee to walk onto Narragansett Town Beach, on top of paying for parking. Town residents have the option of purchasing a discounted seasonal pass. Pugh said Monday that members of the Narragansett tribe, regardless of whether they are town residents, would be able obtain a seasonal pass for free by showing their tribal identification cards at the beach’s sales office. The pass will be good only for this summer, and the town has no obligation to continue the program after this year. Supporters see the move as a small but meaningful way to honor the tribe from which the town took its name. But opponents said it seemed like the measure was being rushed through.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A deputy charged in the deaths of two women who drowned in a locked police van in 2018 ignored barricades and drove into rapidly rising floodwaters against advice from his supervisors and officials on the highway, a prosecutor said Monday. Former Horry County Deputy Stephen Flood is on trial on two counts of involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide for the drownings of the women he was taking to mental health facilities under a court order as rain from Hurricane Florence inundated eastern South Carolina. Flood faces up to five years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter and 10 years in prison for each reckless homicide charges. Flood could have prevented the deaths of Wendy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, four separate times that evening, Solicitor Ed Clements said in his opening statement Monday at the Marion County courthouse. First, he could have listened to people in the Horry County Sheriff’s Office to avoid the shortest route, which was along a highway that had flooded in major storms before, Clements said. Flood then drove around barricades closing state Highway 9 near Nichols, ignored National Guard troops in the road past the barricades who warned them the water was too deep to traverse, and drove his police transport van into water covering the highway near the Little Pee Dee River bridge, the prosecutor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Wednesday unanimously approved a report finding that Republican Gov. Kristi Noem’s daughter got preferential treatment while she was applying for a real estate appraiser’s license in 2020. The findings of last year’s legislative probe, which was conducted by a Republican-controlled Government Operations and Audit Committee, repudiate Noem’s insistence that her daughter, Kassidy Peters, didn’t receive special treatment with her application. State lawmakers on Wednesday approved the committee’s findings by a voice vote and without discussion. Noem, who is running for reelection and is positioned for a 2024 White House bid, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, despite holding a meeting that included Peters and key decision-makers from the agency that was evaluating her license application just days after the agency moved to deny her the license. After the meeting, Peters received another opportunity to demonstrate she could meet federal standards and was ultimately awarded the license. The Republican governor on Wednesday stuck to her defense, saying in a statement that “Kassidy followed the same process as other applicants did to obtain her license. She did not receive preferential treatment.” But the report says Peters received three opportunities to demonstrate to state regulators that she could meet federal standards with her appraisals, which deviated from the standard certification process of two opportunities before an application is denied.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s highest court ruled Wednesday that Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s school voucher program does not violate the state constitution, clearing the path for families to soon use taxpayer dollars on private schools. The Tennessee Supreme Court’s 3-2 decision overturns several lower court rulings that had previously determined the program violated the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. Under the law, the voucher program would apply only to Nashville and to Shelby County, which includes Memphis – the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The law squeaked through the GOP-controlled General Assembly in 2019, with Republicans repeatedly tweaking the legislation to ensure it applied only to Democratic-controlled areas after acknowledging it was unpopular among their constituents. “Every child deserves a high-quality education, and today’s Tennessee Supreme Court opinion on (the voucher law) puts parents in Memphis and Nashville one step closer to finding the best educational fit for their children,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMcAllen: U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday that authorities were prepared for an anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border from Mexico, days before a public health order is set to end after being used to turn people away nearly 2 million times without a chance to seek asylum. A federal judge may order that pandemic-related asylum limits continue, but Mayorkas offered public reassurances of readiness after a whirlwind tour of Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. Homeland Security has said it will prepare for as many as 18,000 daily crossings, compared with a daily average of about 7,800 in April, though Mayorkas emphasized that those are not projections. Mayorkas visited a remodeled processing center in McAllen, the region’s largest city, where migrants sat on metal benches and on sleeping mats spread on the floor, as aluminum thermal blankets made rustling noises. Televisions pointed into cells. The center reopened about six weeks ago for about 1,200 migrants. Chain-link fences have been replaced with cinder block walls. Cells have an open roof that Border Patrol officials said provides better ventilation.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A new report detailing the risk of wildfires across the nation for the next 30 years found southwest Utah to be one of the riskiest areas in the country. The report, released Monday by the nonprofit First Street Foundation, used a 30-year simulation of fires across America and a variety of metrics to calculate fire risk, including data from the U.S. Forest Service’s LANDFIRE program, weather reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, historical records of where wildfires have occurred in the past and changes in climate trends. It found approximately 79.8 million properties in the lower 48 states are at wildfire risk. The report highlighted several counties in Utah with a lot of structures at risk for fire. In Utah County, there are over 118,000 structures at risk. In Salt Lake County, there are 138,600. But while those counties had the largest numerical risk, the areas with the highest risk per household were in southwestern Utah. The report estimates that of Washington County’s 101,400 structures, 93.6% are at a 0.2% or worse risk of being involved in a wildfire this year, compared to 35.2% in Utah County and 9.3% in Salt Lake County. Overall, 57.7% of structures in Utah are at a 0.03% wildfire risk, while 24% of structures are at a 0.2% risk.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Planned Parenthood of Northern New England will close four health centers in Vermont and one in New Hampshire next month, while also expanding the days of operation at seven other centers in the region. The organization announced the “difficult but strategic decision” decision to shutter part-time health centers in Bennington, Hyde Park, Middlebury and St. Albans in Vermont and in Claremont, New Hampshire, effective June 12, said Kai Williams, senior vice president of health care delivery, in a statement. “We believe these decisions will ensure that we can continue to serve northern New England for generations to come,” she said. Over the course of a year, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England will expand the days of operation to a minimum of four or five days a week at health centers in Barre, Brattleboro and Williston, Vermont; in Exeter, New Hampshire; and in Sanford, Biddeford, and Topsham, Maine, the organization said. Operating hours will not change at facilities in Burlington, Rutland, St. Johnsbury and White River Junction, Vermont; in Derry, Keene and Manchester, New Hampshire; or in Portland, Maine.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A Virginia State Police pilot was temporarily blinded during a search for a suspect when a person on the ground aimed a laser pointer at the police aircraft, officials said. Troopers were helping the Nottoway County Sheriff’s Office with a pursuit and search for a suspect near the town of Crewe on Monday, state police said in a news release. While one of the agency’s airplanes was aiding in the search, the pilot was temporarily blinded by a laser pointer being used on the ground, police said. When the pilot regained his vision, he and his co-pilot identified the source of the laser and provided troopers on the ground with an exact location and address. As the airplane continued to assist with the search, the laser continued to track the aircraft. Crewe police officers and Virginia State Police troopers found a woman and the laser pointer and took her into custody. The woman was charged with one felony count of interfering with the operation of an aircraft, police said. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified of the incident, which is under investigation. WRIC-TV reports that state police said the woman and the suspect police were searching for were not connected.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Rainier National Park: Two climbers were rescued by helicopter Friday after one fell into a crevasse the day before on Mount Rainier. The climbers had been in contact with the National Park Service beginning last Wednesday evening, when they stopped their summit bid at 12,800 feet because of adverse weather, according to the NPS. They didn’t initially ask for assistance, the Seattle Times reports. But the climbers called for help Thursday after one of them fell 80 feet into a crevasse at about 12,200 feet above sea level and suffered arm and leg injuries, officials said. The climber who fell was able to communicate with Mount Rainier National Park dispatchers, as well as his partner on the Kautz Glacier, but authorities could not immediately launch a rescue effort because of deep snow, limited visibility and strong and erratic winds, according to the Park Service. Heavy winds thwarted rescuers’ efforts to reach the climbers Friday morning, but rescuers were able to reach the pair several hours later. The climbers were on the Kautz Glacier climbing route below the Wapowety Cleaver and had planned to descend the Disappointment Cleaver route when one of them fell into the crevasse, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The finishing touches on a six-lane upgrade of the West Virginia Turnpike in Beckley are getting underway and expected to last about eight weeks. The $140 million widening project on the 8-mile stretch was finished last fall, but final paving and striping were delayed to allow holiday traffic to have full access on the heavily traveled road. Paving and striping will take place between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. to minimize impact on motorists, said Jeff Miller, executive director of the West Virginia Parkways Authority. Delays should be expected until the work is complete. The speed limit in the zone will be 55 mph, the state Department of Transportation said. Miller said it will be strictly enforced. “It’s a very, very busy area, and we just don’t want anything bad to happen to anybody,” he said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Tuesday voiced skepticism about a lawsuit challenging the legality of private grant money awarded to the city to help run the 2020 election, calling some of the arguments “ridiculous,” a “stretch” and “close to preposterous.” The lawsuit argues that private grants given to Madison from a group funded by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg amounted to illegal bribery. The Wisconsin Elections Commission in December rejected that complaint, and this lawsuit is an appeal of that decision. Four nearly identical lawsuits are also pending in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Racine and Kenosha. The case in Madison was the first to hold arguments. Three Wisconsin courts have previously rejected similar lawsuits arguing that the grants were illegal. Similar lawsuits filed in other swing states have also been rejected. Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke referenced those rulings when he questioned attorney Erick Kaardal Tuesday. Kardaal said the commission got it wrong, and Madison should not have been allowed to use a portion of the grant money to pay for absentee ballot drop boxes because, he said, they are illegal, based on a Waukesha County circuit court ruling issued after the election. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is currently weighing an appeal of that ruling.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The father of a Marine killed in an attack on an airport in Afghanistan last year is planning to run for the state House as a Republican, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Jim McCollum’s son, Rylee, died at age 20 in a suicide bombing in Kabul during the U.S. withdrawal from the Taliban-run nation. Wyoming’s 16th legislative district is currently represented by Democratic Rep. Mike Yin, who ran unopposed in 2020, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/25/underground-proms-popcorn-problems-lobster-relief-news-around-states/115638782/", "title": "Underground proms, popcorn problems: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey this week urged people to wear masks in public after a statewide mandate expires next month. Ivey has been adamant that she will not extend the mask mandate past April 9. On Monday, her office released designs for signs for businesses to use to request patrons to wear masks. The designs range from “Mask Preferred” to “Mask Required For Service.” Face coverings “remain one of the most successful tools we have to keep folks safe from COVID-19,” Ivey said in a statement. “Masks are soon to be a memory but until then, lets wear them out.” Alabama expanded eligibility Monday for COVID-19 vaccinations, adding more than 2 million people to the groups who can get a COVID-19 shot in Alabama and roughly doubling the number of residents now eligible. The additions include more front-line workers; people 55 and older; those with intellectual and developmental disabilities; and residents ages 16 to 64 with certain high-risk medical conditions. The qualifying medical conditions include cancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, smoking, obesity, sickle cell disease and heart conditions. State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris on Friday said most adults will now be eligible for shots and urged people to be patient as they seek vaccination appointments.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: People who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear masks at work in the city when they are in their own workspace away from the public and unvaccinated colleagues, under an updated emergency order that took effect Tuesday. Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson’s office, in a release, called the update an easing of an existing mask mandate “that balances vaccination progress in Anchorage with the importance of masks in reducing transmission of COVID-19.” Under the order, employers would have to verify an employee’s vaccination status, “in a manner consistent with workplace anti-discrimination laws.” Masks still are required in Anchorage in indoor public settings and communal spaces outside the home and at outdoor public gatherings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a person fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of a two-dose vaccine or two weeks after receiving a one-dose vaccine. In the Anchorage area, 27% of those 16 and older are considered fully vaccinated, information provided by the state health department shows.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: COVID-19 vaccine appointments opened Wednesday morning to all Arizonans 16 and older, and the rush to get them was huge. All available slots for state-operated COVID-19 vaccine sites were taken within 20 minutes, health officials said in a tweet, but more will be available at 11 a.m. Friday, when the state will release tens of thousands of new appointments for the following week. The five vaccine sites operated by the state are State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona State University’s Phoenix Municipal Stadium in Tempe, Chandler-Gilbert Community College, the University of Arizona in central Tucson and, as of this Friday, Yuma Civic Center in Yuma County. Vaccine appointments are also available at individual pharmacies, through their websites, and through some individual counties. To book and schedule vaccines, go to podvaccine.azdhs.gov. Those without computer access or needing extra help registering can call 844-542-8201 to be connected with someone who can assist in scheduling. People can contact the call center when it opens at 8 a.m., as it gets canceled appointments released to it daily.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Cities won’t be able to enforce their own mask mandates to curb the coronavirus when the state ends its requirement as soon as next week, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday. The Republican governor told reporters he expected Arkansas’ requirement to end March 31, saying the state has so far met the criteria for positive coronavirus tests and hospitalizations that he set for the mandate’s end when he lifted most of the state’s virus restrictions last month. Hutchinson said officials are still working on guidance for cities, employers and schools systems. He said school districts will likely have a local option, and businesses can have their own requirements, but cities couldn’t have that option. “We’re going to go on this together,” Hutchinson said at his weekly virus briefing. “One statewide standard is what I expect to announce next week.” Before Hutchinson signed the state’s mask mandate last year, he had allowed cities to enforce mask ordinances that did not include penalties for not complying.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: With improving coronavirus numbers continuing to fall, much of the San Francisco Bay Area can reopen to a greater degree, and 94% of California’s population is out from under the most severe restrictions, officials said Tuesday. San Francisco, Marin and Santa Clara counties were among those moving to less restrictive tiers in the state’s four-level system. The three joined neighboring Santa Mateo County as the latest Bay Area counties to move into California’s “moderate” tier for coronavirus restrictions, meaning restaurants and other businesses can serve more customers. Higher-risk businesses including bowling alleys and outdoor bars that don’t serve food can reopen. San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax said the expanded activities could begin Wednesday. Breed credited swift vaccinations and ongoing safety precautions for the shift. “This year has been so tough on so many – from our kids and families, to our small businesses and their employees – and this move to the orange tier and reopening more activities and businesses than we have since last March gives us all more hope for the future,” Breed said in a statement.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: About 1,000 front-line essential restaurant and food service workers received COVID-19 shots during a mass vaccination clinic Tuesday at The Ranch events complex. The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment received additional vaccines from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to administer to the workers who recently became eligible under the state’s Phase 1B.4 vaccine distribution plan. The industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with the county reporting that restaurant workers have experienced the highest occupational unemployment rate at nearly 28%, and 30% of the county’s restaurant workers are people of color whose communities have experienced higher-than-average COVID-19 case rates. County restaurants have seen as much as a 50% decrease in revenue since March 2020. Carol and Tim Cochran, owners of the Horse & Dragon Brewing Company in Fort Collins, were among those vaccinated Tuesday, along with employees. “This is a start in the right direction,” Carol said as the couple waited in the observation line after receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot. “Once we can get almost everyone vaccinated, we will be able to open with abandon and not be worried about being a vector for the disease.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The Senior Resources Agency on Aging’s Senior Nutrition Program has worked to meet increased need during the COVID-19 pandemic through revision of the Congregate Meals Program and expansion of the Home Delivered Meals Program. According to Kathy Chase, director of contracts at Senior Resources, more than 400,000 meals were provided to about 3,500 older adult residents of Eastern Connecticut in the past year. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program began in 1972 to reduce hunger and food insecurity, promote socialization, encourage health and well-being, and delay adverse health conditions. Meals are prepared to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, so they are appropriate for everyone including those with diabetes or other chronic health conditions. Older Americans Act programs including the Senior Nutrition Program are managed through Area Agencies on Aging. When possible, the Congregate Meals Program offers meals in a group setting such as a senior center so that participants can socialize and engage in additional activities. There are no income guidelines for this program; donations are requested but not required. Priority may be given to persons of greatest need. To apply, visit seniorresourcesec.org.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A pilot of a walk-up COVID-19 vaccination clinic Wednesday was testing a process that could help inoculate people who’ve had difficulty registering for a shot. The event was limited to those who received a voucher from community groups in recent days. Being able to serve walk-ups without appointments at future vaccination events could help Delaware reach underserved communities and satisfy the state’s equity goal, state officials said. More than three months into the vaccine rollout, state data shows people in minority groups have received fewer vaccinations compared with white residents. Throughout the rollout, the state has asked those eligible for the vaccine – mostly older adults – to register online for an appointment waiting list and to monitor availability at pharmacies and other providers in the meantime. The system has led to frustration and confusion as demand continues to outpace supply. “We know that there is a disconnect at times with technology,” said AJ Schall, director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. State officials said walk-up events could be a solution for older residents who have had difficulty navigating the online system and could target areas where vaccination rates are low, though they are less efficient than large drive-thru events that require preregistration.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Because of the pandemic, the National Park Service will limit access to the Tidal Basin during this year’s peak bloom of D.C.’s cherry blossoms, WUSA-TV reports. NPS spokesperson Mike Litterst said in a release Tuesday that the restrictions were in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and DC Health and were made in consultation with the National Park Service Office of Public Health. “The National Park Service will limit all vehicular and pedestrian access to the Tidal Basin, East Potomac Park and West Potomac Park during the peak bloom period of the cherry blossoms as a public health precaution to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Litterst said in the release. This year, peak bloom is expected April 2-5, but the park service said restrictions are tentatively in place from March 26 through April 12. Updates or changes to the restriction dates will be posted on NPS’ social media. The National Park Service encourages those who want to take in the splendor of the cherry blossoms at peak bloom to do so virtually via its website.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A state House committee approved a bill Wednesday to better prepare for public health emergencies, ranging from ensuring the state is well-stocked with personal protective equipment to allowing the governor more flexibility in spending to deal with a crisis. The bill approved by the House Pandemics & Public Emergencies Committee on a 14-4 vote also addresses how deaths are reported, would allow the Legislature to override a governor’s executive orders, and seeks to better inform the public on state spending on its response and emergency orders. The bill would require the state public health officer to develop a plan for every foreseeable public health emergency and update it every five years. It also spells out that health emergencies could include the release of toxic chemicals and nuclear agents, as well as biological toxins. But the four Democrats who opposed the bill took issue with provisions that limit emergency orders issued by local governments. “We should not be severely restricting the emergency powers of local governments. I think that makes us less safe, and I think that mayors shouldn’t have to ask permission from Tallahassee in order to be the mayors they were elected to be,” said Democratic Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: All Georgians 16 and older will be eligible for COVID-19 shots beginning Thursday. Gov. Brian Kemp made the announcement Tuesday, saying supplies of the vaccines continue to rise, and he’s confident that enough older adults have been vaccinated to open up inoculation to the broadest possible population. Figures from the Georgia Department of Public Health show the state has administered 3.2 million doses overall, with nearly 2.1 million people getting at least one dose. The number of doses being administered has shown a clear upward trend in recent weeks, with a peak of more than 85,000 doses given March 15, the first day Kemp expanded eligibility to current levels. Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium will get a boost in capacity starting Thursday when the Federal Emergency Management Agency adds doses to a site that had been run by Fulton County. Measures still show demand outstripping supply in metro Atlanta, while appointments are abundant in other areas. Kemp said the state directed 70% of this week’s 450,000 doses to metro Atlanta and areas north of the city “to put more supply where the demand is highest.” Georgia continues to lag most other states in vaccination, ranking second worst behind Alabama in the number of doses administered per 100,000 people 18 and older.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: There was a drop in the number of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students who went to college last year after graduating from Hawaii’s public schools, which a group of educational leaders attributes to the pandemic. A report by the Hawaii P-20 Partnerships for Education shows 35% of Native Hawaiians in the class of 2020 enrolled in college upon graduation, a decline from 44% for the class of 2019, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Figures for Pacific Islander graduates fell to 29% from 35%. According to the report, Hawaii’s public high schools had a record graduation rate in 2020, but far fewer graduates enrolled in college: 50% of last year’s graduating class went straight to college, down from 55% the previous year. It was the steepest one-year dip ever recorded, the newspaper reports. “The negative effects of the pandemic on educational progress in general are not equal across socioeconomic and demographic groups,” said Stephen Schatz, executive director of Hawaii P-20 Partnerships for Education. “In particular, economically disadvantaged, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders saw some pretty precipitous declines.” Schatz said the education community needs to act on the premise that the pandemic had an effect on all students’ academic and mental health.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation extending the tax filing deadline from April 15 to May 17 will be among lawmakers’ top priorities when they return to work April 6, a high-ranking state senator said. Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder said this week that he expects the Senate and House to expedite legislation to delay Idaho’s tax deadline a month to match the federal tax deadline that has again been pushed back because of the pandemic. “I’m hopeful that we can get back and get it done as quickly as possible,” he said, adding that lawmakers have numerous tools such as suspending rules to speed bills through both the House and Senate. The Internal Revenue Service announced last week that it has delayed the traditional federal tax filing deadline until May 17, providing more breathing room for taxpayers and the IRS to cope with changes caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Legislation was introduced last week in the state House to make the change for Idaho taxpayers. But the Legislature shut down a day later, on Friday, after six of the 70 House members tested positive for the virus within a week. Shortly after the shutdown, the Idaho State Tax Commission issued a statement saying the state’s filing deadline is still April 15, and it will be up to the Legislature to change it when it reconvenes.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: About 1,000 inmates scheduled for release in the next nine months could soon be set free as part of a settlement of a federal lawsuit filed last spring amid a growing COVID-19 health crisis in state lockups, a lawyer involved in the case said Tuesday. The settlement calls for the release of low- to medium-risk inmates who are within nine months of their release date and eligible for certain good-time credits, according to a court document filed Tuesday. The Illinois Department of Corrections agreed to “use its best efforts” to process the awards within the next month, the document says. Attorney Sheila Bedi said the settlement applies to about 1,000 inmates, and she believes thousands more should be released. “It remains a public health crisis,” Bedi, a professor at Northwestern University, told the Chicago Tribune. “It is still very much a real issue.” In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s press secretary, Jordan Abudayyeh, said the Department of Corrections has consistently reviewed prisoner records to find those eligible for 180 days or less of earned discretionary sentencing credit. A consortium of Chicago civil rights attorneys and community activists filed the lawsuit seeking the release of as many as 13,000 inmates, arguing that prisons “pose a particular risk of spreading the COVID-19.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor announced Tuesday that he will lift the statewide mask mandate and remaining COVID-19 business restrictions in two weeks. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a speech from his Statehouse office that Indiana’s steep declines in coronavirus hospitalization and death rates along with the growing number of people fully vaccinated justify the steps starting April 6. Holcomb said he hoped the state was seeing the “tail end of this pandemic” that has killed nearly 13,000 people in the state over the past year. The date for ending the mask mandate was picked to coincide with the ending of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament now being held in Indianapolis and to allow more time for people with at-risk health conditions to get vaccine shots, Holcomb said. Local officials would still have the authority to impose tougher restrictions in response to COVID-19 cases in their communities, and face masks would still be required in K-12 schools for rest of this school year, he said. But some health experts worry it is premature to lift the statewide restrictions, pointing to the steep increase in hospitalizations and deaths Indiana saw beginning in September after the governor lifted most business restrictions before reinstating crowd limits after winning reelection in November.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Department of Public Health has acknowledged it significantly overestimated how many of Iowa’s senior citizens have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The department said March 12 that 94.9% of Iowans 65 or older had received at least one dose of a vaccine. Gov. Kim Reynolds said at a news conference March 17 that 95.3% of Iowa seniors had received at least one dose, and she touted such statistics in explaining why the state could soon be able to offer vaccinations to all residents 16 or older. But the numbers didn’t square with much lower estimates reported by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Tuesday, health department spokesperson Sarah Ekstrand said in an email that the state estimates were wrong. She said agency staff mistakenly had counted some seniors twice because those people were included in listings of Iowans receiving an initial dose of the vaccine and in listings of those receiving a second dose. After realizing their mistake, staffers recalculated and determined that 421,553 of Iowa’s 513,872 senior citizens – or 82% – had received at least one dose of a vaccine by Tuesday, Ekstrand said. On Tuesday, the CDC was reporting just 76% of Iowa seniors had received at least one dose of a vaccine.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The only Asian American lawmaker serving in the Legislature says he was physically threatened in a western Kansas bar by an out-of-state patron, who questioned if he had been carrying COVID-19. In social media comments posted Friday, state Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood, said the man confronted him and, using an expletive, asked why he was wearing a face mask and whether he was carrying the coronavirus. “That’s a pretty specific dog whistle at Asian Americans from the last year,” said Xu, who is Chinese American. “Most of the anti-Asian American rhetoric that has happened has had some form of that message.” Moments after the confrontation, Xu said he heard the patron searching for him in the bar, yelling that he was going to “kick his ass.” Xu said he visited the Russell sports bar after featuring as a guest on a PBS television show based in nearby Bunker Hill. Xu said he was in the bar with the show’s host, who is white and also wore a mask but wasn’t targeted. “Everybody at the bar who’s actually from Russell was amazing and kind and I had a good time,” Xu said, adding that he doesn’t think where the incident happened is important.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s COVID-19 vaccination program continues to ramp up, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Some 198,447 Kentuckians received a dose last week, breaking a previous weekly record of about 165,000 in early March. The Democratic governor noted that while demand continues to be high, some vaccine sites in western and eastern Kentucky have open appointments. He urged residents in those regions to sign up if they are eligible. Beshear also announced the opening of a vaccination site at the Kentucky Dam Village Convention Center in Gilbertsville. “This is a new site we stood up in western Kentucky to ensure the area was getting significant amounts of vaccine,” Beshear said. “As of today, they have more than 2,000 available appointments in this coming week. That means any Kentuckian, age 50 and up, if you’re in that area, we need you to sign up.” The Bluegrass State’s vaccination program is currently in phase 1C, which includes people 50 and older, anyone older than 16 with high-risk medical conditions, and anyone deemed an essential worker. Starting April 12, all residents 16 and older will be eligible for a shot.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to updated federal guidance on social distancing in schools, officials have approved revisions to the state’s minimum COVID-19 health and safety standards for school facilities. Effective immediately, the revisions to the standards remove the specific physical distancing requirement of 6 feet and insert the provision that distancing requirements shall be in accordance with current Louisiana Department of Health guidelines, as informed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On March 19, the CDC updated its K-12 school guidance to reflect the latest science on physical distance between students in classrooms. The CDC now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings. “Louisiana’s education leaders are committed to ensuring a safe and productive learning environment as we move incrementally toward the restoration of normal classroom and school operations,” said Sandy Holloway, president of the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. Holloway’s approval of the revisions, by emergency rule under interim authority, is scheduled to be ratified by the full board at its next regular meeting April 21.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s lobster catch dipped slightly last year as fishermen dealt with the coronavirus pandemic, but the final totals were better than some feared. Fishermen caught more than 96 million pounds of lobsters in 2020, the Maine Department of Marine Resources said Wednesday. That total broke a string of nine consecutive years in which harvesters brought at least 100 million pounds of lobsters to land. Maine is by far the biggest lobster fishing state in the country, and the harvest is central to the state’s economy and heritage. Members of the industry feared at the outset of the pandemic that it would be difficult to equal previous years’ hauls because of the toll of the virus on the economy and the workforce. However, the 2020 catch would have been a state record as recently as 2010. Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, said prices were also competitive despite difficulty shipping and worldwide economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. The industry focused on opening up domestic retail sales, such as at supermarkets, to keep prices strong, McCarron said. The industry also pivoted to more online direct-to-consumer sales. Some lobstermen even took to selling lobsters from tanks in their own garages and homes.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The U.S. Naval Academy has begun to ease restrictions that were put in place after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The Capital Gazette reports the academy in Annapolis is allowing food to be delivered again and midshipmen to perform outdoor meetings and formations. Student interaction is still limited to roommates with the exception of socially distanced formations outside. The school’s salon and barbershop, Midshipman store and other services will resume appropriate services. The academy had experienced an outbreak of the disease, and nearly 200 midshipmen were moved to local hotels in order to expand quarantine and isolation space. But there are still students in quarantine. And the number of cases isn’t decreasing fast enough to resume in-person classes, which will remain online through Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Nearly 60 school districts received permission from the state education commissioner to delay the resumption of full-time, in-person learning for elementary school-age children, which the state set for April 5, authorities say. The 58 districts that received a waiver include Brockton, Chelsea, Springfield and Somerville. Commissioner Jeffrey Riley is still weighing the requests of 10 other districts, including Boston and Worcester – the two largest in the state – The Boston Globe reports. Riley also denied requests from six districts, which the state would not identify. “We are pleased that 90% of districts will have their elementary schools back fully in-person by April 5, with all elementary schools in the Commonwealth fully in-person by May 3,” Riley said in a statement Tuesday. “Bringing all our kids back to school is crucial for their educational progress, emotional and social well-being, and we will continue to work with districts to bring students back ahead of their waiver-approved return dates.” The state has directed middle schools to fully reopen by April 28 and is still accepting waiver requests. A return date for high schools has not been scheduled.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A restaurant owner who likened the state’s coronavirus restrictions to her childhood in communist Eastern Europe was released Tuesday after four nights in jail for ignoring orders to shut down. Marlena Pavlos-Hackney paid a $15,000 fine and satisfied authorities that Marlena’s Bistro and Pizzeria in Holland finally would remain closed while it lacks a food license. Her supporters boarded up the doors but also turned the building into a symbol of defiance with signs such as “Stop the Injustice.” Some bars, restaurants, gyms and other businesses have been fined for violating Michigan’s restrictions during the pandemic. But Pavlos-Hackney’s arrest before dawn Friday broke new ground and angered her allies, especially Republican lawmakers. Pavlos-Hackney is “Michigan’s first political prisoner of the pandemic,” state Sen. Tom Barrett said on the Senate floor Tuesday, even offering to take her spot in jail. “Come in the broad daylight. I just need a minute to pack my toothbrush,” Barrett said, aiming his words at Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. State regulators yanked Pavlos-Hackney’s food license in January for serving indoor diners and breaking other rules related to preventing the spread of COVID-19. But the restaurant, 180 miles west of Detroit, stayed open – and customers flocked there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Twin Cities commercial real estate managers are fearful Target Corp.’s decision to leave a main downtown Minneapolis location will become a trend that will continue to diminish office space needs. Target informed the City Center’s manager this month that it will no longer need the 985,000 square feet of office space it rents in the 51-story tower because it is permanently moving to a hybrid remote work model for 3,500 employees. Target’s lease expires in 2031. The company said many headquarters employees are currently working remotely. The COVID-19 pandemic has darkened many buildings in the downtown business district as employees adjust to working at home to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Building managers are bracing for additional fallout from the big retailer’s decision to leave the City Center, the Star Tribune reports. A recent Cushman & Wakefield national survey revealed that 81% of employers across 35 markets expect to switch to a work-from-home model post-COVID-19. According to C&W, about 22% of Minneapolis’ core business district’s 28.4 million square feet of office space is vacant.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Jackson Convention Complex will host a mixed martial arts competition Saturday, its first big live-audience event since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down venues where large gatherings were commonplace. Oak View Group Facilities, the group that manages and operates the Jackson Convention Complex, announced in a news release that the venue will host the ongoing fight series, Empire Fighting Championship. The Empire FC X is a mixed martial arts event that will have 17 fights at the convention center. “Our team has been working tirelessly with local officials to ensure proper safety protocols are in place to have spectators attend an event here in at the Jackson Center Complex,” Mark Arancibia, general manager for Oak View Group Facilities, said in the news release. The convention center will have a limited capacity of 1,000 people for the event and will have predetermined, socially distanced sitting areas, Arancibia said. He said the Jackson Convention Complex has hosted some high school volleyball matches with spectators, but Saturday’s competition will be the first professional sporting event. Fans will be required to wear masks inside the convention center. There will also be hand sanitizing stations throughout the space.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: With COVID-19 cases on the decline and vaccinations on the rise, two mid-sized cities are easing restrictions. St. Joseph Mayor Bill McMurray on Monday ended the requirement to wear a mask, effective Wednesday, the St. Joseph News-Press reports. Meanwhile, in mid-Missouri, the health department for Columbia and Boone County is reducing restrictions on bars, restaurants and other businesses. McMurray initially opposed ending St. Joseph’s mandate but relented after the City Council voted 5-4 in support of doing away with it. The decision was ultimately McMurray’s because he had been given authority over the mandate earlier in the pandemic. Opponents of ending the mandate cited concerns about Buchanan County’s vaccination rate of 13%, one of the lowest in Missouri. “I hope everybody will exercise good judgment and wear their masks in situations that we are very close to people,” McMurray said. “We’re not out of the woods yet.” In Columbia, health director Stephanie Browning announced a new order that ends limits on the size of gatherings at bars, restaurants, entertainment venues and other businesses, the Columbia Daily Tribune reports. The order also eliminates limits on the number of spectators for sports and activities.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A sixth lawmaker has tested positive for the coronavirus during this year’s legislative session, COVID-19 panel chairman Sen. Jason Ellsworth said Tuesday. The identity of the lawmaker was not released. The legislator is quarantining away from the Capitol, according to a statement by Ellsworth. The legislator was last in the building “within the past few days” and tested positive “within the past day,” according to panel spokesperson Kyle Schmauch. More than a month has elapsed since legislative leaders last confirmed a positive test among lawmakers. Coronavirus testing for legislators and legislative staff is available inside the Capitol on a weekly basis. The Legislature’s COVID-19 panel, tasked with addressing coronavirus-related rules during the session, has not met in more than two months.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A scaled-down version of the Nebraska State Fair in 2020 finished with a nearly $1.8 million profit, a substantial improvement over a disastrous fair the previous year, according to an annual audit. An audit by BKD of Lincoln found last year’s fair had revenue of nearly $6.5 million, a drop of about 37% from 2019, The Lincoln Journal-Star reports. However, because fair officials chose not to have a carnival or paid entertainment in response to the coronavirus pandemic, expenses declined to $3.7 million, about $7 million less than in 2019. With other factors such as interest and depreciation, the fair ended with a net profit of about $1.8 million. The 2019 fair incurred a nearly $1.5 million loss after managers spent heavily on entertainment to celebrate the fair’s 150th anniversary before bad weather caused a sharp drop in attendance. Fair officials had to lay off nearly half the staff and take out $1.1 million in credit to cover bills. An audit taken after that fair said Patrick Kopke, the fair’s former chief of finance, paid nearly $150,000 to a company he created for services that weren’t performed. Kopke was charged with felony theft. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In his first trip since being confirmed, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra visited the state Tuesday to talk up the Affordable Care Act and efforts underway to expand coverage and reduce the cost of health care. The secretary is one of several surrogates President Joe Biden dispatched to drum up support for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which includes funding for people who lost health care coverage amid the pandemic. “I hope Nevadans take full advantage of what it does to help middle class families on the edge” during the pandemic, Becerra said. At a Carson City health center, he announced an extension of the special enrollment period for the federal health insurance marketplace to Aug. 15. Former Gov. Brian Sandoval was one of the few Republican governors to create a state-based exchange and expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The law reduced the size of Nevada’s uninsured population drastically. Sandoval on Tuesday called the decision one of the most important he made as governor and said the politics “were not as complicated as one would think.” State lawmakers from both parties supported his approach due to Nevada’s high uninsured rate, he said. Amid the pandemic, Sandoval hopes state governments consider similar policies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state will host its second mass vaccination site this weekend at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Vaccinations are by appointment only, and there were still slots for those eligible to schedule appointments at the state’s online site, VINI. The state hopes to vaccinate 8,000 people this weekend at the speedway. The site will be open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The Pfizer vaccine will be the only option offered. About 12,000 people were vaccinated at the first mass vaccination clinic at the speedway March 6-8.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Renters can now apply to receive up to a year’s worth of housing assistance after the state launched its online application for $353 million worth of grants for low- and moderate-income households behind on payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who have missed rental payments since March 13, 2020, can apply for assistance at the Department of Community Affairs website at njdca.onlinepha.com. The application site launched Monday at 9 a.m. and will remain open until the state receives enough applications to distribute all of the $353 million. More than 350,000 New Jersey households are behind on rent payments, according to U.S. census data from late February. Renters cannot be kicked out of their homes during New Jersey’s eviction moratorium, but landlords are still submitting tens of thousands of eviction filings in court for nonpayment of rent. Rental assistance payments could be distributed directly to landlords as early as May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Legislature is asserting its budgetary authority over $1.6 billion in new federal aid that dwarfs year-to-year spending adjustments, setting an agenda for economic recovery that Gov. Lujan Grisham could challenge with her veto pen. Congress and President Joe Biden approved the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package this month that funnels billions of dollars directly to New Mexico’s state government, school districts and local governments. A state Senate finance committee quickly channeled about $1 billion of that economic relief to accounts and initiatives that avoid future payroll tax increases on businesses, underwrite college tuition for in-state students, and backfill lost income at state museums and more. A final budget bill approved by the Legislature devotes federal relief of $600 million to replenishing the state’s unemployment trust fund. The fund began borrowing from the federal government last year to fulfill unprecedented unemployment claims. Lawmakers earmarked another $6 million for the state fair in Albuquerque, along with $14.5 million to bolster spending at state parks, historic sites and New Mexico’s world-renowned public museum system. Those facilities were closed down for much of the past year as a health precaution against the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie was one of two lawmakers who said they tested positive for the coronavirus Tuesday, though both Democrats said they were experiencing only mild symptoms. Assembly member Ron Kim of Queens announced his positive test on Twitter, saying he was in isolation. Kim has been one of the loudest voices calling for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to be impeached as the governor faces scandals revolving around the classification of nursing home deaths and allegations of sexual harassment. Kim said Cuomo had vowed to “destroy” him during a private phone call for nursing home criticism he felt was unfair. Cuomo has denied the allegation. Heastie, who represents the Bronx, said he would be working from his Albany residence as he and other leaders of the Legislature try to reach a state budget deal with Cuomo by the April 1 deadline. Heastie tested positive despite receiving the first of two vaccine doses March 6. It generally takes two weeks after a second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for a person to build full protection. “I am in frequent contact with my physician and look forward to a full recovery,” Heastie said in a statement. The Assembly began meeting virtually when the pandemic struck last year to limit the spread of the virus among lawmakers and staff.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday eased several restrictions that will soon allow businesses to open at greater capacity and more people to assemble indoors and outdoors. Starting Friday, bars and sports and entertainment venues can open at 50% capacity indoors or outdoors, with the 11 p.m. cutoff for on-site alcohol consumption fully lifted. Restaurants, breweries, wineries, amusement parks, gyms and bowling alleys can fully reopen outdoors and at 75% capacity indoors. Museums, aquariums, retail businesses and shops, hair salons and personal care businesses can operate at 100% capacity indoors and outdoors. Gatherings not otherwise included in the updated executive order set to expire April 30 will increase to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. The statewide mask mandate will remain in place, and the required 6 feet of physical distancing may not allow businesses to reopen at the capacity caps outlined. “These are significant changes, but they can be done safely,” Cooper said at an afternoon news conference. The announcement comes as a handful of North Carolina counties have expanded COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to all adults, regardless of age, health condition or job type, due to limited demand in their areas.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A popcorn machine has been removed from the North Dakota Capitol after it twice triggered fire alarms that brought firefighters to the building this week and caused legislators to evacuate. Rep. Mary Johnson was on her third batch of popcorn Monday afternoon when the machine triggered the alarms for the second time that day. Johnson said she wasn’t aware of a policy that bans popcorn poppers, toasters and other food appliances from the building, with the exception of the Capitol Cafe. House Majority Leader Chet Pollert said the popcorn helped bring together House Republicans, whose caucus has been “a little strained” due to the coronavirus pandemic and the House expulsion of former Rep. Luke Simons, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Popcorn cheers people up for a reason,” Pollert said. “And now it’s gone, and that’s the way it goes.” Facility Management Director John Boyle said the policy was established to prevent the activation of fire alarms.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Multiple local health departments are sounding the alarm about legislation restricting their ability to respond to emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic. The agency heads laid out their concerns in letters to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday, documenting how the bill would slow down or block local officials from ordering businesses to close or requiring residents to quarantine or isolate without a medical diagnosis. “Board of health orders are crucial tools to mitigate a situation, allowing time for a full investigation of a situation before it becomes urgent or worsens,” Franklin County health officials wrote. “Orders like these are utilized sparingly and almost always involve guidance and expertise from the CDC or the Ohio Department of Health.” The department and several other public health agencies opposed Wednesday’s steps by House and Senate Republicans to override DeWine’s veto of the bill. But GOP legislators made good on their promise to check the authority of their fellow Republican by issuing the first override of his term after a yearlong battle over how the state should respond during a health emergency.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state Senate panel voted Monday to endorse the confirmation of Dr. Lance Frye as commissioner of the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The Senate Health and Human Services Committee’s vote on Gov. Kevin Stitt’s nominee sent the pick to the full Senate for a vote. A member of the Oklahoma National Guard, Frye previously served as residency program director and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oklahoma State University’s Center for Health Sciences. “His extensive medical and military experience is a reflection of his longstanding commitment to serving others in times of crisis and uncertainty,” Stitt said in a statement. “He was the right man for the job at the height of the pandemic, and I’m confident his leadership will continue to benefit the health and lives of Oklahomans.” Stitt’s last pick to lead the health department, Gary Cox, was forced to resign after the same Senate committee refused to take up his nomination last year. Meanwhile, newly reported coronavirus cases in Oklahoma continued to decline Wednesday, and the number of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines was rising. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Oklahoma dropped by 41.1% during the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Three students have filed class-action lawsuits against the state’s two largest colleges saying they were charged full price for online classes of poorer quality than in-person classes. When the University of Oregon and Oregon State University closed their campuses because of the coronavirus pandemic, they didn’t offer to refund students’ tuition bills, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The University of Oregon says on its website that in order to provide quality education now and in the future, it cannot discount tuition. The universities did agree to refund portions of their room and board. “The University of Oregon, we believe, has unfairly continued to charge tuition payers for all of the things they were not allowed to experience and use during the COVID-19 campus closure and switch to online classes,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman and attorney for students in the class action. Caine Smith filed the suit against Oregon. Danielle Pranger and Garrett Harris filed the complaint against Oregon State. The suits, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court earlier this month, did not specify how much they are seeking in damages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As life languished in the early days of the pandemic and most people stayed home, vandals left their mark in Philadelphia. The graffiti in March 2020 included multiple swastikas and other symbols of hate, including the white supremacist symbol “1488” that partially pledges allegiance to Hitler. And a disturbing message was found inside a public restroom in the city, which had a powerful Black voting bloc capable of determining the outcome of an election: “We need to re-implement Jim Crow.” Hate symbols found that day were among 330 incidents reported last year in Pennsylvania by the Anti-Defamation League – a record high since the ADL started tracking cases in the state five years ago. Most of the incidents involved white supremacist propaganda, while 96 were anti-Semitic incidents, and eight were white supremacist events. The findings line up with those noted by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, the top civil rights agency in the state, and numerous personal experiences shared on social media. The accounts from individuals and agencies all illustrate an important point: As life slowed down during the pandemic, hate did not, experts said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s two largest hospital groups did not violate laws or break state policies when they offered COVID-19 vaccinations to their board members before they were eligible, but they did erode public confidence in the fairness of the vaccination process, state Attorney General Peter Neronha said Tuesday. Front-line health care workers were among the first people in Rhode Island to be eligible for a shot, but Lifespan and Care New England, after vaccinating workers at high risk of exposure, offered vaccinations to board members and some other employees, no matter their age or risk level. The move drew criticism from people who said many high-risk residents were being denied vaccinations and prompted the attorney general’s investigation. “The appearance or perception that certain connected or wealthy individuals were, by virtue of their seat on a hospital board of directors, being given an opportunity to ‘jump the line’ months in advance was upsetting to many and fueled anxiety among everyday Rhode Islanders who were dutifully waiting their turn,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to management at both organizations and the state Department of Health. However, the state gave the hospital groups wide discretion on whom they should vaccinate, the letter said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina House gave key approval Tuesday to the state’s $9.8 billion budget, which provides small raises for most teachers and some law enforcement officers but not for other state employees. Republican leaders promised either a bonus or a raise for most lower-paid state employees if somewhat rosier predictions about the state’s economy recovering from the COVID-19 downturn come true after taxes are collected this spring. “To make sure we thank state employees and we recognize their hard work and their sacrifice – we need to do that with an increase in their pay,” said Rep. Murrell Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the budget. Smith said if for some reason tax collection isn’t enough to ensure revenue every year for a raise, he will push for a bonus. Smith was responding to Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who made her annual trip to the front of the House to ask for the raises. “State employees are pretty fed up with being told to wait until next year,” the Democrat from Orangeburg said. State employees appreciated the praise for working through the pandemic. But “there’s no paper that goes along with that praise,” Cobb-Hunter said. She promised she would ask for a 5% raise later this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Students will again miss out on school-sanctioned prom this year because of COVID-19 precautions but can instead celebrate with a “grand march” at their school. Still, that’s not stopping parents and students from hosting off-site, unsanctioned prom events. Carly Uthe, a spokesperson for the Sioux Falls School District, said in an email Monday that the district began discussing prom in January, and district leaders and high school principals decided by February that the grand march opportunity would still “provide seniors with a memorable experience with their classmates.” The sheer number of seniors at each school and the need for social distancing and mask-wearing led officials to determine a dance would not comply with health and safety protocols, Uthe said. But that’s not enough for some. To make the end of high school memorable for their seniors, parents at Sioux Falls’ high schools are hosting proms on their own dime. Lincoln High School parents plan an “Underground Prom” at The Social, a local event venue. Washington High School’s unsanctioned prom will be held at the Convention Center. Roosevelt High School is combining a prom and senior party into one event at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance. Parents with all three said masks will be required at their proms.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Citing demand slack for COVID-19 vaccinations, the city of Memphis and Shelby County announced Monday that COVID-19 vaccine eligibility would expand to everyone 16 and up, with appointments opening Friday for vaccinations next week. The move is a long-awaited one for thousands of people who haven‘t been eligible for a vaccine because they weren’t old enough or didn’t have preexisting conditions. It also marks the start of the final push toward herd immunity from COVID-19 and an attempt to return to some sort of normalcy. “Our aim is to get as many shots into as many arms as fast as we possibly can. And the phenomenon that we were seeing was not only were we not having all of our appointments filled, but we were having people double-book and triple-book appointments and then being no-shows,” said Doug McGowen, the city’s chief operating officer and leader of vaccine efforts for Shelby County. The move toward eligibility for nearly everyone could lead to demand outstripping supply again, something that hasn’t been the case over the past few weeks, as the city and county have had to put out repeated calls for appointments to be filled. McGowen said Tuesday that the public may need to be patient when appointments open to everyone Friday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Launching a legal fight against a fellow Republican, state Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has sued Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick – as well as the entire Texas Senate – in a bid to strike down a rule requiring visitors to the chamber to take a coronavirus test. Senate rules require a negative test, conducted in a tent outside the Capitol’s north entrance, before anybody can walk onto the Senate floor, sit in the overhead gallery or enter a Senate committee room for a hearing. Joined by conservative GOP activist Steven Hotze of Houston, Miller’s lawsuit seeks a court order striking down the testing requirement as a violation of free speech and the right to petition the government as protected by the Texas Constitution. “Government power cannot be exercised in conflict with the constitution, even in a pandemic,” said the lawsuit, filed in state District Court in Travis County. “Texas law does not and cannot empower Patrick or the Texas Senate to impose a medical test before one is able to participate in their government.” Patrick, who presides over the Senate, praised the rule shortly after it was unanimously adopted by senators in January at the start of the legislative session, saying it would protect senators, staff and visitors alike.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: All Utah adults can now begin signing up for a COVID-19 vaccine, with the state having accelerated its timetable for opening the shots up to younger age groups. Previously, vaccines were only available to people 50 or older, along with health care workers, teachers, care facility staff and select other groups. Gov. Spencer Cox announced last week that the vaccines would be available to younger people sooner because as much as 15% of the state’s supply wasn’t being claimed by those in the eligible age groups. State health officials say nearly 1.2 million vaccines have been administered statewide, with about 25,000 per day reported over the past week. Some teenagers 16 and older were also eligible under the new rules. Cox urged people to try to sign up quickly, saying the sudden change in eligibility rules would likely mean there won’t be enough vaccines for all of those interested. But the goal was to use every vaccine available without letting any go to waste, Cox said. “We always want to keep demand above availability,” the Republican governor said during a televised news conference on PBS-Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Amtrak passenger rail service could be back on track in the state within the next few months, officials said. Service on the two trains that serve Vermont – The Vermonter, which runs from Washington, D.C., up the eastern side of Vermont before crossing the state and then ending in St. Albans, and the Ethan Allen Express, which travels between Rutland and New York City – was suspended last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’ve had some preliminary discussions with Amtrak on this, and we had said that we’re looking forward to them coming back and being fully operational,” Scott said Tuesday during his COVID-19 briefing. “We just don’t know exactly when it’s going to be.” Amy Tatko, a spokeswoman for the Vermont Agency of Transportation, told the St. Albans Messenger that restart talks are underway. “We hope to make an announcement within the next several weeks as to what that timeline will look like,” she said. Despite the suspension of service, Amtrak trains have been operating on the Vermont lines to train staff.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday that the state will soon relax some coronavirus-related restrictions for social gatherings and entertainment venues. Starting April 1, Northam said, social gatherings such as weddings may have up to 50 people indoors. Outdoor gatherings can have up to 100 people. Indoor entertainment venues will be able to operate at 30% capacity or with up to 500 people. Outdoor venues can operate at a 30% capacity with no limits on the actual number of people. For example, a baseball stadium that holds 9,500 fans will be able to host a crowd of roughly 3,000. That will give people room to socially distance, Northam said. Indoor recreational sporting events will be able to have 100 people per field or 30% capacity. Outdoor events will be able to accommodate 500 people per field or 30% capacity. “These are measured changes,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. “We still have a strict gathering limit and a universal mask mandate and capacity restrictions both indoors and outdoors.” Social gatherings in the state are currently limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors. Some in the wedding business say relaxing the limits to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors may still be too restrictive.\n\nWashington\n\nWoodland: The state Department of Labor and Industries has fined this southwest Washington city for potentially exposing staff to COVID-19 when councilmembers went without face masks during meetings. According to the citation received Friday, Woodland did not comply with the governor’s COVID-19 emergency proclamation banning businesses from operating unless all customers inside the building are wearing facial coverings, The Daily News of Longview reports. “Despite councilmembers choosing not to wear facial coverings at all times, the city continued to facilitate these meetings and expose their employees to the potential spread of COVID-19,” the citation said. “Continued operations in contravention of the orders of the governor unnecessarily endangers employees and creates a substantial probability that death or serious harm could result.” The violation was corrected during the L&I inspection, according to the citation. Woodland Mayor Will Finn could not be reached for comment Monday. Last year, the state received complaints from citizens and staff about people not wearing masks during council meetings. The council has held mostly in-person meetings since June 1, after voting unanimously May 20 to do so “regardless of Gov. (Jay) Inslee’s stay-at-home order.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s vaccination campaign will turn to young people to stem transmission rates after giving shots to most senior citizens. The new strategy to focus on shots for residents ages 16 to 29 comes after officials said they are seeing an increase in doses delivered. “When you have the resources available, you open up multiple fronts against the enemy to deplete their capability,” James Hoyer, a retired major general leading the state’s coronavirus task force, said Wednesday. “In this case the virus is the enemy.” Republican Gov. Jim Justice said more than 70% of residents 65 and over are at least partially vaccinated, but he set a new goal of covering 85% of that population. But he said the state’s focus could now begin shifting to high school and college students and other young adults. “We’re seeing significant transmission occurring with our younger people,” Justice said. He opened up vaccinations to all West Virginians 16 and up Monday. Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus czar, said younger and older people are turning up sicker at hospitals, which he attributed to variants of the coronavirus circulating. The number of coronavirus patients has increased 40% in under two weeks to 212 people.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos called on the state’s business community to “step up” and return workers to offices around the Fourth of July, joining Wednesday with the state Senate’s top Republican in praising Wisconsin’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu offered rare praise for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration, giving it credit for increasing vaccinations. During the virtual event hosted by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, they also pushed for a return to pre-pandemic work routines. “We don’t keep people going through all this rigmarole, which was necessary for a certain amount of time, but we’re now moving beyond it,” Vos said. “It’s up to the business community to step up with government to show the world that we can safely reopen and not have this pandemic hangover really impact our economy going forward in way that none of us want.” Vos’ call for people to return to offices echoes President Joe Biden earlier this month raising the possibility of beginning to “mark our independence from this virus” by the Fourth of July. “That’s the date that I’m looking at,” Vos said. “Kind of that, really, kick start of summer where the vast majority of people want to be outside.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State lawmakers are working on competing proposals to address a projected $300 million shortfall in K-12 education funding over the next two years and are looking to solutions for a longer-term deficit in school funding. The state’s rainy day fund of about $1.3 billion is available to cover the short-term shortfall. But House legislators are working on a bill that would phase in cuts of about $68 million over the next three years, and a Senate proposal would cut $130 million from the school finance model, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Lawmakers are working on a solution with two weeks left in the legislative session. House lawmakers also are discussing a proposal to raise the state sales tax from 4% to 5% once the state’s primary savings account falls below $650 million. The rainy-day fund could reach that threshold as soon as the 2023-24 biennium, legislative staff estimate. Many senators want to explore other possible cuts before supporting tax increases. One proposal includes increasing class sizes. The House bill is set for a final reading this week, with several amendments possible. Lawmakers will likely use that legislation to bridge the difference between the two chambers, according to Senate Education Committee chair Charles Scott of Casper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/03/rockefeller-christmas-snake-burglar-truman-library-news-around-states/49471921/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican Gov. Kay Ivey recognized Ashley M. Jones, the state’s first Black poet laureate, a creative writing teacher who delves into inequality and the difficulty of being Black in America, in the same building where Southern delegates voted to form the Confederacy 160 years ago. Standing in the white-domed Capitol, Ivey presented Jones with a commendation for the honor, bestowed earlier this year by the Alabama Writers Cooperative for a four-year term that begins in January. “Everyone in this room, and I would add folks around the country, are proud of you for being honored with this well-deserved, historic recognition,” Ivey told Jones during the ceremony. As poet laureate, Jones will advocate for poetry and writing in general during lectures and appearances at schools, libraries and other institutions. “I am committed to making space for all of us who write,” she said. Jones’ appointment is “pretty revolutionary,” said Jeanie Thompson, an author and executive director of the Alabama Writers Forum. “She brings a strong statement, but she brings a lot of balance,” said Thompson. “And so I think that she will have things to say that people will hear.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The remains of a man found on Fire Island just west of Anchorage in 1989 have been identified through DNA and genome sequencing, Alaska State Troopers said. Troopers said the victim was Michael Allison Beavers, who owned an excavation business in Chugiak. He was reported missing in 1980. The decadeslong investigation started when human remains were discovered July 24, 1989. An autopsy concluded it was a Caucasian male between the ages of 35 and 50, and evidence found on the remains indicated the death was criminal, troopers said. Officials said it appeared the remains had been on the beach for at least a year, but the date of death couldn’t be determined. A DNA profile entered into the national missing persons database in 2003 came back with no match. Earlier this year, the Alaska Bureau of Investigation Cold Case Investigation Unit reopened the case. Bone samples retained in the case were sent to a private lab, where DNA was extracted and genome sequencing was used to create a comprehensive DNA profile. Beavers’ spouse reported him missing two months after he was last seen alive, in November 1979. Beavers, 40, left his home in Chugiak to travel to Seattle by car to contact a business associate. He never arrived, troopers said. The investigation into his disappearance stalled and closed in 1982. Ten years later, he was declared dead. Troopers said the investigation into his death continues, and anyone with information about his disappearance and death should contact authorities.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 25-foot-tall white pine installed in the state Capitol’s executive tower lobby was lit for the first time Wednesday by Gov. Doug Ducey during a celebration marking the start of the holiday season. The lighting of the Capitol tree is an annual tradition and brings together schoolchildren, state workers and the governor. This year’s celebration featured Christmas carols sung by students from Chandler High School’s choir, the Treblemakers. Last year’s tree lighting ceremony was forced to be held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ducey cheered the return to an in-person ceremony, noting at the time of last year’s lighting, vaccines were not available and the state’s economy was just starting to revive from effects of the pandemic shutdowns.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court upheld the 20-year prison sentence for a former pathologist at an Arkansas veterans hospital who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the death of a patient he misdiagnosed. The three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments by Robert Levy’s attorneys that the sentence was unreasonable. Levy pleaded guilty to misdiagnosing a patient with small cell carcinoma who died after being treated for a type of cancer he didn’t have. Levy falsified the patient’s medical record to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis, according to a plea agreement. Levy was fired from the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville in April 2018. VA officials said in 2019 that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating to 2005.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRiverside: Police are looking for a man dubbed the “snake burglar” who wriggled his way through a Southern California business and fled with several thousands dollars. Surveillance video showed the man slithering on his belly at the Rustic Roots salon in Riverside at about 5 a.m. last Friday after apparently getting into the business through a rooftop fire escape. “It just gave me chills up my spine,” owner Lori Hajj told KNBC-TV. Hajj said the thief she called the “snake burglar” stole hundreds of dollars worth of products, cash from the register and a safe with more than $8,000 inside. A security guard who was installing a new alarm system at the salon told KNBC-TV that the crook had been trying successfully to avoid a motion sensor. The same man might have tried to burglarize other businesses previously, including a local pizza parlor where security video showed a man crawling on his belly, the station said.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Rocky Mountain National Park will have a timed-entry permit system for the third straight season, pending approval from the National Park Service. The park is proposing the system for 2022 with minor tweaks to what was implemented in 2021. The third-most visited national park implemented the pilot system in 2020 to address visitor congestion and resource damage. The park’s timed-entry permit system has been polarizing, with some visitors enjoying less congestion and others complaining about the restrictions that curtail spontaneous trips. Through August, the last month for which visitation numbers were available, the park saw nearly 3.3 million visitors compared with 2.2 million during the same time in 2020. In 2019, the park saw nearly 4.7 million visitors over the entire year. Park spokesperson Kyle Patterson said the park is continually adjusting the system based on data it has collected to help balance visitor experience with resource protection.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Connecticut collected about $1.7 million during its first partial month of legalized online gambling and sports wagering, Gov. Ned Lamont said. The figures represent the state’s share of revenue collected Oct. 12-31. Roughly $1.2 million came from the state’s portion of online casino gambling revenue generated by the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes, and approximately $513,000 came from sports betting revenue generated by the tribes and the Connecticut Lottery Corporation. The money will be deposited into the state’s general fund. Under the state’s new legalized system, Connecticut collects 13.75% of gross gambling revenue from sports wagering, and 18% from online casino gambling until 2026, when the rate increases to 20%. The state does not receive any payments on sports wagers placed at the southeastern Connecticut casinos owned by the two tribes, which currently have opened temporary sports book facilities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Children can now visit inmates at Delaware correctional facilities for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, correction officials said. The Delaware Department of Correction announced in a news release Tuesday that in-person visits at all of its facilities have been expanded to include children and youth under 18. The department said it’s making the change as COVID-19 vaccination expands to include children and aggressive COVID-19 mitigation measures continue in the correctional system. Visiting children must be accompanied by an adult visitor and inmate visits are limited to either one adult or one adult and one child. The department said all in-person inmate visits must be scheduled in advance through the facility and all visits are subject to COVID-19 screening. Commissioner Monroe B. Hudson Jr. emphasized that video visitation is available in all Delaware prison facilities and was expanded early in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:When United flight 2701 from Chicago landed at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Wednesday afternoon, it became the first commercial flight to use 100% sustainable aviation fuel, WUSA-TV reported. It was an important milestone as the travel industry works to fight its contributions to climate change. “Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry, but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels, we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes,” said United CEO Scott Kirby. The demonstration flight departed O’Hare Airport at 1 p.m. CST carrying 100 passengers, with an arrival time of 4 p.m. EST. The flight used 500 gallons of SAF -- a clean alternative to jet fuel -- in one engine and 500 gallons of jet fuel in the other. According to United, airlines are only allowed to use a maximum of 50% SAF on board, meaning past flights using SAF were a combination of the alternative fuel with conventional jet fuel. United Airlines has set a goal of being 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To work towards this goal the company says it plans to buy 1.5 billion gallons of SAF; so far this year they’ve purchased more than 7 million gallons through the Eco-Skies Alliance program.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami is making face coverings optional for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated students whose parents sign opt-out paperwork. The archdiocese made the announcement Tuesday, citing community COVID-19 statistics and the advice of physician advisors, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Miami-Dade County Department of Health. The CDC recommends mask-wearing in public indoor settings, including schools, in areas of substantial or high community transmission. As of Wednesday, Florida was the only state in the nation where transmission was low in nearly every county, according to the CDC’s COVID-19 data tracker. Face masks were already optional for fully vaccinated students and teachers who provided vaccination cards to the school or were confirmed through the FL SHOTS database, the archdiocese said in a statement. Public schools in Miami-Dade and Broward counties allowed parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in early November. If the data trends negatively again, archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agosta said measures will be put back in place.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGrovetown:A nutrition manager at Cedar Ridge Elementary School has been arrested on charges of possession of methamphetamine found at the school, according to a press release from the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. At approximately 8:30 a.m., the department responded to the school where a small amount of methamphetamine was found in an employee restroom in the kitchen. After an investigation, the department believed it belonged to Kelley Nile, the nutritional manager. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office K-9 Division responded to the campus and discovered an additional user amount of methamphetamine in the center console of Nile’s vehicle. Nile was arrested on charges of possession of schedule II narcotics and transported to the Columbia County Detention Center. The Columbia County School District said Nile is no longer employed by the school system. The school is in the process of notifying staff and parents about the situation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii State Department of Health said a laboratory has detected petroleum product in a water sample from an elementary school near Pearl Harbor amid heightened concerns that fuel from a massive Navy storage facility could contaminate Oahu’s water supply. The department said the test result from a University of Hawaii lab is preliminary, and it’s not yet known what type of petroleum was in the water. The sample was taken Tuesday at Red Hill Elementary School. The department is still awaiting test results of samples sent to a lab in California. For three days, hundreds of residents in Navy housing complained of a fuel-like odor coming from their tap water. Some have said they suffered from stomach pain and headaches. The department said all complaints have come from people using the Navy’s water system, and not from anyone who gets their water from Honolulu’s municipal water utility. The Navy and the utility have wells that draw on the Moanalua-Waimalu aquifer, which is located 100 feet below the Navy’s fuel storage tanks at Red Hill. The Navy on Sunday shut down a Red Hill well that draws water from the aquifer out of an “abundance of caution,” a spokesperson said. The department has advised all those using the Navy’s water not to drink their tap water. It’s recommending that those who can smell fuel in their water not to use it for bathing, washing dishes or laundry. The system provides water to about 93,000 people living in and near Pearl Harbor.\n\nIdaho\n\nSugar City: State wildlife officials have euthanized three lion cubs in southeastern Idaho. Officials with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game captured and euthanized the cubs on Friday after they appeared in the backyards of homes in Sugar City. The cubs had been in the area for several days before being captured by wildlife officials. Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman James Brower told the East Idaho News that the mother was nowhere to be found, and the cubs were in poor health. It’s not known what happened to the mother. “We did a pretty thorough examination of these cubs, and they were fairly emaciated,” Brower said. “They were in really poor body condition, so they were not very healthy. There’s no rehabilitation center or place that you can take them to. They would have not made it on their own. They would have starved to death. They were pretty young.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city dropped its lawsuit against the police union in its fight over city employee COVID-19 vaccine orders, saying the complaint became unnecessary as more officers complied. The move follows a judge’s ruling last month to suspend an end-of-the-year city deadline for police officers to get vaccinated. Still, Mayor Lori Lightfoot vowed Wednesday that if union leaders revived talk of an “illegal work stoppage” over the mandate, the city would return to court. The city sued the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7 in October, accusing President John Catanzara of encouraging an “illegal strike.” The city said those who didn’t comply with the vaccine mandate would be placed on “no-pay status.” In public statements and on social media, Catanzara encouraged police to disobey the order. The union also sued. Lightfoot and police leaders said the mandate was put in place to protect officers and the public. More than 460 law enforcement officers have died of COVID-19, including four in Chicago, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette:Six African penguins died at the Columbian Park Zoo after falling ill with avian malaria, zoo officials said. The zoo announced Tuesday that the penguins died despite around-the-clock care that included anti-malarial medications intended to halt their infections. Zoo Director Neil Dale said in a news release that the zoo’s three remaining African penguins were in critical condition after also contracting the illness, the Journal & Courier reported. Avian malaria is a parasitic disease caused by a “plasmodium” that’s transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitos, the zoo said. This disease only affects birds and is not transmissible to humans or other zoo animals. Dale said the first African penguin fell ill on Oct. 24 and despite the zoo veterinary team’s efforts, it died four days later. Five other penguins later died. The zoo’s Penguin Cove exhibit opened at the zoo in July after being pushed back several times because of the COIVD-19 pandemic. Dale said the zoo is working with the exhibit’s design team and continuing to consult experts for preventative measures that would help ward off exposures to the illness.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Former television news anchor Tiffany O’Donnell has been elected mayor of Cedar Rapids. O’Donnell garnered 68% of the vote to businesswoman Amara Andrews’ 32% in Tuesday’s runoff election. The runoff was triggered when no candidate reached a majority 50% of the vote in the Nov. 2 general election. O’Donnell, a former news anchor for television station KGAN and chief executive of Iowa-based women’s leadership group Women Lead Change, campaigned on finishing cleanup from last year’s derecho, fixing city streets and accelerating flood recovery. O’Donnell will take office in January at the end of incumbent Mayor Brad Hart’s term.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A lawsuit filed against a Wichita car dealership by the wife of a police officer injured when he was run over by a sport utility vehicle from the business has been settled for an undisclosed amount. Officer Brian Arterburn was critically injured in February 2017 when he was hit by an SUV driver while putting down stop sticks to stop the vehicle as police chased it. Arterburn’s wife, fellow Wichita police officer Claudale Arterburn, sued Eddy’s Chevrolet Cadillac, its owners and the driver of the SUV, Justin Terrazas. The dealership has said that the vehicle was stolen and that it has “no clear understanding” of how Terrazas came to have it in his possession, the Wichita Eagle reported. But the lawsuit alleged Eddy’s Chevrolet Cadillac gave Terrazas access to the vehicle and did not report the car was stolen for two months before the chase, despite being told it was being used for criminal activity. Terrazas pleaded guilty to charges in the case and was sentenced to nearly 29 years in prison. The lawsuit, which had sought $75 million in actual and punitive damages, had been set to go to trial before the settlement was announced Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Gov. Andy Beshear said he will propose devoting $10 million to support an expansion of Waterfront Park into western Louisville. The 22-acre park expansion will connect downtown and West Louisville along the Ohio River in the state’s largest city, officials said. The total cost of the expansion is $50 million. “For so many people in this city, Waterfront Park is not just a place, it’s an experience,” Beshear said. “It’s the backdrop for some of their happiest moments with family and friends. It’s time that this experience is accessible to all members of the Louisville community.” Beshear will submit his budget proposals to the legislature early next year. The park expansion site will be in the Portland neighborhood within West Louisville. The expansion will include plazas, gardens and an observation pier at the river’s edge that can accommodate events, performances and other gatherings.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:In two short weeks, Miss Louisiana, Julia Claire Williams, will compete on the national stage for the title of Miss America. “I really am most looking forward to visiting with all of the state title holders,” Williams said. “They’re such kind, strong, compassionate, impactful, young women, and to stand amongst them to compete for this job is such an honor.” The competition, which takes place Dec. 16 at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. The centennial Miss America competition was set to take place last year, but it was canceled because of the pandemic. Williams works as an emergency room scribe for St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe. She is a graduate of University of Louisiana Monroe and hails from Kinder in the southwest part of the state. Williams said she has enjoyed fulfilling the role of Miss Louisiana, including her social impact initiative, which focuses on serving disadvantaged and disabled youth. Although there isn’t one specific facet she has enjoyed more than the others, she said the job has helped her grow as a person. Through her experience, Williams said she has increased her public speaking skills and grown in her adaptability.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunk: The federal government is providing a small meat processor in Maine with $200,000 to help rebuild from a devastating fire last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is giving the money to Nest & Mullen LLC of Kennebunk, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree said Tuesday. The fire destroyed a processing plant in September 2020. The grant will help the business recover and rebuild, Pingree said. She said the fire “not only destroyed their plant, but it shook the foundation of their entire business and threatened their livelihood.” Nest & Mullen is a five-generation farm and butcher shop, Pingree said. The money is through USDA’s Meat and Poultry Inspection Readiness Grant program. The agency announced $32 million in grants to dozens of processing facilities earlier in the week.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan outlined preparation plans in the state for the omicron variant of COVID-19, urging people to get vaccinated and to get a booster shot if enough time has gone by since they have been vaccinated. The governor spoke at a news conference not long after after the White House announced that a person in California who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 became the first in the U.S. to have an identified case of the omicron variant. The state’s Board of Public Works approved an emergency procurement Wednesday to acquire additional special reagents and supplies to further expand the state’s capacity to track and detect variants of the coronavirus. The board also voted to extend the state’s genomic sequencing agreements to track various mutations of the coronavirus with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University. Through agreements with the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, Maryland is now sequencing at nearly three times the level recommended by public health experts, the governor’s office said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts is deploying three mobile units to administer monoclonal antibody treatment to high-risk individuals who have been exposed to or have COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker said. The clinics have the capacity to treat up to 500 patients a week with therapies that can help reduce the severity of the disease and keep COVID-19-positive individuals from being hospitalized. Two of the new mobile units – currently in Fall River and Holyoke – began administering monoclonal antibody treatment to patients last week, according to the administration. A third unit is set to be deployed to Everett on Friday. The mobile clinics will increase access to monoclonal antibody treatment in Massachusetts, according to Baker. The mobile clinics can be relocated based on demand. Referral from a health care provider is required for treatment at any of the three new mobile clinics. Treatment will be provided at no cost to the patient and offered regardless of immigration status or health insurance. Patients should talk to their doctor about whether monoclonal antibody treatment is right for them.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: An 11-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed her father and three other people was released Wednesday from a rehabilitation hospital. “She’s Laney, she’s great and she’s our miracle,” said Christie Perdue of Gaylord, referring to her daughter Laney. Laney was one of five people in a plane that crashed on Beaver Island off Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula on Nov. 13. The family believes Laney survived because her father, Mike, shielded her during the crash. Laney was released from Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital in Grand Rapids. “We’ve gone from no walking to a wheelchair to a walker and now to crutches,” Christie Perdue told WOOD-TV. “Her goal was to go home on crutches.” Mike Perdue died, along with the pilot and a couple. The crash is being investigated by a federal transportation agency. “Our community has just surrounded us with love,” Christie Perdue said. “Laney’s getting letters from schools all over Michigan, letters from New York and Minnesota, and we are just so grateful.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minnesota Department of Health said it’s not approving anxiety disorders as a qualifying condition for medical marijuana, unlike neighboring North Dakota and three other states. State Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said there’s not enough scientific evidence of benefits of medical cannabis use when compared to the possibility of “unintended consequences.” No new conditions will be added to the existing list of 17 qualifying health issues. “We received many comments from health care practitioners treating patients with anxiety disorder, and they urged us to not approve it as a qualifying medical condition,” Malcolm said. North Dakota added anxiety disorders to its accepted uses two years ago, when it immediately became the most commonly cited condition. Minnesota did agree to add infused edibles in the form of gummies and chews to a list of approved products that includes pills, vapor oil, liquids, topicals, powdered mixtures, and orally dissolvable medicines like lozenges. “Expanding delivery methods to gummies and chews will mean more options for patients who cannot tolerate current available forms of medical cannabis,” Malcolm said.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A downtown Tupelo neighborhood has joined the National Register of Historic Places. Advocates learned about the designation in late September, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. The largely residential area includes hundreds of parcels on about 163 acres of land. Chris Grimes, vice president of the Historic Downtown Neighborhood Association, helped organize the effort. Grimes owns a historic home in the newly designated neighborhood that dates to 1870 and will now be able to apply for tax credits for some of the restoration work that’s underway, the Daily Journal reported. He had initially sought National Register designation only for his home, but the Mississippi Department of Archives & History thought other homes should be included, according to the newspaper. Downtown Tupelo and other neighborhoods in the city already have the designation. “Believe it or not, it’s easier to get a neighborhood on the register than it is to get an individual home,” Grimes said. Mississippi has more than 1,300 listings in the register, the nation’s official list of sites, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their significance.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence:The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum was scheduled to reopen with limited hours Thursday. The museum will initially reopen on Thursdays through Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for those who bought advance tickets online. Visitors will be required to wear masks. The museum reopened in July after a two-year renovation project but was closed again in October when COVID-19 cases began to increase in Jackson County. “The pandemic has presented a lot of challenges, but we are prepared and anxious to open our doors to make history come to life for our visitors,” museum Director Kurt Graham said. The nearly $30 million renovation was the most extensive project at the museum since it was built in 1957. It offers more exhibits and artifacts, along with interactive exhibits, and a new layout that walks visitors through Truman’s life from his Missouri childhood through his presidency and his later years.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife workers and volunteers scrambled Wednesday to save trout and other fish stranded by an abrupt drop in water levels on a river that’s renowned among anglers. A malfunctioning gate that lets water out of Hebgen Dam just west of Yellowstone National Park caused flows into the Madison River to plummet early Tuesday, according to dam operator NorthWestern Energy. That left side channels cut off from the main river and some areas with no water. Some fish have died, according to outfitters who provided photos of fish lying on exposed rock beds that normally would be covered with water. More fish are at risk in the cut-off side channels, fly fishing shop owner Kelly Galloup said. Galloup said bigger trout likely moved to deeper pools as water levels dropped. But he expected a significant impact on fish born last year that were too small to escape the sudden drop in flows. There was no immediate estimate of the number of fish stranded, but Galloup said hundreds had been rescued Tuesday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized in Nebraska with the coronavirus continues to climb and reached 555 on Tuesday, which was the highest since last winter. The state said 14% of the hospitalized patients were between the ages of 20 and 44, and doctors at several of Nebraska’s largest hospitals said younger patients have been showing up in intensive care units more often. Although the number of hospitalizations remains well below last fall’s peak of 987, the state’s hospital capacity is strained because hospitals were busy with other patients before COVID-19 cases increased this fall. The state said only 13% of the adult ICU beds and 20% of the pediatric ICU beds were available Tuesday. Dr. Matthew Donahue, the acting state epidemiologist, said unvaccinated Nebraskans are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than people who have been vaccinated. He said the spread of the coronavirus’ highly contagious delta variant has fueled the rise in cases. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska decreased over the past two weeks, going from about 864 per day on Nov. 15 to about 771 per day on Monday. But the number remains high.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A union for drivers and the operator of metro Reno’s transit bus system said they have reached a tentative agreement to settle a contract dispute that dramatically reduced service during the past three weeks. Officials of Teamsters Local 533 and Keolis International said Tuesday normal service would resume immediately if the agreement is approved by a vote of represented employees later this week. Terms of the proposed settlement were not immediately available. Only a handful of routes ran during the strike, leaving thousands of riders without public transportation. Teamsters 533 President Gary Watson said some issues between the union and Keolis remained unresolved but that union officials were hopeful that those can be resolved in the coming months. Keolis Vice President Mike Ake said the tentative agreement resulted from productive negotiation sessions held over the weekend. The strike began Nov. 9 after the union rejected the “best and last offer” proposed by Keolis, which operates the system for the Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter:The 23rd annual Festival of Trees benefitting the Community Children’s Fund kicked off in-person Wednesday morning at the Town Hall after a fully virtual event last year. The event was spread out over two days in an effort to manage the number of visitors. Bidding on the 51 Christmas trees donated and decorated by local businesses was done online. Organizers said they were elated to be able to restart the event in-person at the Town Hall after a year marred by the pandemic. The Christmas trees, all donated by Ace Hardware, feature a variety of goodies for the lucky winners ranging from candy to Guinness beer. Foss Motors has a double donation tree where the dealership will match the buyer’s bid up to $2,000 to be donated to a charity of the buyer’s choosing. And, as always, there is the gift card tree, which features gift certificates from local businesses totaling $2,800.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Republican lawmakers scorned statehouse rules requiring proof of either COVID-19 vaccination or a negative test to enter the building and sought to halt the mandate with a lawsuit. Assembly and Senate Republicans, who are in the minority, sued late Wednesday seeking to stop the requirement and set the stage for a confrontation with law enforcement officials. That’s because both chambers have scheduled votes for the afternoon, when legislators are expected to gather to cast their votes. GOP Assembly member Brian Bergen walked into the statehouse complex unstopped by officials and didn’t show proof required under the policy set by the State Capitol Joint Management Commission, the panel made up of administration and legislative officials that sets rules for the building. “It’s unfair and completely discriminatory policy. they’re essentially creating two classes of people, vaccinated and unvaccinated,” he said in an interview. Legislators who don’t follow the protocol won’t be permitted into the legislative chambers, according to Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin’s spokesperson Kevin McArdle, who added that leaders have spoken with state police and the attorney general’s office.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said she will pursue a 7% pay increase for educators and staff at K-12 public schools, as well as higher minimum salaries for teachers at various career stages. The proposal would boost salaries for more than 50,000 public school workers across the state at an annual cost of about $280 million. The Legislature convenes in January to craft a general fund spending plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1. The governor’s office estimated the proposed changes would increase the statewide average for teacher pay to just over $64,000 a year. New Mexico’s minimum teacher salaries would increase to between $50,000 and $70,000, depending on experience and certifications. Current minimums ranging from $41,000 to $60,000 were set in 2019. The proposed changes would bring New Mexico roughly in line with the recent national average for teacher pay of about $64,000.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The holly, jolly, best time of the year got a light-filled launch Wednesday, when the towering Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center was officially turned on. The 79-foot Norway spruce, covered with more than 50,000 lights in a rainbow of colors and bearing a crystal-covered, 900-pound star, was lit in a midtown Manhattan ceremony again open to the public, in contrast with last year’s virus-impacted event. The lighting was televised on NBC and hosted by NBC “Today” anchors Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Craig Melvin. Among the musical performances were Harry Connick Jr., Norah Jones, Brad Paisley and Alessia Cara. The high-kicking Radio City Rockettes were also part of the celebration. This year’s tree came from Elkton, Maryland, where it stood for more than 80 years outside a family home. The first Christmas tree was placed in Rockefeller Center by men working there in 1931.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed legislation that would bar officials from counting mail-in absentee ballots received after Election Day, even if their envelopes were postmarked on or before that date. Cooper’s veto was expected, given that Republicans pushed through the measure on party lines. Any GOP attempt to override his veto also is likely to fail given that Republicans majorities in both the House and Senate aren’t veto-proof. Republicans haven’t overturned any of Cooper’s previous 12 vetoes this year. Current law says envelopes postmarked by the day of the primary or general election can count if they are received within a three-day grace period. Republicans insist the bill would boost confidence in election outcomes by the public and help the media call results more quickly.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Gov. Doug Burgum said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has granted his request for another extension of the hours of service waiver for drivers of commercial vehicles transporting water and livestock feed to help North Dakota livestock producers affected by continuing drought conditions. Burgum first granted a similar 30-day waiver in an executive order Sept. 22, and the FMCSA previously extended the waiver through Nov. 23. Under the new extension, the waiver will remain in effect through Dec. 24 or until the end of the emergency, whichever is earlier. Thursday’s U.S. Drought Monitor report showed 9% of North Dakota remains in extreme drought, mostly in the northwest corner, 33% is in severe drought, 30% is in moderate drought and 21% is rated as abnormally dry.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:The Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund is asking lawmakers to boost the required employer contribution rates to the retirement system. The fund is backing legislation that would increase employer contribution rates to 26.5% of payroll for police and firefighters, up from 19.5% and 24%, respectively. An estimate for how much that would cost Ohio’s 900 local police and fire departments was not immediately available. “I think that the employers, mayors, etc, understand the essential nature of recruiting and retaining public safety officers – not just through COVID but we’ve had a lot of social unrest,” said fund Director Mary Beth Foley. “So we need them and they need a defined benefit plan that they can rely upon, they need disability benefits to be ensured.” The employer contribution was last increased in 1986. Foley said the goal is to move legislation, which has yet to be introduced, through the House and Senate by December 2022. Over the past eight years, employee contribution rates increased by 2.25% to 12.25% and retirees have been forced to pay more for health care benefits.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A human skull found in southwestern Oklahoma 16 years ago has been identified as that of a missing Muskogee woman, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said. The skull is that of Rebecca Jean Boyd, who was 29 when she disappeared in 2002, the OSBI said. The skull, found in a field by a farmer in Kiowa County in July 2005, was known only as Kiowa Jane Doe. “We are happy that Rebecca’s family has her back and can give her the proper burial that she deserves,” said OSBI Director Ricky Adams. “Now our Cold Case Unit is going to determine how she ended up in that field and who is responsible.” No other remains have been found and a suspected cause of death has not been determined, according to OSBI spokeswoman Brook Arbeitman. “We have a lot of questions that need to be answered,” Arbeitman said. “The first step was to get her identified.” Arbeitman said Boyd was visiting relatives in Lawton when she was last seen on July 26, 2002. Boyd was reported missing four days later and was identified when the skull matched a DNA profile of Boyd that had been entered into a national missing persons database.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A Canadian energy company canceled a controversial natural gas pipeline and marine export terminal on the southern Oregon coast after failing to obtain all necessary state permits. Opponents of the Jordan Cove project, which would have created the first liquefied natural gas export terminal on the West Coast in the lower 48 states, rejoiced at the news. The marine export terminal would have been located at Coos Bay, with a 230-mile feeder pipeline crossing southern Oregon. Many landowners, Indian tribes and environmentalists had objected, saying the project by Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corp. could spoil the environment and would have contributed to global warming by producing greenhouse gases. In 2019, protesters filled the Oregon State Capitol and occupied the governor’s office until they were hauled away by state police. Supporters of the project to ship U.S. and Canadian natural gas to Asia said it would create jobs and help the economy. The Coos Bay City Council last year approved dredging part of the bay to increase the width and depth of the shipping channel. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the project in March 2020. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown threatened to go to court to stop the project if it didn’t obtain every permit required from state and local agencies. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality denied a water quality certification for the project, and the Department of State Lands refused to grant another extension to Pembina to file documents in its application for a permit to dredge sediment out of Coos Bay.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: TV stations in Philadelphia, New York City and Cleveland said they are taking down the “Dr. Oz Show,” now that the show’s host, Mehmet Oz, has formally become a candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. The stations were compelled by the Federal Communications Commission’s “equal time” rules that give rival candidates the ability to request matching air time. Oz, 61, will bring his unrivaled name recognition and wealth to a wide-open race that is expected to be among the nation’s most competitive and could determine control of the Senate in next year’s election. This is the celebrity heart surgeon’s first run for public office, but he is facing a crowded Republican primary. The longtime New Jersey resident said he moved to Pennsylvania a year ago.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: An animal shelter has tripled the reward it is offering to $15,500 for help identifying the people who abandoned two dogs found by the side of a road in Portsmouth on Thanksgiving morning. The Potter League for Animals is offering the reward for information about the people who left the two female dogs, WPRI-TV reported. Police said the dogs appeared to be “lethargic and emaciated,” when they were found near a sports complex. They were treated by an emergency veterinarian. One of the dogs had to be euthanized because of her poor health, police said. The animal shelter initially offered a $5,000 reward but contributions from anonymous donors increased the amount of the reward, the station reported. Anyone with information can call Portsmouth police.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Laura Cantral, the executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, one of South Carolina’s most influential environmental groups, is stepping down, prompting a nationwide search for her replacement. Cantral is leaving at the end of December, the organization said in a Wednesday news release. Cantral took over the organization four years ago after the Conservation League’s founder and longtime leader Dana Beach stepped down. The group has worked to oppose offshore drilling, preserve fragile coastal ecosystems against development and advocate to protect other natural resources along the state’s coast. The organization said Cantral is departing for personal family reasons and will move to Atlanta next year. The group’s board of directors will begin searching for a replacement in the coming weeks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWagner:Wagner High School principal and activities director Neil Goster, who was accused of making racist comments toward Native Americans last summer, resigned more than two weeks ago, along with his wife, Cindy, who was a fourth-grade teacher. In a special school board meeting in Wagner two weeks ago, the Goters’ resignations from the Wagner Community School District were accepted by the board in a 5-0 vote. Two board members were absent at the time of the vote. Local residents called on Neil Goter to resign in July and August after LaJuanda Stands and Looks Back alleged in a formal letter that Goter made racist comments to her and other Indigenous people in the town on the Yankton Sioux Reservation. Stands and Looks Back alleged that on July 24, Goter told her and a group of Native American women at a golf course that “my face is so red, I must be Native American.” She was told administrative action was taken by the district after her allegations, but it’s unknown what action was made. According to the Department of Education’s Teacher 411 webpage, Neil and Cindy Goter’s teaching certificates are still active until July 2026. Superintendent Matt Yost would not comment on the story when reached by the Argus Leader. Attempts to reach both Neil and Cindy Goter at their listed phone numbers and email addresses were unsuccessful.\n\nTennessee\n\nSewanee: Reuben Brigety, the University of the South’s vice chancellor and president, said he will resign later this month and would accept a position as U.S. ambassador to South Africa if offered. In a letter Wednesday, Brigety said he decided to leave the post Dec. 21. He wrote that he would accept a nomination for the ambassador job if President Joe Biden nominates him, saying news reports have indicated Biden intends to do so. Brigety, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union, said “it would be unfair to prolong any uncertainty at the University.” The White House has not yet announced a nomination. Additionally, the role requires Senate confirmation. “I have been profoundly honored to serve as the 17th vice-chancellor of the University of the South, and I had expected to serve Sewanee for a long time to come,” Brigety wrote. “Yet I also know that I would not decline my obligation to serve my country if asked by the president of the United States.” Brigety took office in June 2020 as the first African American vice chancellor at the university also known as Sewanee. He previously served as dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: An appeals court halted a federal judge’s order that stopped Texas from enforcing its ban on mask mandates in the state’s schools, allowing the prohibition to remain in effect. In a 15-page ruling, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans granted a request by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to stay the ruling by U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel. The appeals court on Nov. 24 had granted an administrative stay while it issued a formal ruling on Paxton’s request. The 5th Circuit’s ruling on Wednesday means Yeakel’s decision will be on hold while the case goes through the appeals process. The appeals court will ultimately issue a final ruling on his order. The federal judge ruled on Nov. 10 that the ban ordered by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott through an executive order violated a federal law protecting disabled students’ access to public education. The nonprofit advocacy group Disability Rights Texas, which had filed the lawsuit that prompted Yeakel’s ruling, argued Abbott’s ban prohibited accommodations for disabled children particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. In granting the stay, the appeals court said that Paxton would likely win in his appeal, the students represented by Disability Rights Texas likely do not have standing to challenge the ban and the students and the group had not exhausted all remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that makes available a free public education to eligible U.S. children with disabilities.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Nate Brooksby was selected as the Washington County sheriff after the local Republican Party gathered in a special election to decide who would replace Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, who retired because of health problems. Brooksby, who had been the department’s chief deputy, beat out Jared Redfearn with 106 out of 140 votes. The position opened outside of the regular election cycle after Pulsipher announced he would be retiring effective Wednesday. This isn’t the only change in the department leadership, as Undersheriff James Standley also retired this fall. After Standley left the department, Brooksby was appointed to replace him as undersheriff by Pulsipher so Brooksby would be “brought up to speed” on the department’s budget and projects, according to a press release.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: More than 300 Vermont National Guard soldiers are beginning to return to the state, many after nearly a year deployed overseas. The first of the soldiers returned on Wednesday. All are scheduled to be home by Dec. 10. The 172nd Law Enforcement Detachment deployed in January 2021 to support the U.S. Europe Command. Soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the 172nd Infantry (Mountain) departed in February for the U.S. Central Command. The two units were the first of several to deploy throughout the first half of 2021, with a total of more than 950 Vermonters deploying to various locations across Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia. The soldiers of the the law enforcement detachment operated as the primary law enforcement element on Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base in Romania. The soldiers from the 3rd Battalion participated in a variety of missions, including assisting with security at the Kabul during the August evacuations from Afghanistan.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia has launched a new system to improve the response to mental health emergencies. The Marcus Alert system launched Wednesday in five regions in the state, news outlets reported. The system is named for Marcus-David Peters, who was fatally shot in 2018 by police after he charged an officer amid a behavioral health crisis. It will start as a pilot program in Richmond, Virginia Beach, Prince William County, Bristol and adjacent Washington County, and five counties in the northern Piedmont. It must expand to all parts of the state by July 1, 2026. It’s part of a rollout of new services financed by Virginia’s Medicaid program to help people in behavioral crises in their communities to avoid sending them to state mental hospitals, private emergency rooms and juvenile detention centers. The system aims to use regional call centers to alert mental health teams to potential psychiatric emergencies, quickly assess risks and dispatch professionals to help the person in crisis by persuasion instead of force.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state Sen. Keith Wagoner said he plans to challenge newly appointed Democratic Secretary of State Steve Hobbs in next year’s election. Hobbs was sworn into office Nov. 22 following his appointment by Gov. Jay Inslee to replace Kim Wyman, a Republican. Wyman – the fifth consecutive GOP secretary of state in Washington dating to 1965 – resigned to take a key election security job in the Biden administration. Wagoner said voters have long shown a preference for a Republican secretary of state and Inslee failed to recognize that by naming Hobbs, who was a Democratic state senator since 2007. Hobbs’ appointment lasts until the November 2022 election, which will determine who serves the remaining two years of Wyman’s four-year term. Hobbs said he plans to enter that race.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Union maintenance and service workers at Cabell Huntington Hospital ratified a contract late Wednesday to end a month-old strike, the hospital announced. Members of the Service Employees International Union District 119 ratified the three-year contract covering more than 900 workers at the hospital, which said in a statement that employees could likely begin returning to work as soon as Friday. The statement did not disclose details of the contract, which Dr. Kevin Yingling, the hospital’s president, called “fair and equitable.” Under an earlier offer, the hospital had asked union members to begin paying health insurance premiums. “We value all of our employees as each plays an important role in delivering reliable, quality care to our patients,” said hospital Chief Operating Officer Tim Martin. “We are committed to being the best employer in the region with outstanding wages and benefits and this contract confirms that. We look forward to welcoming back our coworkers and resuming normal operations.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:FPC Live, a division of Madison-based Frank Productions and one of the world's largest concert promoters, announced plans to operate a built-from-scratch music venue in the Historic Third Ward, adjacent to the southern end of Maier Festival Park. Actually, it would be two venues – an 800-person-capacity room and a 4,000-person- capacity room – with separate entrances, both housed in the same 108,000-square-foot facility. Pending approvals, including from the Historic Third Ward Architectural Review Board and the City of Milwaukee Board of Harbor Commissioners, construction on the venue could begin in early 2022 and would open in the second half of 2023. The new concert venue would be the latest in Milwaukee's entertainment-building boom. The Milwaukee Bucks' Fiserv Forum, constructed for $524 million, opened in 2018. This year saw the openings of the Bradley Symphony Center, following a $90 million renovation of the Warner Grand Theatre, and the reopening of Summerfest's American Family Insurance Amphitheater after a $51.3 million upgrade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon made state District Court judge John G. Fenn his first appointment to the state Supreme Court. Fenn has served on the Fourth Judicial District bench for Johnson and Sheridan counties since 2007. He previously was an attorney in private practice in Sheridan for 13 years. Fenn’s experience as a judge has earned him respect in Wyoming’s legal community, Gordon said in a statement Thursday. “He has shown himself to be keenly aware of the impact of Wyoming Supreme Court decisions, not only on the law, but also with particular attention to the consequences for the individuals involved in these cases,” Gordon said. Fenn replaces Justice Michael Davis, who is retiring, and will begin on the state high court on Jan. 17. Fenn is a graduate of Big Piney High School and holds undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Wyoming. He helped develop Wyoming’s new Chancery Court created by legislation signed by Gordon in 2019, according to the governor’s office.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/26/school-satan-club-plane-swap-fail-amazon-helix-news-around-states/50142737/", "title": "After School Satan Club, plane swap fail: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The state will remember the Holocaust, the systematic slaughter of Jews and other people by Nazis, with events planned for this week in Montgomery and Birmingham. The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Center for Biological Diversity has joined with two smaller groups in announcing plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if federal officials don’t finish a status review on the thick-leaf bladderpod by mid-June, saying the agency is violating its own deadlines, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/28/cheetah-run-mountain-man-biathlon-prodigal-emu-news-around-states/41078179/", "title": "Cheetah run, mountain-man biathlon: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A new project at the state’s main seaport will open the facility to the shipment of finished automobiles. The Alabama State Port Authority says it has signed a deal to build a $60 million automotive terminal in Mobile. It’s supposed to be ready early next year and will allow for vehicles to roll on and off ships. The 57-acre terminal will be able to handle 150,000 vehicles annually with connections to rail service and highways, officials say. Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Honda currently make cars in the state, and Mazda-Toyota is building a factory in north Alabama. A docks official says the new terminal will open a new business stream for the docks. The project is a joint venture between Terminal Zarate, S.A., a Grupo Murchison company based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Neltume Ports, based in Santiago, Chile.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Legislators have proposed changes to key elements of the state’s Village Public Safety Officer Program. About 1 in 3 communities in the state has no police of any kind, Anchorage Daily News reported last week in partnership with ProPublica. The Department of Justice subsequently declared the public safety gap a federal emergency, officials said. The 40-year-old program uses state money to train and pay officers working in remote villages, but the number of officers fell to a record-low 38 compared to the more than 100 in 2012, legislators in the working group said. The working group spent five months seeking ways to fix the program, which includes placing more certified officers in rural Alaska, increasing morale among current officers and retaining village-based first responders who know their communities best, legislators said.\n\nArizona\n\nQueen Creek: A company’s proposal to take water from farmland along the Colorado River and sell it to this growing Phoenix suburb has provoked a heated debate, and some Arizona legislators are trying to block the deal with a bill that would prohibit the transfer. The legislation introduced by Rep. Regina Cobb would bar landowners who hold “fourth-priority” water entitlements from transferring Colorado River water away from communities near the river. Cobb said this water was supposed to be used for agriculture, and diverting it elsewhere would harm farming communities along the river. “We just needed to get ahead of it and let them know that we’re not for this,” said Cobb, R-Kingman. Cobb said without legislation, she’s concerned hedge funds will try to make more deals to use farmlands for selling off water.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Forrest L. Wood, who created one of the top brands in the boating industry and was a pioneer of bass tournament fishing, has died at age 87. Wood, born in Flippin, Arkansas, founded the company Ranger Boats in 1968 with his wife, Nina. The business quickly grew and became a household name among fisherman around the U.S. He sold the company in 1987. Wood was known as the “father of the modern bass boat.” Keith Daffron, his grandson, said in a Facebook post that Wood died Saturday surrounded by his family, after a brief illness. In a statement, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wood’s death “is a deeply sad moment for our entire state.” Former President Bill Clinton said in a statement that Wood was “ambitious and determined and Arkansas is a better place because he fully invested his time and his talents right here.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Former Gov. Jerry Brown wants to know who is trying to sell his father’s memorabilia related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Private letters and other items that had belonged to Edmund G. “Pat” Brown when he was governor are being offered by the auction house Sotheby’s, which estimates the value at $20,000 to $30,000. Sotheby’s says the seller wants to remain anonymous. The elder Brown, who died in 1996, was California’s top elected official from 1959 to 1967, and eight years later his son started the first of his record four terms as governor. Jerry Brown says he was not consulted or informed of the sale and believes the items should instead reside at the University of California, Berkeley, “with the rest of my father’s papers.” Sotheby’s touts Brown’s materials for sale as unique because “it comes from a single source” and “chronicles a country in mourning.” The auction opened Monday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dipped to 2.5% in December, the lowest level in at least 44 years. An unemployment rate of 2.6% in October and November tied the previous record-low rate in early 2017. The lowest rate before that, 2.7%, occurred in 2000, The Denver Post reports. Yuma and Kiowa counties in northeastern Colorado had the nation’s lowest seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 1.1% in December. Low unemployment is better than high unemployment but can make it hard for employers to find workers, economist Gary Horvath said. “We are in uncharted territory,” Horvath said. “I’m baffled by how companies are making this work.” Colorado has averaged about 84,000 job openings a month since 2001. Colorado had about 150,000 openings in September but only 85,000 people unemployed and seeking work, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Voters who are registered with one party but want to vote in a different party’s presidential primary are facing a key deadline. Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said those voters must change their registration by Tuesday. Voters can look up and check their current registration status online and make any changes at myvote.ct.gov/register. Unaffiliated voters, the state’s largest block of voters, have until April 23 to register with a party online, by mail or at the Department of Motor Vehicles if they want to participate in that party’s presidential primary. They have until April 27 to register in person. Connecticut’s Democratic and Republican presidential primary elections are scheduled for April 28. There are currently 2,192,828 active voters registered in Connecticut. Of those, 895,218 are registered as unaffiliated, 803,802 as Democrats, 459,403 as Republicans and 34,405 in some other party.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: This tiny coastal town’s environment committee held its first discussion last week on ways to reduce plastic intake. Committee members are in the early stages of suggesting various restrictions on plastic, from banning materials outright to putting a fee on others. Along with Wilmington and Newark, Rehoboth is the “farthest along” in reducing plastic use, like charging a fee for single-use bags, says Dee Durham, president of Plastic Free Delaware. The environment committee is eyeing single-use plastic bags, plastic straws and polystyrene, which Durham calls the “low-hanging fruit” of plastic products, meaning they are typically easier to restrict. Last year, state lawmakers chose to ban single-use plastic bags at large retailers. That law, which goes into effect in 2021, doesn’t really impact Rehoboth Beach because it generally applies only to stores 7,000 square feet or bigger or ones with three or more Delaware locations at least 3,000 square feet.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A male harbor seal considered geriatric for his species has died at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. Luke, 35, was humanely euthanized last week, according to a statement. The zoo said he outlived the median life expectancy for his species – 25 years in the wild and 30 years in human care. Luke had been experiencing ocular discomfort and had trouble orienting himself recently, according to the zoo’s statement. He had also experienced a loss of appetite and an unusual lack of interest in training with keepers and socializing with other animals. Animal care staff decided to euthanize him after trying several methods to treat his symptoms. Luke was born June 17, 1984, at New York Aquarium in Brooklyn, and he came to the nation’s capital in 2011, the statement said. He didn’t father any pups, according to news outlets, but lived at the zoo’s American Trail habitat with another male harbor seal and a gray seal colony.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: Residents in an upscale community are seeing red over a paint job on a half-million-dollar home. The home was painted in large patches of extremely bright primary colors with random splatters throughout. The home in the Il Regalo Circle Community in Naples resembles a preschool play toy or cartoon home. Even the trees, lawn and mailbox were splattered with paint. Neighbors said the paint job got worse over the course of a week. WBBH News reports that Collier County Code Enforcement are investigating the paint job. Jeffrey Leibman, 40, is listed as the owner of the home, according to property appraiser records. Neighbors said he painted it, but the management company for the neighborhood said he no longer lives there. The company estimated that reversing the paint job could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is proposing that the state borrow nearly $900 million for construction projects and equipment next year, an amount likely to rise before lawmakers get done with the budget. Key projects in the Republican governor’s plan include $70 million to expand the state-owned convention center in Savannah and $55 million to build a new headquarters for the Department of Public Safety in Atlanta. Lawmakers authorized borrowing of nearly $1.1 billion last year. The agency that forecasts Georgia’s borrowing said the state could issue up to $1.2 billion in bonds this year. In one shift, Kemp wants to move more funding to aid school construction from districts statewide to those that have small property tax bases. Kemp would borrow $155 million for construction in such low-wealth districts, up from $44 million this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State lawmakers have proposed initiatives to help reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities after transportation officials confirmed more than 100 deaths in the past year. Those initiatives include installing traffic cameras to capture drivers running red lights, and enforcing zero-tolerance policies for drinking and driving, Hawaii News Now reports. “Every year, you hear of a horrific pedestrian accident that’s occurring at an intersection because someone did not stop at a red light,” state House Speaker Scott Saiki said. The cameras would automatically record anyone who runs a red light, and a ticket would then be mailed to the address associated with the license plate number, officials said. “There could potentially be a bench warrant for someone who doesn’t appear or who doesn’t respond to the ticket,” Saiki said. “And if you have a bench warrant, potentially there could be some jail time.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two environmental groups have given notice that they intend to file a lawsuit to stop a proposed underground natural gas pipeline from Idaho to Wyoming that the groups say will harm protected grizzly bears and other wildlife. The Alliance for the Wild Rockies and Yellowstone to Uintas Connection sent a required 60-day notice to sue to the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week. The groups contend the Forest Service’s approval of the pipeline project in November violated the Endangered Species Act. The groups also say the 18-mile portion of the 50-mile pipeline would cut a corridor through the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and create a road through six Inventoried Roadless Areas. The 2001 Roadless Rule prevents road construction and timber harvest in designated roadless areas, which are typically 5,000 acres or larger.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The story of a boy who grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s family and later presided over one the nation’s larger retailers will be told in the annual George L. Painter Looking for Lincoln Lecture. Julius Rosenwald spent his formative years in the shadow of the future president and grew up to be president of Sears, Roebuck & Co. He used the fortune he amassed to help those who faced racial injustices. His life will be recalled as part of the annual lecture series at 8:30 a.m. Feb. 12 at the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. It’s presented with the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area, which preserves the history of the central Illinois communities touched by Lincoln’s life. The Rosenwald home, part of the Lincoln historic site, will be renamed in his honor and an exhibit panel about his life and legacy unveiled.\n\nIndiana\n\nJasper: A one-room schoolhouse where the last lessons were taught in early 1950s has been dismantled after efforts to find a buyer for the small building failed. The Dick School had educated generations of Dubois County residents in rural Jasper from 1892 to 1951. But a few weeks ago, the shed-like building was taken down piece by piece in the city about 40 miles northeast of Evansville. The weatherboard structure with a tin roof was moved to a new location after it was closed, and it had remained in good shape. Robin Pate, the current owner of the property on which it stood, had advertised the old schoolhouse and reached out to the Dubois County Historical Society. But Pate couldn’t find any takers for the school, which had been the region’s last functioning one-room schoolhouse, The (Jasper) Herald reports. She’s selling the 2-acre site on which the building stood.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: The leaking inflatable dam on the Cedar River in downtown Waterloo has been fixed, officials said. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reports contractors found a slit in the half-inch-thick rubber and repaired it. Associate city engineer Wayne Castle said the final cost of the project will be significantly below the original $388,350 contract approved in November with J.F. Brennan Co., of La Crosse, Wisconsin. “We’re not completely done yet, but we should be just under $220,000,” Castle said. A major reason for the lower cost was that a marine contractor was able to use divers to inspect the riverbed on the downstream side of the dam, Castle said. The original contract anticipated the contractor building a more expensive wall around the inspection area. The city has inflated the bladder dam since 2009, raising the Cedar River level by about 4 feet to enhance boating. It’s usually inflated in June and deflated in October.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: An effort is underway to more fully tell the story of a boulder that was a sacred prayer rock for a Native American tribe before it was moved to Lawrence and inscribed with the names of the city’s founders. The Lawrence Journal-World reports Pauline Eads Sharp, who serves as secretary and treasurer of the Kanza Heritage Society, and Lawrence artist Dave Loewenstein are leading a wide-ranging team of people, including historians, geologists, artists and filmmakers, to increase interest in the 23-ton red quartzite Shunganunga boulder. At issue is that there currently is no mention on the boulder-turned-monument of the Kanza tribe, which was forcibly removed to Oklahoma in 1873. The approximately yearlong project, called Between the Rock and a Hard Place, will include research, community workshops and the creation of a documentary film and book.\n\nKentucky\n\nHopkinsville: A prosecutor has been absent from court in the weeks following the release of the letter in which he asked former Gov. Matt Bevin to pardon a man convicted of sexual abuse. Two judges in Christian County said there is an agreement between them and Commonwealth’s Attorney Rick Boling that he remain absent from their courtrooms for the “foreseeable future,” The Kentucky New Era reports. Dayton Jones was granted a commutation by Bevin on Dec. 9. The letter Boling wrote on official letterhead Dec. 7 asking the former governor to pardon Jones was released Jan. 9. Boling apologized after it was released. Jones pleaded guilty in 2016 to sodomy, wanton endangerment and distribution of matter portraying a sexual performance by a minor. Boling wrote in his letter to Bevin that the prosecution of Jones was politically motivated. He said the case involved intoxicated teenagers and people in their early 20s “being stupid and immature.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Fans of the late Louisiana author Ernest J. Gaines, who wrote such storied works as “A Lesson Before Dying” and “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,” are gathering to remember his work as part of Black History Month celebrations. The Louisiana Center for the Book in the State Library of Louisiana is hosting the discussion Feb. 19, according to a news release from Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser. Gaines died Nov. 5, 2019. He grew up on a small Louisiana plantation, experiences that later translated into his rich literary characters. “A Lesson Before Dying,” published in 1993, was an acclaimed classic. Both “The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman” (1971) and “A Gathering of Old Men” (1984) became honored television movies. The program will be hosted by Darrell Bourque, who is a two-time Louisiana poet laureate, a close friend of Gaines and a member of the Ernest J. Gaines Center.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Finance Authority of Maine’s board on Monday approved loan guarantees and a loan necessary for a Boston investment group to proceed with purchasing Saddleback Mountain and reopening the area to skiers next winter. The board unanimously approved $2.5 million in loan insurance on a $12.5 million loan, which was smaller than the original request, along with a $1 million direct loan. Arctaris Impact Fund also raised private funds and received a separate $1 million loan through the Maine Rural Development Association. The finance authority and rural development funds will be part of a $23.5 million funding package that includes private equity, new market tax credits, community loans, and community grants for the purchase of Saddleback, officials said. Bruce Wagner, CEO of FAME, said the agency is pleased to “help restart this historic and beloved Maine ski mountain.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Singer and recording artist CeCe Peniston – who released her signature dance hit, “Finally,” in 1991 – will be the headline entertainer and grand marshal for the city’s first organized LGBTQ+ pride celebration, according to Salisbury’s branch of PFLAG, the United States’ first and largest LGBTQ+ ally organization. The city made the announcement in a video on Facebook. The lovably corny clip features Mayor Jake Day vibing to Peniston’s “Finally” in the city government offices. Peniston rose to fame in the early 1990s, when she rapidly become one of the most successful dance club artists in the history of the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play Charts, according to her official website. Salisbury PFLAG announced the city’s inaugural Pride Parade and Festival on National Coming Out Day last October. The event is set for 11 a.m. Sunday, June 7.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has received more than $160 million from federal immigration authorities since 2012, most of which went to four county jails in exchange for housing and transporting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, according to a report in The Boston Sunday Globe that cited documents obtained through a public records request. Advocates and immigration attorneys oppose the agreements with the jails. They say the payments are a waste of taxpayer money, and there are better alternatives to deal with people facing federal immigration charges. The sheriff’s offices for Plymouth, Bristol, Franklin, and Suffolk counties that run the jails have defended the arrangements, with at least two saying their relationship with ICE has made Massachusetts safer. But Matt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration lawyer, said there was “no good public safety justification” for local sheriff’s departments to house ICE detainees.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Home values are projected to increase by an average of 20% across most of the city’s neighborhoods, according to Mayor Mike Duggan. Residential assessments for 2020 also show that property values are up 30% in several parts of the city. The city said that the figures are based on two years of actual market sales and that homeowners are protected by a 2% cap on property tax increases as long as ownership has not changed. Property owners can appeal assessments until Feb. 22. Detroit residential property values rose an average of 13% last year. “This is great news for Detroit homeowners, particularly those who held on to their properties and stayed in the city,” Duggan said. “Home values in nearly every neighborhood are rising and helping to build new wealth, without significant tax increases. This shows as clearly as anything that the city’s revitalization has reached nearly every corner of our city.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has planted hundreds of trees in the past few years in an effort to green up downtown, but many aren’t surviving past their first year. City staff have been trying to figure out why, and they think they might have found the culprit: salt. Soil tests show that salinity levels in some of the planting spots are much higher than what’s ideal for trees to thrive, said Ben Shardlow, director of urban design for the Minneapolis Downtown Council and the Downtown Improvement District. Salt is used liberally in downtown Minneapolis to keep sidewalks and parking lots clear of ice. After the ice melts, the extra salt left behind piles up or gets pushed to the side – sometimes directly into the places where the trees are trying to grow. For three years in a row, a tree census showed only half of the trees the city planted had survived, Shardlow told Minnesota Public Radio News.\n\nMississippi\n\nIndianola: A historical marker will commemorate the legacy of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. Research for the project was led by a Mississippi Valley State University student and professor, the Greenwood Commonwealth reports. C. Sade Turnipseed is an associate professor of history, and 17-year-old Nigerian native Brian Diyaolu took her public history course during the fall semester. They recently received approval from the Sunflower County Board of Supervisors to place the Hamer sign in front of the county courthouse. It will be unveiled during a ceremony March 27. Students in Turnipseed’s course are assigned a historical topic, and Diyaolu’s was Hamer. He said he wrote three drafts of the historical marker’s narrative before pitching the idea to the supervisors. He said other students helped him edit the narrative and prepare the presentation. Hamer was born to sharecroppers in Montgomery County on Oct. 6, 1917.\n\nMissouri\n\nCreve Coeur: The St. Louis Holocaust Museum & Learning Center will triple in size with an $18 million expansion as officials seek to reach even deeper into issues of bias, bigotry and hate. Details about the expansion were announced Monday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Officials hope to make the building more visible and accessible. The museum, in the suburb of Creve Coeur and operated by the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, draws 30,000 annual visitors, about two-thirds of whom are students. Admission is free. Museum officials are in touch with about 30 Holocaust survivors who live in the St. Louis area. Monday’s announcement came on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The museum’s new executive director, Sandra Harris, says groundbreaking will be in May, and the goal is to finish by the end of 2021.\n\nMontana\n\nIsmay: U.S. Postal Service officials say mail service will resume in this town where a fire destroyed the post office. The fire in early January has prompted some residents of Ismay to worry about their mail. Since the fire, they’ve taken turns dropping off and picking up mail in a town almost 20 miles away. Postal officials plan to put a mailbox in a community center in tiny Ismay, population 20, Postal Service spokesman James Boxrud says. Meanwhile, property owners Rita and Gene Nimitz tell the Billings Gazette they’re making tentative plans to rebuild the post office, which dated to the 1920s. A faulty furnace or electrical wiring is believed to have started the blaze.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city’s school district is about to take a major step in the recovery from a fire that destroyed the district office more than eight years ago. The school board is expected to vote next month on a nearly $1.15 million construction project agreement to build a backup data center, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. It’ll be constructed in the basement of the building built to replace the office burned in May 2011. The blaze was started by a disgruntled teacher who was later sentenced to prison for arson. The fire wiped out nearly everything in the building, including severely damaging the computer system that held email servers, grades, payroll and other records. District officials worked with University of Nebraska-Lincoln information technology staff to get the data system back online. The district built an off-site data center near Lincoln High School about a year later. The district wants the backup data center finished this summer.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Local tourism officials have canceled several activities tied to the launch of a new city slogan in the wake of basketball star Kobe Bryant’s death. A 60-second spot touting the “what happens here, only happens here” campaign aired during the Grammy Awards as planned Sunday night, but other plans were postponed. The new slogan is a play on the longtime saying that “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.” The city had intended to display the new slogan on more than two dozen hotel and casino marquees on and around the Strip. Instead, most resorts showed messages of grief. They included “L.A., OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO YOU” and “#RIPKOBE.” Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said all the planned activities will take place at a future date. But Bryant, his daughter and the other lives lost in a helicopter crash were too much on everyone’s minds.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State health officials are seeking input on whether the state needs a residential treatment facility for youth with mental health and addiction issues. The Department of Health and Human Services has issued a request for information about the opportunities and challenges associated with establishing a psychiatric facility that would provide the highest level of care next to an acute psychiatric hospital. The state’s only youth drug and alcohol treatment center closed last month after a spate of nonfatal overdoses. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu says a new facility would ensure that young people struggling with addiction, mental illness or both get the right level of care in a safe environment. The deadline for submitting information is Feb. 24.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGalloway Township: Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled a sweeping energy plan Monday that sets goals for shifting the state to 100% clean energy by 2050. The first-term Democratic governor announced the plan at Stockton University alongside two Cabinet officials who will be carrying the plan out, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe and Board of Public Utilities President Joe Fiordaliso. Murphy cast climate change as an urgent concern and pointed to a Rutgers study that indicated the state could see 1 foot of sea level rise in the next decade. “Quite frankly it will be hard for future generations to create their Jersey Shore memories if the Jersey Shore is only a memory,” Murphy said. The plan calls for reducing the use of fossil fuels while increasing renewable sources of energy. New Jersey currently gets 94% of its electricity from natural gas and nuclear plants, according to the U.S. Energy Department.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A former state lawmaker’s emu that has been missing since Thanksgiving is safely back at its home near the city. Former state Rep. Brad Cates learned his emu had resurfaced last week thanks to a barrage of images people shared on social media. Pictures of the large bird around a subdivision near Cates’ home prompted inquiries from a state livestock inspector and a game warden. Later Sunday, Cates with some help corralled the 150-pound emu named “Hey You!” Cates was also the Republican nominee for Dona Ana County district attorney in 2016. He lost to Mark D’Antonio.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State taxpayers could decide to contribute to a fund that helps pay for abortions under a proposed bill. State Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblymember Karines Reyes say their bill would create an abortion access fund to which taxpayers could voluntarily contribute when they file their personal income tax returns. The Democrats say the fund’s money would go to not-for-profit groups that provide financial and logical assistance to individuals seeking abortion care. The Legislature passed a sweeping law last year to protect a right to abortion care in New York in case of changes on the federal level. Lawmakers could consider passing the latest bill this year before they depart in early June. The bill would also require a report to lawmakers and the governor about the amount of money deposited in the abortion access fund and how it was spent. The state wouldn’t be able to request the names of anyone who sought money from the fund.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Three months after a set of anonymous, threatening, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic emails sent a wave of fear through the sociology department at Wake Forest University, the department chairman says he’s still waiting for university leaders to announce a meaningful response. The emails to faculty in sociology and two other departments called for a “purge” of minorities and the LGBTQ community. Alarmed by what he deemed white supremacist terrorism, chairman Joseph Soares canceled sociology classes for a week. When they resumed, Wake Forest police officers were stationed outside classrooms and the building itself. Doors normally open were closed and locked. Even a study lounge was locked. “It was the most stressful experience of my academic life,” said Soares, who began his college teaching career in 1991 and has taught at Wake Forest since 2003. “My faculty were afraid.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A massive 1984 diesel spill in Mandan, North Dakota, has finally been cleaned up. State officials said the cleanup at a rail yard in downtown Mandan was complicated because of limited access to the affected area, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Workers collected about 770,000 gallons of fuel over the years, said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. “It’s pretty much gone,” Glatt said at a Wednesday meeting. “It seems like a long time, but when you look at, in a downtown area where access is limited, we had 4 to 6 feet on top of the groundwater in some areas. This is a success.” Burlington Northern ran the rail yard when the spill was found in 1984, but BNSF Railway runs it now.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Cheetahs from the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden will have about 5 acres of open terrain where they can run at a facility anticipated to be completed this summer. The cheetahs will be transported from the zoo in suburban Cincinnati in custom, built-in van crates to the “Cheetah Run” at the zoo’s Bowyer Farm in Warren County. The animals will have the space to run but will not be required to do so, said zoo spokeswoman Michelle Curley. Zoning records indicate some residents raised safety concerns, but the Warren County Board of Zoning and Appeals approved the plan last year. The tree-lined “Cheetah Run” project will be enclosed by a fence. Zoo officials have no safety concerns, said Mark Fischer, vice president of facilities, planning and stability for the zoo. He said the cheetahs, raised by humans and dogs, are “docile” and “timid.” Fisher said the run will be fun for the cheetahs – Tommy, Nia, Savanna, Donni, Cathryn, Willow, Redd, and Kris – and give them space to stretch their legs.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor has been arrested, accused of domestic abuse. Robert McClatchie, an Oklahoma County assistant district attorney, was booked into Oklahoma County jail about 4 a.m. Saturday on complaints of domestic abuse by strangulation and domestic abuse in the presence of a minor child. Jail records also did not list an attorney for him. District Attorney David Prater said in a statement that McClatchie “will remain in jail until he is released by a judge or when his bond is posted after a judge sets his bond, like any other person arrested on a domestic abuse charge.” Prater said he’s “not intervening in this matter in any way.” He said the case will be assigned by the attorney general to another district attorney to assist Oklahoma City police in their investigation “and ultimately, make a charging decision.”\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Local police now have an extra set of eyes with them. Each of Pendleton’s 24 sworn police officers has been equipped with body cameras that will record each call of service to which they respond, the East Oregonian reports. “Certainly, the preservation of evidence in real time is something you can’t replace,” Police Chief Stuart Roberts said. The cameras are located on the officers’ left breast pocket and attached using a magnetic plate. Officers must double tap the camera to activate it when responding to a call. The program joins Pendleton police with departments in Boardman and Hermiston as the only agencies with body cameras in Northeast Oregon. All footage collected by the department will be held for a minimum of 180 days, and anything that is a part of an investigation or court case will be held for an additional 30 months, officials said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Former Mayor Stephen Reed, who served for almost three decades but was later sentenced to probation for accumulating Wild West artifacts he bought with public money for a museum that was never built, has died. He was 70. A statement from the family reported by PennLive.com said Reed died Saturday “surrounded by his family.” “Reed was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 and fought it courageously,” the statement said. Reed served seven terms but lost the 2009 primary amid criticism over the millions of dollars he had spent on museum-related items. He and city officials scoured the country for artifacts that would stock the museum, which he had called part of a wider plan to make the city a museum destination for tourists. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to 20 counts of receiving stolen property and was sentenced to two years of probation. Reed apologized and told the judge he took responsibility for his actions, calling his prosecution “a gut-wrenchingly humiliating” process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo wants to reform the state’s criminal justice system through a series of proposals in her budget and administrative actions. The Democratic governor released a nearly $10.2 billion state budget plan this month. The Legislature will review the proposals and present its plan before the 2021 fiscal year begins in July. The budget includes recommendations from Raimondo’s working group on criminal and juvenile justice. Among them, the proposal seeks to improve discharge planning, shift staffing to improve access to health care, update the parole statute to include geriatric parole and provide incestives for work release programs. Raimondo is also looking to bring her signature workforce training program to prisons.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Residents who want to vote in the state’s Democratic presidential primary next month face a deadline to register this week. The State Election Commission said all voters for the Feb. 29 primary must be registered by Thursday. The first-in-the-South presidential primary is open, which means a voter does not have to be a registered Democrat to cast a ballot. People who are 17 years old can vote in the primary as long as they will be 18 by Election Day on Nov. 3. Registration forms can be downloaded at scvotes.org, and residents can also check to see if their South Carolina registration is current. Voters can also register at their county registration offices. Republicans will not have a presidential primary in South Carolina as President Donald Trump runs for reelection.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster State Park: After the near-decimation of the Custer State Park bighorn sheep herd, wildlife managers are now seeing the group as a success story, the Black Hills Pioneer reports. In 2004 the herd was 200-plus animals strong when members contracted mycoplasma ovipneumoiae, a pneumonia-causing bacteria that killed 70-80% of the animals. Since that time, the adults in the herd obtained an immunity to the bacteria, but the lambs suffered – most died from the disease within months, and on a good year, one would survive. Some wildlife managers even began discussions about destroying the remaining 20-25 animals and starting over with disease-free sheep. Then, three years ago, biologists discovered that only three of the bighorns shed the pathogens responsible for the die-off. Those were removed from the herd, and the population rebound began. The first lambing year, eight of the nine born in the park survived.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A new $200 million Amazon distribution center in the city’s Raleigh neighborhood will employ 1,000 workers and should be up and running in time for this year’s holiday season, officials said Monday. With the building’s skeleton and yellow bulldozers in the background, Amazon officials and state and local politicians gathered at the busy construction site in north Memphis to provide details about the project. Workers will make at least $15 per hour as they pack and ship books, electronics and other consumer goods alongside Amazon’s robots, officials said. At 855,000 square feet – the equivalent of 14 football fields – the order fulfillment center will be Amazon’s third in Memphis. The company employs about 6,500 people in Tennessee, Amazon officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Local police are inviting people to drop off their unwanted firearms and ammunition, with no questions asked, Tuesday at an East Austin police substation. This is the first of several gun surrender events this year, police said. On Tuesday, people can drop off these items from 3 to 8 p.m. at the Robert T. Martinez Central East Substation. “No questions asked” means police will not attempt to identify those who drop off guns, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. “We merely want to get weapons that are no longer wanted off the streets, out of homes, and destroyed so they don’t end up potentially in the wrong hands if there was to be a burglary,” Manley said. “This is a service we want to provide for the community.” Austin police will host similar programs throughout the year on April 28, July 28 and Oct. 27.\n\nUtah\n\nLogan: An event straight out of the Old West is attracting more people with its mountain-man appeal, organizers said. About 50 people gathered in Blacksmith Fork Canyon to compete in the state-organized biathlon – an event combining cross-country skiing and sharpshooting – that features muzzleloader guns, the Herald Journal reports. Many wore traditional mountain-man gear to the event this month dubbed Willy Wapiti’s Smoke Pole Biathlon at Hardware Ranch, which is surrounded by snow-capped mountains and populated by hundreds of elk. Shooters raced along a snowy trail, with or without snowshoes, to five separate shooting stations. Prizes like electronic earmuffs, knives and fire starters were given to the best score out of 10, said Rachael Tuckett, a wildlife recreation specialist with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, which organized the event. Prizes also are given for the best mountain man outfit. The event has grown by 40% since last year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The completion of a 93-mile rail trail across northern Vermont would help link an ever-expanding network of recreation trails across New England and beyond, advocates say. The effort got a big boost last week when Republican Gov. Phil Scott asked lawmakers to approve $2.8 million as the state’s share of the estimated $14.1 million cost of completing the remaining 60 miles of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. It runs from Swanton, near the Canadian border, to St. Johnsbury, not far from the Connecticut River border with New Hampshire. The 30-mile section of the trail currently open is already benefiting businesses and the communities that people visit so they can use it, officials say. Trail advocates say completing one section of the trail boosts other nearby trails.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: The post office where survivors reunited after a mass shooting in a government office building now is named after the man who gave his own life for his co-workers. A plaque was unveiled Friday honoring Ryan Keith Cox at the post office that now bears his name, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Cox was one of 12 people who died in the mass shooting last May 31 at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. “We are a city of heroes, and Keith is a perfect example of one of them,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said during the ceremony. In interviews, Cox’s co-workers have said he ushered women into a room and told them to barricade the door. Cox then left to see if anyone else needed help. The gunman and shot and killed him soon after that. Cox, 50, had been an account clerk in Virginia Beach’s public utilities department for 12 years.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A school district has warned parents about a potentially dangerous “penny challenge” spreading on social media. The Tacoma School District said a middle school student in the district took part in the online trend last week, KOMO-TV reports. The school district provided a photo of a burned electrical wall outlet resulting from the penny challenge. No injuries were reported. Social media users are challenged to record a video of themselves sliding a penny between a partially plugged-in cellphone charger and a wall outlet, officials said. Users are asked to film and post the results on the TikTok video-sharing channel. Placing a penny across an active electrical connection will create sparks that can damage the outlet and potentially start a fire and cause injury, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Projects involving sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places are eligible to apply for historic preservation development grants through the West Virginia Historic Preservation Office. Projects should involve the restoration, rehabilitation or archaeological development of historic sites, the state Department of Arts, Culture and History said in a news release. Approximately $369,000 is expected to be available for the grants, depending on appropriations from Congress or the Legislature. Privately owned properties are only eligible where there is evidence of public support or public benefit, the release said. Governmental properties that aren’t accessible to the public are not eligible for funding. Applications must be postmarked by March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLa Crosse: For nearly a century and a half, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration have said prayers every hour of every day in their chapel in La Crosse. But next month that practice will be coming to an end. The sisters have announced that after a dozen years of study and reflection, they will begin to cut back their prayer ritual, which began in 1878, to 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily. In 1997, prayer partners were invited to take the daytime hours while sisters living at St. Rose Convent continued the night hours. As demographics continued changing in the early 2000s, the sisters began studying the future of the practice. “Our thoughtful study over the years has included a growing understanding of a modern way to live in adoration through our prayer lives and actions, no matter where we are,” said FSPA President Eileen McKenzie.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The city’s police don’t have the authority to enforce the new federal law that increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21, the agency says. Officers can only legally enforce state laws and Cheyenne city ordinances, spokesman David Inman says. He says city officials posted the clarification on Facebook because they’d been receiving calls from residents and local businesses. Nonetheless, it’s still illegal for someone under the age of 21 to purchase products containing tobacco or nicotine, including vaping products. The Legislature is expected to consider a bill that would change state law to match the new federal law on tobacco sales. If it passes, Inman said the city would likely pass a similar ordinance, and then police would have the power to enforce it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/26/manatee-food-crisis-confederate-holidays-axed-colorado-wildfires-contained-news-around-states/50284709/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Mayor Steven Reed named Darryl Washington the Economic Development director and David Card the Parks and Recreation director. The city announced the hires Tuesday, but Washington and Card started in their new roles earlier this month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing restrictions that would hinder plans for a copper and gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, the latest in a long-running dispute over efforts by developers to advance a mine in a region known for its salmon runs. The EPA said the proposal would bar discharges of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. within the mine site footprint proposed by the developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership. The federal agency said it took into account information that has become available since it previously proposed restricting development in 2014, including new scientific analyses and a mine plan from the Pebble partnership that was submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of a permit application.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Arizona’s clemency board has declined to recommend to Gov. Doug Ducey that the death sentence of a man convicted in the 1984 kidnapping and killing of an 8-year-old girl be reduced to a lesser punishment, rejecting his claims that he is innocent of the crimes. The decision by the Arizona Board of Executive Clemency on Tuesday at the state prison in Florence marked one of the last steps before Frank Atwood’s execution in the 1984 killing of Vicki Hoskinson. Atwood is scheduled to be executed June 8 with an injection of pentobarbital.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Voters approved two continued sales tax increases that will support the fire, parks and police departments, and consent decree projects.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBakersfield: Some residents are concerned about potential explosions after a state agency found six idle oil wells near homes were leaking methane in the past several days. State and regional inspectors found concentrations of methane in the air around some of the wells at levels considered potentially explosive and environmental activists in the region are worried other chemicals might also be leaking from the wells that could pose a threat to public health. Uduak-Joe Ntuk, head of the California Geologic Energy Management division of the California Department of Conservation, the agency that oversees wells and confirmed they were leaking, said in a statement the leaks were “minor in nature and do not pose an immediate threat to public health or safety.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two wildfires burning in southern and western Colorado have been fully contained. A fire that burned more than 1,500 acres near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was fully contained Tuesday, nearly two weeks after it started, the Teller County Sheriff’s Office said. To the west, the spread of a wildfire near Montrose has also been stopped, the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team said Tuesday. The fire, which burned 313 acres, started on May 19. The cause is under investigation.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Bob Stefanowski, the Republican Party’s endorsed candidate for governor, said has tested positive for the coronavirus. Stefanowski, 60, said he tested positive Monday morning after learning he had been exposed to someone who had tested positive for the virus. Stefanowski is facing a rematch against Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, 68, who tested positive for the coronavirus last month after taking a regularly scheduled rapid self-test. Days later, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, Attorney General William Tong and Treasurer Shawn Wooden all tested positive, as well.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Dr. Karyl Rattay, Delaware’s top public health official who has led the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, said she will leave her job next month. The News Journal reported Rattay, the country’s longest-serving public health director, will step down June 30 after leading the Division of Public Health for 13 years. It’s unknown where she will work next and who her successor will be. The state did not make Rattay available for an interview.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Some D.C. school leaders are looking to strengthen sexual assault reporting policies after parents weren’t notified about an alleged assault on a student, WUSA-TV reported. Police said the alleged assault happened inside Ballou High School in southeast DC in mid-March. But school families said they only were notified days later after a parent posted about in a Facebook video. Carlene Reid, who represents Ward 8 on the State Board of Education, drafted a resolution on \"sexual assault in schools\" in response after she saw in the video. Reid said she hopes to get a vote on the resolution in the June 15 board meeting, but because the school board cannot pass policy, it’s now up to the DC Council to make this issue a priority.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Wildlife officials working to prevent threatened Florida manatees from starving to death said they’re encouraged that some of the marine mammals’ favorite food is growing naturally in a key area. Seagrasses have been found growing recently in small areas of the Indian River Lagoon along Florida’s east coast, where chronic pollution has wiped out much of it, officials said. “We take it as a positive there is seagrass growing, ”said Ron Mezich of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “What that means long-term, we have no idea.” The lack of seagrass forage during winter months has triggered an unprecedented die-off of manatees, including a record of more than 1,100 last year. The deaths recorded so far in 2022 are at 551, according to commission statistics. The FWC and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in March completed an experimental program that fed manatees more than 202,000 pounds of donated lettuce near a power plant where the animals gather during colder months. Officials said a similar program is in the works for the coming winter.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group that works to protect Georgia’s waterways has released a free Georgia River Guide mobile app. The Georgia River Guide app seeks to help people experience the recreation on Georgia’s network of more than 30 water trails, according to the Georgia River Network. Paddlers, boaters, anglers and others who use the rivers can use the app to find trails and learn about river access points, mileage, water falls and other points of interest, the group said. Safety information such as river difficulty, potential hazards and rapids are also included. The Georgia River Guide app is available in Apple and Google Play stores.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The University of Hawaii said it will require masks indoors across its 10-campus system amid a spike in COVID-19 cases on the islands. The new rule took effect Wednesday. Those working alone or who are separated by more than 6 feet from others will be exempt. The university said the rule adheres to recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state Department of Health and the school’s medical experts. The CDC ranks Hawaii fourth in the nation for new coronavirus cases, the university said. The state has a seven-day average rate of 495.9 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A California man convicted of kidnapping an 11-year-old Idaho girl could be released from prison after five to seven months if he successfully completes a treatment program. Third District Judge Randall Grove on Tuesday sentenced Brian Sangjoon Lee to up to 10 years in prison, but retained jurisdiction and said he could be released from prison and placed on probation before 2023 if he completes the Idaho Department of Correction program, the Idaho Statesman reported. Lee pleaded guilty to second-degree kidnapping in exchange for prosecutors reducing the charge from first-degree kidnapping. Second-degree kidnapping carries a maximum penalty of up to 25 years in prison.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: One person died and seven others also were injured Tuesday in a pileup crash involving at least seven vehicles on the Tri-State Tollway around Chicago, authorities said. The crash that occurred about 6 a.m. near northwest suburban Glenview shut down all southbound lanes of the tollway, which is also Interstate 294, for more than 5 hours, Illinois State Police said. All southbound lanes reopened by 1:30 p.m. Two people, including the person who died, were transported to hospitals, the Glenview Fire Department said. The other person hospitalized in the crash suffered minor injuries. The others were treated at the scene of the crash.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Lawmakers voted Tuesday to override Gov. Eric Holcomb’s veto of a bill banning transgender females from competing in girls school sports, allowing Indiana to join about more than a dozen other states adopting similar laws in the past two years. State senators voted 32-15 in favor of overriding Holcomb following the same action in a 67-28 vote by the House earlier in the day. Holcomb had said in his veto message that the bill did not provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports” when he unexpectedly vetoed it in March.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Deer hunters would be able to use semi-automatic rifles during a newly created antlerless season in January under a bill approved by lawmakers Tuesday and sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The measure given final approval by the House is designed to help control the deer population and respond to complaints that excess deer eat corn and are hazardous to motorists.\n\nKansas\n\nSalina:After being canceled in 2020 and moved to September for 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Smoky Hill River Festival is back to its typical spot on the calendar in the second week of June. The 46th annual edition of the festival will run from June 9-12, featuring more than 130 visual artists and 75 performers at Oakdale Park.\n\nKentucky\n\nCovington: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine have asked the federal government to spend $2 billion from the bipartisan infrastructure deal to build a new Ohio River bridge and fix an existing, outdated span that has long been the source of frustration for commuters and politicians. Overhauling the Brent Spence Bridge, which connects Cincinnati with northern Kentucky, was a big selling point for President Joe Biden during the debate over the federal infrastructure legislation. He touted the project last July at a CNN town hall in Cincinnati, vowing his administration would “fix that damn bridge of yours” if the legislation passed. Just before signing the bill in November, Biden said he expected the bridge would finally get funding. Governors from both states announced Tuesday they jointly submitted an application asking for $1.66 billion in federal funding to make the needed improvements.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Two Confederate holidays would be erased from Louisiana law under legislation approved 4-2 by a state Senate committee. The House-passed bill by Rep. Matthew Willard, a New Orleans Democrat, goes next to the full Senate. Neither Confederate Memorial Day nor the day honoring Gen. Robert E. Lee have been observed in Louisiana for years. They are among a list of holidays a governor can proclaim in addition to other, permanent holidays that include Christmas and Independence Day. The governor is limited in the number he can proclaim in a year. As amended by the Senate Judiciary Committee A on Tuesday, the list of optional holidays still would include President’s Day, National Memorial Day and a day honoring Huey P. Long, the former Louisiana governor and U.S. senator. Committee chairman Barrow Peacock, a Republican from the Shreveport-Bossier area, was among the bill’s opponents. He said the holidays should be seen as memorials and markers of history that should be remembered.\n\nMaine\n\nAlfred: Three FedEx delivery vehicles traveling single file crashed into each other, sending one driver to the hospital and tying up traffic, officials said. The delivery vehicles collided with each other when traffic slowed in front of them late Tuesday morning on busy Route 111, said Shannon Moss, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Public Safety. All of the trucks suffered damage, and one of them was pushed off the highway into a tree, Moss said. One FedEx driver was taken to a hospital with nonlife-threatening injuries, Moss said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Maryland man has pleaded guilty to making threats against the National Security Agency and its employees, prosecutors said Tuesday. Ryan Matthew Conlon, 38, of Halethorpe pleaded guilty to making interstate threatening communications concerning the NSA and its employees, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron said. U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher sentenced Conlon to six months of home detention as part of three years’ probation. The NSA headquarters office is based at Fort Meade.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts has sued more than a dozen companies involved in the manufacture or marketing of forever chemicals, alleging they knowingly polluted the environment and endangered public health, state Attorney General Maura Healey said. The companies have known about the dangers of PFAS chemicals – found in firefighting foam and consumer products – for years and violated federal and state environmental laws, she said at a news conference. The chemicals have polluted more than 126 public drinking water systems in 86 Massachusetts communities, the state said. Those communities now face multimillion-dollar price tags to clean up the chemicals, Healey said. In addition, the chemicals have contaminated lakes, streams, rivers, and coastal zones including Cape Cod – areas critical for marine life, the suit said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Michigan Court of Appeals opened the door Wednesday to abortion opponents who are trying to overturn a recent decision that suspended the state’s long-dormant ban on the procedure. The court set a briefing schedule that runs through July 5. A judge at the Court of Claims last week issued a preliminary injunction that freezes a 1931 ban on abortion in most instances. If the injunction stands, it means abortion would not be illegal in Michigan if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade decision by summer. Right to Life of Michigan, the Michigan Catholic Conference and two county prosecutors are asking the appeals court to throw out the injunction granted by Judge Elizabeth Gleicher, who said the law likely violates the state constitution. They said there was no reason for Gleicher to act because abortion remains legal in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two administrative law judges said Minnesota natural gas utilities should be allowed to pass on an extra $660 million in costs related to storm damage to their customers. The state Department of Commerce and Attorney General’s Office alleged the utilities made critical mistakes in their gas procurement procedures during the February 2021 storm and because of the mismanagement, customers should not pay for the extra costs. In a decision released Tuesday, the judges rejected the state agencies’ contentions. The judges’ decisions are not binding, but they can influence the state Public Utilities Commission, which has the final say. The commission is expected to decide the matter this summer. It will also consider the positions of the Commerce Department, the Attorney General’s Office and other parties, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A convicted killer’s effort to get his execution quickly scheduled has been dismissed by the state’s Supreme Court, weeks after the condemned man changed his mind. Blayde Nathaniel Grayson, 46, filed a handwritten letter to the high court in December requesting that his execution for a 1996 killing be set immediately. Days later, Grayson’s attorney moved to withdraw that request, noting that Grayson still had a federal appeal pending. The Supreme Court ordered a state district court to get a statement from Grayson as to whether he wanted to waive appeals and have his execution date set. In April, Grayson told a judge, under oath, that he wanted to continue his appeals. In a ruling dated Friday, the Supreme Court formally dismissed his motion for a quick execution. Grayson was convicted of capital murder in 1997 for the stabbing death the previous year of 78-year-old Minnie Smith during a home burglary in south Mississippi’s George County.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A Missouri man will be laid to rest Saturday, more than 80 years after he died in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. Navy returned the remains of Seaman 1st Class Wilbur Francis Newton to Kansas City International Airport on Tuesday. Newton was among more than 400 crewman killed on the USS Oklahoma during the Pearl Harbor attack. His remains were identified as part of a project by the Department of Defense agency known as The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Researchers needed maternal DNA to get a match, and reached the last living relative on Newton’s mother’s side before she died in 2012. Robin Deeds, a child of one of Newton’s cousins, said Newton will be buried Saturday at Mount Hope Cemetery in Mound City. He said more than 50 cousins plan to attend the service, KCTV-TV reported. Newton will be laid to rest in a burial plot with a grave marker that his parents bought for him before they died in the late 1940s.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently announced that five central Montana community development organizations will receive a combined total of $9.7 million in federal funding to redevelop environmentally contaminated sites across 20 counties. The windfall came as $21 billion in funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act begin to become available. The money is earmarked to address legacy pollution in the United States, allocated to clean up Superfund and Brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned oil and gas wells. Near the top of the list of revitalization packages are plans to clean up the Crowley Block, a century-old storefront property on Main Street in Lewistown.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A man with a long history of mental illness when he killed the grandfather of two Nebraska football players more than two decades ago has died in prison. Russell Harms died in the Nebraska prison system’s Reception and Treatment Center in Lincoln on Monday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said. in a news release. Harms was 64. Harms had been in prison 22 years for gunning down 84-year-old Tennyson Kelsay in the parking lot of an Auburn shopping center in 1999. Kelsay was the grandfather of then-Nebraska rush end Chris Kelsay and former Nebraska and Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Chad Kelsay. Harms was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison after his trial judge rejected his insanity defense, despite Harms having been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with a long history of failed medications and hospitalizations. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld Harms’ conviction and sentence.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A 20-year-old Elko County man convicted of sexually assaulting and killing a Spring Creek teenager two years ago has been sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 20 years. A jury deliberated for two hours Monday before settling on Bryce Dickey’s sentence on a first-degree murder charge in the death of 16-year-old Gabrielle “Britney” Ujlaky. Her parents had provided emotional testimony about how her death has turned their world upside down, the Elko Daily Free Press reported. Police originally treated Ujlaky’s disappearance as a runaway case after Dickey told investigators he saw her get into a green pickup truck with a tall man wearing a cowboy hat outside Spring Creek High School on March 8, 2020. Her mother, Alisha, told Dickey on Monday that she had waited for two years to confront him. “I believed your ridiculous lies and your story about the green truck, and you let me come try and comfort you, knowing that you had raped and murdered my daughter,” she said. Judge Mason Simons will sentence Dickey later on the sexual assault charge, to be added to the murder sentence.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A man who was allegedly killed by a female coworker’s husband who discovered they had been texting, had other gunshot wounds, cuts and bruises before he died of a bullet to the head, the state’s chief medical examiner testified. “It’s very likely he was immediately unconscious at this point and would have died within minutes,” Jennie Duval said about the last bullet that went into Jonathan Amerault, 25, who was killed in September 2020 and later beheaded. His other injuries had caused a lot of bleeding and pain, she said. Amerault’s head was cut off using two weapons, likely a saw and a knife, Duval testified during the first-degree murder trial of Armando Barron, 32, in Keene. Prosecutors alleged Barron assaulted his wife and used her cellphone to lure Amerault to a park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault, and tried to force his wife to shoot him. She refused, and he forced Amerault into the victim’s car and shot him three times, prosecutors said. His wife, Britany Barron, testified last week that she was then forced to drive the car 200 miles north to a remote campsite. There, she said, she was forced to behead Amerault and dispose of his body.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres implored graduating college students on Tuesday to reject jobs at companies that fund the fossil fuel industry he described as “killing our planet.” Guterres made his remarks to graduating seniors at Seton Hall University. Guterres told the class at Newark’s Prudential Center that they are entering a world “brimming with peril” from conflict and strife and the effects of climate change – but that they can reverse the errors of previous generations by not working for financial institutions that profit off fossil fuels. Guterres’s remarks came a week after he announced a five-point plan to encourage use of renewable energy around the globe, in the wake of a World Meteorological Organization report that said the last seven years were the seven-hottest on record.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A BNSF train stalled in the middle of Las Cruces on Tuesday afternoon, blocking vehicles and pedestrians from seven crossings for about 3 hours, including at Picacho and Amador avenues. The Hoagland Road and Avenida de Mesilla crossings were open for vehicles. According to two reporters on the scene, the train started moving again just before 7 p.m. MDT. According to drivers in the area, the train stalled on the tracks at about 4 p.m.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: An outbreak of Legionnaires’ Disease in a Bronx neighborhood has sickened 19 people since the beginning of the month, with one person dying, city health officials said Wednesday. The Health Department said cooling towers in the borough’s Highbridge section had been tested for the presence of the bacteria Legionella, which causes the disease, a form of pneumonia. The bacteria was found in four of the towers, which the department ordered to be disinfected. In addition to the person who died, eight people have been hospitalized, the department said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: Debris from two houses that collapsed into the surf on North Carolina’s Outer Banks are washing ashore, prompting the National Park Service to issue warnings to visitors walking along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The park service said in a news release Wednesday that some of the debris is covered by sand and some of it is fully exposed. Officials advised visitors to wear hard-soled footwear on the beach between Rodanthe and Salvo, although sharp debris might also be found in areas south of Salvo. The unoccupied homes were located along Ocean Drive in the Outer Banks community of Rodanthe. A third house in Rodanthe collapsed in February.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger denied a move by a group that wants to change the voter threshold for amending the state constitution. Jaeger said in a letter to the sponsoring committee that nearly 6,000 of the signatures were invalid. The committee last month delivered 910 petitions with a claimed 33,624 signatures, just above the 31,000 that must be approved to get the proposed measure on the November ballot. Jaeger said the final count of accepted signatures was 25,884. Ten petitions were thrown out because they were not circulated in their entirety and petitions turned in by three circulators were rejected for numerous errors, Jaeger said. Some of the petitions included signatures from residents of other states.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine ended Ohio’s participation in a federal pandemic unemployment aid program ahead of a government deadline for stopping the payments. Attorneys for the Republican governor argued he had the legal authority to do so. People who lost out on additional benefits said DeWine didn’t, and should have continued them. The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides Wednesday. A decision isn’t expected for weeks. At issue before the court is a weekly $300 federal payment for Ohioans to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government ended that program Sept. 6, but DeWine stopped the payments June 26, 2021, saying the need for the payments was over.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:A proposal to end free curbside parking in Midtown is facing some opposition from a handful of business owners who worry about losing employees and customers. Jason Ferbrache, director at EMBARK, unveiled a proposal Tuesday to the Oklahoma City Council that proposed installing parking meters in Midtown and Automobile Alley. The money made from new metered spaces would be split, with 60% going to the city and 40% going to new Midtown and Automobile Alley parking districts. Proponents argued the parking meters will turn over to visitors parking spaces otherwise taken up by area employees. Owners of Hall’s Pizza Kitchen, Harvey Street Bakery, 405 Yoga, Ludivine, and R&J Lounge and Supper Club said the plan could hurt them at a time when they’re still recovering from the pandemic.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state commission has adopted three temporary rules that could significantly impact future housing developments, prioritizing dense communities and walkability while deemphasizing automobiles. The temporary rules augment three areas of state law: housing development, transportation planning and metropolitan greenhouse gas reduction targets. The rules apply to the eight largest metropolitan areas in Oregon: Albany, Bend, Corvallis, Eugene/Springfield, Grants Pass, Medford/Ashland, Portland metro and Salem/Keizer. One aspect of the new rules is these metro areas would need to designate \"climate-friendly areas,\" which would become central to future developments as cities look to expand. These zones would contain higher-density housing, jobs, businesses and services and include \"high-quality\" pedestrian, bicycle and transit infrastructure.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMount Joy: Harold Billow, 99, the last known survivor of a World War II POW massacre during the Battle of the Bulge, will be laid to rest Thursday in Pennsylvania. Billow, who died May 17, was attached to the Army’s 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion when his unit surrendered and he was taken prisoner by Waffen SS soldiers as German forces launched an offensive in Belgium to try to change the war’s tide in December 1944. According to various accounts, the Germans opened fire on the unarmed prisoners in a field, killing more than 80 in what came to be known as the Malmedy Massacre. “As soon as the machine gun started firing, I went facedown in the snow,” Billow told Lancaster Online in 2019. He played dead as the Germans checked for survivors. “Anybody that showed signs of life, they would point-blank shoot them in the head to finish them off,” Billow said. Billow said he stayed there for several hours before he and other survivors bolted. He made his way through hedgerows before reaching the safety of American lines. After the war, he was called to testify at a war crimes trial in which 43 German soldiers were sentenced to death for the Malmedy Massacre. However, they were released after investigators determined U.S. guards had coerced confessions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Dan McKee signed legislation Wednesday to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana in the state. McKee scheduled a bill signing ceremony at the State House for Wednesday afternoon after Rhode Island’s General Assembly overwhelming voted in favor of the legislation Tuesday night. His office said the legislation accomplishes the priorities of making sure legalization is equitable, controlled and safe. It will legalize the sale and possession of up to 1 ounce of cannabis for adults, ages 21 and older, with no more than 10 ounces for personal use kept at a person’s home. It will also allow residents to grow a small amount at home.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A magistrate who has been reprimanded and whose husband is a former sheriff awaiting sentencing for stealing money from government programs has been suspended from the bench for six months, the South Carolina Supreme Court said. Chester County Magistrate Angel Underwood used her official judicial email account to help her husband write a disciplinary order on a sheriff’s office employee and to recommend a student for a scholarship on behalf of deputies, the justices wrote in their order. Underwood also pulled private crime tips from the sheriff’s office Facebook page and emailed to deputies on her judicial account, according to court records. Underwood’s actions “served to erode public confidence in the judiciary” because they “blurred the boundaries between her role as an independent and impartial magistrate and someone acting on behalf of the Sheriff’s Department,” the order said. The state Supreme Court publicly reprimanded Underwood in 2016 for failing to point out her husband was the sheriff each time she started to hear a case involving the Chester County Sheriff’s Office. Underwood pointed out there were no complaints on how she handled those cases.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The Sioux Falls School District’s nutrition trucks with the iconic 1980s apple logo will no longer be on the streets, but a more colorful, designer logo will take the apple’s place. Local artist Megan Jansick with MJ Designs came up with the new look at the beginning of 2022, for the trucks that take food from the district’s central kitchen to elementary school sites, and are on the roads in Sioux Falls for miles and miles each day. With the district’s recent branding and website changes, we “really wanted to define who we are as a Sioux Falls School District,” spokeswoman DeeAnn Konrad said at the school board meeting Monday night. Fruit and vegetable characters, trees made of broccoli, a milk waterfall and homes made of bread cover the new trucks. Some Sioux Falls landmarks are also visible, such as Levitt at the Falls. Some characters will be used in other ways to promote the lunch service, Konrad said. Five of the district’s 10 trucks have been wrapped with the new designs, at a cost of $2,400 per truck, spokeswoman Carly Uthe said. The remaining five will be wrapped in the next fiscal year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee agriculture officials said work has begun to clean up debris at Natchez Trace State Forest after a December tornado damaged the park. A tornado that tore through Henderson County on Dec. 10 made a path about 6 miles long through the forest, causing heavy damage to about 1,400 acres, the state Agriculture Department said. The goal of the operation is to rehabilitate the forest by clearing tree debris to allow public access and improve forest health, officials said. Crews have started harvesting logs of pine and hardwood trees, department spokesman Tim R. Phelps said. Work is expected to last until December.\n\nTexas\n\nRichmond: A Texas man has been arrested for what authorities said was his role in an online romance scam in which women were cheated out of a total of nearly $1 million by someone pretending to be an Army general, federal prosecutors in Rhode Island said. Fola Alabi, also known as Folayemi Alabi, 51, was arrested at his Richmond home Tuesday and charged with wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha. No defense attorney was listed in online court records. Alabi or an alleged accomplice pretending to be a general stationed overseas befriended women on social media on various dates last year, gradually gaining their trust by feigning romantic or personal interest, prosecutors said. The women were asked to send money to the fake general to help ship his belongings back to the U.S., according to court documents. They were asked to send the money to companies in Texas controlled by Alabi or someone associated with him, at his home address, prosecutors said. Many of the women were in their 70s and 80s and either widowed or divorced, according to an affidavit in the case. They were from Rhode Island, Tennessee, North Carolina, California, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Texas, Idaho and South Dakota.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Zion National Park officials expect a busy Memorial Day weekend and for the crowds to bleed into the weekdays, as well.

The 35-year-old man pleaded not guilty Monday and was ordered held pending trial. He is accused of calling a Vermont Department of Corrections reporting line, saying when he was released from jail he would use violence and kill and maim those state officials as well as to harm and kill other members of the legal community, federal prosecutors said. The calls were recorded. The man was recently ordered hospitalized by the state court for mental health considerations, prosecutors said. The Federal Public Defender Office for Vermont, which is representing him, declined to comment on the charges.\n\nVirginia\n\nSimplicity: A 69-year-old Virginia woman who went missing last week was found alive Monday in a dense pine forest less than a mile from her home, the local sheriff announced. The search for Aletha Gee Walton began May 17, when her family discovered she was missing and alerted authorities, Prince Edward County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement posted online. Walton was last seen at her home in the Simplicity area two days earlier, officials said. Search-and-rescue organizations and agencies from across the state joined the search for Walton and she was found about eight-tenths of a mile from her home in a densely wooded pine forest with a thick underbrush on Monday morning, eight days after she was last seen, the sheriff’s office said. Walton was assessed by medical personnel immediately and taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Authorities did not give additional details about her condition or say why she was in the woods in the first place.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A large black bear that evaded capture in western Washington for more than two years was trapped and killed near Issaquah last week. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife said the 5-year-old bear was captured in the Squak Mountain area, where he had been seen in garbage containers, bird feeders and fruit trees dozens of times over nearly three years, The Seattle Times reported. The capture had taken on greater urgency because he was frequently seen in residential areas and was wearing a collar that had grown too tight. The state made the decision to “lethally remove” the bear because he was so overweight at 352 pounds – the normal weight for a similar-aged bear is about 200 pounds – and because of his habit of getting into human-provided food sources.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Attorneys for the state and two remaining pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached a tentative $161.5 million settlement just as closing arguments were set to begin in a seven-week trial over the opioid epidemic, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said Wednesday. Morrisey announced the development in court in the state’s lawsuit against Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., AbbVie’s Allergan and their family of companies. The judge agreed to put the trial on hold to give the parties the opportunity to reach a full settlement agreement in the upcoming weeks. No financial terms were announced. The trial started April 4. The lawsuit accused the defendants of downplaying the risks of addiction associated with opioid use while overstating the benefits. West Virginia reached a $99 million settlement with Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. last month over the drugmaker’s role in perpetuating the opioid crisis in the state that has long led the nation in drug overdose deaths. Before the trial started, Morrisey’s office announced the state settled part of the lawsuit involving another defendant, Endo Health Solutions, for $26 million.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All of the $2.3 million stolen from the Wisconsin Republican Party by hackers just before the 2020 presidential election has been recovered, including nearly $600,000 obtained by the FBI and given back to the party last month, the state party executive director said Tuesday. The state GOP noticed suspicious activity on Oct. 22, 2020, and contacted the FBI a day later, less than two weeks before Election Day. The party determined the money had been taken from the account it was using to help try to reelect President Donald Trump. He went on to lose Wisconsin to President Joe Biden by less than 21,000 votes. The investigation into the theft is ongoing, Wisconsin party executive director Mark Jefferson said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: An abortion clinic set to open next month in Wyoming was damaged in a fire early Wednesday that police believe was deliberately set – possibly by someone seen running away from the building carrying what appeared to be a gas can and a bag. The blaze damaged the inside of the building under renovation to house the clinic in Casper, the second-largest city in a state where opposition to abortion is widespread. The clinic, which also planned to provide other health care services for women, had been set to open in June as only the second place in the state to offer abortions. Wyoming’s other location for women to get abortions is at a hospital in Jackson, 281 miles away. Wyoming is one of 13 states with a trigger law that would immediately outlaw abortion if the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized it nationwide is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. A leaked draft of a ruling suggests that will happen soon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}]}
